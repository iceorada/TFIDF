<DH>A MULTITUDE OF SINS, Stories By Richard Ford, Alfred A.
Knopf: 292 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE CIABATTARI</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Ford, who was raised in Mississippi and has spent a lot of
time in Montana, where the standard obituary often ends, "and he was
an avid hunter and fisherman," has hunted all his life.</LD>
<LD>   "Only the hunter, who imitates the permanent vigilance of wild
animals, is capable of seeing everything," he quotes philosopher Jose
Ortega y Gasset in a Le Monde essay published in 1996, when Fordwas
honored by the French cultural ministry for his work just before
being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the novel "Independence Day." In
the 10 cautionary tales in his third collection of short stories, "A
Multitude of Sins," Ford brings a hunter's steady, subtle and precise
observation to an exploration of the commandment, "Thou Shalt Not
Commit Adultery." All senses alert, the writer tracks the behaviors
of America's wandering unfaithful through the motels and hotels and
bars where they come to grips with their passions.</LD>
<TE>   Although many of the narrators show kinship with Frank Bascombe,
the self-absorbed divorced father of Ford's novels "The Sportswriter"
and "Independence Day," these new stories are marked by a growing
richness and maturity of voice. Ford's observations are more rooted
in the complex realm of the past, where actions have ongoing
reverberations, than in the immediate sensual world. As in his 1997
collection, "Women With Men," his focus here is on relationships--on
cheating husbands and wives, on parents who run off and leave their
yearning children behind. But in this case the settings are not Paris
and Montana but American cities like New Orleans, Chicago and New
York.</TE>
<TE>   His couples are relatively straightforward in desire. Nothing
kinky here; one senses that most of them simply want to find out how
it feels to spend time with someone new. But there is more to these
stories than near-supernatural perceptions. In Ford's particularly
American universe, marital transgressions have consequences ranging
from impending malaise to sudden death. Hell is following through on
the impulse to stray--and then having second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   In "Reunion," a man has a chance encounter in Grand Central
Station with the husband of a woman he had been involved with a year
or so before. His recollection of their relationship puts the moral
in a nutshell: "At any distance but the close range I saw it from, it
was an ordinary adultery--spirited, thrilling, and then, after a
brief while, after we had crossed the continent several times and
caused as many people as possible unhappiness, embarrassment and
heartache, it became disappointing and ignoble and finally almost
disastrous to those same people."</TE>
<TE>   "Privacy," the least of these stories, is the most solipsistic of
the lot. The narrator thinks back to the time when his marriage was
still happy. Even then, he would wait until his wife was asleep and
watch a neighbor woman undress and dance in the nude. "It was all
arousal and secrecy and illicitness and really nothing else," he
recalls. And in no time, the thrill was gone.</TE>
<TE>   In "Calling," a New Orleans lawyer leaves his wife and son for a
man but returns one last time to initiate his son, home from military
school over Christmas break, into the masculine ritual of duck
hunting. The son, now grown, recalls, " ... my father did only what
pleased him, and believed that doing so permitted others the equal
freedom to do what they wanted. Only that isn't how the world works,
as my mother's life and mine were living proof. Other people affect
you. It's really no more complicated than that."</TE>
<TE>   The story brings to mind an earlier first-person coming-of-age
tale, "Great Falls," from Ford's 1987 collection, "Rock Springs," in
which a boy and his father return home from duck hunting to discover
a young airman with the mother. The father sends her packing. The
next day she arranges to see her son one last time before leaving
town. With the grave wisdom of a teenager absorbing life's deepest
blows for the first time, the boy senses that his life has changed.
"As I walked toward school, I thought to myself that my life had
turned suddenly, and that I might not know exactly how or which way
for possibly a long time. Maybe, in fact, I might never know." It is
a measure of Ford's artistic maturity--how far he has come as a
writer and observer--that the older narrator in "Calling" has the
self-awareness to flush out a more complicated and resigned, if
bleaker insight than that of the boy in "Great Falls": "I am not
interested in the whys and wherefores of what [my father] did and
didn't do, or in causing that day to seem life-changing for me,
because it surely wasn't. Life had already changed. That morning
represented just the first working out of particulars I would
evermore observe. Like my father, I am a lawyer. And the law is a
calling which teaches you that most of life is about adjustments, the
seatings and re-seatings we perform to accommodate events occurring
outside our control ... so that when I am tempted ... to let myself
become preoccupied and angry with my father ... I try to realize
again that it is best to just offer myself release and to realize I
am feeling anger all alone, and that there is no redress."</TE>
<TE>   "Abyss," the novella-length finale to the collection, is a marvel,
a shimmering mirage of a story that starts in Mystic, Conn., and
shifts into the glare of the Arizona desert. In supple, lyrical
language, Ford gives us a dark and specific emotional analysis of an
affair that begins with a "large, instinctual carnal attraction"
between Frances and Howard, who meet at a real estate industry awards
banquet, where they were named Connecticut Residential Agents of the
Year.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction was the kind, Frances thought, "animals probably
feel all the time, and that made their lives much more bearable."
Risking the loss of their jobs as well as their marriages, the two
arrange clandestine meetings at motels like a Howard Johnson under
the interstate near Mystic and decide to reconvene at a sales
conference in Phoenix. There, Frances impulsively invites Howard to
drive with her to the Grand Canyon for what she expects to be a
mystical experience. On the road, familiarity quickly breeds
irritation.</TE>
<TE>   Ford presents the brief crescendo and lengthy diminuendo of their
liaison as a tragicomic duet, shifting with breathtaking fluidity
from his point of view ("She was hateful, he thought. Flattening a
rabbit [on the highway] wouldn't be the half of it. It was probably
how she sold houses: a steam-roller, never relenting") to hers ("And
now he was beginning to ruin things, just the way she'd feared but
had promised herself not to let him.... She felt willing to push him
right out the door onto the road, using her foot").</TE>
<TE>   Hell, Howard decides, is a spot in the desert that is "dry, empty,
bright, chilly, alien, and difficult to breathe in," a stone's throw
from an Indian casino and a crummy little chapel with a wooden sign
reading "Chris Died for Your Sins." At their destination, Frances is
blissful; he is petulant (the canyon is, he thinks, the opposite of
real estate: big but empty). She insists upon a personalized
snapshot. Her fierce will, like the grandmother's in Flannery
O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find," brings her a brutal sort of
grace. And Howard learns an awful lesson: "What you did definitely
changed things." Forever.</TE>
<TE>   There are other echoes of O'Connor here, in the harsh wit and
preoccupation with good and evil, in the author's willingness to let
characters seem shallow, even despicable. But Ford has moved beyond
the small-town South to encompass the comedy and pathos and wit of
our dislocated times, the rhythms of the workaday world and the
emptiness that comes at the end of the day to the lobbyist, the
lawyer, the retired cop who dreams of starting over again in East
Whatever, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's with the broad canvas of "Independence Day," or with
"A Multitude of Sins," which reminds us how powerful short stories
can be, Ford delivers a piercing look at the ways men and women
deceive and disappoint each other.</TE>

<HD>The Case of Comrade Serge</HD>
<DH>VICTOR SERGE: The Course Is Set on Hope, By Susan Weissman,
Verso: 320 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biography has many tasks, the most salient of which is obviously the
re-creation of a human personality for subsequent generations.
Sometimes, this duty takes the form of a rescue operation, by which
the record of an important life is prevented from toppling into
oblivion. And sometimes, too, it is necessary to redeem a reputation
from calumny. At the point where this is done properly, biography may
shade into history and alter the way in which we view an epoch. Susan
Weissman's study of Victor Serge meets all the above conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The life of her subject was a near microcosm of the fate of the
revolutionary left in the 20th century. Born to a family of Russian
revolutionary exiles, Serge was brought up in Belgium--the Belgium of
King Leopold's Congo and the Belgium that furnished the pretext for
World War I. His early life was that of an outsider; almost a bandit,
in the louche anarchistic milieu that flourished after the fin de
siecle. But the events of October 1917 caused him to mutate from
rebel to revolutionary. He made his way back to the country of his
forebears and hoped to see it transformed into the first socialist
workers' republic.</LD>
<TE>   You might think that the rest of the story--disillusionment
followed by deportation, imprisonment, persecution, exile and
death--more or less wrote itself. But you would be mistaken. Not only
did Serge put up a fight against Stalin every step of the way, he
also committed almost all of his thoughts and experiences to paper
(often at vast risk to himself), and much of this imperishable trove
has survived. The archive includes some essential personal
reminiscences and glimpses of real people and real events. It also
includes a novel--"The Case of Comrade Tulayev"--which many think
comparable to the work of George Orwell and Arthur Koestler as a
fictional depiction of the moral nightmare of Stalinism and which has
the additional distinction of having been written by a survivor of
same. Serge also produced--and preserved in memory after the original
pages had been destroyed by police--almost the only volume of gulag
verse that has come down to us.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman has set herself three objectives: to bring Serge to life;
to honor the struggle of the left opposition, whose bravery in the
face of Stalinism has received insufficient credit from historians;
and to show that, when Serge differed from the left opposition, he
was generally correct. This is an amazingly intricate project, and it
involves her in writing against most of the preconceptions of the
left as well as of the conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   The general reader should not be discouraged; there is much to be
learned from revisiting these seemingly arcane intellectual disputes.
We learn from Serge that there were people close to Lenin and Trotsky
who knew right from the start that Bolshevism might become a new word
for despotism. There were "objective conditions" that might be used
to give a partial explanation for this: It was not exactly the fault
of Marxist theory that Russia was a savagely backward country or that
it had been devastated by war and counter-revolution or that
capitalist Europe was slipping into the lunacy of fascism. However,
there were some farsighted comrades who understood that there was a
menace also lurking in the "subjective conditions" and that a party
with an attachment to uniformity, to police measures and to
millennialist rhetoric might well be one of these.</TE>
<TE>   By 1920, Serge was writing that he had begun "to feel ... this
sense of danger from inside, a danger within ourselves, in the very
temper and character of Bolshevism." It was Daniel Bell who wrote
that the first break between the Bolsheviks and the democratic left
occurred at Kronstadt during February and March 1921, when the party
used military means to suppress the very naval mutineers whose
bravery had brought them to power in the first place. From then on,
said Bell, everyone who defected had his own "Kronstadt" (he liked to
say that Kronstadt was his Kronstadt). But Serge was a premature
anti-Kronstadtist.</TE>
<TE>   The Stalinization of the Bolshevik party took two related forms.
One could be described as ideological. Stalin, who had no ideas of
his own, simply took advantage of each new disaster to discredit and
then destroy those true believers who had been caught taking the
wrong "line." He was a bureaucratic genius, adept at exploiting
divisions among his opponents and promoting rumors of heresy or
sabotage. Thus the second form of Stalinization: the crushing of
anybody capable of independent thought. Those who don't especially
care to restage arguments about collectivization or the New Economic
Policy or the Soviet attitude toward the Chinese Revolution can still
profit enormously from studying those who tried to keep Russian
culture and politics alive in a dark time.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman has succeeded magnificently in tracing the slow and
methodical way that Stalin squeezed the breath out of society, even
as she reconstructs the courageous but doomed efforts of those who
saw and felt what was coming. Since Serge was one of the most
exemplary of these, and because he had friendships and contacts
beyond the borders of the Soviet Union, he became an early cause
celebre for those in the West who realized that something ghastly was
going on in "the motherland of the working class."</TE>
<TE>   When he was imprisoned, his name was brought up at conferences of
intellectuals, teachers and activists, including ones at which
Communist sympathizers thought they had a majority. The name Victor
Serge became an inconvenience to Stalin personally. His visitors,
even some of his most deferential ones, kept bringing it up. In 1935,
after an approach from Romain Rolland, the dictator called his police
chief, Genrikh Yagoda. The first order of business was to ask what
Serge had confessed to. After all, by then everybody in the gulag had
been forced to confess to something, even if only impure thoughts.
Yagoda told a surprised Stalin that the prisoner Serge had not
confessed to anything at all. His highly unusual fortitude made it
easier for him to be released without embarrassment and permitted to
travel to the West.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that until then, he had not quite taken the full
measure of Stalin's ferocity. His place of internment, Orenburg camp,
had been a relatively lenient one by gulag standards. And his
brilliant novel, "The Case of Comrade Tulayev," had made a working
assumption that the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov, the party
chief in Leningrad, was indeed the work of a lone and disaffected
madman. The murder of Kirov was the pretext for the most sanguinary
and hysterical of Stalin's purges, so that Serge, in stressing the
"loner" theory, may have sought to combat the fantastic accusations
of conspiracy that were confected by the Soviet secret police.
However, as Weissman points out with a strong body of supporting
evidence, he may have been naive in declining to consider the even
more chilling alternative--that Stalin himself had organized the
assassination of one of the party's favorite sons. In any event, it
seems that Serge didn't get himself out of the Soviet Union a moment
too soon. In the years to come, not even the kind words of
distinguished Western fellow travelers were enough to rescue any
victims.</TE>
<TE>   But neither was a dissident intellectual to consider himself safe
once he had reached the West. It is extraordinary to read of the zeal
and wickedness with which Stalin pursued the handful of Trotskyites
and other oppositionists who challenged his rule in small magazines
and tiny organizations. Perhaps he could not bear to be reproached in
the language of Marxism; at all events he devoted a horrific energy
to extinguishing this tiny flame of defiance. Even the recently
released Venona papers, about the activity of Soviet intelligence in
the Americas, reveal an astonishing amount of time and money
expended, not on espionage against the imperialist foe but on the
uprooting and destruction of negligible socialist minorities.
(Weissman might quarrel with my use of the term "negligible" here: I
should say that I refer only to their specific weight within society.
Their moral claim to a place in history is exactly what she
vindicates, but that's another thing.) The culmination of Stalin's
campaign of assassination was the murder of Trotsky in Mexico in
1940, but by that time almost all members of his family, whether
living in Russia or abroad, and a starkly impressive number of his
personal and political friends had been "taken care of" in the same
way. This book is in part their overdue monument.</TE>
<TE>   Two names recur at this point: Mark Zborowski and Dwight
Macdonald. Zborowski was an agent of Stalin posing as a Trotskyite in
the West who successfully arranged many provocations and murders. It
now seems highly probable that he also engineered factional and
personal divisions among Stalin's handful of exiled enemies, who
tended to be strong personalities with a taste for polemic and
infighting. He ended his days in the United States, not without
having to suffer the revenge of Weissman repeatedly banging on his
front door. It is chilling to learn of the ease with which men like
Zborowski were operating in open societies. Macdonald emerges with
great honor as one of the men (the other was Orwell) who believed in
Victor Serge as an author and as a person of integrity. Macdonald's
tirelessness in helping Serge to survive physically was matched by
his commitment to repudiating the hacks and liars who then infested
so much of the American "left" milieu.</TE>
<TE>   Serge died--some say was murdered--in exile in Mexico City in
1947. He was by then so convinced that Stalin was the main enemy that
he took positions (albeit in extreme-left publications) that might be
described as those of a cold-warrior. But he never abandoned his
belief in the humanist character of the socialist idea, and his books
are now taken up by a new generation of Russian left-democrats, who
have opened a library in Moscow that bears his name. Weissman shares
in their idealism, as her title indicates.</TE>
<TE>   It's not necessary to share it yourself in order to appreciate and
value the work she has done. All you require is the capacity to be
impressed by the difference that may be made by an intransigent
individual.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Victor Serge: The Course is Set on Hope'</TE>
<TE>   "Who was Victor Serge? A worker, a militant, an intellectual, an
internationalist by experience and conviction, an inveterate
optimist, and always poor, Victor Serge lived from 1890 to 1947. He
took part in three revolutions, spent a decade in captivity,
published more than thirty books and left behind thousands of pages
of unpublished manuscripts, correspondence and articles. He was born
into one political exile, died in another, and was politically active
in seven countries. His life was spent in permanent political
opposition. Serge opposed capitalism--first as an anarchist, then as
a Bolshevik. He opposed Bolshevism's undemocratic practices and then
opposed Stalin as a Left Oppositionist. He argued with Trotsky from
within the anti-Stalinist left; and he opposed fascism and
capitalism's Cold War as an unrepentant revolutionary Marxist.... His
refusal to surrender to either the Soviet state or the capitalist
West assured his marginality and consigned him to a life of
persecution and poverty. Despite living in the shadows, Serge's work
and his life amount to a corrective to Stalinism, and an alternative
to the market."</TE>

<DH>DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE: A Novel, By Gary Indiana,
HarperCollins: 256 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When TV execs finally get around to producing "That '90s Show,"
identity theft will certainly provide the theme for one episode. This
particular grift--usually taking the form of stealing a person's
Social Security number and then using that identity to purchase or
borrow large sums of goods and money--leaves the hapless victim not
only materially poorer but with the Sisyphean task of proving to
authorities that he is not who he seems to be.</LD>
<LD>   To the extent that there is a plot to Gary Indiana's latest
entertainment, "Depraved Indifference," it involves the rise and fall
of one Evangeline Annamapu Thurlow Slater Carson (to use but one of
her names), a woman with the bust of Liz Taylor and the nails of
Leona Helmsley. "Arrested for shoplifting in 1961 in Sacramento,
arraigned but released on a plea arrangement for credit card forgery
in Santa Ana in 1968. She had never done time." No wonder she catches
the eye of the motel magnate, Warren Slote. "She had initiative and
mobility, things Warren prized." Besides, Warren is a drunk.</LD>
<TE>   And so Evangeline marries Warren, and he begets a son, Devin, upon
her. The three wade through the '70s with a variety of petty
schemes--mortgaging homes that don't belong to them, creating shell
companies, enslaving Mexican maids. Fueled by Warren's money,
Evangeline begins to collect the identities of unwitting victims.
"Any public room that she entered was a pristine harvest of human
information. Not just business cards, phone numbers, fax numbers and
the like, but weaknesses, quirks, character flaws, delusional
ambitions, risky dreams, medical problems, shaky marriages."</TE>
<TE>   The information takes Evangeline to the Nixon White House--where
she meets her match in the first lady--and to the yacht of the
crooked Arab banker Sheik Ubu el-Katami, where she is nearly
bankrupted by his sidekick, Hamza Kadmanites. But Evangeline survives
to age into the roaring '90s, and Devin becomes not only her partner
in crime but partner in bed. Even after Warren's death--which she
neatly conceals from the authorities and Warren's own
family--Evangeline and Devin engage in a variety of wire transfers
and money drops and worse that would make a decent playbook for Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with "Depraved Indifference" is that identity theft is
one episode for TV and thin gruel for an entire novel. Fraud requires
chutzpah, but chutzpah requires feeding, and Indiana never quite
finds a way to build on the initial cons of these grifters.</TE>
<TE>   The denouement of the novel involves an aging millionairess named
Baby Claymore--a former protegee of Esther Williams who turned her
prowess in a pool into a lucrative marriage--and Evangeline's plot to
rob Baby of her house and her name. Presumably this episode is based
on the grotesque con of Sante Kimes and her son Kenny, who in 1998
murdered an elderly New York matron in an attempt to defraud her of
her Upper East Side townhouse. Yet it is a denouement that seems to
fail to capture even Indiana's attention. He spends much of the
second half of "Depraved Indifference" on gossipy miniatures of minor
characters, many of them half-hearted assassinations-a-clef, such as
this riff on Tina Brown: "Teeny's enthusiasm for the magazine was
boundless, and talk about perfectionism, if she got a brainstorm
she'd rip a finished issue to shreds and make them lay every page out
differently the night before it went to the printer.... Franny had
been a Teeny loyalist, defending her to an ever-growing number of
colleagues who thought Teeny's head should be sliced off with a chain
saw and mounted on a pike on the Park Avenue meridian." Problem is,
that's essentially the last we hear of Teeny, Franny, chain saws or
the Park Avenue meridian.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say that some of Indiana's portraits aren't
charming and humorous. Late in the novel, we find Baby collecting
tiny foreign people--like the petite Ikea, the daughter of a Tokyo
pachinko parlor pooh-bah, and the Egyptian Asraboth who reads
Verlaine in French to her on lazy afternoons--to create what she
imagines might be a literary salon. "It was a fond dream of Baby's to
interest Ikea in Asraboth, and vice versa, partly to spare Ikea the
trauma of very large men who would inevitably hit on her.... They
were the same size, and Baby could visualize them gently coupling
like tender lovers in a Bollywood extravaganza. She always pictured
this occurring in a bassinette, and had to remind herself that they
were both adults." And Baby Claymore's love of the operas of Janacek
and sandwiches leads to a nice Wildean precis of "The Makropoulos
Affair": "Elina Makropoulos is three hundred and thirty seven years
old. She has outlived countless lovers, friends, children and
grandchildren, survived two dozen wars, seen empires born and die.
All for what, really. A BLT."</TE>
<TE>   But as Indiana's portraits grow, his action flags. Indeed, for all
its literary aspirations, "Depraved Indifference" is more sandwich
than novel, leaving the reader both hungry and indifferent.</TE>

<DH>THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION: A History, By Gordon S. Wood, The
Modern Library:  196 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ANDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gordon S. Wood is an immensely distinguished historian whose
masterpiece, "The Radicalism of the American Revolution," won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1993. Readers who know that book will recognize the
Modern Library's "The American Revolution" as a distillation of its
arguments. Comparatively little has been lost, and some points emerge
with greater force than before.</LD>
<LD>   Wood's "Revolution" is mainly about ideas--specifically,
republican ideology, a strain of English radical thought that made
close connections between property-holding, political liberty and
individual rights. A threat to the security of property--say by
taxation to which subjects had not consented--threatened liberty
itself and had to be resisted at all costs. Republican beliefs
mobilized colonists against Parliament's efforts to levy modest taxes
on them, but these beliefs also encouraged them to draw democratic
inferences about rights, liberty and equality that frightened the
conservative gentlemen who had first organized the resistance
movement.</LD>
<TE>   Wood shows, with verve and narrative economy, how the revolt
against imperial power produced the world's first written
constitutions, amazing documents written during the War of
Independence, when one might imagine that people had more pressing
concerns than defining the relationship between legislative and
executive powers. But the war itself, with its continual violence and
threats of social disintegration, necessitated such statements of
principle. The states were so weak that they could only hope that
political order could arise from the voluntary allegiance of citizens
whom they had no power to coerce but who might be reassured by
promises that government power would be strictly circumscribed. No
government had ever rested on such a fragile foundation.
Revolutionary Americans tried it in part because they feared power
and in part because they had no alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Having taken care to create governments with limited coercive
capacity, Americans had to deal with the consequences of freedom. The
resulting social ferment--religious enthusiasm, economic
individualism, the growth of antislavery and other reform
movements--alarmed conservative revolutionaries, who concluded that
their countrymen lacked the ability to rise above self-interest and
serve the common good.</TE>
<TE>   A main source of anxiety for such men was the behavior of the
newly egalitarian legislators who ran state governments. Responding
to their constituents' demands rather than to the dictates of virtue,
states vied with their neighbors as if they had never cooperated in
the struggle for independence. With the war over, it seemed as if the
United States would disintegrate in anticipation of the full
realization of Americans' potential for anarchy.</TE>
<TE>   The result, of course, was that most surprising legacy of the
Revolution, the federal Constitution, the fundamental compact of
American nationhood that endures to this day. Wood tells this
complex, ironic tale with clarity, grace and wit, and he does it in a
very brief compass. His great achievement, however, is to communicate
the unpredictability of processes by which an austere commitment to
civic virtue ultimately gave rise to a bumptious egalitarian
political culture and a radically individualistic economic system.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, this slim book tells a big story: one that invites
the reader to contemplate the relationships between liberty, power,
rights and the unpredictable outcomes of human action. Such
reflections may well be more needful now, in the midst of a great
revival of patriotic spirit, than at most times in the republic's
history.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Few moments in life are as clear as those experienced in youth. When
Martin Dijksterhuis climbs the water tower of the Potter Featherbone
Co. in Appleton, Wis., with his girlfriend, Corinna Williams, the
world is all before them: the homes of his family and relatives, the
lights of the football field where the homecoming game is being
played, the distant chapel and cemetery, the apple orchards that his
father and uncle own, the woods and, far beyond, the place where,
according to Indian legend, the creator held the Earth when he shaped
the world.</LD>
<LD>   It's an image of Paradise, 1955, from which Marty and Cory will
soon be expelled, for in the exultation of the hour, an instant born
of youthful confidence, love and defiance, they lose themselves in
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you want to do?" Marty asks.</LD>
<TE>   "I want you to kiss me again."</TE>
<TE>   Which he does, and before the night is over, Cory is pregnant, and
what was once so suddenly clear is forever obscured.</TE>
<TE>   Writing with the same sensitivity to the twists and turns of life
as he did in "The Sixteen Pleasures" and "The Fall of a Sparrow,"
Robert Hellenga turns the hard truths of his latest novel, "Blues
Lessons," upon this singular scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Embracing Corinna, that night after climbing the water tower, I'd
been embracing life itself. We made love only once, but once was
enough, and maybe that's why this memory was fixed so cleanly in my
mind: because it was uncontaminated by additional experiences. Even
as my mother was speaking to me I evoked the image of the little town
seen from above, like a tiny town that I was seeing for the first
time ... and for a few minutes we're weightless, as if we've both let
go of the ladder at the same time and are floating upward through
empty space, as if we're being gathered up into the night sky like a
new constellation."</TE>
<TE>   Covering 20 years, from 1954 to 1974, "Blues Lessons" is a love
story born of the implications of that moment, where first innocence
then prejudice sharply collide.</TE>
<TE>   For the bitterest outcome of that evening's escapade is not that
Cory becomes pregnant but that she and her parents will soon be paid
by Marty's mother and father to leave Appleton and never come back.
Not only does Cory threaten Marty's future, but she is black, two
facts that strain the limits of tolerance in this small community.</TE>
<TE>   It is a quick sequence--beginning with the childhood the young
lovers share, the classes they take reading Camus and Ayn Rand, their
courtship and late-night forays into the picking camps where they
listen to the migrant orchard workers pound out the most desperate
love songs--that unto itself is an exquisite novella, comparable in
its subtle renderings of privilege and race to the best of Reynolds
Price.</TE>
<TE>   Only Hellenga soon widens the aperture. Wounded by his parents,
Marty repudiates their lives. Given the option of playing the
straight notes in life, he mercilessly bends them. Quitting school
(his mother had always dreamed he would go to college), fleeing the
orchards (where his family has a major stake), he joins the Navy,
returns home to work for the railroad post office and chases his
dream to learn the blues into the jook joints of Chicago's South
Side.</TE>
<TE>   Hellenga brings a lot into these pages--the horticulture of
apples, the blues, principles of mathematical integration and
bowling--and he pulls it off, bringing the requisite depth of emotion
to each moment, letting the evanescence of youth pale beside the
dreams and regrets of adulthood. It is, of course, the music--the
chords and the songs Marty practices--that carries the story ahead,
away from Appleton and into a broader world. The blues, Marty
discovers, is "a painful longing ... a longing that was better than
having," but it doesn't keep him from wanting. In his
obsession--dogged and driven, as the great bluesman Robert Johnson
once sang--he hires a private detective to find Cory, now living in
Madison, Wis. She works in a beauty salon. Their daughter is 8 years
old, and the civil rights movement is irrevocably redefining life in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   If the future of American fiction is--as some have argued--to
point us to a deeper understanding about the issues of race and
ethnicity that link and divide us, "Blues Lessons" is an important
novel, a historical document of sorts, reminding us of who we were
before we got here today. Lost, in love, faithful and naive, Marty is
never far from that moment on the water tower or the perplexing
uncertainty over whether the color of his skin--or Cory's--really
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in their conversations, Cory has the upper hand. Knowing more
about Marty's assumptions and attitudes than even he does, she
exhibits the irony that James Baldwin, among others, knew so well
when he wrote, "by means of what the white man imagines the black man
to be, the black man is enabled to know who the white man is." It is
her awareness and their shared history that deftly complicate their
relationship and, perhaps more interesting, the relationship between
Marty and his daughter, so that what began as a story about race
evolves into a story about identity.</TE>
<TE>   Who are we? Who is Cory, a black woman attempting to connect to
herself through a beauty salon that specializes in Afros? Who is
Marty, a white man playing the blues in the style of Mike Bloomfield?
And who is Cozy, their mixed-race child? Identity, as Hellenga sees
it, runs in proportion to the sympathy and rebellion one feels toward
one's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Was Appleton the Garden of Eden? Is any childhood perfect? Toward
the end of the story, Hellenga brings the saddest realization to
Marty's mother, the woman who drove herself between her son and his
life, a parent who, in spite of best wishes and intent, broke the
dreams of her child. "I wanted you to be happy, and I made you
unhappy. I made myself unhappy," she says to him in a moment of
rapprochement. But she is, of course, unnecessarily hard on herself.
No one--not a parent, a lover or a child--can ease the longing in
another's soul. That's, after all, the reason for the blues.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you remember," Marty asks Cory late in the novel, "how my
mother used to talk about a line of poetry, or a whole poem, greeting
your spirit? Like that line about the tears of things, lacrimae
rerum. That's what the blues gives us ... the tears of things. The
joys of things too."</TE>
<TE>   There's no better description for Hellenga's achievement in this
intelligent, deeply satisfying story.</TE>

<DH>TEPPER ISN'T GOING OUT, A Novel, By Calvin Trillin, Random
House: 214 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIGITTE FRASE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Not to boast," Calvin Trillin told Book magazine last summer about
his newest book, "Tepper Isn't Going Out," "but I think this is the
first parking novel." I would add that it is unlikely to be
superseded any time soon. Among car-owning New Yorkers who have
mastered the arcane rules of alternate side of the street parking and
who know that you're more likely to score a spot between Lexington
and Park than farther east--good luck with the killer Upper East
Side--Trillin is a professional among gifted amateurs.</LD>
<LD>   Trillin is the man who, in the 1960s, co-edited a one-issue
publication called Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking. And any
parking aficionados or other readers who understand that urban
parking is a test of fortitude, a survival skill demanding highly
developed instincts and occasionally a blood sport will surely be
satisfied by the inspiring story of Murray Tepper. A much-needed
addition to automotive literature, it certainly hits the spot.
Trillin is at his charmingly funny best in this good-humored satire
of urban politics and media spin.</LD>
<TE>   Murray Tepper co-owns a small business called Worldwide Lists,
which matches its clients and their products with the mailing lists
most likely to yield sales. He muses on the mysterious connections
that sometimes emerge. Accountants, for example, are a good market
for discount designer jeans, and people who send away for treated
cloths that wash cars without water turn out to be lucrative targets
for Republican and Democratic fund-raisers. His protege in the firm,
Arnie Sarnow, has made it his mission to compile the list of lists.
He figures there must be a magic bullet, one item that identifies
consumers willing to buy anything, "portable saunas and life
insurance and matched luggage and attache cases that turned into
foldout computer tables."</TE>
<TE>   Murray is a gifted parker. Although he has a garage slot, he likes
to take the car out early evenings and Sunday mornings, find a legal
spot and read the newspaper. He infuriates space-seeking drivers who
curse at him when he gives them the long-practiced shooing gesture or
the barely perceptible head shake that means: I'm not moving. His
friend Jack admiringly says, "[W]hen it comes to parking, you like to
play rough but clean, like the West Point football team." When his
daughter asks him if he's trying to relive the old garage-less days
when he'd try to score "a beautiful spot" every evening, Murray
explains patiently that this is a different situation. Then it was
alternate-side, now it's meters.</TE>
<TE>   One day, a young freelance journalist interviews him. Answering
his philosophical question about why he likes sitting in his car,
Tepper gets straight to the heart of the matter: "Oh, it's a legal
spot. I've got thirty minutes left on the meter." When the interview
appears, Murray increasingly finds people politely knocking on the
passenger-side window, asking for advice. Tepper nods gravely at
their stories and opines, echoing that other sage of New York,
"Saturday Night Live's" Rosanne Rosanna-Danna, "There's always
something." His legend spreads and pretty soon there are lines
waiting in various places where he's been spotted parking. He makes
the front pages and the network news.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the parking advisory sessions reaches the mayor, Frank "Il
Duce" Ducavelli, who pegs Tepper as one of the "forces of disorder"
that he has been battling against. Giuliani, I mean Ducavelli, has
tried to enforce modest dress codes in Central Park and has forbidden
the citizens of New York from stepping into the street to hail a cab.
Before even his close aides can enter his office, they must submit to
an iris scan and the BOSS (Body Orifice Security Scanner). Now he
tells his pollster, Mike Shanahan, "Parking is the key. That's where
the disorder starts." The fact that Tepper parks legally shows how
wily he is. "It's a way to mock the law is what it is," the mayor
yells at one point. "When you strip away the legalisms, the man's an
anarchist."</TE>
<TE>   Tepper becomes a folk hero, the Little Guy to whom others attach
their own grievances while he remains calm and unflappable. The man
just wants to park. The American Civil Liberties Union takes the
case; his supporters make "Tepper isn't going out" their rallying
cry. In a rousing climax, Tepper reminisces about parking strategies
with the judge, Sarnow is vouchsafed a vision of the ultimate List,
and Ducavelli is challenged by the Irish singing ex-mayor in the
upcoming election. If you're reading "Tepper" in your comfy car, make
sure you're close to the curb and feed the meter.</TE>

<LD>NOT BY ACCIDENT</LD>
<LD>   Reconstructing a Careless Life</LD>
<LD>   By Samantha Dunn</LD>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 256 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Why are some people accident-prone? What does it mean to be
accident-prone? These are the questions that surface most often in
Samantha Dunn's Vicodin-soaked brain after a terrifying,
life-threatening accident that occurred while she was riding her
horse, Harley, in the Malibu hills a little more than a year ago.
Dunn dismounted to cross a stream; Harley reared and landed on her,
his hoofs slicing her leg below the shin. The first person to come to
Dunn's rescue is actor Edward Albert Jr. Looking up at the vaguely
familiar face is the beginning of a surreal journey for Dunn. "Your
life will change because of this," he tells her while they wait for
the paramedics. His prediction resounds throughout "Not by Accident,"
a memoir of Dunn's recovery. Until now, Dunn had been a
twentysomething freelance writer on sports and fitness, a rider of
horses all her life, a somewhat cynical fast-moving, fast-talking
and, yes, accident-prone woman. Married to a musician, she lived
through his drug addiction and rehab; the marriage, not good before
the accident, unravels during the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   As she gets better, her editors begin to call and send her on
assignments to yoga studios and fitness gurus. She now has the space
in her life to listen to their messages. You are careless with your
life, a Navy SEAL tells her; people with stressful childhoods are
often accident-prone, psychologists tell her. Dunn is an honest,
charming, though not always graceful writer. She forgives her horse,
her mother and, in many ways, her husband. The main attraction of
this memoir is self-recognition, mixed with hope for a better, more
fully conscious life.</TE>

<TE>   THE ZYGOTE CHRONICLES</TE>
<TE>   By Suzanne Finnamore</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press: 126 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   Too often, women use humor to apologize for themselves. Whatever
might seem goofy or messy or out of place in such male orbits as the
advertising world, where Suzanne Finnamore's vaguely disguised
autobiographical novel is set, is more digestible with a coating of
rapid irony. "The Zygote Chronicles" is another book about having a
baby. Because this process changes at least superficially every 10
years, it's a good subject for fiction or nonfiction, but it is not
useful information one gleans from these books. It is a riff, a
persona to try on when you are stripped of your identity in order to
make babies. The skinny advertising executive, so terminally focused
on the hip and superficial, takes a dive into less-than-coolness: the
world of extra weight, amniocentesis, obstetrics and, yes, true love.
Selfless love. Animal love. Very hard to make this subject hip. And
so, "The Zygote Chronicles," which has some beautiful phrases (like
"velocity of the spirit" and "advertising is the least work you can
do for the most money") is without bubbles. All the fizz goes flat as
the mother-to-be begins her internal cooing. Until around the sixth
month, she is still funny--unable to stand how badly her husband
smells or to forgive him when he steams up a "mess of beets" for
dinner--but the cord that ties her to the world is humming and
stretching. When it breaks, she is lost to us, which is the trouble
with most books about pregnancy. No one really wants to see the
literary video of your birth.</TE>

<TE>   THE ENVY OF THE WORLD</TE>
<TE>   On Being a Black Man in America</TE>
<TE>   By Ellis Cose</TE>
<TE>   Washington Square Press:</TE>
<TE>   164 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   Ellis Cose has written a risky and generous book. It's risky
because Cose, author of "The Rage of the Privileged Class," an
essayist and a contributing editor for Newsweek, lets us in on his
definition of the problems and advantages of being black in America.
It's generous because he gives us data from polls and studies but
also anecdotes and interviews and conversations. "Our challenge, as
black men, as human beings, is to see beyond the assumptions that
limit our existence."</TE>
<TE>   As of June 2000, 792,000 black males were in prison in this
country. Black men--applauded for their style, their sexuality, their
animal magnetism by everyone from Norman Mailer to Walt Disney--are
discouraged as children from achieving in ways that vary from subtle
to illegal. If you are a white reader, each time you read about these
hurdles (here or elsewhere), you struggle to find a parallel in your
own life, and you cannot. Cose spells out the different kinds of
anger a black child experiences. He chides us for failing to go back
beyond slavery to understand black history; he brings us into his
version of the story between black men and black women. It's not a
war, he says; black women don't feel they have much to choose from
for a partner. Black men turn to lighter-skinned minorities. Our
culture holds the black man like a Pieta, like Mary cradling her son
Jesus in her lap, and he is exhausted.</TE>

<LD>BAROQUE-A-NOVA</LD>
<LD>   By Kevin Chong</LD>
<LD>   Putnam: 240 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   Like an accomplished songwriter, Kevin Chong can sum up
adolescence in a few deft strokes: "I was eighteen, slack-jawed and
gangly in army-surplus apparel, with narrow, miserly eyes and greasy
hair falling in them, heavy and frizzy like wet yarn." The adolescent
in question is Canadian high schooler Saul St. Pierre, and he's a
vividly drawn, unsparing narrator who is like thousands of other
misfit kids strewn across North America, with one exception: His
parents, Ian and Helena St. Pierre, were folk-rock superstars--a la
Ian and Sylvia--back in the late '60s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "Baroque-a-Nova" tells the story of the fallout from that long-ago
era of mellowness: Saul has had to cope with the burden of his
parents' celebrity and the corresponding burden of not benefiting at
all from it, with his father's philandering, and, most significant,
with the disappearance--and suicide--of his cult-figure mother.
Helena St. Pierre is a mysterious larger-than-life chanteuse, made
all the more romantic by her absence. She is the beguiling heart of
this tough-minded ballad about the travails of a pop-culture family.
Chong perfectly orchestrates the notion that Helena's absence from
Saul's life is as omnipresent as the new sample-heavy remake of the
St. Pierres' "Bushmills Threnody" that's currently clogging the
airwaves. With its strains of family, suburbia and awakening
sexuality, Chong's impressive--and often hilarious--debut cleverly
suggests that, in our disposable culture, being a
flash-in-the-pan--like the St. Pierres--can inconveniently last
forever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GONE</TE>
<TE>   By Martin Roper</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 228 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   When Stephen, the emotionally besieged narrator of Martin Roper's
first novel, and Ursula, his wife, move into a fixer-upper Dublin
townhouse, the romance of domesticity is swiftly blown out of the
water: For some reason, the local urchins have taken a disliking to
the striving young couple and, through a campaign of rock throwing,
petty vandalism and verbal intimidation, turn Stephen and Ursula's
dream house into a nightmare and their marriage into a shambles.
Roper has a flair for zeroing in on the disquietude that so often
surrounds or underlies relationships, both erotic and familial, and
Stephen, as he meanders from Dublin to New York to the ultra-American
cornfields of Iowa, has his fair share of inner turmoil: His sister
Ruth dies of cancer as the book opens; he and Ursula call it quits
when he flees to New York; his erotic entanglement with Holfy, a
pretentious New York photographer, can't seem to find a path between
sadomasochism and love; and his mother has slipped away into a
mysterious new life in Cardiff. Despite all the grimness (the amount
of melancholy packed into this little book could be calculated by the
square millimeter), Roper imbues Stephen's wanderings with austere
beauty and such koan-like insights as "Depression is beautiful music
that does nothing to the emotions." For the most part, Roper has an
impressive handle on his shifting locales--those places where his
forever-leaving and forever-arriving narrator is plagued by all who
have gone, including himself.</TE>

<TE>   SEARCHING FOR INTRUDERS</TE>
<TE>   By Stephen Raleigh Byler</TE>
<TE>   Morrow: 244 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   A novel in stories is the aardvark of fiction. It's a literary
oddball, sometimes hard to pull off, but in his debut, Stephen
Raleigh Byler rises to the challenge. "Searching for Intruders" is
the episodic history of a guy named Wilson Hues, told in chapters
that fade in and out, their chronology as loose as their structure is
tight. If each story stands on its own, together they advance with
novelistic momentum, even if the rootless Wilson--a decent young man
from the Pennsylvania Amish country with a mild case of
wanderlust--mostly spins his wheels.</TE>
<TE>   When the book opens, we find Wilson and his soon-to-be ex-wife
plagued by cockroaches in a cramped New York apartment. These
Kafkaesque house guests and Wilson's efforts to eradicate them become
multi-purpose metaphors that ring throughout the book, vividly
embodying the teeming doubts that come out to feast in the wee hours
and the need to pitch quixotic battles. But even when Byler weaves
Wilson's father's death, his new lover's losing battle with cancer
and a brutal murder into the story line, "Searching for Intruders"
never gets mired in melodrama.</TE>
<TE>   The stoic Byler has so much Pennsylvania German good sense that he
is unfazed by the catastrophes he so ably chronicles. It's an
affecting disconnect, thoroughly in keeping with Wilson, who, after
all he endures, finally comes to a belated epiphany after befriending
a pathetic stray dog while on a trip to Chile. Upon receiving a
lecture on the connection between cruelty and maturity by one of the
locals, Wilson, ever on the verge of growing up, defiantly declares,
"then I will never be a man."</TE>

<LD>The ad, sponsored by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, appeared in
1921. Its headline read: "Don't Try to Break Into the Movies." It
concluded with this doubtless spurious, yet not entirely
unpersuasive, statistic: "Out of 100,000 Persons Who Started at the
Bottom of the Screen's Ladder of Fame Only Five Reached The Top."</LD>
<LD>   It is quite amazing: the early appearance of a public warning
against what would in time become Hollywood's central myth, the myth
of discovery. At the time, Hollywood, as a center for movie
production, was scarcely more than a decade old, and the invention of
feature films, which made almost everyone movie-crazy, was even more
recent. But still the promise of stardom was palpable, and while the
ad probably did nothing to stem the flow of pretty, dopey hopefuls
from Keokuk to casting couch, the discovery myth was already an
essential component of Hollywood's hold on the popular imagination.
Some part of us needed to believe that movie stardom was available to
any reasonably attractive individual who could be taught to walk and
talk at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   There was, naturally, a mystery at the core of this myth: the
notion that there were certain faces the camera loved for
inexplicable reasons, certain personalities who had (for want of a
better word) "it," that unquantifiable, indescribable quality that
rocketed a few lucky souls to stardom. This mystery is why everyone
ignored the statistical odds against success. It held that all you
needed to beat those odds was one powerful insider--a mentor, a
guide, a confidant--who sensed and shared your singular vision of
yourself and could shape it for public consumption.</TE>
<TE>   The movies about movies--"Show People," "Movie Crazy," "What Price
Hollywood?," the several versions of "A Star Is Born," even "Singin'
in the Rain"--stressed this point. And it was reinforced by a potent
metafiction: The talent scout observing Lana Turner at Schwab's soda
fountain and being knocked out by what he saw is the ur-example.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the myth contained just enough truth to make it
credible. Occasionally some improbable figure (Turner is an excellent
example) emerged from obscurity to capture the world's fancy. But, in
fact, the myth was always pretty much nonsense. From D.W. Griffith's
days onward, most of the people who became movie stars were, in fact,
trained professionals, actors who honed their craft on stage before
turning to the movies. By the 1940s, when the great teachers began
emerging from beneath Konstantin Stanislavski's overcoat, it became
next to impossible to achieve stardom without access to the
knowledge, and the artistic passion, they imparted. The comparatively
recent transformation of the studios into subsidiaries of vast
international media corporations, unwilling to risk millions in
on-the-job training for inexperienced cuties, should put a definitive
end to the myth.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, it seems at first glance almost quaint of Gustaf
Sobin to write a novel about Greta Garbo, the greatest and perhaps
the unlikeliest of all the accidental discoveries. The story of how
this shy and lanky Swedish shop girl was transformed into the most
enigmatically romantic figure in film history will probably seem to
most modern readers impossibly remote and even slightly risible.</TE>
<TE>   And, indeed, the "secret" of her transformation, which Sobin's
protagonist, a dying screenwriter named Philip Nilson, reveals in
racing his own mortality in order to complete a scenario about her,
is unpersuasive. He offers fictional "evidence" that the young
woman--she was an impressionable 18 at the time--became legend during
a brief sojourn in Constantinople in the winter of 1924-25. She had
gone there with her Svengali, Mauritz Stiller, a director in the
imperious European "genius" mode of the time, to make a
ridiculous-sounding romantic melodrama. Together with a small crew,
they were stranded in the Turkish capital, awaiting production funds
that never arrived. But "Moje," as Stiller was called, noticing
something awed in the response of onlookers as Garbo stalked through
their hotel, instructed his crew to start addressing her as
"Contessa" and to treat her shyness and silences not as defects to be
overcome but as qualities to be worshiped. Voila--a star is born.</TE>
<TE>   Garbo's several excellent biographers make far less of this
interlude than Sobin does--perhaps because she had already played a
countess in her first Stiller film, "The Saga of Gosta Berling,"
possibly because, though she subsequently portrayed members of the
nobility, there was ever something subversively anti-aristocratic in
her sexuality, something playful and ironic, as if she somehow knew
what her lovers did not--that the affair would end badly--and didn't
much care. "Wanton" and "perverse" were words George Cukor, director
of "Camille," used to describe her work in that film. And gallant, I
would add. It was what sometimes rescued her films--humanized and
modernized them--from antique convention.</TE>
<TE>   What's good about "In Pursuit of a Vanishing Star" (a clunky title
for an elegantly written little novel) lies outside its ostensible
subject. We see that its narrator-protagonist's life has been shaped
by a forbidden love for a half-sister he could not possess. This has
led him to marry a woman who resembled her, then to divorce her when
inevitably she turned out not to match his fantasies. We also see
that his writing career has been devoted to the creation of dream
works as improbable as the discovery myth, and Sorbin makes the
reader see that Nilson's choice of a final subject was inescapable,
fated.</TE>
<TE>   In his scheme of things, Garbo's life was equally haunted by
forbidden love. Her adored father, a worldly failure, had died young.
Stiller was his surrogate but also prohibited from her because of his
homosexuality. More important, he too died prematurely and a failure,
discarded by MGM, to whom he had brought Garbo. Her obligation then
was to fabrications: her own preposterous image, the silly movies
that projected it, the twaddling cinematic notion that death is a
minor inconvenience, easily surmounted by immortal love. No wonder
she retreated into reclusive silence. She knew different. She knew
better.</TE>
<TE>   So does Richard Stern. In "Pacific Tremors," he too flirts with
the discovery myth. He has one of his protagonists, Ez Keneret, an
aging, artistically conscientious but out-of-work director, find a
pretty French girl named Leet de Loor on a Fijian tennis court and
take her to Hollywood to star in his comeback film. She, like Garbo,
is haunted by an absent father, a wartime collaborator who has
disappeared from her life. But unlike Garbo, she is a wooden flop as
an actress; the movie is canceled after three weeks in production.
Also unlike Garbo, she achieves a sad yet truthful and oddly
liberating resolution of her Oedipal drama.</TE>
<TE>   She also arrives, perhaps, at a better place--marriage, a
prospering business--than anyone else in Stern's patchy, compelling
and subtly complex fiction. He's always been an ironic realist, and
the irony he's working here is a large one: the futility of ambition
when it is posed against cosmic indifference. Not only is Keneret's
last-chance movie yanked from him, he also eventually succumbs to
writing feckless autobiography, to illness and to death. His hugely
supportive best friend, a film critic named Wendell Spear, first
suffers a brilliantly comic IRS audit, then loses his house in a
Malibu fire and finally dies just as it looks as if he might restore
reasonableness to his life. The novel ends with a shattering
earthquake, wiping out much of the past that might have sustained
those whom Stern permits to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, whose large body of work has been underappreciated, relates
his tale in a manner far jauntier than Sobin's. And, at 72, he has an
old guy's impatience with detail and structural nicety. His grasp of
how the movie business actually works, even the language of the
people who make films, is shaky. But that's unimportant in the end.</TE>
<TE>   What is important is that his book, like Sobin's, is haunted by
death--the death of protagonists, obviously, but also the death of
those illusions (including, but not limited to, the discovery myth)
that sustained not just the movies but much of our public and private
lives in the century just past. Stern is in more visible and
self-conscious pursuit of this idea than Sobin. But these are both
artful, eccentric and pleasing novels, flawed in their ways but
notably--sometimes even nobly--resistant to the conventions of
Hollywood fictions, the cliches of Hollywood historiography.</TE>

<DH>THE WONDER OF GIRLS: Understanding the Hidden Nature of Our
Daughters, By Michael Gurian, Pocket Books: 328 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN STABINER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To paraphrase a basic rule of physics--a class I never took because
girls rarely did that sort of thing when I was in high school--for
every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When women got
tired of the wife-and-mother model, the pendulum swung as far in the
other direction as possible: The early days of feminism were all
about quantifiable equality: equal pay, equal opportunity in the
workplace, dollar-for-dollar parity on the college athletic field. We
wanted to be just like the guys, down to what now seems like a parody
of their power suits, with silk bows to mimic their neckties.</LD>
<LD>   Life is never as simple as a new suit of clothes and good
intentions, though, and in the decades since Betty Friedan wrote "The
Feminine Mystique," we have learned just how elusive equality can be.
Women crack their skulls on the glass ceiling, switch onto the mommy
track so that they can catch a glimpse of their children and find too
often that they work what sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls "the
second shift"--a full day at work, bracketed by another eight hours
raising a family. Women who stay at home too often spar with their
working sisters about whose life has more meaning.</LD>
<TE>   Any sane parent yearns for better times for a daughter. Michael
Gurian's "The Wonder of Girls" says that the solution is a philosophy
he calls "womanism." Be forewarned, weary parents: What is clearly a
well-intentioned attempt to do right by our girls is in fact another
swing of the pendulum. There are bits of wonderfully useful advice
along the way--Gurian is at his best when it comes to the nuts and
bolts of rearing a daughter--but he packages them in a philosophy
that chills my heart.</TE>
<TE>   It boils down to this: Recent biological research confirms that
girls and boys are different in profound physiological ways. We can
do one of two things with this information: either refine the process
that gets us to equality, so it serves both sexes well, or use
biology to dignify what is essentially a return to a double standard.
Womanism suggests that biology is destiny and, as Gurian explains it,
"provides for the equal status of girls and women without robbing
them of the natural need for dependency on men." Gurian uses science
not to alter the process of parenting but to redefine the goal.</TE>
<TE>   And how is tomorrow's woman supposed to feel if she cannot live up
to her destiny? Let's say she cannot have children. Let's say she
cannot find Mr. Right, or that after they have children he turns into
Mr. Wrong. Let's say she cannot afford to stay at home or to find
that lovely nanny or enlightened child-care center to provide her
child with an extended family. Must she go through her life feeling
that she has failed?</TE>
<TE>   Gurian's daughter asks which is better, being a mother or being a
lawyer. He and his wife answer, "Being a mother is more important
than being a lawyer in our family's value system, but you don't have
to see them as better or worse. If you want to, you can do both
things at different stages of your life." Privileged girls will
continue to have choices, thanks in great part to the women's
movement; the rest will have to settle for wishing that they did.</TE>
<TE>   Gurian's earnest optimism is sadly at odds with daily life. Yes,
it would be lovely to live in a world where women could choose to
check out of the workplace long enough to have and raise their
children. But we do our daughters a tremendous wrong if we let them
believe that they will have that chance.</TE>
<TE>   We live in a country that pays lip service to family values and
does little to encourage them: Most women work, and even those who
work full time make less than their male counterparts do; the divorce
rate suggests that no one can count on having a guy around to
subsidize the mothering experience; the landscape is littered with
women who tried to go back to work only to find that their
professions had passed them by.</TE>
<TE>   Gurian writes, "a woman can do both during the season of life in
which her nature guides her to do each; and the essential job of a
civilization is to protect both the women's right to professional
success during those seasons of her life, and her right to mothering
during its season." Perhaps it is civilization, and not feminism,
that has let us down.</TE>
<TE>   Having quarreled with Gurian's conclusion, I was relieved and
grateful to get to the advice section of the book, which categorizes
girls by age; Gurian's tips to dads seem particularly useful. He gets
credit for being at least willing to look at the new research, which
is more than the first-wave feminists are prepared to do, as though
ignoring it would make it go away. But if the purpose of knowledge is
to expand our universe, not constrict it, then it is too soon for
some of this book's conclusions.</TE>

<LD>"Hi Josh ... We were blessed with a beautiful snowstorm on Saturday.
I love how it makes the city clean and sparkly in the brief moment
before it gets brown and slushy. Kinda magical. Your spirit still
makes the city more beautiful every day, and unlike snow does not get
brown and slushy at all. Can't wait to hear your voice again. Love,

<LD>   --Message on Josh Clayton-Felt's Web site near the two-year
anniversary of his death</LD>
<LD>   Josh Clayton-Felt's parting gift--the album he did not know would
be a goodbye--will be bestowed upon the listening public this week,
more than two years after he died. And while a few fans might get
weepy, many he touched will probably smile, light a candle and whip
up some banana pancakes, Josh-style.</LD>
<TE>   "Spirit Touches Ground," due Tuesday from DreamWorks Records,
brims with grand metaphor and unrelenting hope, the crisp, tuneful
work of a singer-songwriter in full bloom.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton-Felt, a Boston native who lived in L.A., finished mixing
the album in mid-December 1999, a week before he was hospitalized and
a month before he died of a rare form of cancer at 32. His family
gained rights to the album and financed the release, which is being
promoted and marketed by a network of volunteers, many of whom worked
with him at his former label, A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   "It's come out just the way he wanted," Marilyn Felt, his mother,
says of the album. "He'd be thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   That "Spirit" would inspire such a flurry of posthumous activity
surprises no one who knew Clayton-Felt, the former School of Fish
frontman whose indomitable optimism echoes throughout the album even
as he explores the compromises we reach between the spiritual and the
secular. Then there are the vocals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so painful for many of us to listen" to the album, says
Laura Baker, Clayton-Felt's sister. "It was hard to hear his voice,
to hear him sound so present."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, his crystalline tenor, earnest and honest with its
occasional tremolo and funk and folk inflections, dances above
guitar, keyboard and horn arrangements with the confidence of a man
who knew exactly where he--and his music--was grounded.</TE>
<TE>   It is the kind of voice that, two years later, still elicits
conversation from fans on www.joshclayton.com, where the artist
recounts not only one of his explorations of Native American culture,
but his special recipe for banana pancakes. (It's the vanilla soy
milk.)</TE>

<HD>Married ... With Issues</HD>
<DH>The new sitcom starring his wife, Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
might settle the debate about writer Brad Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 2:30 p.m. on a recent Friday, Brad Hall took lunch at his desk on
the Culver Studios lot. His office is spacious but barren, the big
desk and big couch looking like the last two pieces of furniture to
be hauled out on moving day. Hall opened a takeout container and
began picking at a chicken sandwich and fries. There was a reporter
on his couch, and as he ate, Hall persevered with amiable
self-deprecation through a series of questions, all of which seemed a
little dishonest, given their underlying theme: Would you be here if
you weren't married to Julia Louis-Dreyfus?</LD>
<LD>   On Feb. 26 at 8:30 p.m., Louis-Dreyfus will become the third
former "Seinfeld" co-star to begin a new series, playing a nightclub
jazz singer in the midseason NBC comedy "Watching Ellie." Ellie is
Eleanor Riggs, a plucky vocalist of some talent who must nevertheless
get by singing at weddings and such. After nine seasons on
"Seinfeld," shining in her own way but also under the creative
auspices of men, Louis-Dreyfus gets to show off her considerable sex
appeal, and yes, sing. Ellie is single and lives in a Los Angeles
apartment (think Los Feliz-area one bedroom, $1,400 a month, walking
distance to trendy stuff on Vermont), and she is pursued by a
collection of damaged men whom the "Sex and the City" gals would
reduce to punch lines in less than one breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   Most prominently, "Watching Ellie" will test whether Louis-Dreyfus
can overcome the perceived "Seinfeld" albatross, after the resounding
failures of "The Michael Richards Show" and "Bob Patterson," starring
Jason Alexander. But "Watching Ellie" is also a test of Hall, who
created the show, and whose career has come to epitomize the
excessive, multimillion-dollar studio deals handed out to sitcom
writers in the 1990s, when huge hits abounded and one needed only to
have spent time in the writers' room of "Friends," "Seinfeld" or
"Cheers" to cash in.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the environment is less generous, most of those so-called
"overall deals" having failed to produce new hits. In the current
sitcom recession, dramas grab the headlines and unscripted
programming keeps proving it's more than a passing curiosity. But
success can still be had by being in the right place at the right
time. By being married, for instance, to Louis-Dreyfus at the moment
she decides to return to prime time.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time that Hall, who has virtually no sitcom
staff experience, has managed to skip over the years-long steps by
which a TV writer becomes a show runner--that is, the executive
producer who oversees all aspects of a project. What is still unknown
is whether Hall truly deserves the abuse of his peers, or whether the
combination of disdain and envy he inspires is more global, of a sort
that could be directed at any writer whose development deal bought a
big house but didn't create a good show.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, 43, joined this fraternity (and it is mostly men) in 1996,
when he signed a development deal with Big Ticket Television to
create sitcoms for a reported $15 million. The deal, which tied Hall
exclusively to CBS, made him one of the highest-paid writers in
television, even though his only show-running experience had come as
executive producer of NBC's "The Single Guy," the failed mid-'90s
sitcom starring Jonathan Silverman as a single guy (hence the title)
surrounded by a gaggle of married friends.</TE>
<TE>   NBC liked the pilot, but came to dislike the show and Hall's
handling of it. He was dismissed or left, depending on whom you talk
to, and went directly into the embrace of his Big Ticket millions. In
a Daily Variety article announcing the deal, Hall's handlers noted
that CBS had "identified Brad very early on as [being] at the
forefront of a new generation of show creators," and the credits that
suggested Hall's chops were duly noted: former writer-performer on
"Saturday Night Live"; mentored by respected writer-producer Gary
David Goldberg on the acclaimed series "Brooklyn Bridge." Plus, he
came from theater.</TE>
<TE>   Hall's exclusive arrangement with CBS included heavy episodic
commitments to whatever ideas he dreamed up. "He will bring a
slightly younger demographic to the network, a different sensibility
for us," CBS Television President Leslie Moonves said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Hall made at least one pilot he liked for Big Ticket and CBS, but
it didn't make it to air, and with more than a year left on his
contract, he walked away from the game altogether, evidently beaten
down by politics. He left millions on the table. "He was honorable,"
says Larry Lyttle, Big Ticket Television chief. "Most people wouldn't
have done what Brad Hall did. People should say, 'There's a really
solid guy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hall withdrew, temporarily, in that wonderful way that Hollywood's
writer establishment can withdraw. He saw movies and read books. He
adapted two novels into unproduced screenplays and took some script
doctor assignments from the studios. He spent time with his kids and
practiced classical guitar.</TE>
<TE>   "You start out as an artist in some way or other," he says,
picking at his fries. "And my background is all theater, and I goofed
into doing TV comedy. And so I thought, 'Well, what's going to make
me really, really happy, and therefore a good husband and good father
and good citizen?'"</TE>
<TE>   This was, more or less, what Hall was thinking when he wrote the
pilot for "Watching Ellie."</TE>
<TE>   Hall is 6-foot-2, fair-haired and thin; he looks like one of those
Harvard Lampoon guys, but in fact he attended Northwestern. At any
rate, he seems, in person, the wrong guy to hate. Maybe it has to do
with the fact that he grew up in the rectory of All Saints by the Sea
in Montecito, the youngest of six children of an Episcopalian priest
father. People, Hall says, would just appear in his living room. What
he describes sounds like a show.</TE>
<TE>   He came up with Ellie Riggs without telling his wife, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Louis-Dreyfus spends much of the pilot episode partially clothed,
getting ready for a club gig. Her sister calls. The toilet overflows.
The men in Ellie's life are brought onstage and introduced. There's
her infatuated neighbor (played by Peter Stormare, memorable as Steve
Buscemi's homicidal sidekick in "Fargo") and her obsequious ex.
There's Ellie's current beau, a married sideman in her jazz band. The
action unfolds in "real time," with a clock, barely visible at times,
counting down in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. No matter
what Ellie is doing, in other words, viewers will see the action
occur in 22 consecutive minutes--like the Chinese restaurant episode
of "Seinfeld," only that sort of thing every week.</TE>
<TE>   Comedy pilots, by their nature, come at the viewer screaming a
broad premise and high-octane laughs. Hall is of the opinion that
this particular sitcom convention has "become fraudulent."</TE>
<TE>   "Often, not always," he says. "But often, in that there's all this
explanation. So we just decided, let's just do away with that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even concerned [if the pilot] is hilarious. It should
just be amusing and fun. It should be entertaining to get to know
her, more in a way like you get to know people."</TE>
<TE>   So far, "Watching Ellie" is being sold for what it isn't. It isn't
a sitcom with a laugh track. It isn't a show with immediately
discernible relationships. It doesn't have three jokes on every page.
But alongside the buzzwords being bandied about--"risk-taking,"
"different"--is a sense that Hall, in absolving himself of the
pressure of being funny on every page, had better produce something
original for the privilege.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Brad really wishes he were Larry David," says a writer
familiar with Hall. David, the revered "Seinfeld" co-creator, has
gone on to fashion the idiosyncratic "Curb Your Enthusiasm," an HBO
comedy currently reinventing the wheel in that it features a fussy,
rich TV writer as its protagonist in improvised, layered scenes of
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   HBO, a pay cable network largely free of ratings pressure,
programs a select few original series each year, promotes them to the
hilt and then waits for the good press to roll in. Hall and
Louis-Dreyfus wanted to do "Watching Ellie" there.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, when the couple pitched the show to HBO and the
four major broadcast networks, they tried to make it clear that, if
they couldn't do a show at HBO, they still wanted to play by HBO's
rulebook. That meant airing the series free of commercials,
restricting network notes to one spokesman, and limiting the number
of episodes per year to 15 instead of the customary 22. "I always
loved the idea that all they did was 16 'Fawlty Towers,'" Hall says,
referring to the classic British TV comedy starring John Cleese as
the proprietor of a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The couple thought they were taking the right approach: delivering
a star but also a script to go with her, a script the star liked,
with none of the hassles and money it typically takes to get a show
out of development. But the stipulations were quickly perceived as
haughty.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of attention on the deal was hilarious to me ...
especially considering the fact that everything we did was a
sacrifice and yet was seen as arrogant," Hall says. "Why, because we
want to make less money? [Because] we want to bring you the show
without a huge commitment?"</TE>
<TE>   HBO passed, as did Fox, CBS and ABC. NBC, according to sources,
was the only serious bidder all along. For Jeff Zucker, at that point
the network's newly installed entertainment chief, "Watching Ellie"
fit neatly into a series of moves that would signal a new sheriff had
arrived at the home of quality scripted comedies and dramas. This
includes scheduling ever-more outrageous reality series (the ratings
hit "Fear Factor," where contestants were recently seen eating pig
rectum) and taking a chance on another "Seinfeld" co-star, in an
expensive project written by her writer-husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jeff wants to be the cat that ate the canary on this
one," says a show source, acknowledging that the scuttlebutt around
town is generally cynical about "Watching Ellie's" prospects for
survival. It didn't help when Carsey Werner Mandabach, the boutique
independent studio tapped to oversee the production, got skittish
about the financial arrangement and withdrew its money from the show.</TE>
<TE>   It is with the confidence of a network head that Zucker calls
Louis-Dreyfus "a very enticing star." Of the series, which has
tentatively been given a 12-episode order, Zucker says: "It does get
funnier, but it's never going to be 'Friends' or 'Will &amp; Grace.'" He
means that it's unfair to judge a single-camera show alongside a
bawdy laugher. He also keeps mentioning Louis-Dreyfus' name, as in:
"I personally believe a lot in Julia, and I really like the different
concept."</TE>
<TE>   Hall has been with Louis-Dreyfus for more than 20 years and
married to her for 15; he loves her more than anyone. "She's
unbelievable and real," he says. "On 'Seinfeld,' that was sort of her
job, to be the one who was very, very real. And funny, but real. And
the way she worked with props, the way she eats, the way she does
certain things on screen, I think, is just amazing. And not easy. And
easily overlooked. It's a really special skill to be able to pick up
a phone the way that a human picks up a phone. It's not as easy as
you think."</TE>
<TE>   They were drama students at Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill., when they met. Hall founded the Practical Theater Company and
hired Louis-Dreyfus to be in one of his shows. She would later be
cast in the famed improvisational comedy troupe next door, Second
City.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Hall and Louis-Dreyfus were plucked for the cast of
"Saturday Night Live," enduring two unremarkable seasons, 1982-84.
They moved to Los Angeles in the late 1980s; soon enough,
Louis-Dreyfus hit the mother lode, cast as Elaine Benes, the
ex-girlfriend-turned-pal of comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Hall acted in
features. At a dinner party in 1991, he says, he met Gary David
Goldberg. The two hit it off, and Hall went to work on two of
Goldberg's subsequent series, "American Dreamer," a sitcom, and the
nostalgic "Brooklyn Bridge," which mixed comedy and drama.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, of course, happened before he became that Brad Hall.
"I was very, very happy in Chicago as an actor making $168 a week,"
he says. "And when it became more important in the paper how much
money I was making, I thought that was grotesque."</TE>
<TE>   On "Watching Ellie," Hall has a writing staff of four. On this
Friday, three of them are holed up in a room that has an empty
bookcase and a smaller sofa than Hall's (perhaps superstition
prevents writers of new shows from actually moving in to their digs).</TE>
<TE>   They are Andrew Gottlieb (formerly of "The Single Guy"), Joe Furey
(formerly of "NewsRadio") and Jeffrey Ross, best known for his work
on Comedy Central as a kind of third-generation Friar's Club
comedian. They insist that media reports of the show's imminent
demise are greatly exaggerated and bat around the misnomer of the
"Seinfeld" curse. "I think people are angry that you're not playing
these characters anymore," Furey says.</TE>
<TE>   There is no writers' room, per se, on "Watching Ellie." At "The
Single Guy," where Hall did run a room, he earned a reputation as
someone who didn't trust his writers. It was a staff that included
Jay Kogen ("Frasier," "The Simpsons") and Max Mutchnick and David
Kohan, the creative team behind "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   The image of Hall that emerges, from some of those who were around
the show at the time, is of a harried show runner trying to please
two masters, increasingly torn between fickle network demands and his
own vision--not so much imperious as overwhelmed. "The writers were
standing around doing nothing," says someone familiar with how the
show functioned.</TE>
<TE>   Hall concedes that he did a lot of solo rewrites ("We were behind
a lot," he says, "so there was a lot of catching-up writing, late at
night"). He adds, of the joke rooms that dominate network comedies:
"I just don't like it. So I never really did it that way."</TE>
<TE>   None of this behind-the-scenes tumult is unusual. The trick, of
course, is to produce a hit show, at which point you're deemed an
eccentric genius (i.e., Aaron Sorkin, the dramatist-savant behind
"The West Wing").</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the skill is not so much how great a pure writer you are,
but also your ability to navigate the network waters," says Marty
Adelstein, Hall's longtime agent, who is leaving the Endeavor Agency
to become a talent manager. "He's a pure creator and a pure writer."</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much on the resume to back this up, but then Hall has
experienced the flip side of this hyperbole. He has been told he's
great and handed millions, and then had to pay the price for having
powerful handlers able to close big deals.</TE>
<TE>   Hall will tell you "The Single Guy" wasn't a bad show, and that it
did a better job of holding its "Friends" lead-in audience than any
of the please-be-like-"Friends" sitcoms NBC has scheduled Thursday
nights at 8:30 since.</TE>
<TE>   The show averaged nearly 25 million viewers its first season,
which would have been terrific for anything that wasn't sandwiched
between "Friends" and "Seinfeld."</TE>
<TE>   He will also say that his development deal was a mistake.
Artistically. "Maybe they work out sometimes. I don't know, do they?
... They're designed badly. You don't start with an idea and get a
whole bunch of money for a great idea.... Really, to tell you the
truth, from a business point of view, that's why this show went the
way it did. Because I wrote the show. Nobody ever does that. And
there's a reason nobody ever does that because you don't make any
money if it doesn't go. So why not be in development and make a
gazillion dollars if your life is 'I'm a TV writer.' But that's not
my life. My life is 'I want to enjoy myself, I want to be funny.'
There's a lot of things I like, I don't have to be sitting in an
office."</TE>
<TE>   And then Hall says what you've perhaps been waiting for him to say
all along: "You know what? I think a lot of it has to do with the
fact that I have an unbelievably beautiful, well-known wife. And the
people who criticize me don't."</TE>

<HD>A Toast to Her India</HD>
<DH>Mira Nair had never seen a film about chaotic modern life
in New Delhi. So she made 'Monsoon Wedding.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>The spirit of masti is what director Mira Nair wanted to capture on
film. "It means to be intoxicated with life," she explains, "and
nothing exemplifies that more than a Punjabi wedding." So it became
the pivotal event of her new work, "Monsoon Wedding," which joyously
and rambunctiously celebrates life, love and family relationships in
their varied manifestations and pitfalls.</LD>
<LD>   Here in the balmy climes of Palm Springs, "Monsoon Wedding"
launched the Palm Springs International Film Festival in mid-January
and Nair is being honored with a luncheon in the garden of the Casa
Cody inn. A grizzled Alan Bates has risen to give an introduction to
the honoree. He is visibly moved thinking about the film he saw the
evening before.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so touched with the love, the honesty and the humanity in
this film," he gushes about "Monsoon Wedding," which opens in Los
Angeles on March 1, "and it makes no concession to the usual norms of
film."</LD>
<TE>   By that, he means that it has escaped the stranglehold of genres,
whether they be the conventions of American romantic comedy or of
India's Bollywood musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Nair, elegantly outfitted in a toast-colored raw silk
churidar-kurta, an Indian-style tunic worn over matching slacks,
graciously accepts her award--an original Dale Chihuly handblown
glass piece--and throws Bates a compliment in return. "I remember I
had such a crush on him after seeing 'An Unmarried Woman!'" she says,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, Nair, 44, settles comfortably on the sofa in the
adjoining guest house, eventually slipping off her flat sandals and
tucking her legs under her.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't believe the kind of packing I've had to make for
this trip," she says about flying in from her home in New York. "From
the desert to the snow." The following day she is jetting off to the
Sundance Film Festival where "Hysterical Blindness," a film she made
for HBO that is set in working-class New Jersey, is about to get its
world premiere. And this month she heads for Berlin, where she has
been named head of the Berlin Film Festival jury.</TE>
<TE>   But rolling with the punches--or the weather or the landscape or
the culture--is her strength. It's the price, in a way, of being a
truly international director.</TE>
<TE>   Born in India, Nair grew up fascinated by the theater and took up
acting as a teen. She was offered a scholarship to Cambridge
University when she was about 17. "But I refused to go, I had a chip
on my shoulder about the Brits," she says. Instead, a year later, she
applied to American schools and got a full scholarship to Harvard,
which she accepted.</TE>
<TE>   But there she found theater "very uninspiring, like 'Oklahoma!'
was playing for months, musicals and hoop skirts." Instead, a
photography course offered inspiration. "The photographs got me
admitted into the film program at Harvard, which was very competitive
because it was very expensive and they took only 10 students a year,"
she says. Afterward, she moved to New York and raised money to make
five documentaries, all about India.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, she directed "Salaam Bombay!," her first feature, a
gritty tale of the plight of Bombay street children, fending for
their survival through odd jobs and scams. Nair recruited two dozen
such kids and put them in the film. (She later set up a foundation
for street children in India, the Salaam Baalak Trust.) It proved an
impressive debut--the film won the Camera d'Or for best first feature
at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination for best
foreign-language film.</TE>
<TE>   That film was followed by "Mississippi Masala" (1991), about an
interracial romance in the American South involving an African
American man (Denzel Washington) and an Indian-born woman; "The Perez
Family" (1995), about Cuban immigrants arriving in the United States;
and "Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love" (1996), a lush visual fable about
the sexual politics of 16th century India. These films had mixed
critical and audience reactions, and there was some feeling that she
hadn't quite tapped the potential she showed with "Salaam
Bombay!"--until "Monsoon Wedding," which last year won the top prize
at the Venice Film festival.</TE>
<TE>   The film focuses on four days of wedding preparations and
celebrations in a lively Punjabi family outside New Delhi. Lalit
Verma (Naseeruddin Shah) wants everything to be just right for the
arranged marriage of his darling daughter Aditi (Vasundhara Das), but
costs are mounting and nerves are fraying as the big day draws nigh.</TE>
<TE>   First, it's not certain his marriage is going to last, nor that
the new one will get off the ground, because Aditi has been having an
affair with a married man. How can she broach the subject with her
groom (Parvin Dabas), a nice Indian boy from Houston? (Yes, Texas.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cousin Ria (Shefali Shetty) is reliving some bad
memories after the arrival of an old family friend, and P.K. Dube
(Vijay Raaz), the hangdog-faced wedding planner, is falling
desperately in love with the shy family maid, Alice (Tilotama Shome).
On top of that, it looks like 40 days and 40 nights of pelting,
monsoon rains are upon them.</TE>
<TE>   Swirling around the action is contemporary India, where the
wedding guests may arrive by jet from far-flung places only to enjoy
the most traditional of ceremonies: Women in saris decorate
themselves with henna; the groom dresses like a prince and arrives on
a horse; then all join in the boogying to the infectious beat of
Indian disco.</TE>
<TE>   Like the polyglot culture it portrays, "Monsoon Wedding" freely
mixes English, Hindi and Punjabi; characters often switch among them
in mid-sentence (the film is partially subtitled).</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the film was born several years ago when Nair was
teaching at New York University and met Sabrina Dhawan, a fellow
Punjabi in graduate school there. "We were both chatting, 'How come
there's nothing we have seen about what our life is like?'" Nair
recalls. "I also wanted to make a film about Delhi, the city I loved
and she loved too. We plotted together, like I really wanted the
upstairs-downstairs quality--the Alice and Dube thing--and the kind
of seamless coexistence of class, and the multilingual way we live,
the music." A wedding seemed the perfect occasion for bringing all
these colorful elements together.</TE>
<TE>   "Mira called me and told me she had an idea to do a fun, quick
film in India," says producer Caroline Baron by telephone from New
York. Baron had fallen in love with India after working on "Kama
Sutra" and was eager for an excuse to go back.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just an outline at the time, and I thought my
experience in India was life-altering, enriching. I found that it was
not just a country of poor people, it was an incredibly rich and
diverse culture, with a tremendous amount of humor and I wanted to
see that on film. 'Monsoon' seems to have all that in it, so it was
an easy decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   To make the film on her own terms, Nair knew the production would
have to be kept lean. Although she didn't stint on talent, calling on
acting newcomers as well as respected veterans of stage and screen,
she established a pay scale in which all the principals would receive
the same modest amount (Nair included), with profit-sharing, should
the film do well.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare, she and the actors spent two weeks in workshops, then
a week in rehearsal at the house that would be the Verma homestead.
Nair decided on a handheld camera, and shooting sped briskly along,
40 locations in 30 days. "It reminded me of how I began my own work,
guerrilla-style." In some ways, it was truly a family affair, as Nair
cast her nephew Ishaan Nair for the role of Aditi's younger brother,
and Nair's mother did the catering.</TE>
<TE>   Nair herself has been married twice. Asked to describe her first
wedding, which took place in full-blown Punjabi glory in India, Nair
starts to laugh. "My husband was a nice Jewish boy [from the U.S.],
he came on a horse--the grooms come on a horse," she recalls. "He did
the whole thing, it was very funny." Then she adds, "I married him
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Her second marriage, to her current husband, Mahmood Mamdani, a
Ugandan academic, took place far more quietly, among a handful of
friends and family when they were visiting Toronto. "That's it," she
says, "No more marriages now." They have a son, 10.</TE>
<TE>   In spending part of every year in India, Nair has been happily
rediscovering her homeland. One recent development there prompted her
to go back to documentary filmmaking--"The Laughing Club of India,"
about the laughing clubs started by Dr. Madan Kataria in 1995 that
have caught on like wildfire throughout the country. The documentary
has played on TV in the U.S. and India and has been screened at some
film festivals.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, she finds an improved self-image. "In today's India, it's
kind of cool to be Indian, to dance to our music, to wear our
clothes," she says. "When I was growing up, there was a kind of
looking-Western ethic, a quasi-inferiority complex. We'd know more
about the Beatles than about [director] Satyajit Ray!"</TE>
<TE>   How did this sea change come about?</TE>
<TE>   "The ironic turning point is that India became more global,
opening its doors to everything from IBM to Prada," she says. "As
that happened, our culture became more assertive of itself. We beg
and borrow and assimilate and steal, but we take it all and make it
into something that is uniquely Indian."</TE>
<TE>   Well into the conversation, the dipping cadences of Nair's
Indian-accented English become more pronounced. And she lets herself
go with Anglo-Indian wordplay--repetition of words or thoughts to
make a point, extended riffs of wryness--when discussing troublesome,
even desperate, subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Nair is reminded of the scene in "Monsoon Wedding" when one
exasperated panelist on a television talk show says with a sigh,
"Just because we're going global, does that mean we should embrace
everything?"</TE>
<TE>   "This is a constant debate," she says. "That scene was a sort of a
[reply] to the Indian censor board which put me practically into
prison for 'Kama Sutra.'" That film was inspired by the classic sex
manual, although not based on it. Set in the 16th century, Nair's
film told of a young woman's discovery of love, both sacred and
profane, and was controversial for its nudity and simulated sex
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "The film was made as a response to the twisted, perverse
sexuality on our screens," Nair insists. "In the guise of censorship
and not kissing and not lovemaking, what was being shown? Rape,
abuse, vindictive revenge movies, and songs and dances of
extraordinary perverse nature. And this is the country which wrote
the Kama Sutra where you understand that the sexual act is one of
many sensual expressions in life."</TE>
<TE>   After the film was made, she spent six months fighting government
censors, making cuts, then finding out more had to be excised. "This
is what I would hear in six months of those meetings--just because we
have gone global, does that mean we embrace everything? Then the
other guy would say, 'That is American, this is Indian.'" Eventually,
the film did get released.</TE>
<TE>   So how did "Kama Sutra" do in India? She quips, "Big hit, hacked
version."</TE>
<TE>   But the battle took its toll on her spirit. "I had moved [to
India] from New York, from everywhere, we wanted to make a go of it,"
she says. "I started an office, I did everything, but finally I left.
Even though I was winning on paper, they were possessing my dreams."</TE>
<TE>   To escape the nightmare, Nair moved to Cape Town, South Africa, in
1997 with her husband, who had gotten a job there. Two years later,
they returned to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Happily back," she says. "It was where my filmmaking community
is. I have a sense of history there. Now I like it because my husband
teaches at Columbia, my son goes to school, and I can work there. As
I've become a mom and a real family-maker, I don't like to leave my
family. New York is where I can do my work and I can find like-minded
people, but from where I can go anywhere else quite easily."</TE>
<TE>   Her other film being released this year, "Hysterical Blindness,"
was made in her new backyard--New Jersey. Culturally speaking, it is
a light-year away from "Monsoon Wedding." The film is about two
women, played by Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis, who live lives of
noisy desperation believing that life has passed them by. The best
thing they can think of to do on weekend nights is hang out in the
local bar, hoping they'll get lucky and find the guy they'll marry.</TE>
<TE>   Nair found the original script a little too cool and injected more
warmth between the characters. At the same time, she encouraged
Thurman, a natural beauty, to look and act wasted by her own
desperation. "It's really a character study," Nair says, "and if
you're half-assed about how depraved she is, how neurotic she is,
you've got nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Colin Callendar, president of HBO Films, is pleased with the
results. "Mira's got enormous heart, a wonderful, distinct sense of
humor," he says. "We needed someone who would not shy away from that
pain, someone who was not afraid to explore the paradoxes."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment is shared by Thurman, who brought the project to
HBO--the film will air on the cable channel later this year--and
specifically courted Nair to direct the film. "'Hysterical Blindness'
is very intimate and very honest," she says by phone from New York.
"It's about all the yearning we have inside to belong, the desire to
be desirable, and the unattractiveness of self-consciousness, all the
things we share."</TE>
<TE>   For years Nair felt caught between the two cultures, Indian and
American. "In the early years, I used to feel confused by that," she
says. "But then I began to use the confusion in my work, and then I
began to accept that confusion so that it no longer is confusion, if
you know what I mean."</TE>
<TE>   While deeply proud of her Punjabi heritage--"we are an earthy,
unpretentious people"--she bristles against being seen as an
ambassador of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm irreverent and affectionate toward my culture," she says.
"Now of course to make matters more complicated and more interesting,
I'm really of three cultures. I also have a home in Uganda where my
husband is from."</TE>
<TE>   She smiles. "It may seem quite daunting for other people, but of
course it becomes part of one's life."</TE>

<HD>This Symphony Spans the Border</HD>
<DH>Funded by California and two states in Mexico, a new
orchestra is launched with a festival benefiting youth groups.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Tom Ireton, 66, retired salesman and amateur musician,
sailed his boat south from Washington state to La Paz, Mexico. He
decided to stay.</LD>
<LD>   About a year ago, Susan Richter, 60, also retired and a former
cellist with the Detroit Symphony and the National Symphony,
navigated her 40-foot ketch from San Diego to La Paz. She stayed too.</LD>
<LD>   The close friends, who first met in Mexico, live on their boats
and they spend a lot of time together, says Ireton with a laugh--and
not just because Ireton has a phone and Internet access.</LD>
<TE>   One of the things these musical soul mates do with their time is
volunteer at La Paz Escuela de Musica (La Paz Music School), home of
the La Paz Youth Orchestra. Richter teaches music classes; Ireton
finds funding, provides transportation and does whatever is necessary
to keep the school going.</TE>
<TE>   The school serves some of the children of a nearby colonia,
Marques de Leon, where there is no electricity, no running water and
most of the homes have dirt floors. Families can't afford the tuition
of $30 a month.</TE>
<TE>   While scholarships provide the children the opportunity to study
and perhaps even join the orchestra, there aren't enough instruments
to go around. Ireton and Richter have cajoled many in their
close-knit sailing community to donate funds and instruments, but the
orchestra is still missing entire sections. They have no tubas or
trombones, and the double bass player uses a cello bow. So Richter
and Ireton also spend time at the computer, arranging music for
instruments never intended by the composer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got two soprano saxophones, and nobody writes orchestral
music for soprano saxophones, so we take the oboe part and transcribe
it for soprano sax," Ireton says by phone from his boat--cheerfully
warning that the line could disconnect at any time. "Or if there's an
important trombone part, we'll write it for baritone sax."</TE>
<TE>   But all that is about to change for the La Paz Youth Orchestra. It
will be among the beneficiaries of a new cultural partnership
involving the three Californias--Baja California, Baja California Sur
and California. Funding from the three regions is going to create the
Orchestra of the Californias, which is holding its first event: the
11-day Orchestra of the Californias Festival, a series of concerts in
all three areas, at venues selected by the host cities--from civic
auditoriums to university halls to historic missions.</TE>
<TE>   The Orchestra of the Californias is an assemblage of musicians
from ensembles around the country. It is produced by San Diego's
Mainly Mozart organization and conducted by David Atherton, founder
of the Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra, a 14-year-old entity that
also pulls together instrumentalists from other orchestras. The
Orchestra of the Californias includes players from Dallas, San Diego,
San Francisco and Houston. Martin Chalifour, concertmaster of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, holds the same position with the new orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Also under the festival banner, Cuarteto Latinoamericano, a string
quartet that celebrates the work of Latin American composers, has
been engaged to perform in the tour cities. The quartet, which tours
the world, maintains residencies in Mexico City and at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly Mozart puts together a top orchestra, but in June, not in
February," said Mainly Mozart executive director Nancy Laturno. "It's
not nearly the challenge it is to mount an orchestra in February,
when almost all of the major orchestras are in their subscription
series season. And it's an enormous undertaking; we're flying
musicians from all over the country to San Diego, then flying them
together to La Paz, and there are visa issues and permit issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Plus, we have concerts in non-traditional concert spaces, such as
missions, where it's easier to do chamber music--we have a full
orchestra," she added. "In the case of Mission San Diego, we are
having to build out over the area where the pews are, and all this
has to be done in and out, in one day."</TE>
<TE>   Concerts began Thursday in La Paz. The event moved to Todos
Santos, another city in Baja California Sur, on Saturday. The music
groups will move on to Tijuana and Mexicali before coming to
California. California concerts begin in San Diego (Thursday), with a
concert by the new orchestra at Mission San Diego. The festival will
move on to San Gabriel (Friday), La Jolla (Saturday) and San Luis
Obispo (Feb.17).</TE>
<TE>   On the program for Orchestra of the Californias are four Mozart
selections and "Ocho Por Radio" by Mexican composer Silvestre
Revueltas. All five pieces will be performed at each concert. For
their festival concerts, Cuarteto Latinoamericano will perform
programs of Mexican waltzes.</TE>
<TE>   Festival organizers say that, in the future, the orchestra may
perform at various times throughout the year rather than making an
intensive tour, but they wanted to launch the new entity with a
concentrated effort. The quartet and the orchestra will not perform
together but they have a common goal: Besides enriching the community
via master classes given by the musicians and other community
activities, all proceeds will benefit local groups such as the La Paz
Youth Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the $300,000 festival will be provided by the
California Arts Council, the two Baja states, and private and
corporate contributions--including a lead gift of $150,000 from the
Barad Family Foundation. Jill Barad, former chief executive of Mattel
Inc., is honorary chairwoman of the festival and a member of the
Commission of the Californias, a cross-cultural organization with
members appointed by the governors of the three states. The
commission approached Mainly Mozart about producing the festival.</TE>
<TE>   The $300,000 will also cover the costs of master classes and
seminars by orchestra musicians, and instruments for youth
organizations in the cities they visit. Rudy Murillo, director of the
Commission of the Californias, said that was Barad's idea. "It's one
thing to tell kids to hear music and appreciate it, but then you
can't tell them they can't do it, and they can't do it without
instruments," Murillo said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that despite the state's economic problems, Gov. Gray
Davis has remained supportive of the commission's efforts. "He said:
'We've got a million excuses to do it next year [instead of now], but
go ahead and do it. We can't just stand here with our arms at our
sides,'" Murillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the Orchestra of the Californias and the
existing Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra is that concerts will be
affordably priced--concert tickets are $15 to $35, and most other
events are free--and all proceeds will benefit youth music groups
chosen by the communities the festival will visit. "It's a populist,
community event," Murillo said. "And the proceeds stay with the
community."</TE>
<TE>   In California, beneficiaries of the project include San Diego's
Community Council for Music in the Schools, the San Gabriel
Educational Foundation and San Luis Obispo County Youth Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the new instruments will be distributed in Baja California
and Baja California Sur, where the need is greatest, Murillo said.
Ireton, for one is happy that the La Paz Youth Orchestra will no
longer have to rely on the kindness of sailors to get the instruments
it needs.</TE>
<TE>   He's full of stories about the kids--including 14-year-old Leo,
who cannot hear or speak but now plays drums in the orchestra. Then
there's Charlie. "Gosh, we had Charlie yesterday, he took his first
flute lesson, first time ever," Ireton said. "To see his eyes, his
enthusiasm, and all the kids looking--an excitement happens, and they
all want to play instruments now.</TE>
<TE>   "We're poor people, it's a simple life, but boy, is it rewarding,"
he added. "I tell people I'm the highest paid person in La Paz."</TE>

<DH>Illuminating the genre and its roots, the Country Music
Hall of Fame and Museum rightly emphasizes creativity, not hits.</DH>

<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The $37-million Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, which
celebrates its first anniversary this spring, devotes more than
50,000 square feet to the colorful history of country music, but
nothing illustrates that story more vividly than a single sheet of
Chaves County, N.M., courthouse stationery.</LD>
<LD>   Showcased in a crowded display case near the front of the downtown
museum's exhibition area, the 1947 handwritten letter is from a
promising honky-tonk singer named Lefty Frizzell to his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Just 19, the Texan was starting to make a name for himself with
regular appearances at the Cactus Garden club in Roswell, N.M., where
crowds cheered the distinctive vocal style that would make him
arguably the most influential singer in country music.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than adopting the smooth delivery of most country singers
before him, Frizzell frequently extended notes or exaggerated certain
syllables to highlight the tenderness or celebration of his songs.
Almost every superior country singer since, from Merle Haggard and
Willie Nelson to Randy Travis and George Strait, echoes Frizzell's
style.</TE>
<TE>   But the young singer had to put his dreams on hold in a Roswell
jail, where he served six months for statutory rape. In the biography
"The Honky-Tonk Life of Country Music's Greatest Singer," author
Daniel Cooper reports that the teenager was filled with guilt,
pouring his heart out in a series of letters to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Those letters frequently included poems or song lyrics pledging
his love and pleading with his wife not to leave him. In the one on
display, the lyrics begin, "I love you, I'll prove it in days to
come. I swear it's true. Darling, you're the only one."</TE>
<TE>   He titled the song "I Love You a Thousand Ways," and it was the
first tune he recorded when he went into a Dallas studio nearly three
years later to kick off his contract with Columbia Records. Within
four months, the song was No. 1 in the country market.</TE>
<TE>   Like many country music performers at the time, Frizzell had no
formal musical training, and it's unlikely he even knew how to read
music. But he was able to express what was in his heart--and that
gift, to this day, is the underlying magic of the most memorable
country music.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is
that it honors that simple truth.</TE>
<TE>   Much the way some young rock fans in the late '70s thought Paul
McCartney's first band was Wings, many youthful country fans may
believe the genre started with Garth Brooks. The museum wastes little
time correcting that misconception.</TE>
<TE>   As you walk along a path that stretches a long city block down one
side of the building's interior and then back along the opposite
wall, exhibits trace the evolution of the music, starting with the
folk songs and fiddle tunes of the nation's early settlers.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining display cases and photos salute technological
developments such as radio and recording, which helped spread the
music beyond its original rural, Southern base, and the music's
various subgenres, from bluegrass and western swing to honky-tonk and
rockabilly. There's also a strong multimedia component, allowing you
to listen to rare old singles or watch highlights of country stars'
TV appearances over the years.</TE>
<TE>   But the heart of the exhibition space is the stories of the
performers themselves, often highlighted by choice pieces of
memorabilia, including vintage guitars, colorful stage costumes or
such entertaining sidelights as Elvis Presley's lavish, gold-colored
'60s Cadillac, complete with a TV set in the back.</TE>
<TE>   The parade of stars starts with such seminal figures as the Carter
Family, the trio from Clinch Mountain, Va., whose recordings of such
songs as "Keep on the Sunny Side" and "Thinking Tonight of My Blue
Eyes" bridged the gap between folk music and commercial country, and
Jimmie Rodgers, the Singing Brakeman, whose mix of country and blues
has influenced everyone from Johnny Cash to Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeding along the walkway, you come across so many other
figures, from Bob Wills and Bill Monroe through Hank Williams and
Merle Haggard, that you begin to think everyone who ever stepped up
to a microphone is going to be saluted. Displays personalize the
stories with such fascinating items as Williams' handwritten original
lyrics to "Your Cheatin' Heart" and a 1971 letter from California
Gov. Ronald Reagan pardoning Haggard for 1958 a conviction for
burglary and jail escape charges.</TE>
<TE>   But there is room for only a fraction of the more than 2,000
artists who have scored country hits--and the museum staff has shown
excellent judgment in deciding which to include.</TE>
<TE>   The staff leans wisely toward a liberal interpretation of the term
"country music," toasting several "outsiders," including Bob Dylan
and Ray Charles, who made invaluable contributions by helping break
down arbitrary boundaries between country music and other pop styles.</TE>
<TE>   The staff also values creative contribution over hits. That's why
exhibit space is devoted to Gram Parsons, the country-rock pioneer
who made some of the greatest country music of the late '60s and
early '70s but never made the sales charts, and none to Sonny James,
a pleasant but undistinguished singer who had 16 consecutive No. 1
country hits during roughly the same era.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the celebration of the singer in country music, the
heart of the music rests with the songwriters who, like Frizzell and
Williams, captured the highs and lows of the human experience with
such engaging honesty.</TE>
<TE>   It's fun to stroll through the hall of fame section of the museum
and watch fans read plaques of the dozens of figures who have been
inducted.</TE>
<TE>   Fans tend to head first for the big names--the Presleys and the
Johnny Cashes and the Dolly Partons. As they slowly move around the
room, however, they pause at unfamiliar names and discover that many
of these writers were responsible for some of their favorite songs.</TE>
<TE>   There's Jimmie Davis, the former governor of Louisiana who wrote
"You Are My Sunshine." And Harlan Howard, who is considered the dean
of Nashville writers because of such hits as "Busted" and "I Fall to
Pieces." And Don Gibson, whose remarkable string of hits in the '50s
was highlighted by "I Can't Stop Loving You" and "Oh Lonesome Me."</TE>
<TE>   The museum doesn't have letters telling the story behind every
song, but you can tell from the drama of each lyric that there is a
real story to be told.</TE>
<TE>   The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum opened last May, but its
tradition goes back to 1967, when the original hall of fame opened a
few blocks away on Music Row, the business core of the country music
world where streets are named after two hall of fame members, Chet
Atkins and Roy Acuff.</TE>
<TE>   Even in those original, cramped quarters, the museum, under the
leadership of Country Music Foundation director Bill Ivey, did an
admirable job of championing country music tradition rather than
overreacting to the latest commercial shifts in the genre.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this stance, which included extensive research and
public education programs, many of country music's most respected
figures have participated in workshops and served on the museum's
board of directors. Marty Stuart is president of the board, and Vince
Gill, Emmylou Harris and Kathy Mattea serve in various capacities.</TE>
<TE>   The new building is one of the key pieces in a billion-dollar
downtown entertainment district that includes the homes of the
Predators hockey team, the Titans football team, the First Center for
the Visual Arts and the new Public Library of Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Tuck Hinton Architects, the building reflects many
aspects of country music history on its exterior, from a mock radio
tower to reminders of such persistent lyrical themes as trains and
prison windows. Ralph Applebaum, whose work includes the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, was the exhibition designer.</TE>
<TE>   When Ivey was named chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts by President Clinton in 1998, Kyle Young took over as director.
Young, whose first job 27 years ago at the museum was selling
tickets, is a passionate spokesman for the museum and for country
music.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a big advantage over other music museums because
so many of the artists live here and want to be involved," Young
says, sitting in his office on a recent morning.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been extremely generous, not just in terms of donating
memorabilia, but participating in educational programs at the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "From the early days of planning the museum, we gathered curators
and historians around a table to decide how to make sure we are being
true to the music, and there were some knockdown drag-outs. That
still goes on and that passion's good. Everyone sees the museum as a
trust."</TE>

<HD>Just a Dreamer Describing His World</HD>
<DH>Painter Tom Knechtel's hodgepodge images draw on disparate
art styles to tell little erotic and whimsical tales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Knechtel has the vague air of a European professor with his
tossed-about hair, rumpled clothes and generous girth. His sentences
lilt upwards, making him sound as though he is perpetually speaking
in interrogatory mode. He is articulate, cheery, and not at all the
sort that one might think of as, well, preoccupied with sex.</LD>
<LD>   The artist, 49, gives out a Rabelaisian guffaw when the topic is
broached. Among the myriad fantastical images that populate his
paintings, things erotic or at least suggestive are constantly making
cameo appearances. Knechtel says, "People feel surprised by the sex.
I don't use it to get attention. It is part of my language of
describing the world."</LD>
<LD>   Knechtel employs the refined color and lapidary detail of Indian
miniature painting, the flattened perspective of Asian and medieval
art, and the draftsmanship of the Renaissance masters to concoct his
own garden of earthly delights. The resulting paintings are
stream-of-consciousness dreamscapes.</LD>
<TE>   The combination of his technical gifts and his paintings'
outrageous surreality has garnered popularity with curators,
collectors and critics. Michael Darling wrote in the New Art
Examiner, "In his jewel-like passages of brilliant animals, humans,
and imagined characters, Knechtel assembles a hodgepodge of
unsanctioned activities that seek to expose the ignored dark side
present but obscured in us all."</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel's recent works--most of them already spoken for by a
waiting list of fans--go on view Wednesday at Grant Selwyn Gallery in
Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "On Wanting to Grow Horns," a mid-career survey of his work, from
1979 to 2001, is on view April 21 to July 14 at the Weatherspoon Art
Gallery at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Organized
by Anne Ayres, director of the Ben Maltz Gallery at Los Angeles' Otis
College of Art and Design, it comes to that institution in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "He is inevitably seen as an idiosyncratic voice within the West
Coast Surrealist tradition," she says, "but more fruitfully, he could
be viewed as a sophisticated and quintessential artist of Postmodern
abundance. I see his paintings as open-ended dramas of desire,
melancholy, skepticism and, not the least, laughter."</TE>
<TE>   One of the drawings meant for the Grant Selwyn show hangs on a
studio wall at his modest Atwater home: a self-portrait of the
artist, tummy protruding, sprawled on an armchair wearing large
glasses and staring, world weary, at thought bubbles floating away.
He's nude, and a certain private body part has been rendered as a
sapling putting forth leaves.</TE>
<TE>   But most of his works are much more mysterious. A large, magenta
painting, "A Mare's Nest," portrays a beefy, middle-aged man who is
naked but for the stays of a formal skirt. Knechtel says, "Rather
than perfect fantasy bodies, I became more interested in my body and
the bodies of men I knew. He has the quality of an Everyman."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the nakedness of the subject's body, the head is
wreathed in tiny images painted with the most painstaking care: the
side streets of Los Angeles, fairy-tale characters, wasps and birds
with fruit, goats wearing jewels, and many male wrestlers.</TE>
<TE>   Above the man's head hovers a world that is even more condensed
and crowded with random scenes, including an urn splashing what
Knechtel explains is green perfume into the man's teacup. A singing
man pulls his skirts apart suggestively; various booths sell ice
cream. There is a temple with animated guardian dogs and a tailor
shop at the side where a skirt is being sewn. A scruffy crow at the
bottom of the painting appears to be telling the whole story in a
maze of delicate lines.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel explains, "I wanted all that highly colored
promiscuousness to be the world that holds onto the man and suggests
experiences that he is not able to absorb. 'Mare's-nest' is an
old-fashioned term for something that is purported to be wonderful
but evaporates upon further examination."</TE>
<TE>   Little visual stories proliferate all around the canvas, but there
is no singular narrative thread. A viewer is left to muse and wonder,
just as the painter had done.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what a painting is about when I start," Knechtel
says. "As I'm working, it changes as meaning accumulates."</TE>
<TE>   It is time-consuming to take in Knechtel's painting, and a
magnifying glass would not be amiss. They are time-consuming to
produce, as well. "The Mare's Nest" took a year and a half to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, with all the Lilliputian figures and activities, the act
of viewing feels somewhat akin to the process of reading. The artist,
who has read Dante's "The Divine Comedy" in all of its various
English translations, is passionate about literature. A few years
ago, he painted his self-portrait as a middle-aged Scheherazade,
spinning tales of personal fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in the work having the same quality as the way I
think," he adds. "Contradictory, with many points of view at once,
many stories and ideas banging up against each other. I don't think
of my work as allegorical."</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel's work has much in common with the artists who were his
earliest influences, including William Blake and Hieronymus Bosch.
"They are the epitome of artists who go into their own universes and
make their own languages," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Knechtel's art is rooted in his first love, which was
theater. As a child growing up in the Northern California town of
Mountain View, he made his own stuffed animals. They were given roles
in stories that he composed and staged.</TE>
<TE>   His father, an engineer for NASA, and his mother, a housewife,
were charmed by his youthful talent. They were patient with him when
he refused to take his SATs because he said Blake wouldn't have taken
them. He told his parents that instead of going to college, he would
open a store and sell his toys. They agreed to this plan, so, after
high school graduation in 1970, Knechtel went into business. By
August, he was bankrupt. In September, he enrolled at the local
junior college, where he took his first art course.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years later, his mother read an article about CalArts.
The then-fledgling college required no SATs or grades; students were
admitted strictly on the basis of their portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel sent the college his journal of drawings and paintings,
and was admitted in 1972, "knowing absolutely nothing about art," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Knechtel created miniature theaters, but a teacher told
him, "You either need to learn to draw or learn to make this ugly
stuff look interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Given his talent as a draftsman today, it is surprising to hear
that Knechtel didn't learn to draw until college.</TE>
<TE>   He used Renaissance art as his model, and began creating realistic
yet dreamy pictures of figures and animals, often in juxtaposition,
which can be seen as forerunners of his work today.</TE>
<TE>   For Knechtel, who was open about his homosexuality, the school's
Feminist Art Program was an important influence because of "its
emphasis on the personal and finding one's own language to express
experience." At the time, it was out of fashion to paint in the
figurative mode, but teachers in the Feminist Art Program refuted
such restrictions. "They gave us permission to find our own path," he
recalls. "A sense of how you have to keep rethinking your work helped
my drawing tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   After earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts in
1976, Knechtel took a break from art. He worked for a year and a half
cleaning houses, saved money and then left for a seven-month tour of
Europe. His first in-depth experience of the Italian Quattrocento
artists and those of the Northern Renaissance proved invaluable. "It
made me more aware of the real presence of a real work of art," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to live in San Francisco in 1978 and returned to
making drawings, but he felt L.A. to be a more supportive art
community, and he moved here in 1980. Once in L.A., he was inspired
by the success of artist friends such as Lari Pittman and Roy Dowell,
whom he knew from CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   Having mastered drawing and watercolor, he moved on to the
demanding medium of oil paint. For several years, he struggled to
find a balance between his love of detail and line and the challenge
of organizing the space of a large canvas.</TE>
<TE>   He turned to Indian, Japanese and medieval art and its creative
use of flattened perspective. "Art made before the invention of
perspective seems more appealing to me," he says. "Western space
feels like a straitjacket."</TE>
<TE>   (In 1994, this integration of the Eastern aesthetics and Western
talent would earn him a fellowship from the J. Paul Getty Trust. He
traveled to Japan to study Kabuki and India to study Kathakali
theater.)</TE>
<TE>   Although he taught at various art colleges, he has found it less
stressful to work full-time designing ads for LA Weekly. Yet he is
disciplined about using his free days to paint: "I feel like I have
to make meaning while I'm here in the studio."</TE>
<TE>   By the late '80s, he had had exhibitions at various L.A. galleries
and was shown in New York as well. In 2000, his first museum show,
"'The Infant Griffin' and Other Recent Drawings," went up at the
Contemporary Arts Forum in Santa Barbara, and he linked up with Grant
Selwyn last year.</TE>
<TE>   As he has gained confidence, his paintings have grown in
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt there were too many generalizations in my work," Knechtel
says, "and I began gradually to name my experiences more
specifically. Not just sex but more humor, more vulgarity, more the
way my thinking works. Part of my feeling was that in order to
describe what it was like to be in my skin, I had to say what my
sexuality was."</TE>
<TE>   Pausing for emphasis, he says, "A gay person looks at heterosexual
art and translates. If I explain my experience honestly, it seems
there is more chance that another person will be able to respond
honestly."</TE>

<LD>I was pleased to see a cover story on Ryan Adams, one of my favorite
artists ("All Heart and Guitar," by Robert Hilburn, Feb. 3). Adams is
an encouraging reminder of why I love pop music: sheer sonic
exuberance. I, for one, will be lining up for the four albums Adams
is reportedly juggling.</LD>
<LD>   I liked the piece so much I won't mention that the terrific second
album from Whiskeytown is actually called "Strangers Almanac," not
"Perfect Strangers" or that the title of the opener from
"Heartbreaker" is "To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)." It
would just be nit-picking.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I happened to see Ryan Adams a few months ago at a small theater
here in Denver, the night after he appeared on "Saturday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   Adams put on an incredible show--at one point, he even made up a
song on the spot, about his beloved guitar that had been smashed by
the airline en route to Denver. The comparisons to Bob Dylan, I
think, are appropriate; certainly Dylan was just as prolific back in
his glory--in the mid- to late 1960s, when albums came out every six
months instead of every two years.</TE>
<TE>   DAVID HILL</TE>
<TE>   Denver</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hilburn's adulation notwithstanding, there are attributes other
than prolificacy, derivativeness and self-referential rock star
posturing that can--and should be--considered when one heaps praise
on a singer-songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   Emotional depth, lyric inventiveness and innovative song structure
would be a few traits that Adams would seem to lack--unless he's busy
telling you otherwise--by virtually any standard other than the "at
least he's not Smashmouth" variety.</TE>
<TE>   There are literally hundreds of singer-songwriters across this
country whose work transcends anything Adams has accomplished with
Whiskeytown or on his own, yet virtually every single article I read
that heaps praise on Adams always focuses on his prolific output and
his "throwback" songwriting style.</TE>
<TE>   Adams also enjoys reminding everyone how "punk" he once was. I've
lived in North Carolina since 1994, seen Whiskeytown on several
occasions, and never saw anything remotely "punk" in their shows,
unless you consider forgetting the words and song key "punk." His
vaunted temper tantrums always rang false and came across as the
whinings of a spoiled brat rather than the artistic pangs of the
truly creative.</TE>

<LD>I had the pleasure of working with Poncho Sanchez a few years ago
when I was an indie rep for his label at the time, Concord Jazz ("He
May Be the King, but He Shuns the Crown," by Agustin Gurza, Feb. 3).
My first assignment with him was at an appearance at the Tower
Records on Sunset on a rainy night. He was supposed to be supported
by other band members, but they got stuck in traffic, so Sanchez had
to entertain a store full of people on his own.</LD>
<LD>   Being a musician in this town for over 30 years myself, I worried
how Sanchez would be able to pull this off. (Ever try entertaining a
crowd with just a set of congas? If you're not a comedian, you're in
big trouble.) He proceeded to do just that--playing and talking to
the crowd, giving impromptu conga lessons to volunteers, and winning
them over with his humility, humor and musicianship. Sanchez's
command of his instrument is obvious to anyone who comes within
earshot.</LD>
<LD>   Still an inspiring figure to me, he is above and beyond the
criticism and stereotyping of the "king of Latin jazz." To me, a
white, 49-year-old songwriter of rock and pop and admirer of all
kinds of music, Poncho Sanchez is a master musician, and master
musicians know no boundaries.</LD>
<TE>   BOB BELAND</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gurza's article offered an interesting look at how fractured the
Latin music world really is. We have grown up with Mongo Santamaria
and Cal Tjader, and in fact years ago I interviewed Sanchez when he
was playing with keyboard great Clare Fischer here in Hollywood for
the now-defunct Goodphone magazine (1980).</TE>
<TE>   What Sanchez does is carry on a tradition of Latin jazz in the old
Tjader tradition with a lot of pluses.</TE>
<TE>   Those who complain about Sanchez should look in the mirror and ask
where their careers are. One need only look at Larry Harlow, one of
the world's greatest salsa pianists, and complain, "But he's Jewish!"
That doesn't detract from his playing, does it?</TE>

<LD>Elizabeth Jensen's piece on cable news organizations' marquee-name
buying spree misses the dispiriting central issue that TV news
deficiencies are systemic in an approach that tries to be all things
to all people ("News Still Counts at CNN. So Do Stars," Feb. 3).</LD>
<LD>   Most TV news anchors and reporters at cable network and local
levels haven't the journalistic skills to hold down a job at a
third-rate newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Anchors, and some reporters, have become overpaid celebrities;
that celebrity invariably affects the content and integrity of the
stories they cover.</LD>
<TE>   The news suffers from a constant tug-of-war between the "word
people" and the "picture people"; stories are filtered through so
many hands that accuracy and focus are often sacrificed on the altar
of career-advancing slickness. Then there are those misspelled
captions and mispronounced words and names.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the images that accompany TV news stories are irrelevant
to the stories being told.</TE>
<TE>   Airline-safety stories are invariably accompanied by stock shots
of jets taking off or landing. Pieces about everything from AIDS
research to work on the Human Genome Project feature
indistinguishable scenes of lab-coated technicians manipulating test
tubes and spectral analyzers. This generic footage could be of
researchers looking into new ways of decaffeinating coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Like local news operations, the cable networks structure their
telecasts around anchor teams, apparently to ensure that they appeal
to the broadest possible demographic, ignoring the sad truth that the
choreographed banter among the teamed participants looks ludicrous
and serves no journalistic purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Will television news operations ever abandon the path of least
resistance? No, not until TV news no longer has to worship at the
altar of the implacable ratings gods, surely as corrupting an
influence as soft money is to politics.</TE>

<LD>I stopped reading movie reviews a few years ago because more than
once, too much was revealed for me in advance. Now, it looks as if I
might have to avoid articles that give away too much in a caption.
Some readers might want to stop here.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Natale's article ("Embracing Parents' Pain," Feb. 3) had
the sub-headline: "From 'In the Bedroom' to 'Monster's Ball,' a spate
of films about the once-taboo topic of a child's death explores
families' complex reactions."</LD>
<LD>   I saw "Monster's Ball," and the child's death did not occur until
about one-third of the way through the film.</LD>
<TE>   Now, sadly, I know a major plot point in the other three films,
thus spoiling the moviegoing experience for me and probably others.</TE>

<DH>The team behind 'Super Troopers' piles into the bus for an
extended tour of colleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Milling around a food court in UCLA's Ackerman Union, the five
members of the comedy troupe Broken Lizard--Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin
Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Eric Stolhanske--could easily
be mistaken for graduate students taking a smoothie break. Instead
they are waiting for the end of a screening of "Super Troopers," a
film they have written, directed and starred in, so they can field
questions from the college audience.</LD>
<LD>   On the fifth day of a 37-day tour that will take them to 24
colleges from Seattle to New York, they are all in good spirits,
excited about the trip and the nationwide release of their Fox
Searchlight film on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   After patiently talking one-on-one with audience members, signing
some free posters and answering more questions, they will pile into a
tour bus with their likenesses on the sides and ride all night to the
next day's appearance in Phoenix. It's like a rock tour--without the
rock stars or the groupies or the roadies.</LD>
<TE>   Their driver proudly recalls such previous passengers as the
Allman Brothers and the Doobie Brothers. The tour manager has a
leather jacket and a British accent.</TE>
<TE>   The Spinal Tap jokes are not lost on anyone.</TE>
<TE>   They've traveled a long distance from their first film, the 1996
indie comedy "Puddle Cruiser," which they booked and promoted on
their own at colleges around the Northeast. One of the stops was
Colgate University in upstate New York, where the group was formed in
1989. Unable to secure distribution even after successful screenings
at the Sundance Film Festival, they hoped the tour would both raise
awareness and maybe make a little money back for the private
investors who financed the $250,000 picture.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the two tours, Stolhanske jokes, "The big difference is
the bus. Last time we were all stuffed into a Winnebago and did the
driving, which is probably how we ended up in a frozen Vermont
ditch."</TE>
<TE>   "We also had to set up our own press," recalls Soter. "Now there's
TV ads, radio ads, print ads. It's just bigger."</TE>
<TE>   "The last one we couldn't get enough schools to take us," laments
Lemme. "By the time we knew what we were doing, it was over."</TE>
<TE>   So when it came time to make another film, they pursued studio
financing with the assistance of Jersey Shore, the specialized arm of
the Jersey Films production company, which originally saw the project
as a possible TV show.</TE>
<TE>   But when that fell through, they again turned to private
financing.</TE>
<TE>   A college friend, whom they refer to only as Cricket, introduced
them to her father, a retiring investment banker interested in
pursuing film finance. He provided the $1.3-million budget for "Super
Troopers."</TE>
<TE>   "We went in to studios and said we want to make this movie, we're
going to star in it, he's going to direct it, give us the money, and
we'll make it," Heffernan recalls. "And they'd just laugh, like who
are you? So ultimately we had to go do it ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Soter, "But the association with Jersey helped to put a more
legitimate tag on the project for casting. And the investor certainly
felt more comfortable because of it."</TE>
<TE>   For Fox Searchlight, which paid $3.25 million for distribution
rights after a midnight screening at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival,
the tour is no laughing matter. Although "Super Troopers" is a broad
comedy about a bumbling band of small-town cops without
Farrelly-style gross-outs or "American Pie"-style raciness, its R
rating precludes marketing the film to anyone younger than 17. (The R
rating is for language, sexual content and drug use.)</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the 17-to-25 age bracket as the film's primary target.
Additionally, according to Fox Searchlight's marketing president,
Nancy Utley, reaching that age group requires that the film open wide
on more than 1,000 screens, an extremely large number for a
relatively small film.</TE>
<TE>   After a post-Sundance marketing meeting, where the Broken Lizard
team related their college tour experiences with "Puddle Cruiser," it
was decided to use the same tactic with "Super Troopers."</TE>
<TE>   Although sneak preview screenings on college campuses around the
country are not uncommon, and directors or actors sometimes drop by
schools in major markets--DreamWorks did this for "American Beauty"
(1999) and Woody Allen often does so for his films--an outing of this
scope is unusual.</TE>
<TE>   The group ethos of Broken Lizard was at least partly responsible
for making the tour a possibility, as the logistics of getting the
creative team together for such an extended period would normally
make the idea cost prohibitive and unworkable. With the troupe
performing its sketch comedy routines before the movie and answering
questions afterward, the tour could be a return to old-time
roadshows, but with a decidedly computer-age twist.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we're attracted to this idea," Utley says, "is really
because of the Internet. College people in particular are on the
Internet constantly, and we thought it would be great to see if word
of mouth can snowball by touring the guys and having the college kids
tell each other about the movie through the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the tour's only real drawback is that there is no real way
to measure its success as a promotional tool.</TE>
<TE>   "It's uncharted territory," Utley says. "The whole cost of the
tour, including the bus, hotels, food and so on, is less than half
the cost of a 30-second prime-time TV spot. I have to believe
exposing the movie in person to thousands of college students across
the country is going to be more effective than one TV spot. And if
the movie opens well and is successful, we'll have to attribute part
of that success to the tour."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to meet people," Stolhanske says. "You actually
talk to people and connect with them, so they take away something
more. It's great exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Finishing the thought, Heffernan adds, "It lets students feel
they're part of something fun and underground, which makes it seem
more worth their while."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping in mind what Heffernan refers to as their "comedy
franchise," all five are also pursuing outside projects. Stolhanske
recently filmed a part on the popular HBO series "Six Feet Under,"
and Heffernan, Lemme and Soter are developing a script with Fox
Searchlight. All the members of the troupe appear in the movie and
share writing credit.</TE>
<TE>   It is Chandrasekhar, though, who seems the furthest on his way to
forging a career outside the fold. Besides officially directing the
two Broken Lizard features, Chandrasekhar has directed episodes of
the Fox TV show "Undeclared" and was recently tapped by Nike to shoot
a series of Olympic tie-in spots with Charles Barkley and Marion
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   He acts surprisingly blase about his status as an up-and-coming
director, genuinely preferring to focus instead on the future of the
group. "It's not that I don't care about anything else," he says.
"But we've got five finished scripts. If we're lucky and people go to
our movie, we could make another seven or eight films together,
ideally one a year. And that would take up most of our time. Right
now I'm happy just making movies with these guys."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Chandrasekhar is perfectly clear on what he does
not want to do. "I haven't had to punch the clock yet in this job,
and I don't look forward to the day when that happens. Everybody has
a cold streak and takes some lousy job, but I won't direct a
multi-camera sitcom with a laugh track. I'd rather not work in show
business."</TE>
<TE>   Chandrasekhar takes his comedy very seriously. "When people
compliment us, they say, 'That movie was so stupid, it was awesome!'
They probably don't realize we wrote 25 drafts of the script. Every
moment is crafted so that hopefully it's stupid in the smartest way."</TE>
<TE>   He mentions with pride that he was able to bring in George Folsey,
editor of the John Landis-John Belushi films "The Blues Brothers" and
"Animal House," to help edit a few minutes from "Super Troopers" for
its theatrical release.</TE>
<TE>   "What is so great about those Landis films, and what we're trying
to do," he says, placing special emphasis on the word "trying," "was
to make a great film that's really funny."</TE>

<HD>Once More Into the Woods</HD>
<DH>Even as he revisits his fairy-tale musical for L.A.,
Stephen Sondheim's creative tug pulls his thoughts forward.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On the ground floor of his plush, five-story Turtle Bay townhouse,
next door to one owned by Katharine Hepburn, Stephen Sondheim relaxes
on his couch, with a drink, in his slippers. He is talking at the
moment about "uplift songs," a subcategory of show tune for which he
is not best known.</LD>
<LD>   His innately mixed feelings on the subject of stirring,
pulse-pounding anthems in the vein of "Climb Every Mountain" or
"You'll Never Walk Alone" are clear in the way the phrase "uplift
songs" slips out of the side of his mouth, quickly. Like an olive
pit.</LD>
<LD>   Sondheim has written a few uplift songs in his day, depending on
the needs of the show ("Being Alive" from "Company") and the mood of
its characters ("You're Gonna Love Tomorrow," ironically deployed in
"Follies"). Such deceptively optimistic tunes coming from the
famously mordant composer and lyricist, however, tend not to sound
like Jerry "Hello, Dolly!" Herman's uplift. Or anybody else's.</LD>
<TE>   With Sondheim, who has spent fruitful decade after decade giving
melody and voice to the contradiction, complexity and yearning in his
subjects, reassurance usually carries a reminder that things can
change in a world with, as one Sondheim lyric has it, so little to be
sure of.</TE>
<TE>   One of Sondheim's few true Broadway popular successes, the
multifarious fairy-tale saga "Into the Woods," has become one of the
last quarter-century's more visible and widely produced musicals. A
Broadway-bound revival opens today at the Ahmanson Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Washington, D.C.'s Kennedy Center launches a "Sondheim
Celebration" composed of major revivals of "Merrily We Roll Along,"
"Sweeney Todd," "A Little Night Music," "Company," "Passion" and
"Sunday in the Park With George." Continuing through the summer, it
also includes a Japanese-language production of "Pacific Overtures"
and a one-act children's version of "Into the Woods."</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make anyone feel appreciated. Seventy-one next
month, Sondheim can look back at a lifetime of musicals that, in most
cases, in one way or another, mattered like no one else's.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for any front-rank artist, it's the next project that nags and
cajoles. And for months now, Sondheim hasn't been able to get to
second base on the long, long awaited project, originally called
"Wise Guys."</TE>
<TE>   Until Feb. 1, the new show, lately retitled "Gold!" but due for
one more title change, found Sondheim and librettist John Weidman
("Pacific Overtures" and "Assassins," as well as the non-Sondheim
"Contact") in a heated legal dispute with Hollywood and Broadway
producer Scott Rudin over who holds the commercial rights to the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the matter is resolved, the world is likely to get its
first new Sondheim musical since "Passion" in 1994. "Gold!" also
marks a reunion of Sondheim and director Harold Prince: They last
collaborated on "Merrily We Roll Along" 20 years ago. "Gold!" is
about the once-notorious Mizner Brothers--one an architect, the other
a con man--whose pursuit of the American Dream, Sondheim says,
represents a chance to "do a romp through history."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the focus is on "Into the Woods," written by Sondheim
and librettist-director James Lapine in the mid-'80s, when the Reagan
revolution was in full force.</TE>
<TE>   The show features various Grimm brothers transplants--Cinderella,
Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the giant--occupying the
same once-upon-a-time landscape. To these, Lapine adds a baker and
his wife longing for a child, plagued by the witch next door. This
enchantress, played in the revival by Vanessa Williams, has put a
curse on the baker's house. She promises to lift it only if four
things come her way: a cow as white as milk; a cape as red as blood;
hair as yellow as corn; and a slipper as pure as gold.</TE>
<TE>   How these items are found, whose fates they affect and what
deceptions are practiced by whom leads "Into the Woods" to a happy
ending. For Act 1, that is. In Act 2, the widow of a slain giant (the
one relating to Jack and the beanstalk) seeks revenge. Wishes granted
begin to curdle.</TE>
<TE>   The second act, Sondheim says, "deals with the consequences of the
first. It's about transgression, about people who in their own little
selfish ways cause a holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   And then comes the show's most comforting song, "No One Is Alone."
Too simple, some say--comforting in a facile way.  Yet the song, free
of bombast, an uplifter with integrity, regularly reduces audiences
to tears. When the Broadway-bound revival of "Into the Woods," now in
previews at the Ahmanson, opens at the Broadhurst Theatre in
Manhattan on April 29, it's a good bet that New York City
theatergoers--in varying states of post-Sept. 11 anxiety--will react
more strongly than ever to Sondheim's lyrics:</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes people leave you</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the wood.</TE>
<TE>   Do not let it grieve you.</TE>
<TE>   No one leaves for good.</TE>
<TE>   You are not alone.</TE>
<TE>   No one is alone.</TE>
<TE>   Reviving and revising "Into the Woods," meantime, wasn't
Sondheim's idea. "It was James'," Sondheim says of Lapine, Sondheim's
collaborator on "Sunday in the Park With George" (about pointillist
painter Georges Seurat) and "Passion" (inspired by the film "Passion
d'Amore") as well as "Into the Woods."</TE>
<TE>   True to the librettist's lot in life and in show biz, Lapine's
isn't the name most closely associated with "Into the Woods."
Sondheim's name is, because Sondheim is Sondheim is Sondheim. He is
the American musical theater's greatest living composer-lyricist, not
to mention Broadway's most venerated songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   The revival promises a new look, fancy new special effects and a
more physically sprightly staging than the 1987 original. (The
choreographer is John Carrafa, hot off "Urinetown.") The song "Our
Little World," sung by the witch and Rapunzel in the show's London
incarnation, has been interpolated. So have smaller bits--there's a
second wolf, for example, and a brief appearance by the Three Little
Pigs. Sondheim is tweaking a lyric or two in "The Last Midnight," and
Lapine is trying out a new line or two for, among others, the
narrator, here played by John McMartin, an alum of the original
Broadway production of "Follies."</TE>
<TE>   For this collision of fairy tales, Sondheim says he wanted a sound
owing equal parts to Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat" and to Carl
Stalling, the man behind the ditties skipping through so many Warner
Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it jaunty and recognizable and rhythmically jolly,"
Sondheim says. "And square, in a way. Square always implies dull, but
I think of square in the sense of traditional. Traditional, but with
some spice and spikiness in the harmonies."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations, echoing Czech composer Leos
Janacek's tart, stringy "Fairy Tale" as well as larger-scale
influences, have been retained here, with a few changes, under the
eye of musical director Paul Gemignani. En route to Broadway the
first time, "Into the Woods" tried out 15 years ago at San Diego's
Old Globe Theatre, now known as the Globe Theatres. Sondheim's memory
of the tryout?</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Kay McLelland [one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters]
falling into the trap door on stage, and Chuck Wagner [a prince]
grabbing her just in time. Very scary. And I remember writing 'No One
Is Alone' out there and playing it for everybody for the first time."
The song, he once said, sticks with people for elemental reasons:
"It's the simplest tune in terms of the fewest number of notes. And
it's sung three times."</TE>
<TE>   The title, he believes, has made the song a thing misunderstood.
It's not simply a we'll-be-fine number, he says, it's a reminder that
everyone's actions affect someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Lapine acknowledges that many people's initial response to an
"Into the Woods" revival was that it might be too soon. Gordon
Davidson, whose Center Theatre Group is assisting Dodger Theatricals
in getting the show up and running again, says with a chuckle that
"when the question was first raised about doing it, I thought: Didn't
we just see this?" The original Broadway tour played the Ahmanson in
1989. "But James had terrific new ideas for it."</TE>
<TE>   Gemignani says that "what this show will say and mean to people in
New York after going through Sept. 11 ... well, let's just say it's
perfect timing, in a way."</TE>
<TE>   Not too much of that talk for Sondheim. "For me it's exactly the
same show, before 9/11 or after. It's about people who do things that
lead to unfortunate consequences, and they don't think. It's about
selfish acts, and they're perennial.</TE>
<TE>   "If the show has any new resonance now, it's because people are
interpreting it that way."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Sondheim was about to leave his Connecticut house for
New York City "for 'Assassins' auditions, of all ironic things," he
says. (A planned revival of "Assassins," the Sondheim-John Weidman
musical about people who succeeded or failed in killing various U.S.
presidents, has been postponed in the wake of the terrorist attacks.)</TE>
<TE>   "Then a neighbor called and said to turn on the TV." Sondheim
pauses, briefly, at the memory. "Yep. Yep. Yep yep yep yep." The
memory isn't pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, he says, in the months following the destruction of the
World Trade Center towers, New York has "calmed down. But, you know,
it'll be scary on some level for a long time. Why wouldn't it be?
Something else is bound to happen.... New York's both vulnerable and
a showcase, if anybody wants to make a point."</TE>
<TE>   Truly, we are in excellent times for the justifiably paranoid.
It's enough to make anyone think, as Sondheim does, that "there are
always those moments when you think, oh, God, what am I writing for?"</TE>
<TE>   "But then," he says, "you live your life." As the song in "Sunday
in the Park With George" says: Move on.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to move on, of course, when faced with an $8-million
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Sondheim had been pondering a musical about the Mizner brothers
for decades. Addison Mizner made his name as an architect whose
Florida buildings helped define that state's sunbaked image during
the '20s land boom. Wilson Mizner was a scoundrel, a prospector,
boxing promoter, and eventually a screenwriter and playwright. Taken
together, the Miz- ners serve as complementary self-made American
swells. They were the spirit of vaudevillian energy, at once lowdown
and high-hat.</TE>
<TE>   Sondheim and Weidman began work on the show formerly known as
"Wise Guys" in the early 1990s. Plans for a premiere at the Kennedy
Center were postponed more than once.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, producer Rudin financed an off-Broadway workshop staging
of "Wise Guys"--with Nathan Lane and Victor Garber in the title
roles, and directed by Sam Mendes.</TE>
<TE>   Mendes was Mr. Hot, straight off his film directorial debut,
"American Beauty." But everyone wanted a different show, and no one
was very happy with the results.</TE>
<TE>   "It came out sentimental, and that's not what we meant," Sondheim
explains. "We meant it to be fast, funny and a kind of tumble through
America. And it turned out to be a sort of psychodrama about two boys
and their mother, and that wasn't at all what we wanted." Recent
rewrites, Sondheim says, have downplayed the mother figure and added
a major female role. In all, Sondheim estimates that only one-third
of the score heard in the 1999 workshop will remain.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Sondheim, Weidman and director Prince will hold a
reading of the work in progress in New York. After that, the creative
team may well commit to a full production at Chicago's Goodman
Theatre for either the 2002-03 season or the one after that.</TE>
<TE>   "Hal and Steve both want to feel the script's in good shape before
they commit to a production," says Goodman executive director Roche
Schulfer.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, when the Goodman announced the show, producer
Rudin threatened legal action. In December, Sondheim and Weidman sued
Rudin for $10 million and sought an injunction that would allow them
to proceed with the production in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin then filed an $8-million countersuit for breach of contract
and fraud. On Feb. 1, the sides came to an out-of-court settlement.
Rudin may make some money on an eventual Broadway production, but for
now, he's out of the picture. And since Prince came on board as
director, Sondheim says, the rewrites have been encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "Hal is galvanizing," he says. "To sit in a room with him and talk
about what you've written, or to play him stuff, just makes you want
to go home to the yellow pad. His energy and enthusiasm and
understanding is nonpareil. John and I are having a great time. Doing
'Pacific Overtures' with him [a quarter-century ago] was one of the
best experiences I ever had. I won't say it's unalloyed joy--that's
hyperbolic--but it's pretty close."</TE>
<TE>   It's a peculiar head trip for an artist: The show has been rolling
around in Sondheim's brain for decades, yet it'll be awhile before
anyone will ever get a look at a full staging. Meantime, the
15-year-old "Into the Woods" keeps going and going, and now it's
going back to a New York City very different from the one greeting it
in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Lapine says that "Into the Woods" has "always been a challenging
show tonally, in that we're trying to have fun in the first act
without it becoming so silly billy that it makes the events of the
second act unearned. That's tricky."</TE>
<TE>   For the end of this new "Into the Woods," Lapine has long
envisioned "a sort of cluttered stage with everybody cleaning it up.
I don't want to completely give away the moment. But right after
Sept. 11, I did think, 'Yikes, is this too much? Too obvious?' For
now, anyway, we're sticking with it."</TE>
<TE>   The changes, says Vanessa Williams, "make you feel like you're
working on an original show, even though this all started back in the
'80s." In the days before the first preview, Williams is ready and
eager to take on the show's technical challenges. "Forget about the
music," she says, laughing. "I need to make sure my levitation
device, my hydraulic foot lift [for scaling Rapunzel's tower],
doesn't kill me. And they're still tweaking the transformation scene,
when I float up and spin around."</TE>
<TE>   In the pre-technical-rehearsal days just weeks ago in New York,
the cast performed a bare-bones run-through that left the invited
audience in tears. "When you can make people cry like that," she
says, "that's a testament to the strength of the material. The show
will always hold up, no matter what time we're living in."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Sondheim flew out for previews. "It's really one of the
most beautiful shows I've seen in my life," he said of scenic
designer Douglas W. Schmidt's work. "It's really lush and wonderful
looking. And I don't think anyone will argue that."</TE>
<TE>   Back in December, Sondheim sussed out the reasons for this
musical's ongoing popularity. "The shows of mine most produced on the
college, stock and amateur circuits are those with plots, and lots of
good parts, like 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' and
this one ... they're just fun to perform."</TE>
<TE>   It's funny, Lapine says, relating a sorry-grateful moment
involving the man who wrote a song called "Sorry-Grateful." "I was
just going through a little family drama with my daughter over the
holidays, and then I went into the rehearsal room one day, and
suddenly I realized Steve's lyric hit me in a whole new way:
'Children may not obey, but children will listen.'</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, well, you know ... that's a good piece of advice."</TE>

<LD>An Oasis in the desert seems fitting. But how about an Icelandic
sprite? We'll find out in April when Oasis and Bjork take the
headlining slots on the third Coachella Music and Arts Festival in
Indio.</LD>
<LD>   Bjork will anchor the first night, April 27, in just her second
appearance at a U.S. festival. Oasis is set to close the weekend
April 28 in its only U.S. concert before the release of a new album
in the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Building on the tone set by the first two Coachella festivals, the
lineup will be a mix of rock, electronica and hip-hop. Others
confirmed for the outdoor marathon are the Foo Fighters, Mos Def, the
Chemical Brothers, the Prodigy, Ozomotli, B.R.M.C., Belle &amp;
Sebastian, Jurassic 5, Dilated Peoples, Queens of the Stone Age,
Basement Jaxx, Sasha &amp; Digweed, Paul Oakenfold, Groove Armada,
KRS-One, St. Germaine and Dutch DJ Tiesto.</LD>
<TE>   Tickets, at $65 per day, will be on sale March 2. A weekend pass
covering both days will also be available at a discount price to be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   That the festival is back at all, let alone for two days, is a
surprise to some. The inaugural two-day festival in October 1999 lost
the promoter, L.A.-based Goldenvoice, a lot of money, with a total
attendance of 40,000.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, the firm revived the concept with just one day,
headlined by Jane's Addiction, for a break-even 30,000 tickets. Since
then, other promoters' attempts to import successful festival
concepts from England last fall--Creamfields and Mecca--were
abandoned before they got off the ground, and changes in the economy
and global events have softened the concert market overall.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Coachella is back at two days, says Goldenvoice head
Paul Tollett, is that quality acts wanted to play it.</TE>
<TE>   "The first year was a leap of faith to confirm a show two hours
outside of Los Angeles," he says. "The second year was easier, but
still a lot of artists had never heard of the event. Now artists are
calling us saying, 'Save us a slot.' That's a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, goodwill seems to be Coachella's biggest asset.</TE>
<TE>   "The buzz about this show has been very positive," says Gary
Bongiovanni, editor in chief of concert business magazine Pollstar.
"The first year, even though they lost a fortune, it was voted by our
readers as the music festival of the year, which was surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Bongiovanni also points out that now Goldenvoice has better
financial resources. It was bought last year by mogul Phil Anschutz's
Concerts West firm.</TE>
<TE>   Tollett has made a few adjustments to the show this year, notably
reducing it from five stages to four.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard a lot from fans that there was a little too much going
on all at one time," he says. "And we've definitely increased the
comfort amenities. From e-mails we get, one thing people really
appreciate is comfort. If you can do that, people will stay longer
and come back the next day."</TE>
<TE>   ON THE ROAD: One thing that may help Coachella III is thin
competition. For the traveling rock festivals that have been regular
features of the summer rock season, 2002 is shaping up as the weakest
year in some time.</TE>
<TE>   Only Ozzfest, with System of a Down confirmed to join Ozzy
Osbourne at the top of the bill, and Warped, with Bad Religion, the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones and NOFX headlining, are definitely on. Moby
is expected to bring back the second edition of his Area tour, to be
called Area:Two, but details are far from set. And the William Morris
Agency is working on plans to revive Lollapalooza--the original
modern traveling rock fest--though no acts have been booked.</TE>
<TE>   Many acts that might be candidates for some of those events are
instead doing their own tours, including Incubus and a
Blink-182/Green Day teaming.</TE>
<TE>   The economic and logistical hurdles involved in mounting a
multi-act caravan have grown in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough out there," says Kevin Lyman, founder and organizer of
the Vans Warped Tour. "That's why I went for a very basic Warped
lineup. Bad Religion, the Bosstones, NOFX--those are bands that have
done the tour before, and then there are bands I think are going to
break, like Ozma.""</TE>
<TE>   Warped will be in Los Angeles on July 10 and 11, with location to
be set, and July 12 at the Ventura Fairgrounds. The Ozzfest schedule
has not been announced.</TE>
<TE>   O SISTERHOOD: The soundtrack for the movie "Divine Secrets of the
Ya Ya Sisterhood" is looking like the most intriguing movie music
project since "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" That's appropriate,
because it's being produced by the same person, T Bone Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to music from the film's Louisiana locales, the
soundtrack will feature contributions from a variety of stars. Tony
Bennett is recording for the project, and while people close to the
film will not confirm it, Bob Dylan, Macy Gray and Alison Krauss are
also expected to be involved.</TE>
<TE>   The film and companion album are due in early summer. The album
will be the second release from a new label founded by Burnett and "O
Brother" filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen. Called DMZ, the company has
just made a joint-venture deal with Columbia Records.</TE>
<TE>   The first album for the label will be by bluegrass veteran and "O
Brother" contributor Ralph Stanley. Burnett is producing the work,
which is due in the spring. DMZ will have offices in Los Angeles and
Nashville, with John Grady and Cameron Strang, owner of the
independent New West Records label, as co-presidents.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: "Young Grow Old," a Creed song that has never been
released in the U.S., will be featured on "Forcible Entry," the
latest compilation put together with the World Wrestling Federation.
Also on the album, due March 26 from Columbia Records, will be a
remix of Marilyn Manson's "The Beautiful People" (the WWF theme
song), Rob Zombie's theme for wrestler Edge, and a Kid Rock version
of ZZ Top's "Legs." ...DJ Shadow is finishing "The Private Press,"
the first album of his own since 1996's groundbreaking "Endtroducing"
and the Bay Area producer's first for MCA Records. Due in May, the
album is built around samples of records made by nonprofessionals in
recording booths at amusement arcades and collected by Shadow over
the years....</TE>
<TE>   L.A. band AM Radio is getting a big boost courtesy of Weezer's
Rivers Cuomo, who's not only managing the group but also taking it
out as Weezer's opening act for nine shows in Japan this spring.
Cuomo and AM Radio frontman Kevin Ridel grew up together in
Connecticut. AM Radio, which is finishing a debut album for
independent release (with Cuomo as executive producer), plays the
Troubadour on Tuesday as part of a benefit for local music magazine
Synergy.</TE>

<TE>   The secrets and lies of two star-crossed married couples--one
poor, one the beneficiary of Ireland's new, robust "Celtic Tiger"
economy--come to light in the U.S. premiere of Bernard Farrell's
wicked comedy, "Stella by Starlight." Opening Saturday at the Laguna
Playhouse, the production features a respected international cast,
headed by Bairbre Dowling, Thomas MacGreevy, Warren Sweeney and
Amelia White. It's the second Laguna outing for critically acclaimed
Irish playwright Farrell: His play "Kevin's Bed" received its U.S.
premiere there last year.</TE>

<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers has one of those classic country voices. Never mind that
her country is Australia--she sounds as if she was reared in a
Tennessee mountain home. On her second album (in stores Tuesday; she
plays the Roxy in West Hollywood on Feb. 19), she makes her voice
count, applying that Dolly Parton-meets-Sheryl Crow singing to Dolly
Parton-meets-Steve Earle songwriting and musical range.</TE>
<TE>   She and her versatile band move confidently from the rock-edged
title song to the bluegrass flights of "On a Bad Day" to the sweet
solo sorrow of "Falling Into You" to the rippin' rockabilly of
"Crossfire." Lucinda Williams, Matthew Ryan and Buddy Miller each
jump in as complementary duet partners.</TE>
<TE>   Most striking is the razor-cut sting of the words, with most of
the slashing directed at Chambers herself. "Sometime I wish I was a
sin / So the ones I love wouldn't let me in," from "This Mountain,"
is one of those turn-you-around lines that says so much with so
little--the foundation strength of great country music.</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't quite integrated her influences into a truly individual
style yet-- a version of Gram Parsons' "Still Feeling Blue" is an
obvious tribute choice. And "Ignorance," a hidden bonus track, is a
bit raw if well intentioned with its current-events rage ("If you're
not [angry] at the world / Then you're just not paying attention").
But those exposed nerves and unbridled quality are what make Chambers
a standout, wherever she's from. --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   CHRIS ISAAK</TE>
<TE>   "Always Got Tonight"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   What have you got against Chris Isaak? Sure, the slick
retro-rocker pales in comparison with the influences he emulates
("Wicked Game" aside). The Stockton-born singer-songwriter's latest
collection (due Tuesday) doesn't bring him any closer, but,
c'mon--not too many living artists can measure up to guys like Roy
Orbison and Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   So, is it that he's just another pretty voice, disproportionately
celebrated thanks to his smooth style and successful cable TV comedy
series? But his sleepy, quavering voice can be meltingly vulnerable.
Here, he seductively infuses such heartbreak tunes as "Let Me Down
Easy" and "Life Goes On" with his trademark sense of mournful
solitude. But breezier numbers such as "Cool Love" or the propulsive
plea "One Day," just don't smolder like those aching torch songs. The
true-blue anthem "American Boy" feels pat, and too many of his
jangling folk-rockers are pleasant but unmemorable.</TE>
<TE>   Isaak's band, Silvertone, expertly shades in the backgrounds,
leaving emotional impressions with the lonesome-echo slide guitar of
such numbers as "Worked It Out Wrong." Less successfully, he spices
the mix with different pop styles, from '70s-soul flute bits on the
driving "Notice the Ring" to inexplicable rap-rock on the bluesy
title track. Which, perhaps, seems a bit more like hedging bets than
being real. --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** Lee "Scratch" Perry, "Jamaican E.T.," Trojan. Jamaican dub,
that reggae subgenre in which voices and instruments are vigorously
bathed in echo and reverb, has been legendary producer Lee Perry's
metier for 40 years. But he can be maddeningly
erratic--transformative on one record, perplexing on the next. This
album falls into the latter category. It's a mad Babel of
sound--Perry's singing and spoken word rants overlap to the point of
total obfuscation, blotting out some of the more compelling
half-baked grooves buried in the mix. --Marc Weingarten</TE>

<HD>Psst--Wanna See a Ballet Video?</HD>
<DH>With legal tapes of many great productions unavailable,
fans swap bootlegs. But the real crime is not preserving the works
for posterity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, a single unguarded moment can propel you headlong into a
life of crime.</LD>
<LD>   Mine came at the 1992 Royal Danish Ballet festival in Copenhagen.
At intermission, I met a young critic for one of the city's
newspapers--dangerously handsome, wickedly sophisticated, devilishly
charming--and as we said goodnight in the shadow of one of the
statues flanking the entrance to the King's Theatre, he uttered the
three little words that sealed my fate: "I have videotapes."</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, he had Bournonville videotapes: off-the-air
telecasts, never shown in America, of ballets choreographed by August
Bournonville in the mid-19th century and passed down in performances
by the Royal Danes. These masterworks and rarities had been telecast
year after year in Denmark, performed by dancers schooled to
unmatched expertise in the unique Bournonville classical style. As my
balletic tempter repeated their exotic titles--"Kermesse in Bruges,"
"Kings Guards on Amager," "A Folk Tale" (in two different
productions!)--I suddenly knew I would stop at nothing to possess
them.</LD>
<TE>   I also knew what he wanted in return, and that it was beyond the
pale. But the tapes he offered documented a golden age of
Bournonville dancing and so, like Faust, Dr. Faustus and Joe Boyd in
"Damn Yankees," I struck a devil's bargain. For all that
Bournonville, I agreed to copy and send off-the-air New York City
Ballet telecasts never seen in Europe, and as I exhausted my own
collection and began duping tapes borrowed from friends and
colleagues, I discovered a growing network of people actively engaged
in swapping dances through personal contacts or over the Internet.
They ranged from respected fellow professionals (critics, academics,
dancers and choreographers) to resourceful civilian balletomanes such
as two spirited retirees in Los Angeles with a special interest in
the ballets of Frederick Ashton or an enterprising Paris Opera Ballet
devotee in the City of Light.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I and all these worthies knowingly flouted
international copyright laws that explicitly forbid duplication. But
before you nominate me for the FBI's Most Wanted list, note that no
money ever changed hands during my transactions (I can't speak for
others), and that I never copied any tape that was available for sale
or rental in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that's the point. Most of the great dance performances
telecast in our lifetimes can't be bought or borrowed, and probably
never will be until their copyrights lapse. If you taped them off the
air, great, and if you can afford to visit archives in New York,
Paris, Copenhagen and other dance capitals to view company
collections, even better. Otherwise, your choice is to do without or
to join the unholy ranks of dance video outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   Forgetting my crimes for the moment, the problem of access to
previously telecast dance programming may seem minuscule compared
with the ongoing conflict over laws that forbid widespread file
swapping and the copying of digital media. For those in the field,
however, what's at stake is nothing less than rescuing an important
segment of 20th century culture.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if a student in the dance history class that I teach
at a local university wants to write a term paper on Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers, their films are available for viewing in campus
libraries, as they should be. But what about the creative partnership
of George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky? Their collaborations
defined an epoch in modern ballet and were resplendent in such
landmark telecasts as the New York City Ballet tribute "Genius Has a
Birthday" on the PBS "Live From Lincoln Center" series in 1982, the
year before Balanchine died. With this and so many other essential
tapes unavailable in any video edition for home or educational use,
how do my students study the body of Balanchine-Stravinsky
collaborations if not through illegal duplicates?</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, many vintage dance telecasts have never been reissued
because there's no perceived profit in them. Others, however, remain
unavailable because the original contracts for creative and technical
personnel covered only the program's scheduled air dates, not any
future publication on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Renegotiating these contracts can be prohibitively expensive,
especially when it's a live performance and theatrical unions are
involved. Indeed, one Oscar-nominated dance documentary had to strip
the soundtracks off performance clips from the PBS "Dance in America"
series and replace them with newly recorded accompaniments because
the demands of the original musicians were reportedly off the map.
Other projects have stalled or been reedited because one hold-out
dancer refused to sign. So historic master tapes are held hostage
indefinitely--and illegal copies fill the gap.</TE>
<TE>   Although off-the-air performances represent the bulk of the
underground dance-video market, there's also a brisk trade in
notation tapes and do-it-yourself bootlegs. Usually one-camera shoots
from the balcony, notation tapes are a company's way of documenting
choreography for future revivals, and sometimes they become the only
record of an important work.</TE>
<TE>   Union restrictions usually prevent anyone from viewing these tapes
except people hired to restage or dance the ballets they document.
When I once asked a publicist for a major international company about
the casting in one of them, I was told that it would cause "terrible
trouble" if it became known that I'd even seen that tape, much less
obtained a copy of it.</TE>
<TE>   With camcorders now nearly as small as opera glasses, and optical
stabilization a standard feature, many balletomanes now bootleg what
they can't buy or rent. At the 1998 International Ballet Festival in
Havana, for example, so many camcorders were switched on at some
performances that the viewfinder lights made it look like some sort
of candlelight vigil was taking place.</TE>
<TE>   The result of such amateur recording has expanded the video
repertory in the way that bootlegs have enriched the pop music scene
since the 1960s and pirate opera recordings made virtually every role
sung by the late diva Maria Callas accessible to anyone who knew
where to ask for them.</TE>
<TE>   Thus I'm glad to know that in the continuing absence of any
commercial version, there are at least two amateur bootleg tapes in
circulation of the 1999 Kirov Ballet "Sleeping Beauty," a four-hour
reconstruction of the Marius Petipa choreography in reproductions of
the original sets and costumes.</TE>
<TE>   As close as anyone is likely to come to what Petipa and
Tchaikovsky intended "Sleeping Beauty" to be, this epochal production
could vanish at any moment in the kind of sudden changes of company
leadership that wreaked havoc on the Bolshoi and the Royal Danish
Ballet in the 1990s. It needs to be preserved in some sort of film or
video record for future study and pleasure--shot by the best dance
filmmakers or videographers in the world, if possible. If not, the
performances stolen on tape by vigilante balletomanes will serve far,
far better than mere memories, photos, production data and reviews
(including mine).</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that copyright holders and participating artists in
the dance world will eventually sign clearances to make some of the
most valuable ballet bootlegs commercially available. That's already
happened with Victor Jensen's unauthorized home movies of the Ballets
Russes "Gaite Parisienne," shot during a 10-year period in the 1940s
and '50s, and now available in the Video Artists International home
video catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Like the most celebrated rock 'n' roll bootlegs and pirate opera
recordings, bootleg dance sometimes offers irreplaceable works and
performances, the best possible reason for going legit. It may be an
index of my criminal mind, but I still cherish my two-disc pirate
recording of Donizetti's "Poliuto," with Callas, Franco Corelli,
Ettore Bastianini and other La Scala opera legends, even though the
same 1960 performance is now available in legal editions.</TE>
<TE>   A recent opinion piece by Paul Boutin in online magazine Salon
discussed the gulf between traditional copyright restrictions and the
new options for duplication and proliferation of music offered by the
Internet and digital technologies. It ended with a question that
resonates strongly in a dance world where many historic performances
and works are available only in the video underground. "Instead of
telling us not to steal," he wrote, "how about just giving us a way
to pay?"</TE>
<TE>   One successful way already exists for books. When, for instance, I
discovered that a collection of essays I needed as a text for my
dance history class was out of print, the university contacted the
original publishers and arranged to issue a copy as a course reader,
paying whatever royalty fee is standard in such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, one university class a year is smaller than the number of
people who might want to purchase, say, the knockout 1978 performance
of Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" with Gelsey Kirkland and
Mikhail Baryshnikov on the "Live From Lincoln Center" series, or even
the Kirov Ballet's own notation tape of its four-hour "Sleeping
Beauty." So why can't people get copies of old dance tapes the way
they can get reproductions of old dance books?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, of course, is that they can, but only illegally. And
that won't change until some fair policy exists for publication
rights to taped performances not commercially available. No, I don't
exactly relish the prospect of a SWAT team crashing through my front
door to seize my Bournonville contraband. But nobody reading this
piece will live long enough to wait for copyright expiration dates on
fabulous performances that ought to be in every university library
and specialist video catalog right now. And if I do end up in the
slammer in a crackdown on these crimes of the art, at least I'll be
in great company.</TE>

<LD>One of David Rambo's most vivid memories of his youth was a weekend
retreat with his confirmation class at his Lutheran church, in a
small town in eastern Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   The teenage boys were assigned to bunk in the basement, the girls
in the attic. Around midnight, however, a few of the female Bible
students became obsessed with the notion that 15-year-old David, down
in the basement, looked like David Cassidy, the era's reigning teen
idol.</LD>
<LD>   The girls ran down two flights of stairs to check out the
resemblance--and they didn't go back. "We stayed up all night,"
recalled Rambo, now 46, "practicing kissing and all the other things
you do on religious retreats."</LD>
<TE>   The chaperons? "I think they had their own party going on."
Thinking back on that weekend, his only other memory is of the food.
"I don't remember a thing we learned. But I remember everything we
ate: lasagna, caramel apples, doughnuts...."</TE>
<TE>   Much later in life, L.A.-based playwright Rambo again became
interested in the culture and the trappings of modern American
Protestant churches. He set a play, "God's Man in Texas," in an
enormous Baptist mega-church in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced at the Actors Theatre of Louisville's Humana festival
in 1999, "God's Man in Texas" has gone on to 15 productions, with
five more scheduled. The latest opens Wednesday at the Geffen
Playhouse. It's one of the most important for Rambo, because it will
be the first major production of any of his plays in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   The play centers on the relationship between the church's senior
pastor, who is nearing retirement, and a younger preacher who might
take over. The younger man begins to wonder if the voice of God can
still be detected among the many activities and amenities the huge
church offers.</TE>
<TE>   For Rambo, who drifted away from organized religion soon after
that fabled retreat as a teenager, the play isn't necessarily about
religion. "It's a parable about art and the life of an artist," he
said, "about how ambition and large-scale commercialism can threaten
the ability of the artist to be inspired."</TE>
<TE>   Citing audience talk-back sessions at earlier productions and
e-mail he has received, Rambo said the play has reached a wide swath
of theatergoers--"people who are religious and people who are not,"
he said. "I'm astonished at how it speaks to people on opposite sides
of religious beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   Hershael W. York, who teaches Christian preaching at Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, saw the premiere and
wrote a program note for later productions that said: "Just where
does Jesus belong, anyway? In pulpits or politics? Is he best
represented by thunderous sermons or thoughtful speech? ... 'God's
Man in Texas' asks these questions and makes us laugh in the
meantime, eliciting a smile even when we are uncomfortable with what
it might mean. Some laugh out of derision, some out of recognition,
but ultimately the two laughters coalesce into one and we are left to
ponder just what faith really looks like."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Rothman directed "God's Man in Texas" for largely Jewish
audiences at Florida Stage in Palm Beach County and then two other
productions in Cincinnati and St. Louis. "This play is so universal
in terms of the bigger themes," said Rothman, who heads the theater
and dance department at Cal State L.A. "It could be set at a big
Jewish synagogue or in the Vatican, or it could be about how people
behave toward each other in any business. It cuts across everything."</TE>
<TE>   The connection between churches and other institutions was one
reason Rambo started thinking about a play on this subject in the
mid-'90s. He was fascinated by a report on National Public Radio, in
which the director of a mega-church's dinner theater performed
selections from the latest production on the air, and by an article
on the mega-church phenomenon in the Atlantic Monthly.</TE>
<TE>   "I was struck by how many similarities there are between a theater
and a mega-church," he said. "They both have scripts, production
teams, music directors. Some mega-churches use more lighting and
sound equipment than 'The Phantom of the Opera.' And it's all in
support of a star, the preacher, who gives weekly performances. The
object is to move an audience."</TE>
<TE>   Rambo was drawn more to show business than he was to the church.
He began playing piano in taverns at age 15 and started acting in
dinner theaters at 17. After high school, "I stupidly decided I
didn't need college," and he joined the ranks of would-be actors in
New York, appearing in some off-off-Broadway shows.</TE>
<TE>   He began living in Los Angeles part time in 1980, trying to make a
living as an actor in film and TV. He co-starred in a 1981 pilot,
"The Best of Times," with Nicolas Cage and Crispin Glover, and paid a
few bills by acting in commercials. In 1984, he settled in L.A.
permanently, and he began selling real estate for a steadier source
of income.</TE>
<TE>   He was good at it. He attained a six-figure income and eventually
managed 60 agents in a Sherman Oaks office, handling deals for Rosie
O'Donnell, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, Tim Curry, and Rue
McClanahan. The profession began to acquire near-religious
significance for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the religion of selling," he said. "It's so fundamental
to our culture. Real estate agents listen to their own gurus they way
other people listen to preachers. They're looking for a magic wand
that can make them richer and happier. A lot of people, myself
included, thought the ticket to that was to sell a lot of houses."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't all about the hard sell, though. "I sat at all these
kitchen tables, dealing with people's dreams and ambitions. I came to
understand that you can't muscle them into a deal. If you do, they'll
wiggle out of it. If you really understand their dreams, then it
sticks."</TE>
<TE>   The real estate market soured in the early '90s, and Rambo
sometimes found himself sitting at open houses with no customers for
as long as four hours. To pass the time, he began jotting down ideas
for plays and then trying to develop them.</TE>
<TE>   He used his professional milieu in "There's No Place Like House,"
a farce set in the world of L.A. real estate, which enjoyed a
successful run in 1997 at two sub-100-seat theaters on Melrose
Avenue. And he ventured into a more tragic mode in
"Speaky-Spikey-Spokey," inspired by an underground fire that burned
in Pennsylvania for nearly 40 years. It was presented at the Ashland,
Ore., New Plays Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Once he got the idea for "God's Man in Texas," he researched it
for more than a year--a habit he credits to two generations of
librarians on his mother's side. He visited a number of big churches,
including the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove and the Church on the
Way in Van Nuys, where he was introduced to Testamints, candy that
comes with ecclesiastical wrappings, which he now uses as gifts on
opening nights.</TE>
<TE>   He began writing the play for a cast of seven actors who would
play 15 characters. "But it wasn't working. I kept writing around the
story." Rambo is a season subscriber at the Geffen, as well as at
South Coast Repertory, A Noise Within and Interact Theatre. When he
saw the Geffen production of Jon Marans' "Old Wicked Songs" in 1997,
he was impressed with "how I could see the whole city of Vienna even
though there were only two characters on one set."</TE>
<TE>   He reduced his characters to just the two ministers. But then he
added a third man, Hugo, a church factotum who had a wild past. Hugo,
he said, is "the portal for the audience. If we're laughing with
Hugo, we're not laughing at religion."</TE>
<TE>   "If the story was going to have any power," he added, "I couldn't
make it a Carol Burnett sketch. I had to buy into what they believe
in much more than I ever wanted to. And once I had three characters,
the light went on. I had a trinity."</TE>
<TE>   He also came up with the notion that the first act is Old
Testament in spirit, "God speaking from on high," while the second is
New--"God is among men," as the younger preacher works with members
of the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Rambo found himself distracted by the noise of remodeling at the
Los Feliz home he shares with Theodore Heyck, an attorney who has
been his partner for 27 years. He rented a Hollywood office to work
on the play--and found that it was next to an office where sing-along
kids' videos were being edited. So he wore earplugs.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, to finish the play in peace and quiet, he rented a house
in Idyllwild in December 1997. "I knew the last word would be 'Amen.'
That last day of writing, when I typed 'Amen,' I wanted to crawl into
bed and sleep for a month."</TE>
<TE>   Although a New York agent had been encouraging Rambo, she didn't
think any of his plays would sell widely until she read "God's Man in
Texas." She submitted it to the Humana Festival, a prestigious
showcase for new plays. When Rambo got the call that it had been
selected, he hung up the phone and cried.</TE>
<TE>   The play was a hit, but Rambo kept working on it. The final,
slimmer version was first presented in San Diego, in a 2000
production at Globe Theatres' Cassius Carter Center Stage. It was
directed by Leonard Foglia, who helped whip it into shape, Rambo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Humana, Rambo decided to retire from real estate.
Although his income has decreased, "the phone doesn't ring every five
minutes. My thinking is deeper, I don't wear as many ties, and my dry
cleaning bill is nonexistent," Rambo said. He works at home, in his
pajamas and dirty hair, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rambo quoted a line from his play, in which the older minister
tells the younger one, "God could be working to change your life
beyond your wildest dreams."</TE>
<TE>   "That's what has happened to me."</TE>

<HD>Banjo That Goes Far Beyond Bluegrass</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of the banjo and what comes to mind? Country music? Bluegrass?
Dixieland? The "Dueling Banjos" of Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell?
Earl Scruggs? The "Beverly Hillbillies" theme song he co-wrote?</LD>
<LD>   Sure, all of those and more. What doesn't immediately register is
jazz--at least its styles beyond the '20s. And it's somewhat
surprising that the banjo was so quickly replaced in the jazz rhythm
sections of the '20s and '30s by the guitar. Given its origin in
Africa (via instruments constructed from turtle shells, calabash
gourds, stretched hides and gut strings), it actually was more firmly
connected to the roots of jazz than were the European trumpets,
clarinets and trombones that quickly became the music's central
voices.</LD>
<LD>   But the arrival of Bela Fleck in the early '90s brought the banjo
back into the orbit of jazz and the blues.</LD>
<TE>   Almost single-handedly, Fleck established the instrument's
capacity to move easily across genres reaching from the blues and
bluegrass to contemporary jazz and pop. On his latest release, "Live
at the Quick" (***1/2, Columbia Records), a CD that is being issued
simultaneously with a companion DVD, he manages to touch most of
those bases with consummate ease.</TE>
<TE>   Fleck has never hesitated to reach into broad stylistic categories
or to add talented guest soloists to performances by his basic
Flecktones ensemble. (His 2001 CD, "Perpetual Motion," has received
Grammy nominations for classical crossover album and instrumental
arrangement.) For this live outing--recorded during two shows in
Fairfield, Conn.--he added an array of artists including steel pan
master Andy Narell; woodwind artists Paul Hanson, Jeff Coffin and
Paul McCandless; tabla drummer Sandip Burman; and Tuvan throat singer
Congar Ol'Ondar.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting collection of music is startlingly diverse. Fleck
ranges from electric synth banjo and electric low banjo to acoustic
banjo, with the latter producing some of the album's most compelling
sounds--especially during his solo interpretation of the Bach Violin
Partita No. 3. Other gripping moments include Ol'Ondar's "Alash
Khem," an amazing display of solo throat singing--a vocal technique
in which the singer creates multiple sounds by building layers of
overtones from a guttural bass note.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that Django Reinhardt ever tried his hand at the
banjo, although it would have been fascinating to hear what the
legendary French Gypsy guitarist would have done with the instrument.
One of his finest heirs, Bireli Lagrene--also a French Gypsy--hasn't
tried the banjo either. But he's been all over the guitar, moving
confidently from bebop and jazz-rock to electronic fusion and
Brazilian rhythms. On "Gypsy Project" (***, Dreyfus Jazz), he offers
yet another tribute to Reinhardt, one that blends reminiscence with
adventurousness, the past with the present.</TE>
<TE>   On the opening track, Reinhardt's "Blues Clair," both the milieu
and the sound are distinctly evocative of the '30s. With violinist
Florin Niculescu, rhythm guitarists Holzmano Lagrene and Hono
Winterstein, and bassist Diego Imbert, the aura of Reinhardt,
Stephane Grappelli and the Hot Club of France is ever present,
especially in tunes such as "Coquette" and "Swing 42," as well as the
rhapsodic rendition of "Embraceable You," "What Is This Thing Called
Love" and "Vous Et Moi" (a 1942 piece in which Reinhardt made one of
his rare appearances as a violinist).</TE>
<TE>   Accordionist Richard Galliano on "Daphne" adds a more unusual
touch, a solid, in-the-pocket swing-style drive with an occasional
seasoning of the blues. But this is Bireli Lagrene's gig, a stirring
example of an improvisational imagination not always apparent in his
more electronically oriented outings.</TE>
<TE>   Local Heroes: The artists who keep the recording studios busy--in
film, television and all musical genres--rarely receive the
acknowledgment they deserve. With a few exceptions, their solo
outings generally surface on small, often self-produced CDs. The
albums below may or may not turn up in your local record outlet, but
they can be found at www.amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Kaplan, "Lonely Town" (***, Rylan Records). Trombonist Kaplan
has probably performed on thousands of recordings and soundtracks,
from "The Simpsons" to Barbra Streisand. For his own debut recording,
he gathered a collection of equally gifted studio associates, brought
in such fine arrangers as Russ Garcia, Bill Cunliffe and Tom Ranier,
and assembled a kind of sumptuous, string-filled, instrumental
version of Frank Sinatra's atmospheric late-night recordings.
Kaplan's lush sound and moody way with a melody are front and center
in a collection of tunes overflowing with the enigmatic qualities of
love lost and found--tunes such as "Angel Eyes," "Guess I'll Hang My
Tears Out to Dry," "I Fall in Love Too Easily" and "Only the Lonely."
Best experienced with a bottle of Cabernet and a roaring fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Melvoin, "Oh Baby" (***, City Light Entertainment). Pianist
Melvoin, who is the new music director for the Grammy Awards show,
was the keyboardist on the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" and Natalie
Cole's "Unforgettable." He's also recorded with everyone from Roy
Rogers and Paul Anka to Stan Getz and Ray Charles, and his composing
was heard in the underscores of shows such as "Mannix," "Lou Grant"
and "Baretta." Lesser known is the fact that Melvoin is a first-rate
jazz pianist who balances his crisp sense of swing and a
compositional cohesion to his improvisational spontaneity. On "Oh
Baby," he works for the most part in a jazz trio context, interacting
superbly with bassist Brian Bromberg and drummer John Guerin. Most of
the tunes are standards--"There Is No Greater Love," "So in Love,"
"I'll Never Smile Again," etc.--enlivened by the ineffable sense of
connection among players whose intuitive compatibility is constantly
present. On a pair of tracks they are joined by saxophonist Tom Scott
in a rare but welcome demonstration of his too infrequently heard
straight-ahead skills.</TE>
<TE>   Inner Voices, "Prairie Jazz" (***, Song River Records). Singer
Morgan Ames and the other members of her Inner Voices vocal
ensemble--Shelby Flint, Melissa Mackay and Michael Mishaw--are
capable of singing almost anything. They take on the American West in
this unusual collection of a cappella versions of songs such as
"Goodbye Old Paint," "Tumblin' Tumbleweeds" "Springtime in the
Rockies," "I Wonder as I Wander," etc. One of the more fascinating
items is a rendering of Jim Pepper's Native American prayer song,
"Witchi Tai To"; another is "Home on the Range," with some new lyrics
by Ames written, she says in the liner notes, "thinking of Georgia
O'Keeffe crouching along a desert rim looking for colors worth
painting." Is it jazz? In spirit and in the harmonies, yes. But the
rich embrace of the American spirit in the album--so unexpectedly
appropriate at this particular time--gives the album an appeal that
reaches well beyond questions of categorization.</TE>

<LD>The members of N.E.R.D. can't make it from one end of the Four
Seasons hotel bar to the other without being buttonholed by music-biz
machers who want to schmooze.</LD>
<LD>   First up is Macy Gray's manager, who gives Pharrell Williams, Chad
Hugo and Sheldon Haley, whose stage name is Shay, big bear hugs and
an even bigger earful about some hush-hush industry scuttlebutt.</LD>
<LD>   Three tables down, it's LL Cool J who wants to confab. Williams
and Hugo, who form the producing duo the Neptunes, produced the first
single from LL's forthcoming album, but the rap star seems to want
more. "I want you guys to think about those other tracks, all right?"
he says in his most ingenuous voice. "Yo, we're on it," Williams
says. "No problem."</LD>
<TE>   Writers and producers of a string of innovative rap and R&amp;B
records, the Neptunes have achieved that critical mass that means
label representatives absolutely, positively have to have them for
their projects and A-list artists beep their pagers with work offers.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, the Neptunes have built a resume that includes Britney
Spears' "I'm a Slave 4 You," Mystikal's exercise in Redd Foxxian
hip-hop "Shake Your Ass," Jay-Z's "I Just Wanna Love U (Give It to
Me)," Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Got Your Money," and remixes for a long
list of artists ranging from the Backstreet Boys to Limp Bizkit.</TE>
<TE>   Even Williams readily admits that the Neptunes' success can be
attributed to the hype. But, he adds, "that's OK, 'cause every time
you come for the hype, we'll give you something that will enlighten
you. It's amazing to us that all of this happened, but we don't want
to be the hot producers. We just want to work."</TE>
<TE>   No worries there. After a decade in the control booth, the
Neptunes have formed their own band, N.E.R.D. (for No One Ever Really
Dies), with high school buddy Haley. N.E.R.D.'s debut album, "In
Search of ... ," due in stores Tuesday from Virgin Records, is that
rare hip-hop paradigm-shifter, an album that calls into question
every current precept of what good hip-hop is supposed to be, then
provides a jarring antidote.</TE>
<TE>   The first single, "Lapdance," in which Williams equates strippers
with money-mad politicians, is powered by a clipped metal riff.
"Things Are Getting Better" is a thick slice of straight-up,
P-Funk-style booty-thump; "Baby Doll" has a peppy new-wave feel. It
goes on like this for the duration of the album, a shape-shifting
survey of styles held together by N.E.R.D's wicked humor and sly
melodic feints.</TE>
<TE>   "In Search of ..." is a call to arms, an album that lays bare the
myopia of hip-hop and points the way toward a more ecumenical future,
where the boundaries between musical genres are blurred to the point
of indeterminacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're entering an age of difference and exploration," says
Williams, joining Haley and Hugo for a late-afternoon lunch in a
quiet anteroom behind the clamorous bar. "Look at OutKast. They did
what they wanted to do and they didn't care. That's what music is all
about. The radio is full of songs about robbing and killing, but a
lot of the songs that we loved as kids were just about, you know,
what the artist did that day, and that's OK!"</TE>
<TE>   While the trio isn't a household word, anticipation has been
running high for the album in hip-hop circles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that based on their track record, people will
automatically be interested in the N.E.R.D. album, even thought it
strays so far from everything the Neptunes are known for," says Shani
Saxon, music editor of Vibe magazine. "This album shows how
innovative, and how willing to experiment, they are."</TE>
<TE>   The anticipation has been stretched for a long time. N.E.R.D.
originally recorded "In Search of ..." with drum loops and samples,
but the band was afraid it would create the wrong first impression.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make an alternative album that wasn't strictly
hip-hop or R&amp;B," says Hugo, whose quiet manner contrasts sharply with
Williams' jive-talking trickster persona and Haley's barbed wit. "So
the first album became kind of a blueprint for us."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Hugo hired a young Minneapolis rock band called
Spymob and had them re-record the grooves to give "In Search of ..."
the raw immediacy the rough draft lacked. The result is a thrilling
example of cross-genre hybridization. N.E.R.D. wants "In Search of
..." to become a Trojan horse for hip-hop--an album that might open
up new possibilities for artists who are hesitant to mix and match
sounds that could turn off category-conscious commercial radio
programmers.</TE>
<TE>   To hear Williams tell it, popular music is pigeonholed because
listeners have been conditioned to harbor prejudices about genres
that aren't a staple of their steady diet.</TE>
<TE>   "In the '80s, Tears for Fears was played on black radio stations,"
Williams says. "So was 'Another One Bites the Dust' and the Art of
Noise. They don't do that no more."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, Shay and Hugo certainly don't fit any hip-hop
stereotype. Born and reared in Virginia Beach, Va., the three
attended different high schools for gifted children, where they
studied music theory and played in their school marching bands. "We
would see each other at school sporting events," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo, whose Filipino father was stationed at the local Navy base,
and Williams listened to Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder and Chicago
records, hung out with fellow hip-hop fanatic and future
super-producer Tim "Timbaland" Mosely, and eventually formed a band
with buddies Shay and Mike Etheridge. In 1990, the foursome, by then
called the Neptunes, entered a talent show mounted by hip-hop
producer Teddy Riley, who had recently moved to Virginia and was
looking for some new recruits to develop and record.</TE>
<TE>   "We performed and it was great," Hugo says. "He gave us a break
and it kind of took off from there."</TE>
<TE>   But instead of recording their own project, Riley assigned
Williams and Hugo to produce outside artists. In 1992, they scored a
Top 5 hit with Wreckx-N-Effect's "Rumpshaker." Williams and Hugo also
produced a few tracks for the 1994 debut album from Riley's group
Blackstreet. But the workload wasn't enough, and in 1993 the Neptunes
struck out on their own with their first outside production, SWV's
"Use Your Heart."</TE>
<TE>   "When we hooked up with Riley, we were still finding ourselves and
our sound," says Shay, who was put on a kind of informal retainer by
Williams and Hugo until they had the time to record "In Search of
..." "But we learned a lot about the business from him."</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D. hopes to do for younger artists what Riley did for them.
They have a long list of releases due this year, including Spymob's
debut and an album from a young rapper named Roscoe P. Coldchain.
It's all part and parcel of N.E.R.D's mission to break down the walls
between genres and set popular music free.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that separates people are themselves," Williams
says. "I don't care what color you are--everyone knows the theme to
'The Dukes of Hazzard,' man! Popular music is the most universal
language in the world ... and everyone can count a beat."</TE>

<HD>State Tax Law Has Changed Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are some of the changes in state tax law for 2001 returns:</LD>
<LD>   * Solar energy system credit: The state now offers a credit for
people who purchase and install a solar energy system. For 2001
through 2003, the credit is equal to the lesser of 15% of the net
price paid for the system, or $4.50 per rated watt of generating
capacity. See FTB Form 3508 for details.</LD>
<LD>   * New interest deduction: Taxpayers who got loans from their
utilities to buy energy-efficient heating or cooling equipment for
their homes can deduct the interest. The utilities will issue a Form
1098 to the taxpayer detailing the deductible amount.</LD>
<TE>   * Disaster relief: Taxpayers directly affected by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks or the 2000 Napa Valley earthquake are allowed
special tax treatment for disaster losses. For more details, visit
the FTB's Web site at www.ftb.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * Teacher retention credit: This state credit, which was new for
the 2000 tax year, continues for 2001. Credentialed teachers in
public or private schools can get a credit worth up to $1,500. For
more information, see FTB Form 3505.</TE>
<TE>   * Long-term care credit: People caring for a dependent or spouse,
or who need long-term care themselves, can take a $500 credit if
their adjusted gross income is less than $100,000. See FTB Form 3504
for details.</TE>
<TE>   * Child and dependent care expenses credit: This credit, which
gives parents a tax break based on the care costs they pay in order
to work, is based on the relatively complicated federal credit with
the same name. See FTB Form 3506.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's 45 million small-business owners and self-employed
taxpayers now have an Internal Revenue Service division devoted
exclusively to them. The change is part of the agency's massive
restructuring. Other items to note:</LD>
<LD>   * New addresses: California taxpayers who file Schedule C business
profit-and-loss forms with their 1040 returns, and who owe taxes, now
should mail their federal returns to P.O. Box 7704, San Francisco, CA
94120-7704. Returns that do not include payments should be mailed to
the IRS in Fresno, CA 93888-0002. Corporate returns should be mailed
to the IRS' Ogden, Utah, facility.</LD>
<LD>   * Easier EINs: The IRS has made it easier to get an employer
identification number--essential if you have employees, a Keogh
retirement plan or operate as a partnership or corporation. Taxpayers
can call toll-free (866) 816-2065 from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday
through Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Californians also can send EIN requests by fax, using the
instructions on Form SS-4, to the Philadelphia service center at
(215) 516-3990. For more information, go to the IRS Web site at
www.irs.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * Higher Section 179 limit: You can write off up to $24,000 in
qualifying business equipment purchases, known as Section 179
expenses, for 2001. The limit for 2000 was $20,000.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers Who Give Receive Generous Deductions</HD>
<DH>The reward for keeping detailed records of your donations
can be more cash to give again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Generosity pays at tax time.</LD>
<LD>   Even in normal times, Americans are a generous lot, giving $126
billion in 1999--the most recent year for which statistics are
available--for an average of $3,100 for each taxpayer who itemized
deductions.</LD>
<LD>   The number may have climbed even higher last year. The Sept. 11
terrorist attacks prompted charitable giving by millions of
Americans, who gave an estimated $1.5 billion for victim relief and
related causes.</LD>
<TE>   For taxpayers who itemize deductions, those charitable
contributions can mean big savings--perhaps more than they realize.
Many don't always remember to claim all of the deductions they're
entitled to, or properly account for their value.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of charitable contributions, especially the
noncash contributions, that people overlook," said Tom Pudner,
manager of personal financial planning at KPMG in McLean, Va. "They
do a good job of accounting for the big checks, but they miss a lot
of the non-cash contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Are you making the most of your charitable giving? It's worth a
review. Taking tax deductions for the value of your charitable gifts
and mileage leaves you with more cash to give again.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a guide to what's deductible and how to document your
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   * Cash:  If you gave more than $250 to a charitable organization
in 2001, you need to have written confirmation that you didn't
receive anything of value in return.</TE>
<TE>   Confirmation is required only when you give a single gift worth
more than $250. If you gave regular gifts to an organization that
added up to more than $250 during the year--for instance, if you gave
$25 each week to your church--each payment is considered a separate
gift. But you should maintain the canceled checks--or some other
evidence--to establish the value of the gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Many churches provide envelopes to parishioners and will keep
track of donations for those who use them. This--or writing checks
rather than giving cash--is an advisable approach for those who give
generously.</TE>
<TE>   * Appreciated securities: If you donated securities--such as
stocks or bonds--that were worth more than what you paid for them,
you can deduct the full market value of the security on the date of
the donation. But neither you nor the charity has to pay capital
gains taxes on the profit.</TE>
<TE>   The catch: You must have owned the investment for more than a year
to deduct the appreciated value. If the investment was owned for less
than a year, you can deduct the lesser of the original purchase price
or the current market value.</TE>
<TE>   * Depreciated property: Unwanted used stuff--clothing, furniture
and appliances--is a potential gold mine of deductions. But make sure
you can prove what you claim.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS expects a record of the organization you gave to, the date
and a description of the donated items. If the value of the donation
is more than $250, the agency wants more records. And if the value is
more than $500, you need to file a separate form--an 8283--that
details the property donated, the value and how you determined that
value--such as through appraisal, thrift shop value, catalogs etc.</TE>
<TE>   Can't figure out the value of your donated items? The Web site
www.taxsave.com, run by Income Dynamics Inc. of Omaha, Neb., sells a
computer program that provides market values of thousands of items by
indexing and analyzing the sales of millions of household items each
year.</TE>
<TE>   The program costs $29.95, so it's not worth purchasing it if you
donated a handful of used T-shirts. But Gordon Whitten, president of
Income Dynamics, said its average customer deducts about $1,500 in
used goods. That's a saving of $500 for someone in the 30% tax
bracket.</TE>
<TE>   * Donated cars: If you donated a car to charity last year, it's up
to you to determine the value of the donation. And there are tight
restrictions on how you determine that value.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, you can't deduct the high-end Blue Book value for a
car if it's in need of major repairs. You must determine the real
market value--what a willing buyer would pay. A mechanic or used car
dealer can help. If the car is worth more than $5,000, you'll need a
certified appraisal.</TE>
<TE>   Although some charities maintain they'll value the car for you,
the taxpayer is liable for whatever value is used to figure the tax
deduction for the car.</TE>
<TE>   * Giving time: You can't deduct the value of the time you donate
to charity, but you can deduct mileage and out-of-pocket expenses.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if you drove 40 miles a week to the local hospital
to serve as a candy striper and you paid $50 for the uniform that all
hospital volunteers wear, you can claim a charitable deduction for
those costs. For car expenses, you can either deduct your actual
costs--provided you maintain good written records--or you can deduct
14 cents a mile.</TE>
<TE>   * Quid pro quo: If you got something of value in exchange for your
donation, subtract that value from the amount of the deduction. For
instance, if you paid $500 for tickets to a charity dinner and the
meal was worth $50, your deduction is limited to $450.</TE>
<TE>   * College donations: There's a special rule for those who give to
colleges and get the right to buy tickets to athletic events in
exchange. Only 80% of the value of the donation is deductible. In
other words, if you joined the college athletic booster club at an
annual cost of $300, which gave you the right to buy season tickets
to the college home games, you can deduct just $240--or 80%--of that
cost.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a faster, more accurate return, consider electronic filing.
Here's what you need to know:</LD>
<LD>   * E-filing can speed your refund to you in two to three weeks,
compared with up to eight weeks for a paper return. People who owe
money can e-file as well, and pay by credit card or scheduled
automatic debit.</LD>
<LD>   * The e-filing system checks your math and offers electronic
confirmation that your return has been received--something that's not
available with a paper return.</LD>
<TE>   * You can e-file using tax software, tax-preparation Web sites or
a tax preparer who offers the service. Eligible taxpayers with simple
returns can use the telephone to e-file; the IRS has sent a special
package to those who can use this "TeleFile" system.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of e-filing is typically included in the
tax-preparation fee, although some preparers, Web sites and software
vendors charge an additional $10 to $20.</TE>

<LD>With the U.S. economy sending out mixed signals, even the experts
can't agree on what recovery looks like. But Gerardo Cruz can tell
you how it sounds.</LD>
<LD>   It's the rhythmic pounding of stamping machines inside his
family's Chatsworth manufacturing plant churning out tiny metal parts
for everything from trucks and computers to medical devices.</LD>
<LD>   "Hear that? That's a symphony to me," said a smiling Cruz recently
over the din at Colbrit Manufacturing. "There were times last year
when nothing was running."</LD>
<TE>   Hit first and worst by the economic downturn, the nation's
factories are showing some sign of recovery. Orders for big-ticket
items from refrigerators to turbines are on the rise, with government
figures released Tuesday showing new orders for durable goods
increasing 1.7% in December. Manufacturing work hours are edging up.
The glut of inventory is easing.</TE>
<TE>   Even the technology sector, the black hole of California's job
losses, is starting to emit flickers of light. Global semiconductor
sales have perked up in recent months. So have orders for some
high-tech equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Bad news still abounds for the nation's manufacturers. Industrial
production continues to slump, and thousands of factory workers swell
the unemployment rolls. Demand for information technology equipment,
machine tools and other key capital goods remains weak, while a
strong dollar has made U.S.-manufactured products less competitive
abroad. Some economists warn of a dreaded "double-dip" recession that
could squelch any hint of a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   But the good news, others say, is that though some indicators
continue to slide, the rate of decline has slowed. That suggests the
manufacturing sector has hit bottom or is close to it, setting the
stage for recovery this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the worst is over," said Dan Meckstroth, an
economist with the Manufacturers Alliance in Arlington, Va. "More and
more forward-looking indicators are pointing to a rebound."</TE>
<TE>   Recovery can't come too soon for the nation's factories, which
have borne the brunt of the economy's fallout. In contrast to
previous consumer-led recessions, this one started when businesses
slashed spending on information technology tools and other capital
equipment after the tech bubble burst. The collapse in business
investment hit the manufacturing sector early and hard, pushing it
into recession in autumn 2000, well ahead of the rest of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   While other sectors were still experiencing the so-called
Goldilocks economy--not too hot, not too cold, but just
right--manufacturing tumbled like Alice in Wonderland into an
unexpectedly deep hole.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't notice, because other parts of the economy
kept plugging," said David Huether, an economist with the
Washington-based National Assn. of Manufacturers. "But for
manufacturers, the downturn was severe."</TE>
<TE>   The toll can be measured in pink slips. Manufacturers have shed
more than 1.5 million workers since July 2000, with 1 million of
those coming since the start of the U.S. recession last March. That
represents 80% of all U.S. jobs lost so far in this downturn, even
though factory workers represent just 13% of the domestic labor
force. Nearly 45% of those losses have come in just three
categories--electronics, transportation and industrial machinery,
reflecting the double whammy of the tech meltdown and the terrorist
attacks that grounded the nation's aviation industry.</TE>
<TE>   Business Inventories Fell at Record Pace Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Factory production has plunged 7.8% from its peak in June 2000, a
larger decline than the 6.2% drop seen during the early-'90s
recession. At present, more than one-quarter of the nation's
factories have idle capacity. The situation is particularly grim in
high-tech manufacturing, where capacity utilization recently hit an
all-time low of 60.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia-based Stockwell Rubber Co. is among those feeling the
pain. The family-owned firm expanded its plant in late 2000 to meet
surging demand for silicone rubber seals and gaskets used in wireless
devices, only to watch those orders dry up almost overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "We cut the ribbon just in time for the spigot to get turned off,"
said company President Bill Stockwell. "It was very sudden."</TE>
<TE>   But after a 2001 marked by red ink and layoffs, Stockwell said,
his phones now are ringing with customers requesting preliminary
designs and bids. Some of that early interest already has resulted in
orders. Even clients in the beleaguered telecom sector are calling
again.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, these companies have got to make some new
products," said Stockwell, who is anticipating double-digit revenue
growth in 2002. Inventories "have been ground down about as tight as
they can go."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, business inventories have fallen at a record pace over
the last year as companies wary of getting stuck with unsold goods
cleaned out their warehouses and used up spare parts without
reordering. Business inventories fell a further 1% in November, the
10th straight month of contraction, with stockpiles dropping to
nearly two-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Economists say skeletal inventories mean that even a slight
increase in new orders will lead to more activity in the nation's
factories this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Any upturn in demand should translate into improved production,"
said Michael Burt, an economist with West Chester, Pa.-based
Economy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Don Scott, whose Ohio company makes hydraulic cylinders for heavy
trucks and other industrial equipment, is expecting such a bounce. He
said his automotive customers have drawn down their parts stockpiles
dramatically and are soliciting quotes in anticipation of stronger
sales in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "When [that business] comes back it won't be nice and gradual,"
said Scott, general manager of the hydraulic cylinder division of
Waltco Truck Equipment Co. in Tallmadge, Ohio. "They're going to want
everything in a week . . . because they're so lean on the inventory."</TE>
<TE>   Rise in New Orders Bigger Than Expected</TE>
<TE>   Despite the massive liquidation, manufacturing output has
continued to decline, but at a slowing rate. December's 0.1%
contraction represents the third straight month of improvement and
the smallest monthly decline since July.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, December's 1.7% rise in new orders for durable goods
was a bigger increase than analysts had projected. Strong defense
orders helped. But a close reading of the numbers shows strengthening
across a broad spectrum of industries. Orders for big-ticket
non-defense goods posted their third consecutive month of growth,
helped by gains in everything from motor vehicles and home appliances
to construction machinery and semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's factories continue to shed jobs, but at a slower
pace. Last month manufacturing employment fell by 89,000 jobs,
compared with average losses of 137,000 a month in the fourth quarter
of 2001. Despite the continued job losses, the factory workweek rose
by 0.4 hour to 40.7 hours in December, while factory overtime rose
0.2 hour to 3.9 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Other indicators hold promise as well. The Institute for Supply
Management's latest purchasing manager's index--a much-watched
barometer of what's doing in the manufacturing trenches--rose to 49.9
in January, its highest level since August 2000. A reading above 50
indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding.</TE>
<TE>   The index's new-orders component was particularly strong for the
second straight month, helped by increases in orders for a variety of
manufactured products, from computers and industrial equipment to
electronic components and wood products. A recent forecast by the
Manufacturers Alliance also is projecting higher factory orders this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, economists say the manufacturing recovery will be uneven,
with some capital goods makers not seeing a true rebound until the
second half of 2002 and many high-tech manufacturers not until 2003
at the earliest. But some makers of consumer-related goods already
are on the upswing.</TE>
<TE>   Backyard Adventures Inc., an Amarillo, Texas-based maker of
redwood swing sets and other home playground equipment, expects sales
to grow 10% to 15% this year after a sluggish 2001. Orders for the
company's playscapes, which retail for $2,500 to $10,000, swooned
along with the stock market in early 2001, according to company
President Charles Sammann.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my customers are connected to Wall Street," Sammann
said.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent contract with a major retailer, a healthy housing
market and rising consumer confidence have Sammann upbeat about 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm adding another shift next week," he said recently. "We are
extremely busy."</TE>
<TE>   Machines also are humming at Colbrit Manufacturing, where
operations manager Cruz is likewise seeing early signs of a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the stamping plant's automotive business drop
significantly in 2001, Cruz said, he's getting calls to ramp up
production for a metal part used in the exhaust systems of
sport-utility vehicles and light trucks. He credited the Big Three
auto makers' popular no-interest financing offer for thinning the
glut of vehicles on dealers' lots.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1979 by Cruz's father, Jerry, a Colombian immigrant,
Colbrit got its start punching out low-margin, commodity electronics
parts. When that business began migrating overseas, Colbrit
diversified its customer base and changed its focus to compete on the
basis of design expertise and rapid turnaround instead of just price.</TE>
<TE>   Today the company employs 30 workers and has attracted a second
generation: 34-year-old Cruz and brother Lee Cruz, 31, who heads the
company's quality assurance. Cruz said the company's metamorphosis
has been critical to weathering the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be here today if we hadn't made the changes," Cruz
said. "Some of our competitors aren't going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the downturn has only accelerated an ongoing shakeout in
low-margin industries such as apparel and textiles that already were
unraveling under the weight of cheap imports.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's aerospace industry also has been hammered by
plummeting commercial aircraft construction since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Though government data shows that orders for
non-defense aircraft and parts posted solid growth in December, those
gains have yet to trickle down to manufacturers such as John
Schoolland.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Camarillo-based Omega Technologies Inc., a maker of
aircraft tools, has seen his company's sales shrink from a peak of
$10 million annually in the late 1990s to $3.5 million in 2001. This
year looks to be even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not seeing any signs of a turnaround," Schoolland said. "Call
me in six months."</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers say a sizable number of ailing firms won't
survive this recession, and it will take years for the manufacturing
sector to recover its recent job losses. But some manufacturers are
getting serious about staying competitive in the face of this
wrenching downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Masters, a Cleveland-based expert on Japanese-style
production practices, was hoping to attract 100 manufacturing
companies for a recent seminar in Ohio. He figured even that number
was too optimistic given the troubled economy. To his amazement,
nearly 300 signed up to learn how to make their plants more
efficient.</TE>
<TE>   "They're looking toward the future," Masters said. "That's a
positive sign."</TE>

<HD>Enron Excesses May Spur Salary Reforms</HD>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The collapse of Enron Corp., whose executives last week either
pleaded the 5th Amendment or offered testimony to Congress that
strained credulity, has provoked demands for reform among angry
investors, politicians and the public.</LD>
<LD>   So far, talk of reform has concentrated mainly on accounting. But
soon it will turn to money--the big money that Enron executives
pocketed while the ship went down and employees were hurt. Enron's
top officers gained tens of millions of dollars from stock option
gains and other forms of compensation on top of their
multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses. Similar patterns have been
seen at other companies, notably the recently failed Global Crossing
Ltd. Employees lose while top brass walk away with large fortunes.</LD>
<LD>   Reforms are needed to bring discipline to executive compensation,
which has become "extreme," says the dean of management experts,
Peter F. Drucker of Claremont Graduate University.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Enron's collapse and the aftermath of the '90s stock
market boom make this a watershed time for improving corporate
accountability. "It recalls the era of Theodore Roosevelt," says
Warren Bennis, distinguished business professor at USC, referring to
the president who attacked corporate trusts at the beginning of the
last century.</TE>
<TE>   Drucker predicts reform will come within the next five years and
will be in the form of new kinds of audits. In addition to the
standard tax audit, "we will have a management audit," Drucker says,
to evaluate the risks management faces and how well it's conducting
the business. "And finally we will have the economic audit, of all
the corporation's relations in industry and in the community," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Drucker, a scholar of management science and author of more than
30 books, puts today's executive pay in historic perspective: "J.P.
Morgan, no enemy of wealth, once said that a reasonable ratio of
management pay to that of the average worker would be 20 to 1. But in
U.S. business today it is 500 to 1."</TE>
<TE>   That's not exaggerated. Average total pay, including stock option
gains, for chief executives of America's largest companies rose past
$15 million in 2000, says Kevin Murphy, professor of finance at USC's
Marshall School of Business and a national authority on compensation.</TE>
<TE>   And yet such incentives have proved an utter failure, Drucker
says. "There is not one shred of evidence that the extreme
compensation of executives has improved company performance. None!"</TE>
<TE>   To remedy the situation, Bennis says, "government needs to impose
rules on corporate directors to do their job of protecting
shareowners interests."</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. G. Monks, onetime head of the Labor Department office
that protects the U.S. pension system and founder of several firms
devoted to corporate reform, thinks the present may recall the 1930s,
when legislation created the Securities and Exchange Commission to
prevent investment frauds of the kind that proliferated in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Today's specific problem is abuse of stock options and other
incentive systems, experts say. Companies have given top
management--and broader groups of employees--incentive options to buy
company stock at a favorable price for years.</TE>
<TE>   Stock option gains in the '90s are largely the reason that
executive pay has gone so far beyond average worker compensation.
Even so, executives have finagled more. If stock prices fall, making
options less valuable, compliant boards of directors often have
repriced the options to benefit executives.</TE>
<TE>   "Tyson Foods [last year] took 150,000 executive options that had
lost value and simply replaced them with shares of restricted stock.
It's not an incentive but a payoff at the expense of shareholders,"
says Frank Glassner, head of Compensation Design Group, a New
York-based consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and Global Crossing Chairman
Gary Winnick received gifts of restricted stock along with loans from
their company treasuries, a complex way of giving tax-benefited
compensation that also dilutes the interests of other shareholders
and arguably misuses corporate cash.</TE>
<TE>   Graef Crystal, longtime critic of excessive management
compensation, says stock options should be restored to long-term
duration. Options were intended to align the motivations of man-
agers with those of owners for long-term success of the com- pany.
But recently, Crystal notes, executives have been able to cash in
options after only a year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's speculation, not incentive. Make them go five years before
exercising. That way the company and shareholders can benefit too,"
because management will pursue longer-term strategies, Crystal says.</TE>
<TE>   If the government does not require better control of stock option
compensation, as the British government now is doing by requiring
that the value of options be fully stated in financial reports, the
major investing institutions, such as the California and New York
public employee pension funds, should press their case on company
managements, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   What's occurring now is more than a backlash against rich
executives, which tends to happen after an economic boom, Drucker
says. This time the reaction is selective. Bill Gates' great wealth
is not resented because it was earned in building Microsoft Corp.,
where employees--and arguably the economy and society--also
benefited. But outsized rewards for corporate managers at companies
such as Enron are resented because the public believes the rewards
have not been earned and that ordinary employees have been cheated.</TE>
<TE>   Also, when a company collapses, the pain may extend to more than
employees and shareholders. Today's company may have numerous
alliances and obligations to long-term programs that may not appear
on financial statements, such as research programs at a university
and obligations to employees and communities. "The enterprise has
human and social obligations that will be evaluated in future,"
Drucker says.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Enron, "I think we will see a greater role for
public and government oversight of the corporation, a reaction to the
'market rules' philosophy of the last 25 years," Bennis says.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's fall will have reverberations indeed.</TE>

<HD>Changes in Code Could Trip Up Unsuspecting Filers</HD>
<DH>The IRS is seeing errors on early returns beause of the
complexity of the new tax breaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are only a few new twists that taxpayers need to worry about
when filing their 2001 taxes. But what the changes lack in numbers,
they make up for in complexity.</LD>
<LD>   Early filers already are making errors on the rate-reduction
credit--the only new item on this year's standard Form 1040. Some
people who received this credit through refund checks last year are
improperly claiming it again on their returns. Others, who didn't get
checks and are due a credit, have missed it completely, the Internal
Revenue Service reports.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a guide to what taxpayers need to watch out for this filing
season:</LD>
<TE>   * Child tax credit: This credit is available to taxpayers with
dependent children or grandchildren who were younger than 17 at the
end of 2001. As a credit, it is subtracted from the taxes you owe
rather than from your pretax income.</TE>
<TE>   The credit has been increased to as much as $600 a child, up from
$500. And if the amount of the credit you're due exceeds the amount
of tax you owe, the government will send you a check for the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news: Although the credit is more generous, it's far more
complicated for people at both ends of the income spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Lower-income parents, for example, could qualify for the
refundable portion of the credit. But to claim it, they must fill out
a worksheet--Form 8812--which takes into account the amount of Social
Security taxes they paid, the number of children claimed as
dependents and their income.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimates that preparing, copying and filing this 13-line
worksheet will add nearly an hour to the time it takes an average
taxpayer to file a return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's complicated, but the benefit is worth the work," said Brenda
Schafer, senior tax research coordinator for H&amp;R Block in Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   For upper-income parents, the credit is means tested. Translation:
Anyone who earns more than a set amount will lose all or a portion of
the credit. The applicable income thresholds are $75,000 for single
filers and heads of households and $110,000 for married couples
filing jointly.</TE>
<TE>   * Alternative minimum tax: Fewer taxpayers will be hit by the
alternative minimum tax this year, largely because the exemption
amounts have been increased. Nonetheless, those with large capital
gains, unusually high state tax deductions or gains from certain
types of stock options may have to grapple with this parallel tax
system.</TE>
<TE>   * New capital gains rate for a few: The long-term capital gains
rate for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% brackets is lower this year,
falling from 10% to 8%. This rate applies to profits from the sale of
stocks, bonds or other investments sold after five or more years of
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The new long-term rate doesn't apply to higher-income taxpayers or
extend to all types of asset sales. Rental real estate and
collectibles sold at a profit may be taxed at a different rate,
regardless of the holding period.</TE>
<TE>   Those who can claim the 8% rate must fill out a 37-line worksheet
in addition to the 40-line Schedule D.</TE>
<TE>   * Investments in small companies: There's another new
capital-gains rule that applies to any taxpayer--no matter their tax
bracket--who held a long-term investment in a small business. (This
law isn't new. Taxpayers could first take advantage of it in 1998,
but tax experts believe more investors could qualify because of the
large number of start-up companies in the mid-1990s.)</TE>
<TE>   Those who realized a gain from the sale of stock in a "qualified
small business" held for more than five years are allowed to exclude
up to half of that gain from tax. But if they do, the remaining gain
will be taxed at a 28% rate.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify, the business must be a U.S. corporation that had $50
million or less in gross assets when the stock was issued. Service
sector firms in health, law, engineering and architecture are
excluded, as are hospitality, farming, insurance, finance and mineral
extraction companies.</TE>
<TE>   * Rate-reduction credit: Remember all those rebate checks the
government mailed out last year? They were designed to give workers
an immediate benefit from the new 10% tax bracket. The rate-reduction
credit is for everyone who qualified for a refund last year but
didn't get a check.</TE>
<TE>   Those who received rebate checks--or who qualified but the check
was seized to pay a government debt, such as back taxes or child
support--should skip this credit. They do not qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Those who qualify can claim a credit of $300 if single; $500 if a
head of household; and $600 if married, filing jointly.</TE>
<TE>   * Estate-tax changes: The estate-tax exemption--the amount of
money that can pass tax-free to heirs--rose to $675,000 last year
from $650,000 in 2000. The gift-tax exemption remains at $10,000,
which means that anyone can give anyone else up to that amount
without having to file a gift-tax return.</TE>
<TE>   * Deductions for student loan interest: Taxpayers can deduct more
of the interest they paid on student loans. Up to $2,500 can be
deducted by workers who earn less than $40,000 if single or $60,000
if married and filing jointly. The catch: The interest must be for
loans that are in the first 60 months of repayment.</TE>
<TE>   Deductions for those who earn more than the threshold amounts will
be reduced or eliminated based on a formula spelled out in the
10-line Student Loan Interest Deduction Worksheet.</TE>
<TE>   * Relief for victims of terrorism: Federal income taxes owed by
persons killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, last fall's anthrax
scare or the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were retroactively wiped away
by a law signed in January. The law covers taxes for the year of the
attackand the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The estates of approximately 4,000 terrorism victims are due a
minimum of $10,000 each. If a victim's total tax bill for those two
years was less than $10,000, the survivors or executors of their
estates can get a refund check for the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS expects to have guidance--Publication 3920--on how to
claim terrorism-related refunds posted on its Web site at www.irs.gov
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   * Inflation adjustments: Some tax thresholds have been adjusted
for inflation, including the break-points for marginal tax brackets
and the thresholds for phasing out deductions.</TE>
<TE>   The two inflation adjustments that the majority of taxpayers will
use are:</TE>
<TE>   * The standard deduction--the deduction for taxpayers who don't
itemize--rises from $7,350 to $7,600 for married couples filing
jointly; from $6,450 to $6,650 for heads of households; and from
$4,400 to $4,550 for singles.</TE>
<TE>   * The personal exemption--the tax deduction you get for yourself
and each dependent in your household--rises from $2,800 to $2,900
each.</TE>

<HD>Power of Deductions</HD>
<DH>The new tax breaks won't offer much help on your 2001
returns, but if you start planning now, they could pay off next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans who hoped the new tax breaks Congress passed last year
might help them save big money this filing season probably will be
disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   There are dozens of significant changes in the tax code, including
liberalized retirement-savings provisions and increased
college-savings options. But only a few of the new tax breaks went
into effect during 2001 and thus are of any use on the tax forms that
must be in the mail by April 15.</LD>
<LD>   But cheer up. Many of the tax breaks go into effect this year. By
planning now--yes, even while struggling with your 2001 tax
return--you can take advantage of them and save hundreds, even
thousands, of dollars on your taxes next year.</LD>
<TE>   "Even people who can't take advantage of all the breaks could save
a few hundred dollars if they plan ahead," said Joel Isaacson,
director of tax planning at Joel Isaacson &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The savings will vary widely among taxpayers, however, because the
new law's benefits target specific groups.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who are adopting children, going back to school or
saving for retirement or their children's college tuition will
qualify for the biggest breaks. A taxpayer with no children and no
savings will benefit only from slight reductions in the marginal tax
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   There's a caveat in all of this for Californians. Until
legislation is passed in Sacramento bringing the state's tax laws
into line with the changes made in the federal tax code, California
residents won't be able to claim any of these breaks on their state
tax returns. But they can still qualify for big savings from Uncle
Sam.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the major changes that go into effect this year and can
be claimed on U.S. tax returns due April 15, 2003:</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans rise
$500, to $11,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to 457 retirement plans rise $2,500, to
$11,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to traditional and Roth IRAs rise $1,000,
to $3,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Individuals older than 50 can make additional "catch-up"
contributions to retirement plans. The maximum is $500 a year for an
IRA and $1,000 for a 401(k), 403(b) or 457 plan.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to Education IRAs rise $1,500, to $2,000
annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Distributions from education savings accounts, also known as 529
plans, become tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   * Deductions for student loan interest are expanded to cover more
loans and higher income levels.</TE>
<TE>   * As much as $3,000 in higher-education expenses become
deductible.</TE>
<TE>   * The value of adoption tax credits is doubled for normal
adoptions, allowing taxpayers to get credits for a maximum of $10,000
in qualified expenses. Those who adopt special-needs children can
claim a $10,000 tax credit, even if their qualified adoption expenses
are less than that.</TE>
<TE>   * Self-employed people can deduct more of their health insurance
expenses--as much as 70%, up from 60% in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new tax breaks aren't available to taxpayers above
certain income levels. But some of the breaks--so-called
before-the-line deductions--can lower your income to the point that
you may qualify for some of the other tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Smart taxpayers who are near the income thresholds should consider
using more before-the-line deductions to get the full benefit of
other lucrative credits.</TE>
<TE>   Before-the-line deductions are chiefly contributions to retirement
and employee benefit plans, such as 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans. But
they also include interest paid on student loans, alimony payments,
moving expenses, self-employment taxes and health insurance
deductions for self-employed people.</TE>
<TE>   Before-the-line deductions reduce your adjusted gross income,
which is used to determine eligibility for child tax credits, the
Hope tax credit, student loan interest deductions and other tax
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a single mother with $46,000 in income and two teenage
children, one of whom is starting college in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, taxpayers can claim a credit of up to $1,500 to
recover a portion of their first $2,000 in college education
expenses. But this credit phases out once a taxpayer's adjusted gross
income exceeds a certain level--$41,000 for the 2002 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   If this single mother doesn't contribute to a retirement plan or
claim some other before-the-line deduction to reduce her income,
she'll be able to claim only half of the tax credit, or $750.</TE>
<TE>   But if she contributes $5,000 to a 401(k) plan, her adjusted gross
income drops to $41,000, allowing her to claim the entire $1,500
credit. Also, her taxable income drops and her total federal income
tax bill falls from $3,101 to $1,601.</TE>
<TE>   The income limits vary by tax break, so it's difficult to figure
out what you'll be able to take advantage of. But anyone considering
actions that have tax consequences, such as refinancing a house,
adopting a child or sending a child to college, should look at the
income thresholds that could affect them and see what type of benefit
they might reap by increasing their before-the-line deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Other tax breaks coming this year could provide savings even
further down the road.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, last summer's tax law boosted the annual
contribution limit on Roth IRAs to $3,000 this year. Those 50 or
older can contribute an extra $500, for a total of $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike regular IRAs, Roth IRAs don't offer upfront tax deductions.
But when the money is pulled out at retirement, everything--principal
and interest--is exempt from federal tax.</TE>
<TE>   To figure the potential tax savings a Roth IRA might provide,
taxpayers need to project an approximate rate of return and determine
how much they might save and for how long.</TE>
<TE>   Say you're 50 years old and you put $3,500 in a Roth each year for
the next 10 years. At a 9% annual rate of return, the account would
grow to $53,175 by the time you turned 60. If you withdrew all of the
money at that point--and assuming you were in the 30% tax
bracket--the Roth account would allow you to avoid $5,452 in federal
taxes. (That's 30% of the investment earnings of $18,175.)</TE>
<TE>   Education savings accounts--both 529 plans and Education
IRAs--offer a similar benefit. Federal law makes distributions from
these accounts tax-free if the money is used for qualified education
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no deductions for contributing to the accounts,
the future tax savings possible by financing higher education through
these accounts can be significant--particularly for parents who have
small children and plenty of time to accumulate investment returns.</TE>

<TE>   Common Errors</TE>
<TE>   Avoid the most common filing errors. Double-check Social Security
numbers. Make sure the names on your tax return match the names on
your Social Security cards. Include Social Security numbers for all
dependents claimed. Check your math. Sign and date your return. Don't
claim an exemption if you or your spouse is claimed as a dependent on
someone else's return. Send the federal return to the IRS address in
Fresno and the state return to the California Franchise Tax Board
address in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Tax Software, Web Sites</TE>
<TE>   The two best-selling software packages</TE>
<TE>   are Intuit's TurboTax and Microsoft's TaxCut. TurboTax
(www.turbotax.com) costs about $30 for the deluxe CD version; and
online version costs $19.95 for feceral returns and $12.95 for state
returns. TaxCut (www.taxcut.com) costs $24.95 for either the deluxe
CD version or the downloadable version.</TE>
<TE>   For Faster Refunds</TE>
<TE>   * Electronic filing shaves weeks off the time it takes to get your
refund. The system also checks your return for the kind of errors
that would otherwise delay your check. 4 Allow the IRS to deposit
your refund directly into your checking account, and get you your
money a week or so earlier. Information on direct deposit is included
in your tax return instructions or tax preparation software.</TE>
<TE>   * File early. More than half the tax returns filed arrive between
March 15 and April 15, clogging the system.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't borrow. Those ''instant refund'' offers at tax preparation
chains are really just loans with high interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Free Tax Prep Options</TE>
<TE>   The elderly and people with low incomes can get free tax
preparation help provided by volunteers. For more information about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the
Elderly (TCE), call the IRS at (800) 829-1040 or the state Francise
Tax Board at (800) 338-0505. 4 TurboTax provides free tax preparation
software at its Web site, www.turbotax.com, for people with adjusted
gross incomes under $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Tax preparation site TaxAct.com offers free tax preparation
software for federal returns only at www.taxact.com. Users can
download the software.</TE>
<TE>   Payment options</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who owe money to the state or federal government can pay
by check, credit card or direct debit (an electronic withdrawal from
a bank account). Official Payments Corp. ([800] 2PAY-TAX) and
PhoneCharge Inc. ([888] ALL-TAXX) process credit card payments for
the IRS. Official Payments also processes payments to the state. Both
companies accept Discover/Novus, American Express and MasterCard and
both charge a convenience fee of 2% to 3% of the billed amount (about
$25 on a $1,000 tax payment. Taxpayers who file electronically may
pay their bill through an automatic withdrawal from their checking or
other bank account. The service is free and the direct debit can be
scheduled to occur as late as April 15. The procedure, which requires
the bank's routing number as well as the account number, is included
in the e-filing software.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Your Calendar</TE>
<TE>   * April 15: Due date for income tax returns or for extension
application. Last day for tax-deductible IRA contributions that still
count toward the 2001 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   * Aug. 15: Deadline for submitting 2001 tax return and owed taxes
if you received an extension for April. Second extension application
due.</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 15: Final deadline for submitting 2001 tax return if
granted second extension.  If You Can't File by April 15</TE>
<TE>   If you can't complete your tax return on time, file Form 4868,
Application for Automatic Extension, with the IRS by April 15 to get
a four-month extension. (The state extension will be granted
automatically when you file the form.) If you owe, you still must
estimate and pay your taxes by April 15, even if you take longer to
file. However, file even if you can't pay: Penalties for failing to
file are much greater than penalties for failing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   * Anyone who filed a tax return last year can also request an
extension by calling (888) 796-1074 from March 1 to April 15.</TE>
<TE>   New Addresses</TE>
<TE>   The IRS' reorganization means you may be sending your federal tax
return to a new address. California residents who are owed a refund
should send their individual tax returns to the IRS, Fresno, CA
93888-0002. Individual returns with payments should be sent to the
IRS, P.O. Box 7704, San Francisco, CA 94120-7704. Business returns
(forms 940, 1120, etc.) will be sent to either Ogden, Utah or Dallas,
Texas; consult form filing instructions for details. The IRS says it
will forward incorrectly addressed returns without penalty if the
returns are filed on time.</TE>

<CX>   State tax information--An article in Sunday's Business section
included incorrect information about office hours and an office location
for the Franchise Tax Board. Its offices are open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday. In addition, the state tax agency no longer has an
office in Burbank. The nearest office is 15350 Sherman Way, Suite 100,

<LD>Lawmakers Focus on Enron Execs</LD>
<LD>   The week started with former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay
backing out of testifying before Congress and ended with him agreeing
to appear this week.</LD>
<LD>   In between, Lay's former No. 2, Jeffrey K. Skilling, made a
compelling witness before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on oversight and investigations in an atmosphere rife with outrage.
But Skilling told lawmakers that he knew nothing about the hidden
debt or inflated profits that led to the company's collapse.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, The Times reported that Skilling was among a handful of
senior Enron executives who sold $44 million in company stock as
concerns were growing inside the company that losses racked up by a
group of obscure partnerships could spill into public view.</TE>
<TE>   New Disclosure Rules Proposed for Analysts</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers proposed new disclosure
rules for Wall Street analysts, but many said the plan falls short of
solving the industry's conflict-of-interest problem.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, devised at the urging of Congress and securities
regulators, includes a requirement that past ratings be plotted on a
stock's price chart. A common complaint is that Wall Street analysts
are so biased that they often reiterate "buy" ratings on crumbling
stocks, such as Enron Corp. last year, with which their firms also
have investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the rules sought by the association, the industry's
self-regulatory agency, match those the Securities Industry Assn.
trade group unveiled last summer--guidelines major brokerages say
they already follow.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting Allegations Dog Global Crossing</TE>
<TE>   Troubled Global Crossing Ltd., which filed for bankruptcy
protection two weeks ago, is being dogged by a former employee's
allegations that the company used misleading accounting methods to
boost its financials. The Bermuda company, which has executive
offices in Beverly Hills, now faces investigations by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the FBI. While the company awaits other
bailout bids, Global Crossing this week unveiled more details about a
proposed $750-million investment from two Asian investors, but that
plan is likely to face stiff opposition because it wipes out
shareholders and leaves little for Global Crossing's many creditors,
bankers, and bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   Trader Suspected of Piling Up Bank Losses</TE>
<TE>   Ireland's biggest bank disclosed that a rogue employee involved in
currency trading secretly lost $750million at its U.S. subsidiary,
jolting European markets and triggering a federal criminal
investigation into another financial debacle.</TE>
<TE>   The suspected fraud at Allied Irish Banks' Baltimore-based
subsidiary, Allfirst Bank, would be one of the biggest trading
scandals since Singapore dealer Nick Leeson brought down Britain's
Barings Bank in 1995 after piling up $1.4billion in concealed losses.</TE>
<TE>   Allied Irish said John Rusnak, 37, who was well-regarded in his
seven years at the bank, ran up the huge losses last year at Allfirst
Bank, where he was part of a small but aggressive currency-trading
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The bank subsequently said it would centralize currency-trading
operations and open an internal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Profit Falls Amid Default Fears</TE>
<TE>   Telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. said fourth-quarter profit
plunged 64% and 2002 results will be lower than expected, partly
because of an upcoming charge of as much as $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But investors, fearing that the Mississippi-based company might
succumb to the financial devastation sweeping the telecom industry,
gave the company a reprieve after Chairman Bernard Ebbers said
WorldCom has access to $10billion in cash and that its operations,
though struggling, are sound.</TE>
<TE>   Forum Sees More Sluggish Times</TE>
<TE>   The anti-globalization forces were a sideshow. Business and
government leaders attending this year's World Economic Forum in New
York were far more preoccupied with an unanticipated triple threat:
Enron Corp., Argentina and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   In the heavily guarded Waldorf-Astoria hotel, these very different
sources of political and financial uncertainty combined to cast a
pall over the forum's 32nd annual meeting, making participants
unusually reluctant to make firm predictions about the economic
future.</TE>
<TE>   There was a consensus about global and regional trends: The
world's leading economies will remain sluggish this year, most of the
industrialists and finance ministers at the five-day talk fest
concurred.</TE>
<TE>   NASA to Launch Rocket Propulsion System</TE>
<TE>   Quietly inserted in NASA's proposed budget for 2003 released last
week was a $125-million initiative for developing a nuclear-powered
propulsion system, which would aid exploration of the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed project is being resurrected after a 30-year hiatus.
NASA abandoned the project in 1972 after it was deemed infeasible.</TE>
<TE>   NASA scientists hope advances in nuclear reactors and rocket
propulsion systems will give the quest for a nuclear rocket new life.</TE>
<TE>   Such spaceships would have small nuclear reactors, which would
give the engines virtually unlimited fuel supply to travel to the
farthest reaches of the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Wins Upgrade of Foreign Debt Rating</TE>
<TE>   Mexico received a long-awaited seal of approval from the financial
community when Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. raised its foreign debt rating
to investment grade. The rating is a boost to President Vicente Fox's
economic policies.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrade to BBB- from BB+ will reduce Mexico's cost of
borrowing on international markets and generate a significant
increase in foreign investment. The move follows similar upgrades by
Moody's and Fitch.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's sound fiscal and monetary policy, low inflation and
improved tax collections have improved economic stability and
enhanced Mexico's status of "safe haven" for foreign investment, S&amp;P
said.</TE>

<HD>The Right Preparer Can Ease the Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most difficult decisions taxpayers must make each year is
not whether to itemize or file electronically. It's deciding who will
prepare their returns in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of U.S. taxpayers turn to paid preparers, ranging
from part-timers working out of their homes to certified public
accountants and attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining 45% of taxpayers tackle their returns themselves,
either by hand or using tax-preparation software. The result is
sometimes a mismatch between the complexity of the return and the
competency of the preparer.</LD>
<TE>   For example, each year more than 750,000 taxpayers pay a preparer
to file the simple two-page 1040EZ form--probably an unnecessary
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Other taxpayers tackle some of the most difficult returns without
professional help, wrestling with business depreciation schedules or
the alternative minimum tax--elements that even do-it-yourself
advocates agree are usually best left to pros.</TE>
<TE>   Finding guidance  on the question of who should prepare a return
is difficult, however. The IRS steers clear of advising taxpayers on
this issue, although the agency offers tips about what to look for in
a pro.</TE>
<TE>   But tax experts offer some general guidelines about when it's
smart to do it yourself, and when it's better to hire someone--and
who that someone should be.</TE>
<TE>   Most people can tackle a simple tax return--a 1040EZ or 1040A, for
example, with one W-2 form from one employer, no itemized deductions,
no tax credits and little or no investment income.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Tyson, author of "Taxes for Dummies," also believes that many
people can successfully wade through more complex returns, including
those with mortgage interest deductions, multiple employers, child
tax credits and some investment income. But taxpayers who want to
prepare their own returns must be willing to invest some time.</TE>
<TE>   Although the simplest returns take only a few hours, the IRS
estimates that it takes more than 28 hours to research, organize and
complete a standard 1040 return with three common schedules--Schedule
A for itemized deductions, Schedule B for interest and ordinary
deductions and Schedule D for capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   Do-it-yourselfers should clear a full weekend early in the tax
season to give themselves time to do necessary research and in case
they run into trouble that requires professional help.</TE>
<TE>   Preparers who have plenty of openings in February often have to
turn clients away as the April 15 deadline approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers preparing their own returns also should consider using
tax-preparation software and filing electronically to reduce errors
and save time, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Software programs check for math errors and flag other problems,
such as deductions that aren't allowed. (The two leading software
programs, Intuit's TurboTax and H&amp;R Block's TaxCut, also offer links
to tax preparers who can help answer questions for a fee.)</TE>
<TE>   E-filing--which must be done through a third party--catches the
most common mistakes. The electronic system won't accept a return if
the math  is incorrect or if the filer used the wrong Social Security
number.</TE>
<TE>   But Tyson believes most taxpayers can do just fine preparing their
returns by hand, particularly if they have a professionally prepared
return from the previous year to use as a guide.</TE>
<TE>   Many people lack the time or inclination to do their own returns.
Others may want to but probably shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   People who need ongoing tax advice generally should hire a tax
professional. This group includes business owners, people with
extensive investments and those who may be affected by the
alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax system that operates by
different rules.</TE>
<TE>   People who have lots of itemized deductions or who have used
incentive stock options to buy company stock often trigger the
alternative minimum tax.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people need tax professionals when complexities come up
in their lives," said Barbara Rosenbaum, a Santa Monica certified
public accountant. "You can't strategize with [tax-preparation]
software."</TE>
<TE>   Complex tax returns have more gray areas where judgment calls are
required. Tax pros usually are better at making those judgments than
lay people, who may not have read the latest Tax Court decision on
the issue, Rosenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to a professional also is a good idea after any major life
change: a marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, death or big increase
or decrease in income.</TE>
<TE>   Certain returns may be more likely to trigger an audit, in which
case a professional can be handy in preparing the return and in
helping the taxpayer deal with the IRS, tax experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those more likely to face audits are small-business owners,
people in the entertainment industry and those employed in cash-based
businesses such as waitressing or cab driving, according to CCH Inc.,
a tax research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Not all preparers can represent a taxpayer in an IRS audit,
however. Only enrolled agents, certified public accountants and tax
attorneys are allowed to handle such matters.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to hire a tax professional should first determine
how much help they need. Relatively simple returns can be handled by
storefront or chain operations. More complex returns may need more
expertise:</TE>
<TE>   * Registered tax preparers are the first rung of the tax-preparer
ladder and are usually who you meet when you go to a national tax
preparation chain such as H&amp;R Block or one of its competitors.</TE>
<TE>   California law requires that anyone who prepares a return for a
fee must first earn this designation, which requires instruction in
tax law and continuing education.</TE>
<TE>   Unless they have another credential, such as EA (enrolled agent)
or CPA (certified public accountant), registered tax preparers can't
represent you in an audit. They are best used by lower- to
middle-income taxpayers with relatively simple returns. Costs range
from $60 to $150 for a typical return.</TE>
<TE>   * Enrolled agents are tax preparation specialists and many are
former IRS employees. They have ongoing education requirements and
can be a good fit for many taxpayers with moderately complex returns,
and those who want their preparer to represent them in an audit.
Enrolled agents charge $100 to $300 to prepare a return. For a
referral, visit www.naea.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Certified public accountants have stringent education and
experience requirements, but not all specialize in tax return
preparation. CPAs who do prepare returns tend to charge more than
most other tax preparers--usually $500 to $1,000 or more, depending
on the return's complexity. But business owners and those with
complicated financial situations may need a CPA's expertise. The
California Society of CPA's Web site at www.calcpa.org  offers
referrals.</TE>
<TE>   * Tax attorneys are the big guns of the tax world. They represent
high-income taxpayers and those whose complicated finances tend to
attract the most IRS attention. Some tax attorneys are also CPAs or
EAs and prepare their clients' returns while others hire out the
work. And don't forget--if you do decide to hire someone to do your
taxes, the fees you pay may be deductible. Be sure to ask your
preparer.</TE>

<HD>Tips for a Happy Return</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Many taxpayers are capable of doing their own returns but may not
have the time--or the patience. But even those who hire help should
spend some time making sure they get the right professional.</LD>
<LD>   Once you've decided which route you want to take, here are some
tips to keep in mind:</LD>
<LD>   For Do-It-Yourselfers</LD>
<TE>   * Get started early: Give yourself enough time to gather necessary
forms, read the instructions and research any difficult topics.</TE>
<TE>   If you find you can't finish your return on your own, an early
start means you'll have time to search for a good tax pro and avoid a
panicked, last-minute scramble.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a good tax guide: IRS Publication 17, "Your Federal Income
Tax," is a fairly comprehensive and readable guide--and it's free.
Tax help books such as "J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 2001" use
Publication 17 as a starting point, adding helpful tips and warnings
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider software: Intuit's TurboTax and H&amp;R Block's TaxCut
offer a question-and-answer format that can point out deductions,
credits and tax traps you might otherwise miss.</TE>
<TE>   These programs also are helpful in preparing California state tax
returns, which can be surprisingly complex.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies also have Web-only versions of their software and
offer professional help for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   For Those Seeking Help</TE>
<TE>   * Determine how much help you need: You don't need to pay a CPA to
file a 1040EZ--neither should you have a storefront chain tackle your
business' corporate filing. Match the complexity of your return with
the appropriate level of expertise and cost.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask lots of questions: Find out what credentials your tax
preparer has, what types of returns he or she typically prepares and
how much the return is likely to cost. (You might want to get the
cost estimate in writing.)</TE>
<TE>   * Get on the same wavelength: More complex returns can require
judgment calls. If you're terrified of an audit, find a preparer
who's conservative. If you're a risk-taker, make sure your pro is
comfortable taking an aggressive approach.</TE>
<TE>   * Beware of fraud: Don't sign a blank return or agree to have a
refund sent anyplace other than to your address. Don't work with a
preparer who guarantees you a refund upfront or who refuses to sign
your return.</TE>

<HD>Talking About a Revolution: Old-School Rivalry Runs Hot</HD>
<DH>Two colleges argue over which holds claim to the title of a
new nation's first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEC MacGILLIS</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may seem like a petty squabble, the academic equivalent of arguing
over a parking space: Which college has the right to claim to be the
first one formed in the new United States?</LD>
<LD>   But what is at stake in the dispute between Washington College and
Dickinson College, the schools say, is nothing less than the
historical truth about the founding of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   For more than two centuries, Washington has proudly proclaimed its
status as the first college founded in the newly created United
States of America. It was chartered in 1782, making it the 10th
college in the 13 Colonies but the first one formed after the
Declaration of Independence.</LD>
<TE>   Now, however, the small private college in Chestertown, Md., is
fending off a challenge to the mantle of primacy from Dickinson, in
Carlisle, Pa., which two years ago started marketing itself as the
first-in-the-nation school. Dickinson was chartered on Sept. 9, 1783.
This, the school argues, makes it the first college founded in the
new America--if you date the nation's birth to the signing of the
Treaty of Paris on Sept. 3, 1783. The treaty ended the Revolutionary
War and secured England's recognition of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The question, the two sides agree, is of great historical
significance: Was the United States' true beginning in 1776, when its
founders proclaimed its independence, or in 1783, when its former
ruler recognized it?</TE>
<TE>   "It's generally agreed by historians everywhere that [the United
States] began with the Declaration of Independence in 1776," says
Washington College President John S. Toll.</TE>
<TE>   Counters Dickinson President William G. Durden: "1776 was
obviously a critical and a proud moment. But the date that was really
significant was the moment that self-proclaimed independence
transformed into an internationally recognized independence. At that
point, Britain said, 'You are a nation. You are cut free.'"</TE>
<TE>   Both presidents say they are keeping the dispute in perspective
and that it hasn't gone beyond a few phone calls, letters and barbs
exchanged at conferences. At the same time, both say their claim to
being the first is central to their school's mission and tradition,
and that they aren't about to give in.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to them and told them it's important they recognize
the primacy of Washington College," says Toll, a former president of
the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Dickinson has changed the wording on its Web site and stationery
from "first college chartered in the new nation" to "newly recognized
nation" to try to mollify its rival but refuses to drop the claim
completely.</TE>
<TE>   "We're of revolutionary stock here. We were founded by
revolutionaries, and we believe our claim as the 'first college in
the newly recognized nation' is a totally justified claim," says
Durden, a former administrator at the Johns Hopkins University and
Sylvan Learning Systems.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the colleges' rivalry dates back to their
founders. Benjamin Rush, the Philadelphia physician and Declaration
of Independence signer who founded Dickinson, feuded with George
Washington, who gave 50 guineas to Washington College, served on its
board and consented to have the school named for him.</TE>
<TE>   Rush, who treated Continental troops in the war, complained
publicly about the quality of medical care for the army and pushed
secretly to have Washington removed as commander-in-chief--a move
that backfired when the general learned of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Both colleges have turned to historians to buttress their
position, but historians themselves are divided on the question.</TE>
<TE>   University of Maryland historian Alison Olson sides with
Dickinson, noting that a sizable minority of colonists, the Tories,
remained loyal to England until the end of the Revolutionary War. In
addition, she said, the outcome of the war--and the fate of the
Colonies--was in doubt until shortly before the Treaty of Paris was
signed.</TE>
<TE>   The country has traditionally celebrated 1776 as its founding, she
adds, because that was the date that served the wartime cause. "It
paid the American propagandists to play up the Declaration, to get
people to fight enthusiastically," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Olson dismisses Washington College's argument that nations such as
France and Holland had recognized the U.S. as early as 1778, saying
that those were simply wartime deals to undercut England.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, says Johns Hopkins University historian Jack Greene, who
dates the nation's founding at the signing of the Articles of
Confederation in 1781--which also gives Washington College the nod.</TE>
<TE>   The wartime alliance between France and the Colonies, he says, was
a treaty between "two sovereign powers." As for the Tories, they
never amounted to more than a third of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "[Dickinson's claim] is a specious argument. It's kind of a Tory
argument, in fact," Greene says.</TE>
<TE>   University of Virginia historian Peter Onuf agrees, saying that
it's the privilege of any "insurgent state" to pick the date of its
founding, and the United States' is clearly July 4, 1776. "It seems
bizarre and ludicrously legalistic to invoke the date that makes
sense in international relations," he says. "[Dickinson's] got a
point, but it's a trivial point."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides find support in David McCullough's bestselling
biography of John Adams. McCullough describes Adams as having
received formal recognition from the French and Dutch before 1783,
but, in summarizing the Treaty of Paris, he writes, "The mighty
Revolution had ended. The new nation was born."</TE>
<TE>   Historians asked to rule on the dispute urge the colleges not to
get too carried away. Still, says Onuf, "If it inspires interest in
American history, I'm all for it."</TE>

<LD>For Nancy Rigg, February is the cruelest month. It's not just the
Valentine's Day reminder that in middle age she is still unattached,
waiting for love. But next Sunday marks the anniversary of the death
of the man who loved her most and best, the man who'd planned to make
her his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-two years ago, Rigg watched as her fiance, Earl Higgins,
was swept to his death while trying to rescue a child from the
rain-swollen Los Angeles River. His drowning inspired Rigg to lead a
years-long public campaign that revolutionized swift-water rescue
operations. It also dashed the dreams she and Higgins shared of
marriage, casting Rigg forever into the role of fiancee.</LD>
<LD>   She would not be wife or widow but would find herself in a niche
that seems to convey a kind of secondary status to survivors of
disaster. Finding themselves there now are the men and women who lost
their would-be spouses in the tragedies of Sept. 11. Although they
hadn't yet pledged "till death do us part," their hearts may be
broken for life, as Riggs can attest.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel like I 'flunked' recovery," Rigg says. "In
happy-ending stories, the heroine finds a new love, and that
relationship is ... part of the affirmation of the [original] love."</TE>
<TE>   She and Higgins shared "what people in California call a 'soul
mate' kind of closeness," she says. "We lived and breathed and did
everything together. We were partners emotionally, professionally ...
in every way, already, for life, we thought.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you've known a relationship like that, it's difficult to
want anything less. And as much as I tried not to have a ghost
trailing me around while I was dating [after he died], I guess it was
always there, hanging over my head."</TE>
<TE>   She never took his name, didn't get to keep his remains, couldn't
share the financial prize that came with the Carnegie Medal for
Heroism that Higgins was awarded eight months after he died. But her
grief was not diminished by the absence of a wedding band.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Rigg was trying to say in a letter she wrote last
month to the New York Times, in response to the newspaper's front
page story on the special problems faced by those who were engaged to
marry victims of the World Trade Center tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 left scores, if not hundreds, of people in the lurch who
were betrothed, but not yet wed, linked in love and intention but not
in the eyes of the law. The loss of their partners landed these
survivors in a sort of legal and emotional limbo. Some are ostracized
by once future in-laws. Others have been forced into debt because
they lack the legal standing to get financial help. Some complain
that their grief is unacknowledged by a public tuned to widows' and
widowers' needs. "Here you lost the most important person in your
life, and nobody gives you any recognition," one fiancee told the New
York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Rigg has traveled similar emotional terrain. She recalls the shock
of Higgins' sudden death, the emptiness she felt when his body wasn't
recovered, the overwhelming sense of isolation.</TE>
<TE>   She and Higgins had just moved here from Colorado and were out for
a walk near Griffith Park, during a brief respite in a string of
fierce winter rains, when Higgins spotted a boy being swept into the
flood channel and ventured in to try to pluck him out. The churning
waters carried them both downstream. The boy managed to scramble to
safety, but Higgins was never seen alive again.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Rigg spent her days posting fliers with Higgins'
picture along the path his body would travel, and her nights alone in
their Atwater Village apartment, still crowded with boxes they'd yet
to unpack. She was staggered not just by her loss, but by the
realization that her four-year relationship with Higgins--their
marriage plans, the possessions they shared, the business they were
building together--meant nothing to those outside their circle of
family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   It took eight months to get access to the bank account, in his
name, that held her money. And when his body washed up in the Long
Beach harbor nine months after he disappeared--with their apartment
keys still in his pocket--Rigg found out from a newspaper reporter.
"When I called [the coroner's office], they wouldn't give me any
information because I wasn't his wife," she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   But hers is not a cautionary tale about the perils of long
engagements or the legal protection marriage conveys. A wedding ring
wouldn't have stopped Higgins from jumping into that river. Married
or not, he'd still be dead.</TE>
<TE>   She just wants the public to consider the emotional needs of
people who lose their would-be spouses. Her life was derailed by her
loss just as certainly as if she and Higgins had been husband and
wife. What rankles her is the assumption that loss matters less in
the absence of a wedding band.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this attitude of 'You're young. You'll find somebody
else, don't worry,'" Rigg says. "People would say that to me, and I'm
thinking, 'Do you have any idea of what love is at all?'"</TE>
<TE>   The suffering of the not-quite-married can be just as disabling
and long-lasting as the grief of husbands and wives, she says. Those
engaged to World Trade Center victims deserve a full measure of
compassion and support, she said in her letter, which was printed in
the New York Times:</TE>
<TE>   "Do not assume that because someone is young, recovery will be
automatic. Falling in love with someone is a rare gift, not like a
pair of slippers you can quickly replace if you lose one.</TE>
<TE>   I did not know it at the time, but Earl was the last man in my
life who wanted to marry me, start a family and be my partner in all
ways."</TE>
<TE>   In the years since Earl Higgins died, Rigg has built a successful
career writing for magazines and television and has become a
nationally recognized expert in urban, swift-water search-and-rescue
operations. She's dated, had a half-dozen boyfriends, even fallen in
love again. But the guy "was trying on potential wives like winter
coats," she says, "and turned out to be a two-timer."</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't given up, she says. Her "heart and mind are open" to
the hope of finding someone else. "I'd love to fall in love again,
I'd love to have that life. ... I've learned that love transcends
death, but that doesn't mean I get up every morning and have a cup of
coffee with Earl's ghost."</TE>
<TE>   Her hearty laugh reveals a woman who has made peace with her pain
and accepted the wound that remains. "Grief runs its natural course,
whether you want to run with it or not," she says. And its duration
and intensity do not rely on wedding rings and marriage vows.</TE>

<HD>Valentine's Day: The Time That Tries the American Male's
Soul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SHEA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Valentine's Day is that unfortunate time of year when the American
male is driven by forces beyond his control to be something he is
not: romantic.</LD>
<LD>   No other occasion, not the birthday, not the always tricky wedding
anniversary, compels the American male to act in a manner that is so
fundamentally contrary to his basic nature.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, the American male's idea of romance can be summed up
in those five little words: Slam. Bam. Thank. You. Ma'am.</LD>
<TE>   Anything beyond that is as alien as the notion of sharing
feelings. But if this is true, then how does one explain such
seemingly contradictory behavior as candlelight dinners, red roses,
the purchasing of things that sparkle?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is really quite simple--Pavlov. Through trial and a lot
of error, the American male has learned that the response to such
stimuli as food, flowers and costly gifts is often very pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   That said, what the American male has never grasped, and will
never, ever grasp, is the underlying rationale. It's a lot like
housebreaking a dog. Old Rover can be trained not to lift his leg
indoors, but he will never understand why.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely assumed that dealing with the intricacies of
Valentine's Day becomes easier with age. In fact, the opposite is
true. If experience teaches us anything, it is that the older the
American male gets, the harder it is for him to escape the day's lacy
noose.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true when the recipient of the aging American
male's Valentine's Day token of affection approaches the intersection
of provocative and practical. Surely there is nothing more ticklish
than determining at what point to make the gift transition from
scanty attire to George Foreman Grill.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Valentine's Day has also always been the
ultimate test of the American male's ability to function under
extreme pressure. What is truly remarkable is just how often he is
able--through a combination of fast talking and fancy footwork--to
escape the day's mushy minefield. On the other hand, when plans go
awry and luck runs out, the consequences can be devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most famous example of this syndrome is the infamous
1929 Valentine's Day Massacre. Although it is believed this crime was
rooted in gangland conflict, that is not the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   What also set the tommy guns to talking that cold Chicago day
involved a frazzled American male mobster, an unhappy moll and a
skimpy red teddy gone terribly wrong.</TE>

<LD>Legendary flying machines--from the Wright glider to the Gemini and
Mercury spacecrafts--and the stories of the daring men who flew them
will be featured in the new Air &amp; Space Gallery at California Science
Center in Exposition Park.</LD>
<LD>   Originally known as Aerospace Hall, a part of the former
California Museum of Science and Industry, the building has been
closed since 1998 for a renovation designed by Frank Gehry.</LD>
<LD>   The gallery, a Smithsonian Affiliate, is scheduled to open to the
public March 9. But last weekend, more than 600 center supporters
paid $400 for a sneak preview of the new venue at "Flight of Fancy,"
the annual Discovery Ball, which marked the center's fourth
anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   Space traveler Dennis Tito was the guest of honor at the black-tie
event, which raised more than $350,000. Tito, who spent $20 million
to join an eight-day Russian Soyuz taxi mission to the International
Space Station last April, told the sold-out audience that his
childhood hobby, building model airplanes, kindled his lifelong
interest in aerospace.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are like sponges. Impressions that they get stay with
them for the rest of their lives," he said. "Space will always be my
passion, and for the rest of my life I'm going to share my
experiences with kids to get them focused on dreams. Anything is
possible in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Among attendees were former Gov. Pete Wilson and current first
lady Sharon Davis, who spoke on her husband's behalf: "Gray had to
attend another event. But I hope the fact that he allotted $19
million in the state budget for the center will make up for it."</TE>
<TE>   Arriving guests walked through a pathway of faux fog, where they
were offered "star" martinis before touring exhibits. The concrete
and metal building, 75 feet tall, displays spacecraft and other means
of flight suspended in a huge open space. The multilevel gallery has
four main areas: Air and Aircraft, Humans in Space, Mission to the
Planets, Stars and Telescopes.</TE>
<TE>   Attractions include a bicycle ride across a high wire spanning the
gallery balcony--Riverside Police Chief Russ Leach was among brave
souls who took a spin.</TE>
<TE>   George Pla and Lon Rosenberg co-chaired the dinner committee,
which included Sharon Allen, Marvin Elkin, Joseph T. Forgatch, Victor
Franco, Karen MacDonald, Ezekiel Pattern Jr., Dean Scarborough and
Jill Sheffield. --Patt Diroll</TE>
<TE>   Ice Capades</TE>
<TE>   In a Broadway-style production that mixed comedy with song and
dance, Bob Newhart joined Christopher Reeve on stage at the Front &amp;
Center benefit that netted $100,000 for scholarships at Cal State
Fullerton. Appearing before thousands of fans at the Pond in
Anaheim--750 of them at a black-tie dinner staged atop the hockey
rink, 3,600 in the stands--the two were given personalized musical
introductions by members of the university's theater and dance
department. "I never thought anybody could do my name for six
minutes. I never thought anybody would want to hear my name for six
minutes," Newhart quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Observed Reeve: "I've never experienced anything like that in my
life. The music, the original lyrics--wonderful!"</TE>
<TE>   And then Reeve, paralyzed from the neck down almost seven years
ago, told the crowd how he had found the courage to go on living. "I
took inventory of what I had left," he said. "And I realized it was a
luxury to have a body that works--but that you are not any less of a
person as long as you have a heart, a brain and a soul."</TE>
<TE>   Honored at the Feb. 2 festivities were members of the U.S. Armed
Forces and Orange County's law enforcement and emergency personnel,
who were presented with the university's Front &amp; Center Award. Henry
T. Nicholas III, president and CEO of Broadcom Corp., received the
Titan Award. --Ann Conway</TE>
<TE>   City Hearts</TE>
<TE>   Jane Seymour and James Keach opened their Malibu home for the
fifth annual Truffle Dinners to benefit City Hearts. The
organization, founded by attorneys Sherry and Bob Jason, offers
disadvantaged children exposure to the performing and visual arts in
Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Montblanc sponsored the two nights of feasts of Perigord
truffle-themed dishes created by noted chefs: On Feb. 2, Joachim
Splichal held forth in the kitchen, and on Feb. 3, chef Rolland
Passot of San Francisco's La Folie prepared the eight-course menu.
Sample dishes? Foie gras with ham and truffle salad; scrambled eggs
with truffles; sea bass with truffle and butternut squash risotto.
For dessert? Caramelized apple galette and truffle ice cream. All was
complemented with Moet et Chandon champagne and Melville Estate
wines.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations at $375 were sold out well in advance for both
nights. Event chairwoman Shannon Swanson Binder said $105,000 was
raised for City Hearts programs. Event planners Tony Schubert and
John Paul Lorello of Event Eleven made sure sofas were moved into a
large screening room for fans to catch the final minutes of the Super
Bowl before joining the party, staged in a transparent tent
overlooking the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday night crowd included City Hearts President Liane
Weintraub and her husband, Richard. Also, Karsten Martens of
Montblanc, Jane Donaldson, Bruce Davidson, Eloise and John Paul
Dejoria, Esther and Rick Rosenfield, Daphna and Eduardo Ziman, Alyce
Williamson, Jennifer and Royce Diener, Bill Norris and Jane Jelenko.
--P.D.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz Tribute</TE>
<TE>   In introducing his longtime friend Stephen Schwartz at an event in
his honor, host Jason Alexander laid it on the line: "He is a writer,
director, teacher, composer and performer. And he's taking jobs away
from literally hundreds of people!"</TE>
<TE>   "Extraordinary!" was presented by the Musical Theatre Guild and
the foundation of ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers) on Monday  at the Pasadena Playhouse as a tribute to
Schwartz's prolific career and his work nurturing young talent.</TE>
<TE>   By 1976, at age 28, Schwartz had become the first
composer-lyricist to have three shows on Broadway at the same time:
"Godspell," "Pippin" and "The Magic Show."</TE>
<TE>   Among the performers who turned out for the tribute were John
Rubinstein (the original "Pippin" on Broadway); Maureen McGovern,
Teri Ralston, James Mellon, Kevin Bailey, Karen Morrow, Kirsten
Benton, Marsha Kramer, Lenny Wolpe, Teri Bibb, Liz Callaway, Eileen
Barnett, Jeffrey Polk, Kevin McMahon and Stephanie J. Block, who sang
"Defying Gravity," from Schwartz's new musical based on the early
life of the Wicked Witch of the West.</TE>
<TE>   After the finale ("Day by Day" from "Godspell") guests walked over
to the California School of Culinary Arts for a reception with the
cast. There, writer-director Paris Barclay praised Schwartz's
dedication to the ASCAP/Disney Musical Theatre Workshop, which
promotes new writing talent for the musical theater. "I'm really
proud to salute Stephen," said Barclay. "You can always write great
musicals, but to dedicate yourself, year after year, to helping
others write them is quite extraordinary." --P.D.</TE>
<TE>   Star Turn</TE>
<TE>   Following the opening Tuesday of "The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, cast members
joined with center donors to celebrate at a jazz-and-food filled
party at Maggiano's restaurant in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping a low-profile at the event was the star of the show,
Ann-Margret, who made a quiet entrance and dined with husband Roger
Smith in a private room. Playing the role of Miss Mona, the madam of
a chicken ranch brothel, marks the star's first stage appearance in a
musical. "I don't mean to get schmaltzy," said co-star Gary Sandy,
who plays Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd, "but I really respect her
professionalism. Getting the chance to work with her is just too
much."</TE>
<TE>   The production continues through today at the center before moving
to the next stop on a 40-city tour. --A.C.</TE>

<LD>In a backyard studio on a quiet street in Hancock Park, six women
gather in a dimly lighted room on a Saturday night. Wearing sweats
and T-shirts, they start the evening with a rigorous routine of yoga
and ballet stretches. Fully warmed up, they change into skimpy shirts
over lingerie, strap-on stiletto heels, then crank up some thumping
hip-hop music. One after the other, they perform erotic dances for
one another, swaying their hips, strutting and spinning around a
strippers' pole bolted floor to ceiling rafter. The routines all end
with the dancer stripping down to lacy bra and panties.</LD>
<LD>   As each dancer shows off her wares, everyone else cheers her on,
as the leader shouts out, "Beautiful! Beautiful!" "Slow down," and
"He's loving it. He's dying."</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Stripping for the Everyday Woman, a high-tone class on
disrobing billed as a remedy for sexual repression. Neither a
showcase for audiences, nor a professional training ground for
X-rated clubs, this class, designed and led by actress Sheila Kelley,
is meant to be a self-help experience, a safe place to learn to enjoy
playing the stripper's role--whether for the sake of a relationship
or just to unleash a pent-up self.</LD>
<TE>   Kelley, best known for playing Arnie Becker's sultry, no-nonsense
assistant Gwen Taylor on "L.A. Law," might seem an unlikely
evangelist for stripping and lap-dancing. A trim and attractive
37-year-old, her lank brown hair flows to her shoulders, and she can
often be found wearing no makeup and jeans. Her look could easily be
described as Hollywood-style mom-next-door. Indeed, she and her
husband, actor Richard Schiff, have two children, ages 7 and 11/2.</TE>
<TE>   There's a gentleness about Kelley that's as soft as the purr in
her voice. She displays a friendly, unaffected manner and is apt to
tap the knee of the person she's talking to in wide-eyed agreement.
Even when performing elaborate tricks on the pole--spinning like an
upside-down iceskater--she adds touches of ballet that make her act
seem almost wholesome.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelley is driven by a mission. Encouraged by friends who were
fascinated when she installed the pole, she wants to drag striptease
away from the exclusive domain of sleazy clubs and into master
bedrooms, which is where she feels it belongs. She sees stripping as
a liberating act for women, a way to enhance one's physical and
sexual potentials.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting up there and owning the space and allowing your body to
move the way it wants to move naturally, being overtly sexual without
apology, gives these women and myself an enormous sense of
satisfaction. See the smile on my face?" she asks, wearing a beatific
grin. "When I'm teaching, this is me. I just get this energy. This
wall of sexual, sensual, beautiful energy comes at me. It's a high."</TE>
<TE>   Her students' hoots and howls during class support her claim. So
does the popularity of her program, which she started in May and has
grown through word of mouth. Thirty women now take her 90-minute
classes weekly, each paying $50 a pop. Twenty-five others are on a
waiting list, and Kelley is looking for rented space to accommodate
her burgeoning business.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not say I wanted to become a stripping teacher. This all
just happened," she says. "I know how powerful I feel when I do it. I
know how sexy I feel. I know how beautiful I look to me and to my
husband, and that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Her students are friends, actresses and mothers--sometimes they're
all three--who come to the class, they say, to tap into their
repressed sexuality. They're white, upper-middle-class women ranging
in age from 24 to 57. Kelley refuses anyone who says she aspires to
become an X-rated dancer. Talking about her students, Kelley is very
protective--and not only because of the social taboo against
stripping. Her students are shy, she says, so even in class she keeps
the lights low and forbids anyone from inviting guests. One student,
who asked to remain anonymous, spoke of the classes as a way to give
married women a renewed sense of sex appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Women my age, housewives and mothers, aren't prepared to say,
'Look at me, aren't I gorgeous?' It's embarrassing," said the actress
and mother, who is in her 50s. "The class is incredibly embarrassing
and brings out all of your insecurities. And yet, you're dying to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley first became fascinated with stripping while studying for
film roles. The youngest of nine, she was raised in an Irish-Catholic
family in Pittsburgh. When, at age 24, she walked into a strip club
to prepare for the 1989 movie "Breaking In," she was stunned. The
dark world of these sleazy clubs--and the women who worked in
them--fascinated her so much that she began writing a script about
them. It evolved over years into the film "Dancing at the Blue
Iguana," which Kelley produced and Daryl Hannah starred in. That
unglamorous portrait of strippers' lives was directed by "Il
Postino's" Michael Radford and released by Lions Gate Films last year
to mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   During the long process of making the film, however, Kelley paid
strippers to teach her their dance moves. And she also started
stripping for her husband, Schiff, who plays Toby Ziegler, the
taciturn White House communications director on NBC's "The West
Wing." That was her turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "It struck me how unbelievably empowering it was for me to dance
for my husband alone," she says. "Simultaneously, you become your
most open, your most vulnerable and your most powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Schiff says men are bug-eyed with envy when they find out his
lithe, pretty wife, a former ballerina, likes to strip for him. He
says he has also discerned a difference in female friends who have
taken her classes.</TE>
<TE>   "It has changed their marriages, and it's changed the way they
walk through life. There's a centered kind of sensuality in them that
might have been fighting to get through before," he says. "Then
there's just the fun they have. They're always howling and screaming
back here. I'm playing with the kids, and then I hear this hooting
and hollering, and I think, 'Man, I want to be back there. What am I
doing changing diapers?'"</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in the old-money, million-dollar homes of Hancock Park
also appear to be unflustered by the enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Several neighbors said they know she has a pole in the house and
that she practices. But I've only heard positive things about it,"
says neighbor Christopher Larsen. "It's not like she has working
girls going in and out. They're really pretty quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley's classes and her neighbors' acceptance may indicate that
another sexual taboo is being peeled away. Hollywood has been nudging
strippers into the mainstream with major releases like "Showgirls"
and "Striptease." Bada Bing, the topless club in HBO's "The
Sopranos," brought stripping to critically acclaimed television. The
Internet's profitable relationship with pornography has contributed a
general frankness to America's dialogue about sex. Just recently, TV
sex goddess Pamela Anderson, who has a stripper pole in her bedroom,
said she may give up acting to strip onstage during her boyfriend Kid
Rock's rock concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Historical factors might be at work, too. Crunch gyms considered
adding "cardio striptease" to its roster of aerobics classes months
before testing it in Los Angeles last September. The experiment was
so successful that classes are filled to capacity and are being
offered at Crunch clubs in New York and Miami as well.</TE>
<TE>   "With Sept. 11, people learned the lesson that you have to take
hold of life and have some fun," says Crunch publicity director Dayna
Crawford. "There's one woman in the L.A. class named Thelma. She's 70
years old and refuses to miss a class."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Kelley says her classes are not an easy experience for
many who attend. Some have burst into tears because they're so afraid
to perform in groups. They clearly are petrified of vamping.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been able to act sexy in a movie. I was playing
romantic parts and everything, but that was an area where I just felt
foolish, totally foolish," one student says. "Sheila's very
supportive and wonderful. She eggs you on and keeps saying, 'Oh,
powerful move, powerful move,' and screaming out how beautiful
everyone is. And she means it."</TE>
<TE>   Several students aren't married, and some of the married ones say
they have never performed for their husbands, despite months of
classes. They take the classes for themselves. Each dance ends with a
fake lap dance on another student, yet there seems to be an absence
of sexual tension among the women. When Kelley is asked if students
get aroused, she just says, "Ewwww."</TE>
<TE>   For Kelley, the experience is about power, a word she uses 18
times in some form during a two-hour conversation. There's also a
sense of mischief: "I probably got pregnant after a lap dance," she
says with an impish grin. "There's a way to spice up your marriage."</TE>

<HD>To N.Y. Cabbies, Life Isn't Fare</HD>
<DH>Gotham's infamous taxi drivers feel put upon by bosses,
cops and customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY VOBORIL</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>To hear them gripe and grouse and kvetch, you'd think New York City
cabdrivers were the Rodney Dangerfields of the working world.</LD>
<LD>   They get no respect! Officious cops, road-hogging motorists,
insouciant jaywalkers, fault-finding women, impatient men, nitpicky
inspectors from the Taxi and Limousine Commission--all give
righteous, hard-working, long-suffering cabbies a hard time. Even
other cabbies give cabbies a hard time.</LD>
<LD>   Or so it was said one recent Friday night at a mandatory customer
relations class for probationary cabdrivers at LaGuardia Community
College. The official emphasis is on helping deaf, blind,
wheelchair-using and other disabled customers, but otherwise this
four-hour class focused mostly on ... attitude.</LD>
<TE>   Some cabbies call it "charm school." It began in 1997, a legacy of
the Americans With Disabilities Act, and, through 2001, 46,026
cabbies had paid $20 tuition each to take it. All must complete the
course as part of their 12-month probationary period.</TE>
<TE>   On this Friday night in a standard-issue, fluorescent-lit college
classroom, instructor Jeffrey Walsh, a former New York cabbie
himself, stands against a bright orange wall. A fold-up wheelchair
and a chalkboard are his only props. Eighteen glum-looking students,
all male, align their desks in a semicircle.</TE>
<TE>   In friendly tones, Walsh asks each cabbie his name, where he's
from--more than half are from Pakistan--and what he likes about the
job. Flexible hours, they say, and money in the pocket, adventure,
meeting people, being their own boss. Negatives? Traffic, rude
passengers, drunk passengers, no union, no benefits, too-low rates,
poorly maintained cars, lack of respect.</TE>
<TE>   Customers, one cabbie grumbles, climb into his cab and instantly
set the wrong tone. They don't talk "nice." "They say things to put
me down." And women! He says he never receives decent tips from
women. He also says women complain about him, without cause, to the
Taxi and Limousine Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh replies, "If you start thinking that all customers do this,
you might be creating a situation where you make them do it. You're
thinking, 'Hey, it's me against them.'"</TE>
<TE>   In a pan-ethnic, hyper-stressed, time-is-money city like New York,
problem fares are bound to crop up. But a taxi driver, unlike a
bartender, has it easy: Even factoring in airport runs, "you have a
customer an average of six minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh says, "Six minutes! That's all you have to deal with this
guy. Gentlemen, who cares what they say. You be pleasant. The guy
grousing in the back of the cab, you think he saves that just for
you? No! He does it to everybody." So don't take it personally, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh stresses safety and the fact that drivers must keep their
tempers in check. Otherwise, he says, "you may be setting yourself up
for something ugly." He tells drivers to never, ever, argue with
cops. He advises civility in speech.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh asks the students to define the public image of the New York
cabbie. Rude, someone says. Leans on the horn. Reckless. And where
does this perception come from? The students laugh and admit:
cabdrivers.</TE>
<TE>   In an annual survey by etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart,
New York tied improbably with Charleston, S.C., last year as the
nation's most polite city. Yet in customer relations class,
rudimentary, Golden Rule-type lessons in getting along must be
reinforced.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh tells the true story of a cabbie who goes to the flower
district every Valentine's Day to buy roses and then presents a rose
to every woman fare. Tips? He cleans up. A second cabbie gained about
$40 a day in extra tips by offering customers a stick of chewing gum.</TE>
<TE>   After class, several cabbies, kvetchers to the end, resume their
Dangerfieldesque, cabbies-get-no-respect beefs against the taxi
commission and others in authority.</TE>
<TE>   Says one: "I feel like I'm in boot camp. I've got all these people
over my head. They don't want you to make money. They want to see you
suffer."</TE>

<HD>Politicians Getting a Warm Reception</HD>
<DH>More elected officials are accepting invitations to
officiate weddings. Talk about wooing the voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The groom was scanning the marble staircase. Ten minutes until the
wedding and the officiant had yet to arrive. Kevin Giberson would
have settled for Vegas, but his bride had wanted this guy, someone
memorable, who did movie stars' weddings. She was starting to pace
when he finally materialized, smiling so warmly they'd never have
guessed that this was his third wedding in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "Hello," said the celebrant.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm Willie Brown."</LD>
<TE>   Here comes the ... mayor. And the congressman. And the governor.
And the legislator, councilman, supervisor, attorney general,
lieutenant governor and secretary of state. In a quintessentially
California confluence of celebrity and politics--and a dash of
wartime civics--elected officiants are suddenly showing up at
fashionable weddings all over the state.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has averaged a wedding a week so far this year and did two
in one day after Sept. 11. Both House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi and
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein flew home after the September attacks to
perform marriages, each for the first time since their respective
elections to Congress. U.S. Rep. Robert T. Matsui officiated in
October in Pasadena for the head of the state Department of Fair
Employment and Housing and his bride, who is president of the
National Asian Women's Health Organization. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante
did the impromptu Thanksgiving wedding of two widowed friends of his
chief of staff in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   And they just keep coming: Last month, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
presided over the Nob Hill marriage of two politically active
lawyers--one of whom had been treasurer for the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign--and state Senate Majority Whip Richard Alarcon (D-San
Fernando Valley) is gearing up to do his first wedding this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of politically touched unions has inspired both good
feelings and gossip in this post-Sept. 11, mid-Enron moment, when it
isn't always clear whether to celebrate or suspect the gestures of
elected officials toward constituents and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people thought it was political," said Karen Caufield,
whose Sept. 22 marriage to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Frank
Caufield was officiated by Pelosi. "But Nancy is our neighbor. It was
just a coincidence that she became whip a few days after the wedding.
She and my husband have been friends for years."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, government watchdogs say that parson-playing politicians
are the least of their worries. "We're concerned about the
legislative favors, not the personal ones," says Jim Knox, executive
director of California Common Cause.</TE>
<TE>   The greater risk, perhaps, is the potential for courting
wisecracks.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people you want to put in charge of the making of
promises?" joked Republican political consultant Wayne C. Johnson.
"Although the possibilities are endless. You could have them
focus-group the couple, bring in the campaign team. Poll the family
and friends."</TE>
<TE>   For some couples, an elected officiant celebrates the success, not
just of their relationship, but also of their social circle. For
others, it's a novel twist on an otherwise conventional exchange of
civil vows. Giberson, a Bay Area software developer, and his bride,
Karen Holsclaw, a corporate contract negotiator, said they wanted
Brown because he'd officiated at actor Don Johnson's 1999 wedding to
socialite Kelley Phleger. Holsclaw felt his presence would give their
City Hall wedding a touch of panache.</TE>
<TE>   Though several San Francisco mayors have performed civil
marriages--by city tradition, mayors are automatically deputized as
marriage commissioners as a perk of the office--the dapper Brown has
by all accounts made unprecedented use of the power. Last year,
according to city records and the mayor's spokesman, Brown--who has
lived apart from his own wife for decades and had a child out of
wedlock last year--did 18 scheduled weddings, a private commitment
ceremony, a vow renewal and at least three off-calendar marriages
that were done as personal favors to friends and social
acquaintances.</TE>
<TE>   That's not counting his annual mass commitment ceremony, which has
joined more than 500 gay and lesbian couples since Brown did the
first one in 1996, the year he took office. "It's a lot of fun, and I
love it," Brown says, "and of course, it's part of being the mayor of
San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Moran, Colusa County's clerk-recorder and a former
legislative liaison for county clerks statewide, also notes that
weddings also "are a great political gesture."</TE>
<TE>   "Presiding over a ceremony," she says, "lets you affect a lot of
constituents."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Cott, a Harvard University history professor and author of
"Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation," pegs the
interest in elected officiators to "a kind of celebrity seeking,
which these days is part of our culture in general." The bride and
groom, she says, get attention, both personal and public. The
politician, meanwhile, is associated with happiness by a roomful of
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he would do it when I asked, but he did," recalls
San Francisco interior designer Sumi Sereni, who is a friend of
Brown's personal assistant and whose April 2 wedding was among those
that didn't appear on the mayor's 2001 official calendar. "He has
always been more like a king than a mayor to me, and I imagined City
Hall was my mansion, and the very king of San Francisco shall wed me!
Afterward, when I tried to shake his hand, he reached out and hugged
me. Thank God for waterproof mascara. I sobbed through the whole
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Elected officials--like all adult Californians--have for years
been able to perform weddings. State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis
Obispo), for example, has done at least 10 in his 20-year career. One
made it onto national TV when a camera crew tried to crash Elizabeth
Taylor's wedding to Larry Fortensky in 1991 at Michael Jackson's
Neverland ranch and ended up settling for O'Connell, who was in the
area, officiating for a former staffer.</TE>
<TE>   But, until recently, lawmakers such as O'Connell were the
exception, and few presided with any frequency at weddings. The
reason? Most people are unaware of the option. Under state law,
county clerks, who are authorized to solemnize civil marriages, can
in turn appoint deputy marriage commissioners to stand in for them.
Usually, these deputies are municipal employees or volunteers in the
clerk's office. But about half of the state's counties, including Los
Angeles, Orange, San Francisco, Ventura and Sacramento, have
additional, unadvertised programs that can extend the certification
at the clerk's discretion to any citizen over 18.</TE>
<TE>   The authority is good for one day and one wedding only. Until
1998, most elected officials who were asked to perform marriages
simply applied for one of these 24-hour deputizations in the county
in which the ceremony was to take place.</TE>
<TE>   But the deputization process is time-consuming. Not all counties
offer 24-hour permits, and those that do tended to insist that the
officiants-to-be apply in person. Plus, over the years, the permits
crept up in price.</TE>
<TE>   "Some counties charged, like, $100 every time they swore you in,"
recalled U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who officiated
"maybe three or four times" in his previous job as a state legislator
from the Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "And it wasn't as if you could pass that cost on to the couple. Or
charge them for your time."</TE>
<TE>   Finally in 1998, elected officials quietly solved the problem by
putting themselves on a par with ministers and judges. Thompson says
the change came out of a casual conversation he had that year with
Pat Johnston, a Stockton Democrat who was then chairman of the state
Senate Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I said it was ridiculous that we had to repeat this process every
time someone asked us this favor, and he said, 'Yeah, and
expensive,"' Thompson remembered. On the spot, Thompson said, they
decided legislators, members of Congress and state constitutional
officers such as the governor should be freed from the hassles of
having to be designated repeatedly as "deputy for a day."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston, who is now a lobbyist and lecturer in politics and
public policy at UC Berkeley, said he doesn't recall the incident but
is "glad to take credit for it." Both Thompson and a former
legislative staffer said that, after making sure other lawmakers had
no objections, Johnston slipped the idea into a 1998 "omnibus" bill
of legislative loose ends and, without fanfare, it became law.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Secretary of State Bill Jones, now a
Republican gubernatorial candidate, used his new powers to perform
two marriages--one for the son of a staff member, the other for a
friend of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County real estate developer Roland Arnall, chairman of
Ameriquest Capital Corp. and a longtime Democratic fund-raiser, got
Gov. Gray Davis to officiate at his wedding.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff presided first over his chief of staff's
wedding and then over the union of two constituents at the 2000
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Alarcon--remarried
after a bitter marital breakup--will officiate later this year for
the son of an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, who had done "two or three" weddings in his career as a
state senator under the old rules, did triple that number after the
new law was enacted. So far, he says, all the couples are still
together (though Lockyer is twice-divorced).</TE>
<TE>   "I could have asked any one of two dozen judges, but we wanted
someone we both knew," said Harry Wartnick, a San Francisco attorney
who married former Clinton-Gore campaign treasurer Joan Pollitt last
month at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Wartnick, speaking by phone
from Kauai, where the couple were honeymooning, said that having the
state's top law enforcement officer at the altar "reinforced" the
couple's decision to keep the wedding small "and not let it turn into
a spectacle."</TE>
<TE>   Venture capitalist Frank Caufield and his wife, Karen, said they,
too, had familiarity in mind when they asked Pelosi to preside over
their wedding at Caufield's sprawling second home in Montecito.
Caufield, a longtime contributor to Democratic causes, also lives in
San Francisco, a block from Pelosi in Pacific Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "Frank's been involved in Washington, D.C., quite a bit, so he
knew she could do it," said Karen Caufield. "And she was just
darling. She did a beautiful job. She had to fly in on Saturday
afternoon because they were in session because of Sept. 11. But she
made some notes on the back of a fax that got to her at the San
Ysidro Ranch, where she was staying."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi said the wedding was tinged with patriotic emotion. "Frank
is a West Point graduate, and his father was a general and the
ceremony was opened by a presentation of the flag that had been his
father's," she recalled. (Other guests were impressed with Caufield's
estate, the private jets doubling as guest shuttles and the bridal
procession, for which the couple hired Bruce Springsteen's
saxophonist, Clarence Clemons, to riff on "Here Comes the Bride.")</TE>
<TE>   The wedding Feinstein presided over also had a personal angle. The
groom was Norbu Tenzing, development director of the American
Himalayan Foundation, of which Feinstein's husband is founder and
chairman. Ditto for the October nuptials of Dennis Hayashi and Mary
Chung, who enlisted Matsui because, Hayashi said, "he has been like a
mentor to me."</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes--as with love itself--famous officiants just happen.
Take the couple married in November by Bustamante in a suburban
kitchen near the state capitol.</TE>
<TE>   The groom--who asked that names not be used because they haven't
told their grown children--said Bustamante's chief of staff made the
suggestion while they were visiting for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "He just kinda asked if, well, 'If you're going to get married,
would you like to be married by the lieutenant governor?' " said the
groom, a man in his 60s who runs a machinery sales and service
business in Corona. "Well, we said of course. Why not? It's not every
day you get to do something like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Republican and probably would have gone for George Bush if
I could have gotten him, but Cruz did a real nice job," he said,
laughing. "We even got pictures. I donated $100 to his campaign a
couple days later, even though he didn't ask for it. Who knows? Next
time he runs, I may even vote for him."</TE>

<HD>Misery Outside and Mercy Inside</HD>
<DH>Without the Venice Clinic, Many More Would Go Untreated</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like sad clockwork, the economy stumbles and a familiar word
reappears. Health care becomes the health care "crisis."</LD>
<LD>   I've come to the community of Venice to take a look. At this other
ground zero, America's proud image of itself is tested everyday.</LD>
<LD>   One of the country's biggest safety nets is here. But it's not big
enough, and beneath it is something very close to nothing.</LD>
<TE>   The Venice Family Clinic is the largest free clinic in the U.S. It
serves the poor who live in the vast pockets and veins spread through
one of our richest regions--the Westside of Los Angeles. In this part
of town, there are perhaps 120,000 people without health insurance.
This clinic, with three offices, cares for 18,000 of them--most of
them working people still striving for the American dream, and
finding a piece of it here.</TE>
<TE>   In ways that touch scores of men, women and children every day,
the Venice Family Clinic is an American celebration. In ways that
touch many more of us, it would be a far greater success if it were
driven out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a wonderful day for this country if we no longer had
a reason to exist," says Linda Feldman, a fund-raiser and
communications director for the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   She is speaking about some dreamy far-off day when all Americans
can count on basic health care, no matter whether they work down at
the bottom of the economy or they get chronically sick or whether
they're young and have no choice in things.</TE>
<TE>   A more pressing reality is the eerie economics: Health insurance
is now beyond the reach of 39 million people in the U.S.--nearly 14%
of the population. Costs are soaring, businesses are retrenching and
government budgets face the stranglehold of recession. As I said,
clockwork.</TE>
<TE>   "You know that moment just before a thunderstorm?" the clinic's
CEO, Elizabeth Benson Forer, says to me as we tour this clean,
inviting building of glass and stucco. "That's where we are now. The
wind hasn't kicked up. The big rain isn't falling. But it's about to;
it's ominous."</TE>
<TE>   But sweeping numbers and eerie predictions omit what is seldom
discussed: The haves and have-nots in the nation are not neatly
divided. In our absurd patchwork of care, some of the poor rate
services more comprehensive than provided by standard insurance.
Others are simply left out, turned away for triage in miserable,
overburdened emergency rooms. Those in the middle never rest easy.
The whole system is anchored in a foundation of loose sand.</TE>
<TE>   As we walk through the Venice clinic, I count 21 patients and
parents. It is a morning for children's checkups. Every youngster not
only sees a doctor but is given a book to encourage reading. Medicine
is free. Patients can obtain mental health services in the same
office, and eyeglasses too. The homeless get a shower and clean
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   What I cannot see are the 20 other sick and downtrodden people who
call today and are told that there is no room for them, sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasts like this infuriate me. I believe in the goodness and
greatness of the United States. I've been known to defend the old
myth, handed down to us as children, that there is no country to
equal this one.</TE>
<TE>   As for the goodness, it's here in Venice: 500 volunteer doctors,
donated medicines and books, a fired-up staff drawing its spirit from
the honorable urges of humanitarianism, plus a community willing,
year after year, to provide half of the clinic's $12-million
operating budget with charity donations.</TE>
<TE>   But greatness? Let's put that idea on ice. We're not even close.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice clinic cannot do it all even in one of the wealthiest
communities in a wealthy country. Year by year, its services hang by
a stretched thread of government grants, which provide the other half
of the operating budget. Every county, state and federal spending cut
is eyed here as a matter of survival.</TE>
<TE>   In this working-class neighborhood of this mixed community, there
is a glass door three paces from the sidewalk. On one side of it is
mercy, on the other side misery. Some people will see a doctor today
and they'll get a kindly smile and medicine to make them well. Some
won't.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Needs Something to Lose</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTOR D. CHA</AU>
<BD>Victor D. Cha is director of the American Alliances in
Asia Project at Georgetown University</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's references to North Korea as part of an "axis of
evil" represents another feint in the administration's yet unformed
policy toward that opaque regime.</LD>
<LD>   Bush started his term skeptical of North Korea and the "sunshine
policy" of engagement by ally South Korea. After a thorough policy
review concluded last June, Bush then moved in the direction of
welcoming talks with Pyongyang. But in his State of the Union
address, Bush seems to have reversed course again, intimating little
interest in better relations with the North.</LD>
<LD>   If the administration believes that tough words and a policy of
"benign neglect" that walks away from engagement will pacify
Pyongyang, it is sorely mistaken. A confluence of events ensures that
we are headed for the brink again with North Korea.</LD>
<TE>   The 1994 "agreed framework"--in which the U.S. offered heavy fuel
oil and nuclear energy in exchange for North Korea shutting down its
potential nuclear weapons and missile programs--reaches critical
implementation stages in the coming months that will test the
intentions of Pyongyang. It will almost certainly spark debates about
whether the U.S. should revise or abandon the accord.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential elections in South Korea this year have made Kim Dae
Jung's sunshine policy an object of acerbic debate, with the
front-runner opposition candidate already pushing a harder line.
Japan-North Korea normalization talks have been frozen since 2000
with little chance of a thaw. Meanwhile, Pyongyang's rhetoric against
Tokyo grows more aggressive. Finally and most ominous, North Korea's
self-imposed moratorium on missile tests will end this year.</TE>
<TE>   With this backdrop, Pyongyang is unlikely to be brought into line
by a policy of "benign neglect."</TE>
<TE>   Bush should reaffirm the policy of engagement with North Korea in
his trip to Asia later this month. Many highly placed individuals in
this administration abhor the North and genuinely do not trust
Pyongyang's intentions. But what Bush officials might see as a dovish
or naive policy can also be the policy of hawks.</TE>
<TE>   First, engagement is the best practical way to build a coalition
for punishment tomorrow. No U.S. plan to coerce North Korea into
behaving will work without a regional consensus that efforts to
resolve the problem in a nonconfrontational manner have been
exhausted. There was no such consensus in the June 1994 nuclear
crisis. Not only was there resistance to imposing economic sanctions
against North Korea from China (which could veto such a resolution in
the United Nations) but also from U.S. allies, such as Japan and
South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Second, engagement makes threats to punish more credible. For
example, continuing to impose a decades-old embargo is unlikely to
elicit a positive change in behavior. However, lifting sanctions,
letting the North gain what little they can from new opportunities
and then using the possibility of reinstating sanctions is more
likely to be successful. Today's carrots are tomorrow's most
effective sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Third, engagement with North Korea and missile defense are not
incompatible. The common refrain in Asia regarding Bush's North Korea
policy is that the administration does not want to engage North
Korea--its "poster child" for missile defense. This has been a
popular albeit not well-thought-out stance.</TE>
<TE>   Engagement is most effective when it is undergirded by robust
defense capabilities and when it clearly communicates to the target
that engagement is a choice of the strong and not the expediency of
the weak. In this sense, missile defense enhances rather than
contradicts the policy.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean regime is despicable. The regime's starving of
the people, selling of children like cattle and other untold acts run
contrary to every value the United States upholds. But given current
concerns, inviting crisis in East Asia is not in American interests.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are "hawk rationales" compatible with the thinking
of many in the administration. For these folks, engagement cannot
operate without an exit strategy, but engagement is the exit
strategy.</TE>

<HD>Don't Get Mad, Get Even at the Polls</HD>
<DH>Take a lesson from Latinos, who haven't forgotten what
happened to LAUSD's Zacarias</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't be surprised if the political furor over Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard Parks plays out the way the Ruben Zacarias controversy
did a couple of years ago. After first threatening to break up the
L.A. school district, Latino activists retreated. But they did not
forget.</LD>
<LD>   You can count on Latino voters being reminded about the unseemly
firing of the popular, if flawed, Los Angeles school superintendent
when the school board members who voted against Zacarias are up for
reelection next year. And Latino Democrats may use former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan's role in engineering the coup against Zacarias
as fodder if he becomes the Republican nominee against Gov. Gray
Davis in November's election.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional wisdom in Los Angeles politics says Latino power,
while clearly emerging, still lags behind the political clout of
blacks. But black political leaders scrambling to save Parks' job can
learn something from their Latino counterparts.</LD>
<TE>   Like payback.</TE>
<TE>   The local black community was stunned last week when Mayor James
K. Hahn said that he did not favor a second five-year term for Parks.
Strong support among African American voters helped Hahn win a tough
election last year against several rivals who had pledged to replace
Parks when the chief's term was up. So black leaders had assumed
Parks' job was safe despite the LAPD scandals and controversies that
emerged on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   As a longtime Police Department critic, I applaud the mayor's
decision. But I can't shake a sense of deja vu because I vividly
recall the similar outcry among Latino elected officials and
political activists when Zacarias was ousted in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the parallels:</TE>
<TE>   Parks began as a street cop and worked his way up the ranks over a
37-year LAPD career. Zacarias started as an elementary school teacher
in Boyle Heights 33 years before he was forced out as head of the Los
Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Many blacks saw Parks' ascension as a symbol of change in a police
department with which they share a most unhappy history.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos felt the same way when Zacarias was put in charge of a
school system notorious for a high Latino dropout rate and other
problems with its largest constituency.</TE>
<TE>   Parks cultivated political support in the black community to
compensate for his status as an outsider within a mostly white LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Zacarias also made it a point to be accessible to Latinos, whether
members of Congress or barrio PTA moms.</TE>
<TE>   Both men had their careers jolted by profound problems in the
institutions they had devoted their lives to--despite the fact
neither was personally responsible for the scandals that came to
epitomize those problems.</TE>
<TE>   There is no denying that both men were products of and prospered
within the insular bureaucracies that spawned the district's Belmont
Learning Complex fiasco and the LAPD's Rampart Division scandal. So
legitimate questions can be raised as to whether they were really the
right leaders to shake things up when it became glaringly obvious
that change was needed. That's why one of the first things a new
school board majority did to try to reform the school district was to
fire Zacarias. And I is why Hahn has concluded that a new chief is
needed to reform the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   So if black activists can't convince the Police Commission to
ignore the mayor's views and give Bernie Parks another term as chief,
it won't mean they lost the war. They can bide their time, like
Latinos are doing, and plan for some political payback at election
time.</TE>

the U.S.</DH>

<LD>The past week has seen an unprecedented diplomatic offensive on the
part of Iraq. This appears to be driven by the harsh rhetoric
emanating from the Bush administration since the president's
identification of Iraq as an integral part of an "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   Whether or not Iraq is sincere, Baghdad's burst of diplomacy
appears to be designed to derail a drive for war from within the Bush
administration that has been gaining momentum at a startling rate.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq has dispatched representatives to Europe, Russia, China and
the Arab world to distance itself from President Bush's
characterization of it as evil and to discourage the war-like
undertones of such a label.</LD>
<TE>   These efforts have borne instant fruit. The "axis of evil"
formulation has been criticized in almost every corner of the world
as ill-conceived and counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, one issue that caused trouble for Iraq: the
return of United Nations weapons inspectors. The focus by Bush on the
matter of weapons inspections prior to his State of the Union address
resonated in many capitals around the globe, even those sympathetic
to Iraq or overtly opposed to renewed military conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The ambiguities that exist concerning Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction programs are troubling. The shadow cast by Sept. 11,
combined with the specter of weapons of mass destruction, made the
issue of the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq suddenly relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, China and Turkey all have urged Baghdad to allow the
inspectors back to work. Iraq was cool to these overtures until, in a
stunning recent reversal, Baghdad communicated to the U.N. secretary
general its willingness to engage in discussions on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   In so doing, Iraq has exposed the Achilles' heel of Washington's
policy: Is the U.S. truly serious about weapons inspections?</TE>
<TE>   While Iraq has stated that it has set no preconditions for any
discussions regarding inspectors, it is widely recognized in the
United Nations that the issue of economic sanctions is firmly linked
to weapons inspections. Any discussion of sanctions is the last thing
the Bush administration would want.</TE>
<TE>   Economic sanctions have been the cornerstone of a policy of
containment pursued by three consecutive administrations. Sanctions
are essential to Bush's plan to destabilize and eventually overthrow
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The resumption of serious weapons inspections would, by their very
nature, open the door for the eventual lifting of the sanctions,
which in turn would signal an end of containment. This could mean the
de facto recognition that Hussein would retain power. Such a process
certainly flies in the face of the strong language of confrontation
coming from such proponents of the Hussein regime's removal as
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Sens. Joe Lieberman, John
McCain and Joe Biden.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi diplomatic offensive has thrown the administration into
a quandary.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Iraqi offer was given short shrift by Secretary of
State Colin Powell, the machinery of international diplomacy has been
actively engaged and will prove hard to stop. By showing a
willingness to discuss the issue of inspectors, Iraq has trumped
those who have maintained that Hussein would never permit their
return. Baghdad now has raised the question as to whether U.S.
support for inspectors has been merely rhetorical, a verbal foil
designed to support the primary policy objective of removing Hussein
from power.</TE>
<TE>   How the Bush administration answers this new challenge will do
much to shape the nature of any global support for future actions
against Hussein.</TE>

<HD>Chief: Walk Away Proud</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We've criticized Mayor James K. Hahn for failures in leadership.
After his decision to drop Los Angeles Chief of Police Bernard C.
Parks, no one can say Hahn is afraid to lead. Exactly where he is
leading this sensitive metropolis--with its persistent racial and
regional calculations over debts paid and debts owed--is another
matter.</LD>
<LD>   But the mayor is the city's chief executive. He has to have
managers who he believes will work well with him to serve Los
Angeles.  Hahn has declared that he doesn't want Parks to continue
for a second five-year term. Parks has insisted he'll press his case.
He should not. This part of the political tango is over; Hahn has
abruptly left Parks on the dance floor, music blaring, and the crowd
is now heading for the exits. Even if Parks were to win approval from
the Hahn-appointed Police Commission, he loses, and more important,
the city loses.</LD>
<LD>   Parks is a no-nonsense professional, of solid character and with
many traits we admire. He holds one of the toughest jobs in the
nation. But no one can run Los Angeles' police force effectively if
the top man in City Hall doesn't support him. The mayor and the chief
don't see eye to eye. They have not even met on a regularly scheduled
basis since Hahn took office in July.</LD>
<TE>   Now the political family feud is out in the open, with Hahn and
Parks' most vocal supporters in the African American community taking
sides and others in the city becoming uncomfortable onlookers. The
city cannot afford for this struggle, with its obvious racial
overtones, to continue. Nor can it afford for its police force to be
hobbled while the chief and mayor butt heads--Hahn each day
explaining his decision, Parks pressing a counteroffensive, insisting
he should be retained.</TE>
<TE>   All of this needs to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn says that he based his decision on serious differences with
Parks on three issues: the implementation of police reform, LAPD
morale problems, and community policing. The key problem is that Hahn
and Parks have different ideas of what constitutes true reform, what
drives recruitment and retention of good officers and how community
policing should be defined.</TE>
<TE>   Even during the peak of the Rampart police corruption scandal, in
which officers were found to have beaten, shot and framed suspects,
Parks took a position that reflected his 37 years in the LAPD: The
department should control the information and the punishment for
misconduct. But the Rampart scandal was proof, as then-City Atty.
Hahn and others pointed out, that the department's internal commands
and controls had broken down. That's why the federal consent decree,
which calls for stronger civilian oversight, was and continues to be
critical to true reform of a long-troubled department. But Parks,
even as he has done what he must to comply with the decree, has
consistently resisted it.</TE>
<TE>   Parks believes that reform can be achieved through greater
discipline within the rank and file. Indeed, he has excelled in
restoring discipline in a department that had forgotten it works for
the people of Los Angeles. The chief has ingrained in the LAPD a
seriousness about citizen complaints that was sorely lacking, as
pointed out by the 1991 Christopher Commission. He has no tolerance
for officers who show discourtesy or disrespect for the public they
serve. But even in this worthy pursuit Parks has shown crippling
rigidity. Under Parks, no complaint is minor. About 6,000 complaint
investigations are initiated each year against a force of nearly
9,000 officers. Some are allegations of major officer misconduct;
others are as trivial as a complaint about an officer who failed to
remove his sunglasses. In all this, a sense of proportion is missing,
and that hurts officer morale.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the apple-pie issue of community policing, Parks and Hahn
disagree. Hahn favors the retention and expansion of the popular
senior lead officer program, in which officers actually get to know
and work closely with neighborhood groups. Parks essentially sees the
program as a misuse of the time  of scarce officers who are more
needed on patrol.</TE>
<TE>   A thousand town hall or Police Commission meetings would not make
these fundamental differences go away.</TE>
<TE>   What is most alarming about Parks' political fall is the
implication that it signals the political rise of the Police
Protective League, the union that represents LAPD officers. The
union's leadership has attacked Parks with an unseemly zeal that even
tops the fervor with which it went after the previous police chief,
Willie L. Williams. While Williams and Parks could not be more
different, they are both African Americans. That fact is relevant,
considering the union's odious history of racial relations. This is a
union that in its 80-year history has never had an African American
on its board and a union that was happy to stand up for four officers
after their indefensible beating of Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   (Ironically, on the biggest police shooting controversies, Parks
supported the restive rank and file. The chief staunchly defended
officers involved in the dubious shootings of two African Americans:
Margaret Mitchell, a mentally ill homeless woman armed with only a
screwdriver, and Anthony Dwain Lee, a man at a residential Halloween
costume party armed with a fake gun.)</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, desperately wanting the union's endorsement during his bid
for mayor, promised the "flexible" workweek the union sought for
officers, over Parks' objection  that it didn't make sense. It didn't
then and it didn't when the new mayor delivered it during the
nation's biggest terrorism scare.</TE>
<TE>   This brings us to Hahn. The mayor was willing to say no to some
black community leaders; he must also assert his independence from
the police union. Hahn's call for the union to cease its relentless
campaign against Parks is a start. But Hahn now has to do a lot more
than issue a plaintive call for civility. He has major fences to mend
because of the months he spent clumsily hemming and hawing about his
decision on Parks. How much better it would have been for Hahn to
make a public case, over time and in subtle ways, that would have
suggested to his loyal African American supporters and everyone else
why he felt it was time to step away from Parks, who had been
championed by former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Parks knew Hahn would not support him when he announced
he was seeking a second term. African American leaders who continue
to frame Parks' retention as the litmus test of political power are
playing a risky game that could undermine their citywide influence.</TE>
<TE>   This episode should serve as a constructive reminder to all of a
brutal reality of politics: There are no permanent friends, only
permanent interests. It is in the interest of Los Angeles that this
battle between the mayor and the chief end. Mayor: Start mending
fences and separate yourself from lock-step support of the narrow
police union agenda. Chief: Celebrate a long record of service and
integrity and walk away proud.</TE>

<LD>High-speed Internet businesses have not exactly been rousing
successes. Excite@home and dozens of smaller broadband providers went
bust last year, while Global Crossing Ltd., which spent $15 billion
building a worldwide network of high-speed lines, filed for
bankruptcy Jan 28.</LD>
<LD>   Such flops haven't stopped broadband providers from spamming
Congress and the Bush administration with requests for special
favors. The tabling of the economic stimulus bill last week sank the
industry's immediate hopes, but lobbyists are still pitching for
government to subsidize wiring every home, hospital and school for
high-speed Internet.</LD>
<LD>   So far, the Bush administration is resisting nicely. As Nancy
Victory, head of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, recently said, "Whenever possible, the market, not
the government, should drive this deployment." That's the right
signal. No need to repeat the mistakes of the 1990s, when Congress
and the Clinton administration arguably wasted hundreds of millions
of dollars subsidizing broadband technologies that were greeted with
public apathy. Nearly 80% of households now have potential access to
broadband via satellite, cable or telephone lines, but only about 10%
have signed up.</LD>
<TE>   Government's challenge is to steer public investments smartly, not
to puff hot air into another Internet bubble.</TE>

<LD>Re "'Hollywood Whitewash of the Cold War's Shameful Red Stain,"
Commentary, Feb. 6: Roy Brewer admonishes the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences (and me) for failing "to tell the full
truth" about the domestic Cold War in the U.S. Certainly, Communist
Party members defended a reprehensible regime. Equally certainly,
according to the 1st Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, they had a protected right to do so. Individuals who found
this stance repugnant regularly disassociated themselves with
communists, as was their right. Equally certainly, hundreds of
communists engaged in espionage, sending all manner of classified
information to the Soviet Union. But there is no evidence that
communists in Hollywood had infiltrated the movie-making process,
dripped red hues into Hollywood movies or sent film-making secrets to
Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   The blacklists were nothing more than institutionalized,
politicized attempts to censor those critical of the Cold War and
silence dissent. And those in Hollywood who informed did so to save
their jobs, not because they believed the communists they named were
threats to the security of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Ceplair</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brewer's commentary on the McCarthy era, while pointing to needed
discussion, remains partial at best. Whether the Red hunting of the
McCarthy era had a core of justification or not, there is no question
that it quickly fell victim to massive excesses. It hurt many people,
and the country, far more than it helped.</TE>
<TE>   The academic field of philosophy, for example, suffered numerous
losses and was distorted in ways that persist unchecked to this
day--yet there is no evidence that a single clandestine communist
philosopher was ever exposed by McCarthyite forces.</TE>
<TE>   The academy is to be congratulated on its exhibition. We have a
long way to go before these ghosts are exorcised. (I am the author of
"Time in the Ditch: American Philosophy and the McCarthy Era.")</TE>

<TE>   I am certain you will get letters complaining about Brewer's
commentary. Recast it like this: Change "Communist Party" to "Nazi
Party" and see how the story now reads. It is only the very odd view
that communism was a wonderful policy that makes this "blacklist"
seem terrible. In view of the fact that communism helped no one,
murdered tens of millions (that fact is beyond dispute) and was
eventually rejected by the people it governed after leaving them in
poverty, it is indeed sad that anyone, anywhere, would defend support
of and association with such a group.</TE>
<TE>   If we had acted on the desires of these writers and directors and
established such a regime, how many of us would have been murdered?</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Stance on Parks Is Applauded, Booed</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How unfortunate that Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn has capitulated to
the police union. Although he, erroneously, offers up other reasons
for his lack of support for Chief Bernard Parks, the real reason is
the political muscle of the Police Protective League. Now, nowhere in
California can a police chief survive without constantly appeasing
the union types.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom line is, the LAPD needs more discipline, not less, and
Parks has shown the courage necessary to make the Los Angeles Police
Department, once again, the epitome of professional law enforcement.
The Times needs to do an in-depth study of the police culture and
what goes on behind the scenes; the public would be appalled.</LD>

<TE>   Other than being black, what has Parks done to benefit L.A.'s
African American community? I reside in one of the city's African
American "strongholds," yet I see increasing violence and graffiti.
Frankly, I share my neighbors' concern about changing demographics
and loss of political muscle. However, I cannot agree that supporting
Parks and dinosaurs like Councilman Nate Holden is in the bests
interest of our neighborhood or city.</TE>

<TE>   To those individuals who commented on Hahn's "courage" and
"boldness" in not supporting Parks' bid to continue as chief of
police, let me say that you obviously are confused. When you turn
your back on the constituents who (dare I say) put you in office,
doing the opposite of what they desire is not courage. It's called
back-stabbing. Those individuals who chose those words have never
been spread-eagled, disrespected, shot at, profiled or any other
unpleasant phrase one can use to describe the daily treatment of
citizens by the old LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   I have noticed a different treatment of L.A. citizens by the LAPD,
and I'm certain the chief has played a major role in that change.</TE>

<TE>   I applaud Hahn's decision regarding Parks' reappointment. It was
not, I am sure, an easy decision but nevertheless it was the right
one. It took courage, as I am sure he knew what the backlash would be
like. However, the statistics speak for themselves. This is not a
racial issue. In addition, shame on William Elkins [for refusing to
shake Hahn's hand at a Black History Month celebration]. This was not
the moment for him to behave in such a petulant manner.</TE>

<TE>   Re ''Hahn Betrayed the Faith Blacks Had in Him,'' Commentary, Feb.
8: What Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) seems to be saying to us
is that, in her world, it is right and fair for white people to be
judged based upon job performance but not people of color. She seems
to be telling us that people of color have an unquestionable right to
their jobs no matter how they perform or that a white mayor has no
right to an opinion of the job performance of a black city employee.</TE>
<TE>   Is it not possible for Waters to consider that perhaps Hahn does
not support Parks' second term based upon job performance and not
skin color? Given the Hahn family history with the African American
community of Los Angeles, Waters ought to consider that perhaps
Hahn's opinion of Parks' job performance is based upon factors other
than race.</TE>

condemns the leadership skills of the entire LAPD.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bridging the Artistic Gap for Students and Teachers," Feb. 6: The
ArtsBridge program is a huge asset to the schools that are lucky
enough to have it in their curriculum, and there is an alternative to
keep this program alive, to help more schools and allow more college
students to participate. The UCs should offer students college
credit, in lieu of an honorarium, as a part of the program. This
would not only solve the problem of possible budget cuts, it would
also allow more schools and students to become involved. Why give
$1,000 scholarships for an internship that could be done free? There
is such a shortage of funds in the school system as it is; the money
could be spent better elsewhere.</LD>

<LD>Re " 'Kidnapped' by Drivel, We Invite World Hatred," Commentary, Feb.
7: Although I appreciate Norah Vincent's effort to flag the "soulless
frippery" (great words) of current shows like "Fear Factor," "The
Chair," "Kidnapped," etc., it was overkill to use the seriousness of
reporter Daniel Pearl's abduction for contrast, as was the suggestion
that these programs justify "world hatred."</LD>
<LD>   We should simply hate ourselves for the decayed educational system
that produces the mindless audiences for this "teledrek." We might
consider apprehending the bottom-feeding TV executives responsible
for green-lighting these travesties, depriving them of sleep and
forcing them to watch this drivel on a round-the-clock basis until
they scream for mercy.</LD>
<LD>   Hal Greenfader</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent's denunciation of drivel TV "reality" programs is well
stated, and I'm fully prepared to agree with her, even though I never
watch these programs. In fact, that is my point: There are certainly
many Americans who are not watching such programs but instead tune in
to (for example) programs such as "Search for Destiny" that aired
recently on PBS and gave such invaluable historical background to the
seemingly incomprehensible violence in Israel and Palestine--violence
that cannot be understood if one does not go beyond current events.</TE>
<TE>   The real problem, in both cases, may be the same: The mass media
pander to the worst instincts in Americans and then are taken up
abroad as an image of all Americans. It is the same as when we watch
coverage of demonstrations in Pakistan or violence in the Gaza Strip
and then generalize such images, extending them to all Pakistanis,
Israelis or Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Or is that the problem? Perhaps it is actually the soul-numbing
consumerism that characterizes our country and invites people to seek
relief from deadness in any easy way they can find. Even President
Bush urges us to consume more to bring the economy back to strength.</TE>

<LD>I highly approve of the decision made by U.S. Magistrate W. Curtis
Sewell in not allowing John Walker Lindh to be placed in the custody
of his father ("Lindh E-Mails Unsympathetic," Feb. 7). The father has
shown that he did a lousy job of parenting leading up to this; why
should he be trusted now? The father claims his son was just a
teenage kid trying to find himself. Well, he found himself in the
wrong place.</LD>

<TE>   Why should the American people have to pay to support Lindh in
comfort in prison? Let's just drop him off in the mountains of his
chosen Afghanistan, where he can struggle to eke out a living among
the now-liberated people, who will view him as a pariah and treat him
more appropriately.</TE>

<LD>In "The Root of Secession's Stall: Identity" (Opinion, Feb. 3), Joel
Kotkin correctly says that secessionists are failing due to a lack of
a positive vision. All I ever hear from them is negative harping.
Being a third-generation Angeleno living in the Valley for the past
26 years, if I am to consider voting positively for secession I need
to see a positive vision of what they say a Valley city would be
like.</LD>
<LD>   All I hear is the constant pounding on the many problems the city
is faced with and their assumptions that secession would solve them
all. All they've done is give me a headache. I don't want to make
these huge changes based on negatives but rather on a positive vision
of how things will be better.</LD>

<TE>   "Words in Our Hands"</TE>
<TE>   by Ada B. Litchfield</TE>
<TE>   Michael Turner is 9. He has two sisters named Gina and Diana.
Their parents are deaf. Michael's parents went to a school for deaf
children when they were growing up. They learned how to talk in sign
language. They had never heard people talking or their own voices.
They don't even know how voices sound. Mr. and Mrs. Turner could hear
with their eyes and talk with their hands. The family went to a play
one night, and all of the actors and audience were deaf. Michael,
Gina and Diana learned there were many friendly people in town that
could talk with their parents.</TE>

<TE>   There is a little girl who finds a turtle egg. She takes it home

<LD>Once upon a time, there was a village named Phu Dong, in Bac Ninh
city in Vietnam. In that small village lived a 5-year-old boy who
could not talk, walk or sit up. His parents were sad, but they did
not know what to do to help him.</LD>
<LD>   One day, a soldier brought news from the king. The powerful An
invaders were very near. The king called for a hero to save the
country.</LD>
<LD>   When news came to the door of the boy, he sat up and spoke to his
parents.</LD>
<TE>   "Cook for me five pots of rice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After he finished all five pots of rice, he yawned and stood up.
He turned into a young, healthy man. He told the soldier, "Go back to
the palace. Ask the king to make for me an iron rod and an iron
horse. I will chase the enemy out of the country."</TE>
<TE>   The soldier went back to the palace and reported the story to the
king. The king thought that the heavens wanted to help the country.
He sent the items to the village.</TE>
<TE>   The young man received the rod and the horse. He rode to the
battlefield and chased the enemy out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   After that, no one saw him again. People said, "He and his horse
disappeared in the Soc Son Mountain."</TE>
<TE>   The king honored him as "Phu Dong Thien Vuong," the heaven king of
Phu Dong village, and built him a temple.</TE>
<TE>   To this very day, you can go to the Phu Dong village in Bac Ninh
city and see the temple and the horse's footprints on the road.</TE>
<TE>   This is the Vietnamese legend of the iron horse.</TE>

<HD>Sarajevo's Lessons for Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>How do you reforge a nation out of groups bent on mutual
destruction?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BROOKS</AU>
<BD>Geraldine Brooks is a former Middle East correspondent
for The Wall Street Journal and the author, most recently, of "Year
of Wonders."</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>During the war, a secret tunnel ran under this city's besieged
airport and came up in Bajro Kolar's basement. Every night, some 20
tons of food, arms and medicine flowed through the tunnel into the
starving city, while ill and injured people flowed out.</LD>
<LD>   Now, six years after the war's end, Kolar has turned the tunnel
into a private museum. A city map on the basement wall shows Serbian
siege lines. The map happens to be the one produced for the 1984
Winter Olympics, with cheerful graphics showing the slalom course and
bobsled run. "I use this map to remind people that we once were an
Olympic capital and hopefully will be a future one," says Kolar.</LD>
<TE>   He isn't the only hopeful man in Sarajevo, a city that offers many
lessons in how--and how not--to rebuild a society shattered by civil
war. Last December, 25 specialists from the United Nations mission
here left for Afghanistan to assess what a similar mission there
should look like. They took with them everything from tents to food
to experience in trying to reforge a nation out of groups engaged in
mutual destruction. Some of the lessons--that peace must be planned
for as exactingly as a military campaign, that outside investment
needs to be substantial and ongoing and that foreign forces are
likely to be needed as peacekeepers for decades--may prove
unpalatable to an already stretched international community.
Bosnia-Herzegovina remains an international protectorate, with its
own political leaders showing little will to move away from sectarian
and nationalist positions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sarajevo is struggling back into its mantle of tolerant
multiculturalism. While shrapnel-pocked walls and ruined buildings
remain common here, much has been renewed. An Irish pub offers "20
brands of world beer"; the city's first sex shop just opened. Down
the block, a muezzin calls the faithful to prayer under a fall of fat
snowflakes.</TE>
<TE>   The much-shelled Holiday Inn has been reincarnated, bright as a
child's Lego tower, in blocks of vivid yellow. The airport, where
passengers used to be warned to sit on their flak jackets for
take-off and landing in case of upward-aimed sniper fire, has a smart
new terminal. Sycamore and birch saplings line the streets, replacing
trees that were cut down for fuel during the cruel winters of the
siege. Along the once-perilous airport road, the ruined
student-housing complex has been renovated by the United Nations for
use as mission headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   That mission is due to begin scaling down this year. In
retrospect, says Jacques Paul Klein, the U.N. special representative
here, the international community's biggest mistake was failing to
plan adequately for peace. In Germany and Japan, he says, the allies
had such a plan. "Here, we assumed if we stopped the violence, that
would be enough." The result: "The war went on bureaucratically, with
obfuscation and delay."</TE>
<TE>   The former U.S. air-force general cites such things as stripping
ethnic symbols from car license plates and currency as examples of
the small steps that are helping to forge "a single economic and
political space." Bosnia-Herzegovina's currency is printed with Latin
and Cyrillic script in alternating pride of place at the top of each
bill. Cars bearing the old license plates, which had identifying
national symbols such as the Croatian savonica (checkered shield),
Serb cross or Bosnian lily, were often run off the road when they
passed through neighborhoods of opposing groups. The new plates use
only random numbers and the six letters common to the Latin and
Cyrillic alphabets. While Serb leaders had proclaimed that they would
sooner eat grass than surrender their symbol, ordinary Serbs, who had
had to drive miles out of their way in order to stay on roads within
Serb territory, were the swiftest to adopt the new plates.</TE>
<TE>   To create a new flag, Klein set only one design criterion: "That
no one had died for it." He commissioned a panel of academics to come
up with three designs, which he promised to present to the
parliament. When the first two designs were noisily rejected, Klein
declared the third accepted by default. The flag--a yellow triangle
representing the shape of the state on a ground of European-Union
blue with a diagonal row of stars along one side of the
triangle--flies from many buildings in downtown Sarajevo. However,
when Klein last visited the Serb leadership in the nearby village of
Pale, the flag was stowed in a desk drawer.</TE>
<TE>   There have been practical changes, as well as symbolic ones. The
state now has a border patrol and a largely retrained police force.
Officers who committed economic or war crimes have been fired. A
group of 25 Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims are serving in the U.N.
police force in East Timor, while a similarly diverse force of 30 are
military observers in Ethiopia and Eritrea. "The leaders said we
couldn't have a mixed force, that they'd shoot each other, but when I
told them the per diem was U.S. $110, they rethought that."</TE>
<TE>   The new calm is held together by a conspicuous NATO-led
peacekeeping force. U.S. soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina wear
battle-dress at all times, even when handing out dreidels and
chocolate gelt at a Hanukkah celebration thrown by the city's small
Jewish community. Jacob Finci, a leader of that community, laments
that the city's Jewish museum, closed along with others during the
war, still has not been allowed to reopen. "One year after the
devastation of World War II, the museums of this city were open," he
says. But now, "No one can agree anymore on how the history should be
presented." At the National Museum, the only open exhibition features
Roman antiquities and a prehistoric boat--artifacts that predate the
arrival of Serbs, Croats and Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, which was heavily shelled, remains only partly
repaired and has been without heat for nine years. The damp masonry
of the interior so magnifies the cold, says the director, Denana
Buturovic, that her fax machine has frozen. Instead of the grand
director's office, she has retreated to a tiny room where a space
heater makes work bearable if she keeps her hat and coat on. But the
museum soon may have at least one comfortable room.</TE>
<TE>   On the top floor of a nearby bank, watched over by museum staff,
Sarajevan police and U.N. guards, Andrea Pataki, a book conservator
from Stuttgart, is working to stabilize the museum's chief treasure:
a rare illuminated Hebrew manuscript created in 14th-century Spain
and somehow spared from Inquisition book burnings. Saved twice by
Bosnian Muslim museum staff--once from the Nazis during World War II
and again, in 1992, from Serb shelling--the codex spent the recent
war hidden in a bank vault. The manuscript has become a symbol of the
survival of the city's multiethnic ideal. Klein is gathering funds
from the World Bank and private donors to repair the manuscript's
binding and create a secure, climate-controlled room in which he
hopes the Haggada can be displayed, along with related art works such
as Serbian Orthodox icons and Islamic miniatures.</TE>
<TE>   As she watches over the restoration, the museum's assistant
director, Mirsada Muskic, has dreams of another way in which the
international community could support Sarajevo's reconstruction. In
an act of supreme optimism, the Sarajevans have bid for the 2010
Olympic Winter Games. During the war, the start of the 1984 bobsled
run became a notorious sniper pit, while the Olympic archives and
museum were torched. "We are poor now," concedes Muskic, but she
somehow hopes the International Olympic Committee might, in a triumph
of idealism, overlook that. "We are experts at hope," she says. "We
have to be."</TE>

<HD>Many Latin Americans Oppose Trade Deal</HD>
<DH>Critics want a partnership, but a more equitable one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to The Nation
magazine. His latest book is "Pinochet and Me: A Chilean
Anti-Memoir," now in paperback from Verso.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Porto Alegre, Brazil--In U.S. living rooms, talk about such policy
measures as the White House's proposed Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) is likely to elicit clueless shrugs. But south of the
Rio Grande, millions of Latin Americans consider FTAA--and U.S. trade
policy in general--to be an immediate issue of life and death
urgency.</LD>
<LD>   No surprise, then, that as some 40,000 social activists and
scholars met here last week to strategize against what they call
"corporate globalization," they chose resistance to the FTAA as one
of their top priorities. "We will fight it every possible way and we
will defeat it," vowed Luis Inacio da Silva, Brazil's most important
opposition politician. As head of the left-of-center Workers' Party,
which governs large parts of Brazil, Da Silva, or "Lula" as he is
known to most Brazilians, is currently leading in opinion polls for
this October's presidential election. The FTAA, he says, "isn't
really a free trade pact. Rather, it's a policy of annexation of
Latin America by the United States."</LD>
<LD>   Lula's characterization of the agreement is at sharp odds with
that of the Bush administration, which claims that the proposed
agreement would help the hemisphere's poor by encouraging a freer
flow of goods among all 34 countries stretching between Canada and
Argentina. The administration hopes a pact can be approved and
implemented by 2005.</LD>
<TE>   So, why such a sour view from Lula and other Latin Americans--the
very people President Bush says this agreement would benefit? Critics
of the FTAA say it would allow powerful countries like the U.S. to
force smaller countries to open their markets, which would then be
quickly absorbed. Underdeveloped countries couldn't hope to compete
with giants like the U.S., which would, in the end, gobble up an even
greater piece of the economic pie.</TE>
<TE>   Even some leading free-trade defenders concede the same point.
Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, chief trade advisor to the
Organization of American States (OAS), acknowledges that, while he
remains hopeful, there has been no substantial reduction in Latin
American poverty after a decade of trade liberalization encouraged by
Washington. "Liberalization was not the miracle or the magic formula
that many expected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Objections to the FTAA center on the same point: the pact would
diminish the power of nation-states to regulate their own economies
and protect their own citizens. Like the 1994 North Atlantic Free
Trade Agreement signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the new pact
would allow corporations to sue individual governments over any law
that might diminish private profit, including legislation that
protects consumers, communities, labor and the environment. Already,
under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, Mexico has been successfully sued by a
U.S. company for trying to protect itself against toxic dumping by
blocking the company's expansion plans. And a Canadian firm has sued
the U.S., claiming a California anti-air pollution law interferes
with profit-making.</TE>
<TE>   The FTAA would also severely erode controls on foreign investment
capital--the same sort of controls that the International Monetary
Fund says have been key in providing financial stability in countries
ranging from Chile and Colombia to Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   With the richest economy in South America and the ninth-biggest in
the world, Brazil worries that American corporations would use the
FTAA to exploit the abundant resources of the Amazon. The trade
debate has become so contentious in Brazil that the recent
assassinations of two Workers' Party mayors have been widely
interpreted here as an attempt to intimidate Lula and force him to
withdraw from the presidential race, thereby silencing a central FTAA
critic.</TE>
<TE>   But hesitation over FTAA extends beyond Lula's leftist opposition.
Recently, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress unanimously
passed a nonbinding resolution calling for withdrawal from the
current FTAA negotiations with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Such opposition also extends into the United States, where there
is fear that, as has been the case with NAFTA, the export of domestic
jobs will be greatly accelerated if the FTAA is implemented.
Resistance from labor, citizen and environmental groups has been so
stiff that, two months ago, when the Bush administration asked for
"trade promotion authority" to expedite negotiation of the FTAA, the
measure passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote, at
a time when Bush was at the height of his post-Sept. 11 popularity.</TE>
<TE>   In its desperation to ram this measure through Congress, the White
House may have done itself more damage than good. Last-minute
backroom deals with wavering members of Congress guaranteed more
trade protection for U.S. agricultural interests--not only
contradicting the spirit of free trade but infuriating major trading
partners. A few days after the squeaker House vote, Brazil's moderate
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso condemned the protectionist
measures.</TE>
<TE>   In the months to come, as negotiations on FTAA become more
intense, so will resistance and protest. U.S. opponents say they will
apply the "Dracula Strategy" to defeat the pact. "The more we expose
it to the sunlight of public opinion, the more unpopular it will
become," says Lori M. Wallach of the nonprofit Public Citizen's
Global Trade Watch division.</TE>
<TE>   From Brazil and the rest of Latin America, meanwhile, anti-FTAA
campaigners will make it clear they are not flat-Earthers opposed to
all trade agreements or to greater economic integration. Rather, they
will argue that it is the height of cynicism to contend that treating
radically unequal partners equally is somehow fair. These critics
want a partnership with the U.S.--but a more equitable one.</TE>
<TE>   One model frequently cited as more attractive is that of the
European Union. When the EU was being formed, "compensatory" measures
were enacted so that richer countries--like Germany and
France--provided significant development aid as well as trade and
currency advantages to poorer partners like Greece and Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   If President Bush is serious about his promise to help lift Latin
Americans out of poverty, he should follow the European example. An
FTAA based on the notion that a country like landlocked and
impoverished Bolivia can be an equal trading partner with the U.S.
will only deepen the hemispheric divide. A more authentic partnership
between North and South America would not only establish rules for
fair and increased trade and alleviate the suffocating burden of
Southern debt, but would also embody a continental Marshall Plan that
would seriously address the currently unsustainable imbalances in
education, health care, the environment and human rights.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no evidence to suggest that Bush is serious about his
hemispheric anti-poverty promise, which probably means a rocky road
ahead. This might be a good moment, then, for average Americans to
start brushing up on the alphabet-soup details of NAFTA, GATT (the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and the FTAA. They're likely
to be hearing a lot of angry protesting about these issues in the
next few months, and they might want to know what all the shouting is
about.</TE>

<HD>Al Who? Gore's Uphill Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK W. GERMOND</AU>
<BD>Jack Germond is a political writer in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore's lurch into what he called "the
national debate" is based on two flimsy premises. The first is that
there is such a debate, and the second is that he has the political
standing to take part.</LD>
<LD>   The whole notion of a national debate suggests two sides of some
reasonably equal heft, with some kind of jury of Americans weighing
one issue against the other. At the moment, however, President Bush
dominates the political discussion to the point that Democratic
leaders in Congress can do no more than quibble about the particulars
of a few domestic issues. That situation is likely to change as the
memories of Sept. 11 fade, but not until several months into this
election year at the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the nature and timing of the national dialogue, however,
there is no reason to believe the former vice president is a relevant
player. His position as a potential presidential candidate in 2004
rests almost entirely on the reluctance--perhaps inability--of both
Democratic Party leaders and the press to speak frankly about his
standing.</LD>
<TE>   The broad and pervasive consensus in the political community today
is that Gore is finished as a national candidate. While Republicans
lick their chops at the thought of a Gore candidacy, there is not a
single Democrat of any national prominence publicly supporting him
for the 2004 presidential nomination. Privately he is faring even
worse. As a Californian who raised serious money for Gore's 2000
campaign said, "I can't say this out loud, but I've been there, done
that." Asked about organized labor's attitude toward Gore this time,
an AFL-CIO official replied, "Al Who?" Big labor is absolutely
critical to any Gore campaign. And John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, has said privately--and repeatedly--that his organization
will not repeat the mistake it made in the 2000 campaign when labor's
early endorsement was critical to Gore's triumph over former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in the pivotal Iowa presidential caucuses.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Gore continues to figure prominently in the speculation on
2004. Why? Because public opinion polls show him leading the
Democratic field. Both the politicians and the press know those polls
are essentially meaningless. Most Americans pay far too little
attention to public affairs to be able to identify a John Kerry or a
Tom Daschle, even if they retain some vague notion of who Gore is.
But neither the news organizations who pay for the polls nor the
political leaders who follow them are willing to say they are based
on sand.</TE>
<TE>   Gore cannot be a serious contender because he committed the one
unpardonable sin in politics: He lost an election he should have won.
Easily. He was a de facto incumbent running on a strong record of
eight years against an awkward and inarticulate Republican with thin
credentials at best. It should have been a boat ride.</TE>
<TE>   There is some lingering sympathy for the former vice president.
After all, Bill Clinton didn't make things easy for him. And Gore did
carry the popular vote. He lost several states only because Ralph
Nader and his Green Party decided there was no difference between the
Republicans and Democrats and ran an ego-trip candidacy. It took a
combination of Nader and a political U.S. Supreme Court ruling to
deny Gore the state of Florida and the White House. But the sorry
fact remains that he lost his home state of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   There may have been strategic and tactical mistakes--should
Clinton, say, have been utilized more effectively?--but the core of
the problem was the candidate. He changed his shirts and his persona
so often that, as the campaign came to an end, many Americans didn't
feel comfortable with him. His campaign was too contrived and
mechanical; there was no one willing to walk through a wall for him.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Gore's behavior since the election been comforting. He was
clearly entitled to a European respite, but he could have shed the
beard before coming back. Instead, he continues to wear it in what is
being interpreted as a signal of another "new" Gore, this time a
laid-back model. What political professionals see here is evidence
that the flaws that cost him the 2000 election he should have won
were not the kind of flaws that can be corrected. He can talk about
"mending fences" in Tennessee, an obvious first step toward 2004. But
he cannot shed the image of the contrived candidate too controlled to
be human.</TE>
<TE>   It is always possible, of course, for Gore to overcome all these
obstacles. After all, Richard M. Nixon won the presidency in 1968
after losing both the 1960 presidential election and the California
gubernatorial election two years later. And Nixon was even less able
to incite the passions of the street. Talk about controlled and
contrived, he retired the cup.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, nonetheless, writing a Democratic Party scenario
for 2004 starring Al Gore is a stretch, a long stretch.</TE>

<KH>GLOBALIZATION</KH>
<HD>As the World Shrinks</HD>
<DH>One salient feature of globalization is loss of control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL KOSS</AU>
<BD>Mitchell Koss is a producer for Channel One News. His
work has appeared on public television's "Nova" and "The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer," and on ABC and MTV.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last weekend, a self-selected group of world economic leaders
gathered in New York City at the World Economic Forum for a round of
self-congratulatory discussions on the future of globalization. At
the same time, thousands of anti-globalization activists attending
the World Social Forum danced for the cameras through the streets of
Porto Alegre, Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters complained that globalization homogenizes
the world's cultures. They also charged that it has a devastating
impact on Western manufacturing jobs, because tens of millions
of Third-World workers, eager for jobs in the overseas factories of
Western companies, are willing to work for wages far lower than those
paid in the U.S. or Europe. This is hard to dispute.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, the corporate leaders believe that as the tide
of globalization lifts their yachts, it will also lift the Third
World's rowboats. Measured by the relative reduction of poverty in
places like China, India and Uganda over the past decade, this
reality also seems to be true.</LD>
<TE>   It seems to me that both sides share a set of wrong assumptions,
for which I blame the media.</TE>
<TE>   We journalists--particularly TV news people--have done a terrible
job of reporting on what globalization is actually doing to this
single, shrinking world we all share. Until Sept. 11, the U.S. public
that relies on television news didn't know much about the rest of the
world beyond the sad fact that Princess Di was dead. Since then,
we've done a bit better. But in terms of globalization, we seem to
have failed to point out something essential: To be for or against
globalization implies that we can control it. From what I've
observed, the salient feature of globalization is loss of control.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, my big picture is built only of the many small things
I've observed first-hand. But it seems to me that whether I've been
looking at organized crime in Russia or the Falun Gong in China or
drug lords in Colombia, I've seen the same thing: governments losing
control as market forces take hold. And that loss of control has
resulted in something else--more freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Think back to 1994. when then-President Bill Clinton reversed the
human-rights positions of candidate Clinton. The key to winning
freedom in China, he began saying, was not sanctions, but trade. He
asked us to believe that somehow the number of new high-rise
buildings going up in China would correlate directly with an increase
in freedoms for China's emerging middle class. At the time, Clinton's
reversal seemed to me an act of political expediency. Then, I began
going to China.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1994, the first time I worked in China,
globalization was just beginning to take hold. People were reluctant
to express themselves publicly, even in Shanghai, the most developed
city. We asked people if they felt free, but got little for our
efforts--other than a stern lecture from one of our mandatory
government escorts. Crowds would gather around us when we videotaped
on the streets, but melt away rapidly if the camera panned over
them--as if even being seen in a crowd shot was too risky.</TE>
<TE>   But globalization was creating a new middle class. Hundreds of
millions of people around the world, including in China, were
interacting with economic and cultural forces outside their borders.
On a superficial level, this globalization could be tracked in the
loss of local culture--in the spread of McDonald's outlets or in the
sudden proliferation of bottle blonds. But as governments began to
lose control of their economic and cultural borders, they began to
lose control in other areas too.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, this loss of control by governments was most
often reported on obliquely. Reporters focused on the rise of
multinational criminal groups, such as the mafias in the former
Soviet Union and the drug-trafficking organizations in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   But in China, where the government had controlled so much of life,
this loss of control meant the government couldn't repress people as
effectively. Each time I returned to China in the '90s, the Chinese
people seemed to have gained new freedoms. On my sixth visit, in July
1999, we looked at an emerging spiritual group called Falun Gong.
Each morning, members of the group meditated together in public
places. They hardly seemed threatening--largely a collection of
retired people. But after organizing a protest in Tiananmen Square in
April 1999 that drew some 10,000 protesters, the group was under
pressure from the government. From what we could see, Falun Gong did
not seem to be bowing to the government's pressure. Early one Monday
morning outside the walls of the Forbidden City in Beijing, we
interviewed some Falun Gong members, who warily stated their resolve.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the Falun Gong movement was banned by the
Chinese government. Thousands of people were rounded up. But the ban
only underscored that fact that, in the new climate fostered by
globalization, an unsanctioned movement had grown to the point that
it had actually frightened the government.</TE>
<TE>   Even more striking is the existence of tens of millions of
"underground" Christians--Chinese who attend churches not sanctioned
by the government and therefore illegal. In January 2000, a colleague
found a Chinese American missionary who regularly visited China to
minister to the underground Christians. Last year, after nearly a
year of planning, we joined him in Hong Kong and then traveled to the
mainland. Our trip began with him delivering religious books to a
secret training center for ministers that occupied the top two floors
of a medium-rise apartment building in a neighborhood of dozens of
identical structures. We ended the trip literally underground, in a
Central China basement of an abandoned industrial building where 80
leaders of one of China's largest Protestant sects were meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In between, we traveled a lot in the dark, never stood by windows,
sometimes lived in very rough conditions and heard many stories of
persecution. Because, although the Chinese government has granted its
people more social and economic freedoms, religious and political
freedoms are still something people have to secretly create for
themselves, as the underground Christians have. Despite the secrecy,
people were willing, even eager, to talk to our cameras, provided we
did not name them nor divulge the cities they lived in. The fact that
so many ordinary Chinese were willing to defy their
government--something that would have seemed impossible a decade
earlier--said a lot about development, globalization and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   After our story aired on both Channel One and ABC's "Nightline," I
wondered if I'd be able to get another visa. But we were back in
China last August. In Guangzhou, we approached young people in
shopping malls to ask them how free they felt. This time, no one was
camera-shy. And they were frank: "If you obey the government," one
said, "they will give you enough human rights. But if you do
something they don't like, they will never give you any human
rights." And there's the paradox of progress: People feel free enough
to say that they're not entirely free.</TE>
<TE>   The same loss of control is going on in other authoritarian
nations. On the first evening of my first visit to Iran, in 1993, I
was arrested and detained for three days for interviewing people in a
Tehran park without a government escort--something tantamount to
spying back then. On the first evening of my most recent visit, in
the summer of 2000, two young Iranian men took us out to videotape
them trying to pick up women in the section of Tehran they call
"Flirt Street," a place kids cruise in defiance of religious
hard-liners. Iran is one of the world's youngest nations in
demographic terms, and thanks to all those hidden satellite dishes
and bootlegged CDs, the kids are no longer under complete control.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, it's easy to show Chinese praying or Iranian kids
holding hands in public to convey the weakening of repression. It's
harder to show--or even really to see--how the weakening of
government is affecting large globalizing nations that are already
democratic, such as India and Brazil. Globalization seems to work as
a kind of promise in the developing world, where even those not yet
receiving its benefits can hope that they'll be next. But as
governments cede control of their economies to market forces, they
may also have less ability to help populations that could turn
suddenly restive if the new economies falter. Since loss of control
is likely to be tough to reverse, it seems like we--all of us, the
whole world--are going to find out.</TE>

<HD>What Is This Thing We Call Love?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES LINDHOLM</AU>
<BD>Charles Lindholm is a professor of anthropology at
Boston University and author, most recently, of "The Islamic Middle
East: An Historical Anthropology.</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>According to a Greek legend cited by Plato in "The Symposium," human
beings were originally starfish-like creatures, with four arms, four
legs and two sets of sexual organs. Each human being was complete
unto itself. Then, because of their pride and ambition, humans were
split in half by the gods, which is why we now spend our lives
searching for that other half, compulsively seeking unity in the arms
of another.</LD>
<LD>   That's one way of looking at that most intimate quest we call
falling in love--although not, probably, one you'll find expressed in
greeting-card sentiments as Valentine's Day approaches.</LD>
<LD>   What the Greeks meant by love and what we mean by it are far
different things. The Greeks, and the Romans after them, saw
passionate love as a kind of dangerous illness. It could tear
respectable young people away from their families and draw them into
disadvantageous affairs with inappropriate mates; it could make
adults act like fools. Such passions had to be rigorously guarded
against. And they certainly had no place in the relationship between
husband and wife. As the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote: "Nothing is
more depraved than to love one's wife as if she were a mistress."</LD>
<TE>   For modern Americans, in contrast, romantic love is the highest
attainment: We celebrate it in song, our poets and novelists
chronicle its pains and pleasures, our movies present love stories
that ordinary people attempt to emulate. Such passionate love leads
naturally, we assume, to marriage and a family. It is what binds a
man and woman together as a couple; it "makes the world go 'round."
It is seen as an essential human need.</TE>
<TE>   So how, then, did love come to mean something so different in our
world than it did in ancient times? It's all about social
organization. Greek and Roman societies were largely based on
patrilineal descent groups. Only through membership in a patrilineage
could men make claims to property, or assert leadership; women, too,
relied on their patrilineage for protection and honor. It was the
essential glue of society, providing identity, safety and continuity.
Through marriage, a lineage could be strengthened or weakened.</TE>
<TE>   In this context matrimony was too important a matter to be decided
by young people, particularly if they were in the throes of passion.
Rather, marriage arrangements were negotiated by elders, with an eye
to advancing the interests of the clan. A new wife entered her
husband's extended family as a stranger, under the thumb of her
in-laws; her life was confined to the home, where she could gain
status by bearing children. Meanwhile, her husband was likely to
avoid the women's quarters altogether, competing with other men for
honor and renown in the public sphere. In such societies, men and
women alike viewed marriage as a duty and a necessity; sexual passion
between husband and wife would be an act of disloyalty to the larger
extended family.</TE>
<TE>   Passion, although removed from the marriage bed, did play a role
in ancient societies. Sexual desire was simply directed elsewhere.
For patrician men in Greece and Rome, the objects of desire were very
often women (or sometimes men) of the slave and courtesan classes,
whose business was providing pleasure. The channeling of sexuality
away from marriage preserved the staid atmosphere of the family, but
could have disastrous consequences when lust turned, as it sometimes
did, into love. Men occasionally sacrificed honor and wealth for the
sake of a prostitute's favor, bringing disgrace and ruin upon
themselves. Although they, too, occasionally got enmeshed in wanton
and destructive affairs, women did not have the same opportunities
for passionate pursuits, and so instead lavished their thwarted
affections on their sons.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Greeks and Romans, modern Americans also fear adulterous
affairs, but not for the same reasons. In our society, descent is
neither patrilineal nor matrilineal, but instead is traced through
both male and female lines. As a result, we do not belong to solitary
clans, and kinship ties, though affectionate (at least ideally), are
very rarely central to our economic and political lives. Rather, each
of us struggles to achieve his or her own potential in a fluid
society of competitive individualists. We do not expect or want our
families to contract marriages for us, but instead yearn to fall in
love and to realize our own personal dreams.</TE>
<TE>   In a traditional society, mates are chosen for practical reasons
from a limited range of candidates whose virtues can be easily
calibrated. But in our culture, where the range of potential mates is
infinite and more or less equivalent, only the irrational compulsion
of love can release us from the quandary of choice. Of course, this
does not explain where that compulsion comes from in the first
place--only that it serves a purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Our current societal bent toward independence, social mobility,
free choice and marriages that grow out of love has been linked to
the rise of capitalism. It is certainly true that, as capitalism has
triumphed throughout the world, love-based marriages have also become
more prevalent. But it is also true that in England, the cradle of
capitalism, marriages for love (along with social mobility and
personal autonomy) preceded the rise of the capitalistic economy. And
love-based marriages were also the norm in such small-scale
hunting-and-gathering cultures as the Ife of Central Africa, the Kung
bushmen of Botswana and the Ojibway of North America's Great Lakes
region.</TE>
<TE>   These seeming anomalies are explicable in cultural terms. Like our
own society, simple hunting and gathering societies prize
individualism. They are highly mobile. People have little attachment
to kin groups and must make their own way in a risky environment. As
free agents, they are able to choose whom they wish to marry.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the big question: Why should that choice be surrounded
by a cloud of romance? Why don't men simply choose the best gatherer,
the most fecund child-bearer? Why do women not automatically select
the male most likely to bring down the prey?</TE>
<TE>   These questions are at the core of a very old debate about the
nature of romantic love. On one side are those who believe that all
the fuss and bother, all the romance and adoration, are just a cover
for something much more fundamental: sexual desire. Romantic love,
they contend, is simply a mask that makes lust respectable. The other
side insists that love exists as its own highest end. Lovers love not
because they wish to gain sexual pleasure, but because love bestows
the ultimate value on both lover and beloved. Romance, they believe,
is something akin to worship.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps Plato was right. What we are looking for in love is
only symbolized by sex. It is really something far more powerful:
completion.</TE>

<DH>Enron and the Bush family have boosted each other up the

Political History of the American Rich," will be published in May.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Enron's spectacular collapse has put scores of politicians on the
defensive because of their pro-Enron voting records and their war
chests full of Enron dollars. Even some Cabinet officials are
squirming over their past relationships with the energy company. It's
all an unsettling echo of Teapot Dome, the
government-oil-reserve-loan scandal of the Harding presidency, which
became a symbol of the financial and political abuses of the 1920s.</LD>
<LD>   In 1921, the U.S. Interior Department rigged the leasing of
California's Elk Hills and Wyoming's Teapot Dome naval oil reserves
after Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall received "loans" from oilmen
Edward L. Doheny and Harry Sinclair. The loans of cash and stock were
in the $400,000 range, with a "gift" of $100,000 from Doheny.</LD>
<LD>   Both Teapot and Enron involved energy policy, privatization and
corruption. And like Teapot Dome's "Ohio gang" of ethically loose
Harding cronies, oilmen and administration officials--energy
deregulation during the first Bush administration, through the
Clinton years and George W.'s time as governor of Texas on up till
today has been warped and feasted upon by a Texas-led "Enron gang."
In both scandals, some Democrats were involved, but the power centers
of misbehavior were Republican.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, there has been nothing quite like the rise and fall of Enron
in U.S. history, certainly no plausible comparison since the
late-19th-century heyday of railroads and robber barons. The sums in
Enron's collapse certainly overshadow those in Teapot, much as a
space shuttle does a Model T Ford. More important, not in memory has
a single major company grown so big in tandem with a presidential
dynasty and a corrupted political system. Indeed, the Bush family has
been a prominent and well-rewarded rung in Enron's climb to national
political influence.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, it's unclear whether the Bush dynasty built Enron
or vice versa. In 1985, when Enron was formed, the Bushes were an
important political family. George Bush, as vice president, headed
the Reagan administration's task force on energy policy. But in terms
of Texas oil money and stature, the Bushes were third echelon. When
George W. ran for governor of Texas in 1994, Ann Richards, the
Democratic incumbent, joked that of the oil companies he had started
or been involved with, none had made a profit. Enron's rise, with the
Bush family's help, in the 1990s rearranged the energy power
structure in Texas and the nation, and put the Bush entourage in
clover. The question now is whether what went up together will come
down together.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1988, when his father was president-elect, George W.
Bush lobbied the Argentine government on behalf of an Enron pipeline
proposal. Bush, through his staff, has denied making a telephone call
on Enron's behalf, but Rodolfo Terragno, the Argentine minister of
public works and services at the time, insists he did. When newly
elected President Carlos Menem made a sweetheart deal with Enron,
freeing the corporation of certain Argentine tariffs and taxes when
doing business in the country, lawmakers demanded an investigation,
and a special prosecutor undertook the task. But since his Justice
Department was already "investigating," Menem fired the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   From 1988 to 1992, Bush the elder collected hefty political
contributions from Enron. When president, it was his ambassador in
Buenos Aires who had pushed for favorable tax treatment for Enron in
Argentina. Bush asked Enron chief Kenneth L. Lay to co-chair a host
committee for the July 1990 G-7 economic summit in Houston and
appointed him to his Export Council in late 1990. A year earlier,
Bush energy officials began work on the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Its
provisions obliged utility companies to carry and transmit
Enron-generated electricity, which contributed to the company's
subsequent huge growth. In 1992, Lay was named co-chairman of the
Bush reelection campaign and chairman of the host committee of the
Republican National Convention in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1992, Bush's Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
chaired by Wendy L. Gramm, wife of Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, created
a legal exemption that allowed Enron to begin trading energy
derivatives--another growth enhancer for the company. When Bush left
the White House in 1993, Enron made Wendy Gramm a company director
and signed a joint consulting and investing agreement with James A.
Baker III, Bush's secretary of State, and Robert A. Mosbacher, his
Commerce secretary. The two were to do Enron's global deal-making for
natural-gas projects.</TE>
<TE>   How much the Bush family and its close political entourage
actually collected from Enron and its executives since the company
was organized is a matter of definition--reportable political
contributions, soft money for the Republican Party, finders' fees,
joint investments, inauguration funding, presidential-library
donations, speech money, capital gains, consulting fees, directors'
fees or what? If you combine what the multiple Bush generations
received with what loyalists Vice President Dick Cheney, Baker,
Mosbacher, political advisor Karl Rove, economic advisor Lawrence B.
Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick got, you
certainly have $6 million to $8 million, and depending on the success
of the Baker-Mosbacher-Enron joint investments, perhaps $20 million
to $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   On top of which, 29 top Enron executives and board members (and
its accounting firm, Andersen), the majority of whom were significant
Bush contributors in 2000, are being sued by Enron shareholders to
recover $1.1 billion made by the 29 in alleged insider trading of
Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   But let us return to Texas in 1995. George W. Bush has been
elected and inaugurated as governor. Enron chairman Lay and Joe B.
Allen of Vinson &amp; Elkins, Enron's Houston law firm, are his top
fund-raisers. Lay also chairs the governor's Business Council, and
press reports have Lay writing regularly to Bush, seeking favors,
recommending appointments and asking the governor to receive visiting
dignitaries from places where Enron hoped to do business.</TE>
<TE>   Bush began pushing Enron-backed deregulation in his first year as
governor. In 1997, he urged then-Pennsylvania GOP Gov. Tom Ridge to
support an Enron-backed energy-deregulation plan for the state. Then
in 1999, Bush succeeded in getting a kindred deregulatory blueprint
enacted in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Bush was running for president and, once again, Enron's
checkbook was open. Lay and Enron would be Bush's biggest corporate
contributor, with Vinson &amp; Elkins not too far behind. This was the
year when Lay also sent a memo to company employees urging them to
contribute personally to Bush through the Enron Political Action
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's roster of advisors and lobbyists became a pay-station for
senior Bush campaign strategists and advisors: Lindsey, former
Christian Coalition honcho Ralph Reed and Zoellick.</TE>
<TE>   When the 2000 presidential election ended up in the Florida
courts, Enron helped fund the Bush campaign's expenses, a fitting
gesture because the effort's captain was Baker, the old Enron
deal-maker, with Enron advisor Zoellick--known also as Baker's
"second brain"--back as first lieutenant. Then when the U.S. Supreme
Court decided the election, Lay and his fellow power brokers popped
the figurative champagne cork with a $300,000 contribution to the
Bush-Cheney inaugural gala.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Enron gang--let's call them the "E team"--also
included Sen. Gramm and Texas Reps. Dick Armey, the House majority
leader, and Tom DeLay, House majority whip. All received large Enron
contributions--Gramm collected $100,000 over 12 years, the
second-largest draw in Congress--and their voting records were
supportive of Enron causes. Gramm's decision last September to retire
from the Senate may have stemmed from his worry that he might be
politically vulnerable for being a leading supporter of 2000
legislation that facilitated Enron's entry into commodity derivatives
markets and exempted the company from key financial reporting
requirements, while his wife was an Enron director with sizable
company holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Enron boosters who landed government jobs are Patrick H. Wood III,
the former Texas Public Utilities Commission chairman who now heads
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Nora M.
Brownell, a former pro-Enron public-utilities commissioner in
deregulated Pennsylvania, who is also a FERC member. White House
personnel chief Clay Johnson, a former energy lawyer in Houston; Army
Secretary Thomas E. White, a former Enron senior executive; Commerce
Department general counsel Ted Kassinger, a former Enron advisor and
trade lawyer with Vinson &amp; Elkins; Montana ex-Gov. Marc Racicot, the
former Enron lobbyist recently named Republican National Committee
chairman by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The drafting of a Bush federal energy policy fell into the vice
president's lap. A previous Enron shareholder and a friend of Lay's,
Cheney had run the Halliburton Co. One of its divisions built
Houston's Enron Field, the new home of the Houston Astros baseball
team. Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis Libby, was an Enron stockholder.
Cheney, who refuses to say what he and Lay discussed in their private
meetings, and the General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of
Congress, is suing the vice president to obtain that information.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's largess has even compromised law enforcement. U.S. Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft has recused himself from Enron-related matters
because of large Enron political contributions he received while a
Missouri senator. Deputy Atty. Gen. Lawrence Thompson, from the
Enron-representing Atlanta law firm of King &amp; Spalding, is also under
pressure to follow his lead. The office of the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of Texas, which includes Houston, has had to recuse
itself en masse.</TE>
<TE>   In the months and years ahead, as the congressional and criminal
investigations fill in the details of the Enron story, the collapse
of Enron may, like Teapot Dome, come to symbolize an era of financial
and political excess. If so, there is even some chance that it could
do for the memory of Bush what those California and Wyoming oil
leases did for the memory of Harding.</TE>

<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's announcement that he opposes a second term for
Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has provoked a full-scale
political squabble. And like so many struggles in Los Angeles, the
battle is being drawn along racial lines. Yet, race is not what
threatens to tear this city apart. Despite their obvious racial
implications, secessionist movements--from the San Fernando Valley to
San Pedro, from Eagle Rock to Hollywood--are about place, not race.</LD>
<LD>   For too long, Angelenos have defined "community" racially. In our
civic imaginations, the city is made up of a handful of ethnic and
racial constituencies, rather than of hundreds of districts and
neighborhoods. If we are going to cohere as one city, we must
redefine community in geographic terms and eliminate the
anachronistic racial vocabulary we have inherited from our
segregationist past.</LD>
<TE>   The obsolescence of our political language is underscored by the
remarkable level of integration among the city's native-born middle
classes. One recent study showed that Angelenos are more likely than
other Americans to have friends from other ethnic and racial groups.
Further defying the conception that Los Angeles is a federation of
self-contained, monolithic, ethnic "communities," the city's
political elite itself is increasingly mixed. Indeed, in the past few
years, the number of ethnically mixed or intermarried officials in
L.A. County has skyrocketed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, everyday in L.A., we routinely speak of the Asian, Latino
or black "communities," but never of a white community. The media
like to call black and Latino elected officials "black leaders" and
"Latino leaders," but they never call, say, Hahn a "white leader."
It's the language of a time when blacks were disenfranchised and a
small African-American elite was expected to speak for them. But as
newly gained voting rights turned minority advocates into elected
officials, they were still regarded as representatives of their
races, not of their districts. Today, this language is perpetuated by
racial advocates, whose power it inflates, and by a media that finds
it more entertaining and cost-effective to interview a "racial
chieftain" than to conduct an opinion survey.</TE>
<TE>   The underlying assumption is that whites live as individuals while
nonwhites are mere extensions of a collective mind-set. We view
minority groups as if they were centralized, hierarchical
organizations rather than as aggregations of individuals with diverse
opinions and outlooks. Worse yet, a vocabulary born of racial
segregation inhibits us from envisioning civic integration.</TE>
<TE>   Although many--particularly the poorest--Angelenos are still
clustered along ethnic lines, race and geography are no longer
interchangeable. If geography tends to be coterminous with any
category, it is class. Hahn's failure, so far, to appoint many
commissioners from the city's poorest neighborhoods spotlights his
and other city politicians' fixation on race. It is significant to
note that even though the mayor has appointed only five commissioners
from South L.A., African Americans are not underrepresented in the
ranks of citizen panels. Just like white, Latino or Asian
commissioners, most black panelists don't live in the city's most
neglected areas.</TE>
<TE>   Race, to be sure, matters in politics. Candidates routinely tailor
their messages to appeal to a variety of Angelenos. Particularly
among the foreign-born, ethnicity carries powerful political
currency. But class and place may be as--and sometimes more--telling.
In last year's mayoral election, for example, Westside Jews voted
heavily for former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, while their
counterparts in the Valley--less wealthy, more moderate--cast their
ballots for former City Atty. Hahn. Similarly, Mexican-American
politicos in northeast San Fernando Valley have different agendas and
ply a different style of politics than their co-ethnics on the
Eastside. Constantly distinguishing themselves from what they call
the Eastside establishment, Latino pols in the Valley are building a
different kind of power base.</TE>
<TE>   But the extent to which L.A.'s political class is mixing racially
has potentially far-reaching effects on the way politics are played
in Los Angeles. For example, when Councilwoman Jan Perry, who
converted to Judaism two decades ago and is married to a Jewish man,
authored the motion to waive city fees for this month's Nation of
Islam convention downtown, was she acting as a black or a Jew?</TE>
<TE>   Does Eric Garcetti qualify as a traditional minority leader and,
if so, which minority? The 30-year-old councilman is a Mexican
Italian Jewish former Rhodes scholar and represents some of the same
neighborhoods as Democratic Assemblyman Dario Frommer, a Mexican
Hungarian Jewish official who is a rising star in the state Latino
Legislative Caucus. In 1999, L.A. County's Mexican American sheriff,
Lee Baca, married a Taiwanese-born engineer. A year earlier, the lone
Republican county supervisor, Mike Antonovich, wed a Taiwanese
actress in a ceremony at an Armenian church.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, the city's second-ranking
official, is himself half-Anglo and married to an Anglo woman from
the Midwest. Representing downtown Los Angeles, the former head of
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, is the
wife of an Anglo Southerner. Her Mexican American colleague,
first-term Rep. Hilda L. Solis, who represents the lower San Gabriel
Valley and parts of East Los Angeles, has a Palestinian American
spouse.</TE>
<TE>   While most politicians prefer to keep their personal lives
private, others, like former state Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg--who is Jewish and married to a Mexican American
academic--have attempted to use their cross-ethnic marriages to
strengthen political alliances. But the mixed backgrounds of most
local politicians, like Czech Mexican Assemblywoman Sally Havice of
Bellflower or her German Mexican colleague Assemblywoman Jenny
Oropeza of Long Beach, are generally ignored in the press. It's not a
stretch to say that most of the suburban voters who elected Chinese
American Carol Liu of La Canada-Flintridge and Mexican American
Robert Pacheco of Walnut to the state Assembly probably have no idea,
nor would be particularly surprised, that their representatives are
married to Anglos.</TE>
<TE>   But that's precisely the point. Today, class and geography
separate Angelenos much more than race.</TE>
<TE>   Charter reform, so far, has failed to produce a more
representative democracy and to integrate the more isolated parts of
the city with the whole. It takes 15 minutes for a police unit to
reach my street from the station house. The desk commanders have
never heard the name of my little neighborhood northeast of downtown.
The fledgling neighborhood councils, our consolation prize for not
having created more political districts, seem to be giving more power
to the homeowner groups that already had plenty of it. And just as
the controversy over Chief Parks was quickly reduced to a racial
struggle, rather than to the merits of his performance in office, we
can expect more of the same when the battle over secessionism heats
up later this year.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when race seems reflexively superimposed on every social
issue, it is even tougher to ask the question that secessionism
should force us all to ponder: What constitutes a community?</TE>

<HD>Ripe for Cutting: Prison Budgets</HD>
<DH>If more nonviolent offenders are diverted away from jail,
then some prisons can be closed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VINCENT SCHIRALDI and JUDITH GREENE</AU>
<BD>Vincent Schiraldi and Judith Greene are with the
Justice Policy Institute, a research and public policy organization.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>During the boom years of the 1990s, prison-construction spending was
one of the fastest-growing line items in state budgets. But the
recession has forced state elected officials to make more efficient
use of incarceration, and in ways that were unthinkable a decade ago,
according to a report released by the Justice Policy Institute last
week. Regrettably, it's business as usual in California.</LD>
<LD>   According to the National Assn. of State Budget Officers, states
expect a $40-billion revenue shortfall this coming fiscal year. Some
$12.4 billion of that, or almost one-third, is California's estimated
budget deficit. The last time states had to make sizable budget cuts
was in recessionary 1991, when they cut more than $7 billion, or less
than one-fifth the reductions they face in the next fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   State prisons now consume a much larger share of tax dollars. It
is costing states, counties and the federal government $40 billion to
incarcerate 2 million inmates, up from $5 billion in 1978. One of
every 14 general-fund dollars spent by states nationally in 2000 went
to prisons.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, several factors make prison budgets ripe for cutting this
fiscal year. For one, the expansion of U.S. prison budgets during the
past 20 years has been largely driven by an increase in nonviolent
prisoners. Indeed, during that time, the percentage of state
prisoners incarcerated for violent offenses actually declined from
57% to 48%. Specifically, from 1980 to 1997, the number of violent
offenders going to prison doubled, the number of nonviolent offenders
tripled and the number of drug offenders increased 11-fold. At the
end of 2001, there were an estimated 1.2 million nonviolent offenders
locked up, at a cost of more than $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, voters seem increasingly inclined to divert
nonviolent offenders away from incarceration. In a survey, conducted
by the national research firm of Belden Russonello &amp; Stewart, 62% of
respondents agreed that we need to change the laws so that fewer
nonviolent crimes are punishable by prison terms. In a Field poll
last December, Californians put prison-spending cuts at the top of
their budget-cutting lists.</TE>
<TE>   This shift in public attitude has translated into actual votes in
Arizona and California. In 1996, 65% of Arizona voters approved
Proposition 200, an initiative calling for the diversion of
nonviolent drug-possession offenders from prison into treatment. The
measure was supported by a phalanx of conservatives, including former
U.S. Sen. Barry S. Goldwater. An analysis by the Arizona Supreme
Court found that the new law is saving Arizona taxpayers nearly $7
million a year--and it's working. Many more defendants are getting
treatment under the law than they would have otherwise, and 62% of
them have successfully complied with the terms of their treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, three of five California voters approved Proposition 36,
the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act, modeled in part after
the Arizona initiative. The nonpartisan California legislative
analyst's office has estimated that the new law will result in an
annual cost savings of between $100 million to $150 million and avoid
an additional $500 million in prison-construction costs. Buoyed by
the success of these two initiatives, the California Campaign for New
Drug Policies is planning to place similar measures on the ballots in
Florida, Michigan and Ohio this year.</TE>
<TE>   In view of these emerging realities, many elected officials have
revised their prison policies. Republican governors in Michigan,
Illinois, Ohio and Florida have all closed prisons to save money.
Texas, which has the largest prison system in the country, has
modified its parole practices, increasing inmate releases and
creating alternative sanctions instead of sending minor violators
back to prison. In doing so, they cut the number of returning
parolees by 26% and reduced their prison population by nearly 8,000
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   In Louisiana, the state with the highest incarceration rate in the
country, Republican Gov. Mike Foster saved the state $60 million by
promoting a modification of the state's mandatory-sentencing law to
give judges discretion in handing out terms. Alabama, Mississippi,
Kansas and Iowa have all either followed suit, increased inmate
releases and/or created alternative sanctions for parole violators.
By adopting sentencing guidelines, North Carolina went from having
the highest incarceration rate in the South to the second-lowest, and
crime still fell in the state just like elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, California Gov. Gray Davis steadfastly refuses to consider
even the most modest proposals to save money by handling nonviolent
offenders in different ways. While cutting more than $900 million to
education and $200 million to health and welfare, he has reduced the
state's corrections budget by a paltry $6 million. Worse, he's
pressing ahead with the construction of a new 5,000-inmate,
$335-million prison at Delano at a time when the state's prison
population may be declining and when arrests, including violent ones,
have flatlined out or decreased. The governor even announced a pay
raise, amounting to an estimated $1 billion over five years, for
California's prison guards, whose union is one of his largest
campaign contributors.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the state's Legislative Analyst Office has drawn up a
list of 10 options for cutting the corrections budget that would
lessen the sacrifices being asked of education and health care and
not jeopardize public safety. For example, by eliminating
post-release supervision for nonviolent, non-serious, non-drug-sale
offenders with no prior record of violent or serious offenses, the
state could save an estimated $99 million in fiscal year 2003. Giving
inmates who fight fires more good time than inmates who peel potatoes
would save another $15 million. Making shoplifting punishable by jail
instead of prison would net another $25 million in savings. If these
three options were adopted, the state could avoid cutting
higher-education spending this year.</TE>
<TE>   Republican and Democratic political leaders across the country are
recognizing that certain offenders can be held accountable for their
actions without breaking the bank through expensive incarceration.
They are doing so with the support of their constituents and with the
belief that the goal of the criminal-justice system ought to be to
have fewer victims, not just more inmates. Why won't California's
leaders follow suit?</TE>

<HD>Has the Hot Water Vanished? Time to Relight Heater Pilot</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever woken up ready for a nice hot shower only to find cold
water flowing through your pipes? Odds are the water heater pilot
light has gone out, and you need to relight it.</LD>
<LD>   Relighting is a simple job that anyone can do with a little
instruction. Here's how:</LD>
<LD>   * Find the control valve, usually at the front of the heater tank
toward the bottom.</LD>
<TE>   * Turn the small control knob on top of the control valve from
"on" position to "pilot" position.</TE>
<TE>   * Remove the sheet metal access panels at the bottom of the tank
to expose the lower service hatch. There is an outer and an inner
panel.</TE>
<TE>   * Locate the pilot flame orifice. Follow the tubes down from the
gas control valve through the lower hatch to their terminus, where
the pilot flame is located.</TE>
<TE>   * Light the pilot. First find the red "pilot activation knob" on
top of the control valve and push down as far as it will go. Now
light a match or extended lighter and place it just below the pilot
orifice. A blue flame should appear.</TE>
<TE>   * Continue to hold the red knob down for a full minute before
releasing it. The flame should continue to burn.</TE>
<TE>   * Carefully reinstall the sheet metal access panels at the bottom
of the water heater.</TE>
<TE>   * Turn the control knob from "pilot" to "on." You should notice an
audible "whoosh" as the main burner ignites.</TE>

<LD>Question: I live in Los Angeles County. Is there an agency that can
tell me the square footage of my apartment unit? I asked the landlord
about it and he said doesn't know but will take a measurement and let
me know when he gets a chance. I don't want to wait. Can you help?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The county assessor's records only contain data on the
square footage of the entire building, not the individual units. The
building departments of most cities have some building plans, which
usually include data on the square footage of units, but may only be
able to access recent records.</LD>
<LD>   Do the math yourself. To compute the square footage of your unit
simply multiply the length of each room by its width, then add the
areas of the individual rooms together to get the total square
footage of the unit. Be sure to include bathrooms and closets in your
computations.</LD>
<TE>   Landlord May Boost Rate for Roommate</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in a two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles and I'm having
a problem with my landlord. There is only one occupant named on the
rental agreement, but the landlord allowed the leaseholder to live
with a roommate or spouse for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Can the landlord now ask for a new rental agreement and a rent
increase? The property is under rent control.</TE>
<TE>   A: Just because the landlord didn't charge rent control's legally
allowed 10% rent increase for an extra occupant in the past, doesn't
mean that he can't do so now. He can give you a 30-day notice to
raise the rent by 10% for the extra occupant and he can require you
to sign a new rental agreement listing two occupants.</TE>
<TE>   If your roommate subsequently moves out of the apartment and you
don't replace him or her, you can give the landlord a 30-day notice
and he will be required to again lower the rent.</TE>
<TE>   Flaws in Grounds for Breaking Lease</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in a leased single-family home. I have lived here for
five months on a one-year lease. Now I want to move before the lease
is up for a couple of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, the landlord required me to leave a $2,300 deposit to
reserve the place because he said there were other interested
parties. I felt like I was forced to take the place because of the
large amount of deposit money at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the day I signed the contract, I found out that the fourth
bedroom in the residence (it was advertised as having four bedrooms)
had no closet. At best it could be called a bonus room. The landlord
insisted that it was still four bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Afraid of losing my $2,300 deposit, and with no place else to
move, I reluctantly rented the place anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Do I have a potentially unenforceable lease agreement because it
was entered into unwillingly and under the threat of losing a large
deposit as the result of clearly false advertising?</TE>
<TE>   A: As far as I know, the law does not recognize bedrooms without
closets as "bonus rooms."</TE>
<TE>   It's also not clear to me that a room without closets cannot be
considered a bedroom, although it may be an unconventional one. Your
argument that the owner used false advertising to market the house
seems to have no legal merit.</TE>
<TE>   Your argument that the deposit was high, therefore somehow illegal
or improper, is equally flawed. If you believe that a deposit for a
rental is too high, don't leave it. Whenever you leave a deposit for
a pending rental, it is at risk. Be sure you want the place before
leaving deposit money.</TE>

<HD>Noise May Be Coming From Toilet's Water Inlet Valve</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After we flush the toilet, when the tank is almost full,
there is a noise. It appears to be the wire and bulb vibrating. Can
this be fixed or do we need to get a new valve with parts?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Few things are more irritating than a noisy toilet.
Fortunately, a toilet has few moving parts. And usually, only one of
them will make noise as the toilet tank becomes full. That's the ball
cock, or water inlet valve.</LD>
<LD>   This valve is operated by the "wire" and "ball" mentioned in your
question. The wire is called the float arm and the ball is called the
float ball.</LD>
<TE>   During the flush cycle, water travels from the tank into the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   As the water level in the tank drops, so do the float ball and
arm.</TE>
<TE>   The dropping float arm opens the ball cock valve, letting water
into the tank to refill it. As the water level nears the top of the
tank, the reverse happens--the float and float arm begin to close the
ball cock. This is where the noise occurs.</TE>
<TE>   A dry or deteriorated ball cock valve gasket can make the valve
vibrate. When this happens, the arm and ball also might vibrate.</TE>
<TE>   Your repair is simple: Replace either the gasket in the ball cock
valve or the valve itself.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing the gasket is less expensive, but replacement of the
entire assembly is easier, and will probably prove to be the less
expensive in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   On the Trail of a Sneaky Water Leak</TE>
<TE>   Q: How can I find a leak in my house? My water bill keeps going
up. Sometimes I can hear water dripping in the bathroom after the
sink has been used, but then it stops.</TE>
<TE>   A: If you are on a public water system, chances are you have a
water meter somewhere on or near your property. Besides telling you
how much water you are using, it can help you detect leaks.</TE>
<TE>   Water meters look a little like a speedometer. Subtract the first
reading from the second to find out how many cubic feet of water you
have used. A cubic foot contains 7.5 gallons of water. For example:
If the first reading is 006300 and the second--a week later--is
006400, your use for one week was 100 cubic feet or 750 gallons (100
cubic feet x 7.5 gallons per cubic foot = 750 gallons). That's an
average of slightly more than 107 gallons per day. In some
communities all you need to do is read your water bill to discover
this information.</TE>
<TE>   To use your water meter to detect a hidden leak, turn off every
plumbing fixture in your house for a couple of hours. Don't forget
the built-in ice maker or the reverse-osmosis water filtration
system. They turn themselves on automatically.</TE>
<TE>   Once everything is off, take a meter reading. If the reading
changes, a leak exists.</TE>
<TE>   If the leak is a plumbing pipe or fitting located in the attic or
walls, chances are great that you would have seen water dripping from
the ceiling or noticed damp spots on the walls or floor. If, on the
other hand, the pipes are in the crawlspace or basement, it might
require a bit of investigative work to find the leak.</TE>
<TE>   It also is possible to have a leak between the water meter and the
main shut-off valve where water enters your home. To determine if the
pipe between these two points is leaking, shut off the main water
supply valve at the house, and check to see if the meter continues to
show water is being used. If such is the case, it's time to call in a
leak-detection company. Using state-of-the-art technology, they will
be able to pinpoint the leak for repair. They can also find an
evasive leak in your home.</TE>
<TE>   Replace Noisy Pipe With Cast-Iron Type</TE>
<TE>   Q: We have a 3-inch schedule 40 PVC drain from a bathroom that
runs about 8 feet down through the basement. When hot water is
draining from the bath, there is a loud cracking sound generated in
the drainpipe. What can I do to the drainpipe to reduce the noise?</TE>
<TE>   A: The cracking noise is the result of expansion and contraction
of the PVC pipe as it heats up and cools down--when hot water is run
through it. While there are many means to deal with this problem, we
believe that the best solution is to replace the PVC with a section
of no-hub cast iron.</TE>
<TE>   Use no-hub couplings to connect the cast iron to the PVC. You not
only will be rid of your cracking noise, you also will hardly be able
to hear water running through the new pipe.</TE>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--How big are the annual tax benefits Congress bestows on
Americans who own their homes rather than rent? And who, among
homeowners, receives the bulk of those tax benefits?</LD>
<LD>   A new congressional tax study reveals the pro-ownership tilt in
the federal tax code--a tilt that has helped keep the housing market
humming, even while the rest of the economy slipped into recession.</LD>
<LD>   The report on "tax expenditures" by the bipartisan Joint Committee
on Taxation estimates that in fiscal 2002, America's homeowners will
divvy up $66.5 billion worth of deductions for mortgage interest
payments, and $21.4 billion for local property tax write-offs. They
will pocket nearly $14 billion tax-free on home-sale profits.</LD>
<TE>   In all, homeowners will split about $102 billion in direct federal
largess. Renters, meanwhile, will receive zero in direct federal tax
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Federal budget experts view "tax expenditures"--preferences
inserted into the tax code to encourage specific behaviors or
investments--as the functional equivalent of appropriations for
regular federal outlays.</TE>
<TE>   The net effect is the same: A federal policy priority--in this
case, homeownership--is promoted through non-collection of taxes that
would otherwise be part of federal budget revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-ownership preferences are among the largest in the federal
budget. The report documents that the vast majority of the
homeownership subsidies go to people with the highest incomes.</TE>
<TE>   During fiscal 2001, according to the tax committee, among all
home-owning households that itemized deductions on their tax returns,
those with incomes of $50,000 or under received less than 6% of the
$64.5 billion in mortgage interest deduction subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Households with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 took double
that--about 12.2% of the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Households with incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took another 18.9%,
while taxpayers with household incomes above $100,000 received by far
the heftiest share: 62.7% of all benefits available to homeowners who
itemized their deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, home-owning households with incomes of $50,000 or above
got about 94% of the $64.5 billion in mortgage interest deduction
subsidies distributed by the federal tax system last year. That's not
a complete surprise: Households with lower incomes are also more
likely to take the standard deduction, rather than itemize
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern is similar with property tax write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners with incomes above $50,000 took more than four-fifths
of the tax expenditure subsidies. The committee didn't do a separate
distribution analysis for home-sale capital gains exclusions, but the
results are likely to be the same.</TE>
<TE>   People with higher-cost homes, supported by higher incomes, are
far more likely to be able to take maximum advantage of the generous
$250,000 (single owners) and $500,000 (married joint filers) tax-free
limits on home-sale profits provided by the tax code.</TE>
<TE>   What impacts do the subsidies appear to have on the economy?</TE>
<TE>   They are huge. Federal tax preferences have helped sustain demand
for new and resale homes this past year, despite the slowdowns
elsewhere in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   New home construction boomed throughout the recession of 2001, as
did home resales and new mortgage originations.</TE>
<TE>   Tax subsidies lower the effective cost of owning a house--at least
for people who itemize--and they turn capital gains from home-sale
profits into tax-free investment returns for all owners. No other
capital asset in the American economy receives such kid-gloves,
tax-exempt treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The tax preferences also indirectly push up housing values as
waves of successive buyers reinvest tax-free cash from prior sales
into new, more costly home purchases. Rising housing values, in turn,
helped transform "cash-out" refinances last year into one of the most
explosive forces in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, helped moderate what otherwise might have been a
far deeper recession into what now appears to be one of the shortest
in modern history.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar De La Hoya has sold his Bel-Air home for $3.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   The boxing champ, scheduled to meet Fernando Vargas in a
junior-middleweight championship fight May 4 in Las Vegas, has a
number of homes elsewhere, including one where he trains in Big Bear.</LD>
<LD>   The house he sold has eight bedrooms and 10 bathrooms in 10,000
square feet. The home also has a gym, screening room, game room, pool
and tennis court.</LD>
<TE>   De La Hoya bought the home for about $3.9 million in 1997. He had
the house, built in 1990, completely redesigned and then listed it
for sale at $5.5 million in 2000. Since then, it has been on and off
the market.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, 29, has won several championship titles in different
weight classes since he was a 1992 Olympic gold medallist in the
lightweight boxing division.</TE>
<TE>   Currently the World Boxing Council 154-pound champion, De La Hoya
is guaranteed $14 million for the match against Vargas. Vargas, the
World Boxing Assn. champion, will make at least $6 million. Each
fighter will get additional revenue based on the pay-per-view buys
and international sales.</TE>
<TE>   Also a singer, De La Hoya released a debut album in late 2000. The
album was on the Billboard Latin charts for more than eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer of De La Hoya's Bel-Air home was described as a
physician from the South Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian and Kyle Grasso of Prudential Estate Properties, John
Aaroe Division in Beverly Hills, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Actor David Schwimmer has sold his Hollywood Hills home for just
under $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Schwimmer, who plays Ross Geller on the NBC sitcom "Friends" and
co-starred in the fall HBO miniseries "Band of Brothers," had put the
four-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house on the market at $1.25 million
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Four months earlier, he had purchased a nine-bedroom,
11,000-square-foot house on more than an acre in Hancock Park for
$5.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 35, sold his traditional-style Hollywood Hills home,
behind gates with a pool and city views, to Nadine Watt,
granddaughter of real estate magnate Ray Watt, and her fiancee, film
executive Andrew Jameson.</TE>
<TE>   Nadine Watt is president of Watt Plaza in Century City; Jameson is
senior vice president of Commotion Pictures, which recently wrapped
production on its first film, to star Tom Arnold, under a
multi-picture deal with MGM.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Frankel of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills East, represented
the buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Arleen Ruby and Lawrence Leviton of Prudential-John Aaroe, Beverly
Hills, had the listing; Ruby also sold the house to Schwimmer six
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Szmanda, who plays eccentric forensic-lab technician Greg
Sanders on the CBS television series "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," has become a first-time home buyer with his purchase
of a four-bedroom Studio City house for $785,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee native, in his 20s, bought a one-story,
2,855-square-foot house, built in 1969. The house has slate floors,
maple cabinets, stainless steel appliances, a family room and a front
courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Szmanda previously appeared in the USA series "The Net" and the
UPN pilot "Dodge City." He also starred in the independent film "True
Vinyl."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Chimienti of DBL Beverly Hills represented Szmanda in buying,
and Steven Walker of Coldwell Banker, Studio City, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Medavoy, chairman of Phoenix Pictures and a producer of such
movies as "The Thin Red Line" (1998) and "The People vs. Larry Flynt"
(1996), and his wife, Irena, have listed their Beverly Hills-area
home at just under $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   The home, which they had built a year ago, is on about two acres
in a guard-gated community and has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms
in 12,000 square feet. One side of the master bathroom has a
kitchenette, office area, tub, sofa, fireplace and a closet with
three hidden closets. The other side of the bathroom has a walk-in
closet and a gym.</TE>
<TE>   An East Coast traditional-style estate, the house has a center
hall opening onto large rooms for entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Medavoys are said to have entertained as many as 800 guests in
the home at one time.</TE>
<TE>   The estate also has a screening room, guest house, mini-running
track, and an outdoor shower by the 20-by-40-foot pool.</TE>
<TE>   Decorated by Gregory McAllester, the home was designed with feng
shui and natural light taken into consideration. This is the third
home that McAllester has decorated for the Medavoys.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Robinson of DBL Beverly Hills has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Gale Anne Hurd ("Terminator," 1984; "Armageddon," 1998)
and her husband, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh ("Armageddon," "Die
Hard With a Vengeance," 1995), have sold their eight-bedroom, Beverly
Hills-area home for $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought a house in Pasadena several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills-area house also has a screening room, a gym and
an office in about 14,600 square feet. The home, on more than two
acres, was built in 1995 by Peter Morton, co-founder of the Hard Rock
Cafe and owner of the trendy West Hollywood restaurant Morton's.</TE>
<TE>   The home was listed in September at $11.9 million. Its last asking
price was $8.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian of Prudential John Aaroe, Beverly Hills, and Joan
Duffy, of the firm's Sherman Oaks office, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Laurence Mark, producer of such movies as "As Good as It Gets"
(1997) and "Jerry Maguire" (1996), has sold his Hollywood Hills home
to music producer Pat Leonard for $1.65 million.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, who has produced albums for such stars as Elton John and
Madonna, bought the four-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot home. Situated
behind gates, the house has two master suites, a pool, gardens and
brick terraces.</TE>
<TE>   Mark sold because he moved into a home he had redesigned and
rebuilt off Mulholland Drive in the Beverly Hills area.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Enright of Enright Co. had the listing on Mark's former
home, and Magie D'Abo with Re/Max on the Boulevard, Sherman Oaks,
represented Leonard, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Cash-Poor Widow Has Options</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Few Options for a House-Rich but Cash-Poor Widow" by Jack Guttentag
(Your Mortgage, Jan. 27) offers one example of borrowing equity out
and investing it with a possible rate of 3%. This scenario, he
observes, would run out in about 11 years.</LD>
<LD>   Right now there are a number of fully insured fixed annuities
being offered at 6% to 7%, guaranteed for six to 10 years, from very
highly rated insurance/financial companies.</LD>
<LD>   If my math is correct, the widow could expect a far larger monthly
interest payment for a period of 120 months ($10,500 at 3% versus
$24,500 at 7%). About 70% of her principal would remain intact at the
10-year mark of 65.</LD>
<TE>   Her equity in the house might appreciate at 5% annually (a rather
conservative estimate these days) tax-free; approximately an
additional $1 million in current value equity in 10 years. At that
time she would have far more choices available to her and she could
look to the marketplace to decide what to do including another
refinancing or similar option.</TE>
<TE>   There are other options that may well be better for this woman.</TE>

<HD>Even the Odds</HD>
<DH>Knowing the strategies to use in a buyer's market or a
seller's market can help you negotiate from a position of strength.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARCIE GEFFNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether you're buying or selling a home, negotiating is always easier
when market conditions favor your side of the transaction.</LD>
<LD>   But timing a lifetime of home purchases and sales to match market
trends is practically impossible. That means you need to know how to
strengthen your negotiating position, even when you're buying in a
seller's market or selling in a buyer's market.</LD>
<LD>   The first challenge is to figure out whether market conditions
favor buyers or sellers. Generally, a buyer's market is characterized
by a large inventory of homes for sale and a slow pace of sales
activity, while a seller's market is characterized by a small
inventory of on-the-market homes and a fast pace of sales.</LD>
<TE>   Another statistic worth monitoring is the average premium or
discount between listing and sales prices. Are homes selling higher
or lower than the asking prices?</TE>
<TE>   Homes selling in fewer than 30 days on average and sales prices
higher than asking prices tend to signal a seller's market. Homes
selling in more than 60 days on average and price discounts hint at a
buyer's market.</TE>
<TE>   Such big-picture economic factors as demand for housing, new
household formation, job growth, property-related tax policies, the
local economy and mortgage interest rates also influence the housing
market.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing market conditions is no small task, in part because
buyers' and sellers' perceptions rarely are in sync with each another
or with reality.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time people are convinced it is a buyer's market or a
seller's market, it is moving on to something else," said Michael
Greenwald, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker in Brentwood and West Los
Angeles. "It's a very short period where all parties agree. You have
to have a lot of factors [pointing the same way]--and maybe a full
moon--for everyone to agree."</TE>
<TE>   Here are some negotiation strategies for buying and selling
whatever the market conditions:</TE>
<TE>   Buying in Seller's Market</TE>
<TE>   * Hire a savvy agent.</TE>
<TE>   In-the-know agents find out about homes coming on the market
before they appear in the multiple listing service. Getting the
inside scoop can give you an opportunity to make an offer before the
home is exposed to other buyers.</TE>
<TE>   * Be prepared to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a hot home in a hot market typically entails competing
against other buyers' offers. Make yours as strong as possible, and
remember, list price is only a starting point.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't get to buy the house, what does it matter that you
only offered list price? You are back to square one, hoping another
suitable house comes on the market," said Emily Link, a Realtor with
Keller Williams Realty in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   * Make the transaction seller-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "Offer as short a loan contingency and escrow as possible. Make it
convenient for the sellers. Let the sellers lease back the home for a
month if they need to buy another house. Include contract terms that
give the seller warm fuzzies," Greenwald said. Don't pressure the
sellers to include personal property in the deal and go easy on
required repairs and warranties.</TE>
<TE>   * Let the seller select the service providers.</TE>
<TE>   "'Seller's choice' means the seller's agent feels a little more
powerful because he can recommend his favorite escrow company and
title company to the seller. The buyer wants the seller's agent to be
thinking it's going to be an easy deal," Greenwald said.</TE>
<TE>   * Be ready, willing and able to close.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers who are pre-approved for a mortgage and are renting or have
their home in escrow are in a stronger position. "You can't expect
sellers to accept an offer contingent on you selling your home," Link
said. "If you are going to move, you have to be willing to sell your
house contingent on finding a replacement property or you may have to
make a double move."</TE>
<TE>   * Make a backup offer.</TE>
<TE>   If you lose a multiple-offers competition, position yourself to be
next in line. "Ask your agent to keep in contact with seller's agent
to find out whether the transaction is getting squiggly," Greenwald
said.</TE>
<TE>   Buying in Buyer's Market</TE>
<TE>   * Buy a home you love.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a great deal can turn sour if you detest your new home and
can't resell it without losing money. "Be comfortable and happy with
the home you are buying. It's a big commitment," Link said.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a long-term view.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to time the market. If the market value of the home you
purchase depreciates further, you might not be able to resell the
home for the price you paid until the market rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Buyers in a buyer's market need to understand they are already
getting a house for less money and they shouldn't expect to turn it
around [for a quick profit]," Greenwald said.</TE>
<TE>   * Negotiate price, not costs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of buyers ask the seller to pay the escrow costs. Instead
of doing that, analyze those costs and make it [part of the] price.
Otherwise, all you are doing is upsetting the sellers. Make a clean
offer and you will come out ahead," Greenwald said.</TE>
<TE>   * Use the data.</TE>
<TE>   "Have your agent present good arguments that you don't want to
overpay for the house because you don't know what's happening in the
market," Link said. But don't low-ball, or the sellers may counter
higher than they otherwise would have.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't make a backup offer.</TE>
<TE>   In a buyer's market, backup offers needlessly strengthen the
seller's negotiating position with the in-escrow buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Selling in Seller's Market</TE>
<TE>   * Limit early showings.</TE>
<TE>   "Pick a day, whether it is the first Sunday or the broker's
caravan, and make that the first day anyone can see the home. Let
everyone have an even playing field," Greenwald said.</TE>
<TE>   * Shorten contingency periods.</TE>
<TE>   Contingencies mean leaving your home in escrow while the buyers
organize their transaction. "You can't make the loan contingency
period so short that the buyers can't perform, but you don't want a
to wait a long time for the loan to be funded," Link said.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan your next move.</TE>
<TE>   "If the sellers' next step is to purchase a home in the area,
that's great. But if inventory is low, they can't have their choice
of 10 homes. Before they put their house on the market, I want them
to know there are houses for them [to buy]. If not, they need to make
the purchase of their next home a contingency. And most buyers won't
want to give that as a contingency unless they get a fair price for
the home," said Matt Epstein, a Realtor with Re/Max on the Boulevard
in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   * Fix up your home.</TE>
<TE>   An unappealing home can languish unsold even in a strong seller's
market. "The condition of the home is always important. It's amazing
how many sellers ask for advice about what they should do to their
home, then don't act on the advice," Epstein said. "Dress your home
for success. Even a vacant home can be staged to look like a million
bucks."</TE>
<TE>   * Consider underpricing your home.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes if you underprice, you end up getting more money
because if you have a nice house, you'll get more activity and you
may have more offers," Link said. But Greenwald disagreed. "I'm not a
believer in positioning yourself for multiple offers," he said. "Many
times a home has multiple offers, but later it's back on the market
because the buyer didn't perform and the other buyers have gone
away."</TE>
<TE>   * Be lawsuit savvy.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers who feel they overpaid for a house may be more likely to
bring a lawsuit alleging undisclosed problems with the home after the
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Make sure your agent has a perfect record that clients don't get
into lawsuits," Epstein suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be shy about asking the agent outright whether he or she has
been involved in any real estate-related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   You also can search the California Department of Real Estate
database, www.dre.ca.gov for information about the status of the
agent's state license and state disciplinary actions.</TE>
<TE>   Selling in Buyer's Market</TE>
<TE>   * Don't overprice your home.</TE>
<TE>   "If the data shows more houses are on the market and are staying
on the market longer, you have to be realistic when you price your
home. If you don't, you ultimately are going to sell for less money,"
Link said. Added Greenwald: "Sellers can't dip their toes in a
buyer's market. Price the home appropriately to begin with because
most of the showings will be in the first month."</TE>
<TE>   * Shorten the contingency periods.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you are selling from a weaker position, you still don't
want the contingencies too long. And as a seller, you want to have as
much done upfront as you can," Link said. "Once you get into escrow,
time goes fast. You don't want to get hung up at the end over
something that could have been found out earlier."</TE>
<TE>   * Think twice before you offer financing.</TE>
<TE>   Lease-sale options, seller carry-back financing and similar
arrangements can be "more trouble than they're worth," according to
Epstein.</TE>
<TE>   * Select your agent with extra caution.</TE>
<TE>   "A good agent has the pulse of the market," Epstein said. "Listen
to agents who are giving true advice, not just the answers you want
to hear. Some agents just want to get the home in the MLS [multiple
listing service], then they will get a price reduction later. If your
agent gives you advice on the price, take it. If the agent
underprices your home, the market will set the stage and you will
still get top dollar for it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year thousands of people are scalded by overheated tap water.
When is hot water too hot? At 130 degrees, serious burns occur in 30
seconds. At 140 degrees, it takes only five seconds. And for the
elderly and small children, it happens in half the time.</LD>
<LD>   For injury prevention, water heaters should be set between 120 and
125 degrees, and for children, bathwater should be no more than 100
degrees. It's a good practice to run some cold water first, then add
hot, testing it with your hand.</LD>
<LD>   To test your water temperature, run hot water until it has reached
its peak, then fill a glass and use a thermometer. First fill and
empty the glass a time or two to warm it. Then adjust your
water-heater thermostat as needed. Whenever you make a change, wait
24 hours before retesting.</LD>

<HD>Conflicting Stances on Loan Markups</HD>
<DH>First of two parts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that
it is legal for lenders to make a profit on third-party services sold
to borrowers, such as appraisals and credit reports. In contrast, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development has always said that
markups were illegal if there were no services provided in connection
with them. Who is right, and if the court ruling stands, how can
borrowers protect themselves against excessive charges?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I'm with the court on this one. HUD's rule was essentially
unenforceable and was widely violated before the recent court
decision. Having unenforceable laws on the books that are routinely
violated does not protect the borrower and undermines respect for the
law.</LD>
<LD>   There is a case for prohibiting markups in this market. Loan
providers are not restricted in their ability to charge directly for
their services.</LD>
<TE>   The list of fees that loan providers charge is bewilderingly long.
Markups aren't needed to assure that loan providers are adequately
compensated, and they create one more layer of complexity for
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   If I were mortgage czar, I would prohibit all markups and limit
loan providers to two fees: one expressed as a percentage of the loan
("points") and one expressed in dollars ("total fees").</TE>
<TE>   This would greatly simplify life for borrowers without in any way
restricting the ability of loan providers to charge for their
services.</TE>
<TE>   In the world that exists, however, it is better to permit markups.
The alternative to permitting markups is not my ideal rule but an
actual HUD rule that allows markups if additional services are
provided but prohibits them otherwise. Though the HUD rule may appear
fair, it is not, because it is not enforceable except very
selectively, which is unfair. The vast majority of loan providers
know they are beyond HUD's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Violations of the HUD rule were pervasive before the recent court
decision. Hence, the problem that markups on third-party services
pose for borrowers will be little different than before the recent
court decision.</TE>
<TE>   What does a borrower do to protect against unjustified markups?
Let me begin with what not to do.</TE>
<TE>   Another columnist advises borrowers: "Don't be asleep at
settlement; demand to know why you're being charged $60 for a credit
report instead of much less and take a hard look at other fees if
they seem high."</TE>
<TE>   If the borrower doesn't wake up until settlement, he might as well
go back to sleep for all the power he will have to affect the
outcome. To expect that a borrower will be able to talk down fees at
settlement because they "seem high" is unrealistic. The lender will
have ready explanations for every charge, and the borrower's clout in
protesting them is zilch.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the loan provider can explain that the $60 charge for
the credit report includes the lender's cost to extract the critical
information from the report and analyze it. That will end the
discussion and the charge will remain.</TE>
<TE>   A borrower who awakens prior to closing may have more success. If
the deal is a refinancing, the borrower can threaten to walk from the
deal. If it is a home purchase and a real estate agent recommended
the lender, the borrower can enlist the agent to intervene with the
lender.</TE>
<TE>   Another not-so-great idea is for borrowers to order their own
services. Loan providers will strongly resist it, for good reason.
They know they will have to instruct the borrower how to do it and
then monitor the results, which takes more of their time than if they
did it themselves. Loan providers expect to be compensated for their
time, so if you demand more of it in order to reduce their fees on
third-party services, they will look to make it up elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that markups on third-party services, when they occur,
are the smallest part of a loan provider's compensation. It makes no
sense to try to save $150 on the appraisal if it costs you the
equivalent of $500 elsewhere in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers should be concerned with the total, not one part of the
total. In my next column, I'll outline strategies for dealing with
markups that don't lose sight of the total picture.</TE>

<HD>Red Bullet Tries Living Up to High Expectations</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After winning the Preakness last year, he has
yet to win a stakes race and return to championship form.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BEYER</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>HALLANDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>When the late trainer Charles Whittingham was asked if a particular
thoroughbred was a great one, he regularly cited a self-made
aphorism: "Never say anything about a horse till he's been dead for
10 years."</LD>
<LD>   Whittingham knew that premature judgments in racing are often
wrong, and that a prudent man waits until all the evidence is in.</LD>
<LD>   The racing world would have been well advised to heed
Whittingham's maxim in May 2000, when a pair of 3-year-olds, Fusaichi
Pegasus and Red Bullet, were being hailed as potential superstars.
Fusaichi Pegasus was extolled as one of the best Kentucky Derby
winners in decades. When Red Bullet, making only the fifth start of
his career, upset Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness, racing fans
assumed that he, too, had a brilliant future ahead of him.</LD>
<TE>   How wrong everyone was.</TE>
<TE>   Fusaichi Pegasus won only one race after the Derby, flopped badly
in the Breeders' Cup and was retired to stud before he could do any
more damage to his reputation. Red Bullet hasn't won a single stakes
race since his day of glory at Pimlico. But unlike his contemporary,
who ducked most challenges, Red Bullet is still trying to live up to
his early promise, and he will be a slight favorite in Saturday's
$500,000 Grade I Donn Handicap at Gulfstream.</TE>
<TE>   Red Bullet raced only once as a 3-year-old after the Preakness,
and then was sidelined for more than a year by an assortment of
physical problems, including a foot abscess and a cracked cannon
bone. When he returned to competition last summer, his trainer, Joe
Orseno, expected him to re-emerge as a major force and was aiming for
the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But Red Bullet flopped so badly in a prep race, the Woodward
Stakes, that he didn't get to the Cup; he disappointed in the Cigar
Mile, too. He launched his 2002 campaign in the Skip Away Handicap at
Gulfstream last month against a field he figured to dominate, but he
lost that one, too -- to the 9-year-old Sir Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Ever optimistic, Orseno thinks Red Bullet is finally ready to fire
his best shot. "He's been training very well since the Skip Away,"
the trainer said. "I think having that race under him will do a lot
of good. He's healthy and is doing just fine. He should run a very
good race in the Donn."</TE>
<TE>   If Red Bullet is ever going to add another Grade I stakes to his
resume, this is a good spot to do it. The older horses in the United
States this year appear to be a pitifully weak group, and there are
few bona fide Grade I horses in the Donn lineup. The best of the
challengers appear to be Graeme Hall, who developed into a top runner
in New York in the fall; Pleasant Divorce, an impressive performer at
Laurel this fall; and Hal's Hope, trained by 90-year-old Harold Rose,
who won the 2000 Florida Derby.</TE>
<TE>   After three straight unexceptional performances since his
comeback, there is too much evidence that he is not going to be the
star that that the racing world had expected. What went wrong?</TE>
<TE>   It is quite possible that Red Bullet's various physical problems
took a toll on him. But it is more likely that we all misevaluated
him in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   American racing has suffered from such a shortage of great horses
in recent years that fans are eager to hail a new star. We all tend
to get excited prematurely. But when horses such as Red Bullet come
alone, we might be wise to remember the wisdom of Charlie
Whittingham.</TE>

<HD>No Snap Making Switch</HD>
<DH>Football: It can be rough going for college quarterbacks
who are drafted by NFL teams that are looking to change their
positions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN POMPEI</AU>
<BD>The Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in the age of the mobile passer, college quarterbacks who are
two-way threats can be positional misfits in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Indiana's Antwaan Randle El and North Carolina's Ronald
Curry are considered receivers by most teams. Clemson's Woodrow
Dantzler was given a look at running back in the Senior Bowl. Eric
Crouch, the Heisman winner from Nebraska, is thought of as either a
strong safety or a running back. And Ohio State's Steve Bellisari
probably will be tried at free safety.</LD>
<LD>   Drafting a quarterback to play safety is like hiring a lawyer to
remove your tonsils. A major learning curve is to be expected. Nolan
Cromwell made the switch, but among those who have struggled include
Scott Frost, Rex Kern and Jack Mildren.</LD>
<TE>   "Defensive players have to be reactive," says one front office man
who took part in drafting Frost out of Nebraska. "Frost is far better
with the ball in his hands than when he has to see the play, break
down, change direction and make the play. He missed a million
tackles."</TE>
<TE>   It helps when the player gets a head start by making the position
switch in college, as Tampa Bay's John Lynch did while at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The change will be much more problematic for Crouch, who has been
strictly a quarterback and is resisting the idea of playing another
position. Crouch, however, runs a lot better than he throws. His
three-interception performance in the Hula Bowl last Saturday did not
enhance his chances of getting a look at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   There are more examples of college quarterbacks who were
successful switching to running back or receiver. Among them are Drew
Pearson, Tony Martin, Brian Mitchell, Freddie Solomon, Ed Podolak and
Bert Emanuel.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not like an offensive transition is simple. Playing
running back at the Senior Bowl, Dantzler looked like a sports car in
a blizzard. Dantzler argues that quarterback is his best position,
and he has the numbers to back him up. At Clemson, he was the first
player in NCAA history to pass for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 in
the same year.</TE>
<TE>   Scouts say he's too short at 5-10 and question his accuracy. But
Atlanta's Michael Vick is only two inches taller, and he had accuracy
issues, too. Like Vick, Dantzler has a top-rate arm and extraordinary
running ability. If Vick can be the first pick in the draft, there is
no reason why Dantzler can't be a mid-round pick as a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Accuracy is an issue with each of the positional misfits this
year. "All of them are going to have to show people they can throw
the ball better than they did in college," says Bills General Manager
Tom Donahoe, who drafted Kordell Stewart to play quarterback for the
Steelers when others were thinking of switching Stewart's position.
"People questioned Kordell's accuracy, too, but we didn't see that."</TE>
<TE>   Randle El believes NFL teams wouldn't be questioning his accuracy
if he were taller than 5-9. He might be right. One scout says Randle
El would be a top five pick if he were six inches taller.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Randle El is almost dainty by quarterback standards,
he has long arms (301/2 inches) and big hands (971/4 inches from the
tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinkie) that, in effect, make him
play bigger. He was plenty tall at Indiana, where he threw for more
yards than Peyton Manning did at Tennessee. He also was the only
big-time college player ever to throw 40 touchdown passes and score
40 times.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason he isn't considered a quarterback by most NFL
teams is there is no one who has been successful in the NFL that he
compares with. An offensive coordinator says 5-10 Doug Flutie is
faster and has a stronger arm.</TE>
<TE>   Randle El ran the equivalent of a 4.75 40-yard dash in the spring.
But that clocking is deceptive. Randle El might not have track speed,
but he has a quick burst that enables him to separate. On tape,
Randle El appears to be one of the faster players on the field.</TE>
<TE>   What works against Randle El and all of these quarterbacks is they
won't fit into most offenses being run in the NFL. If a team is going
to draft Randle El as a quarterback, it must adapt to him by changing
its offense. That would take a tremendous commitment and an
unwavering belief.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility, the most intriguing, would be to use Randle
El as a "slash"-type player, capable of taking snaps or handoffs,
catching passes or punts. "You could create a package for him that
would take advantage of his special traits," Bears General Manager
Jerry Angelo says.</TE>
<TE>   Randle El played some receiver at Indiana, and he looked like a
natural at the position during the Senior Bowl, even earning MVP
honors. He was much less impressive playing quarterback at the
East-West Shrine game.</TE>
<TE>   Each case is unique, but the best chance for most of these players
probably is to remain at the position that got them this far.
"History tells you most of them don't make it when they switch," says
Angelo, who has studied the phenomenon. "It's too much to make a
projection at the highest level."</TE>
<TE>   What makes it even more difficult is the transient nature of the
NFL. "We can't keep players around forever like we used to," Texans
G.M. Charley Casserly says. "So a projection has to play sooner. That
works against him and us."</TE>
<TE>   There is a place for some of these gifted players in the NFL --
it's just a matter of defining it.</TE>

<HD>Taking Flight at the Olympics</HD>
<DH>Freestyle aerials: Eric Bergoust is the defending men's
champion, even if the three-time Olympian is known to be a little
weird.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ALEXANDER NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Olympic aerialists are known as a strange sort. These are the people,
after all, who regularly catapult down a 72-degree steel ramp at 45
mph, soar several stories in the air while performing twists and
turns and tucks and then, if they are lucky, land on their feet.</LD>
<LD>   There are all kinds of stories about these people and what they
will do for an adrenaline rush, like jumping over cars and such. And
then there are the stories about Weird Eric.</LD>
<LD>   "We're all a little crazy, but I'm sorry, he's weird with a
capital W," U.S. Olympic aerialist Tracy Evans says. "He's W.E. Weird
Eric."</LD>
<TE>   Eric Bergoust is the one who regularly jumped off his chimney as a
child, the one who set up trampolines on bridges so he could freak
out passing cars by leaping off as they drove by.</TE>
<TE>   He has dyed his hair every color of the rainbow, shaved a zig-zag
pattern into his chest hair. Yet the weirdest thing of all about
Bergoust might be the way he trains--methodically, obsessively. In a
sporting culture where the prevailing attitude is "rip and roll," the
man with the best chance to win Olympic gold is the science nerd, the
one who meticulously examines everything from the position of his
fingers to the degree he cocks his head. Weird.</TE>
<TE>   "Every little technical aspect is crucial to him, everything,"
says U.S. aerials Coach Matt Christensen. "As crazy as his reputation
is, he's the studious one. I can say that everything I know about the
sport now is from watching him."</TE>
<TE>   This will be Bergoust's third Olympics, and after a seventh-place
finish in Lillihammer and a first-place finish in Nagano, he is by
far the favorite to take home another gold. Last month, he won his
second consecutive World Cup, and for this event, he is preparing a
quad-twisting triple back flip that he has been working on for
months.</TE>
<TE>   He is known as a constant innovator, changing everything from the
way aerialists rotate to the way they approach their jumps. Last
summer, he invented a special kind of fiberglass ski in his garage in
order to lessen the strain jumping puts on an athlete's body. His
greatest attribute, however, may simply be his work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought when I was jumping, I was a tough competitor, but then
I met Bergy," Christensen says. "He just wants it."</TE>
<TE>   For Bergoust, work is just a natural part of growing up as one of
six children on a ranch in rural Montana. With a disciplinarian of a
father and acres of land to tend to, he learned quickly that excuses
weren't part of the bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "If we ever complained," he says, "'my Dad would say, 'If you live
in the West, you have to be tough.'"</TE>
<TE>   The expression "Be Tough" was even inscribed on the license plates
of the family Suburban, and when Bergoust fell in love with aerials,
it was made clear to him that if he was going to play, he should play
to win.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 18, he was sleeping in a field in Calgary to
ensure a spot in the crowd when aerials debuted as an Olympic
demonstration sport in 1988, and just a few months later, he was
subsisting on powdered milk and peanut butter after driving
cross-country in an attempt to make the U.S. team. He quickly
impressed coaches with his combination of daring and attention to
detail, and while he wasn't in the running for a medal at the 1994
Olympics, it was already clear he was going to be a force in the
sport.</TE>
<TE>   Even injury has not slowed him. His two Olympic jumps in 1998 were
taken within hours of a frightening practice crash that left him with
severely bruised ribs, yet Bergoust still managed to grab the gold
medal with the highest aerials score ever recorded.</TE>
<TE>   And while he has since beat that number twice, he still is coming
into this Olympics convinced he can do better.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics is the biggest event of my life, easily, not just
the biggest sporting event, the biggest event--it's all I've thought
about for the last two years," he says. "I just want to go in there
and keep improving, and I know if I do that, the winning will come."</TE>
<TE>   This is the secret, of course, even behind the crazy stuff that
have earned him the reputation as Weird Eric. The jumping off the
chimney onto mattresses, for example, started with a jump off the
porch onto a mattress.</TE>
<TE>   The jumping off a bridge--"well, there isn't actually much that
can go wrong with jumping off a 60-foot bridge," he insists. "You
just take a step and then fall 60 feet into the water."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Bergoust has been dreaming up the impossible, then
breaking down every detail of the road he'll need to take to get
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric just believes he can do these amazing things and then
figures out ways to do it,"Christensen says. "And, man, they are
amazing things."</TE>

<HD>Pinning Their Hopes on the Winter Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CANDUS THOMSON</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The unofficial currency of the Winter Games is pins: food pins,
sponsor pins, sports pins. Even the FBI has pins.</LD>
<LD>   Want something copied for free? Give the clerk a pin. Need a cab
driver to wait while you dash to the ATM? That'll cost you two pins.
Don't have a pin to trade? Welcome to the loser's club.</LD>
<LD>   An urban legend has it that 17 million pins were traded at the
1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, and that's before bartering really
got hot.</LD>
<TE>   Pin traders are everywhere. Some specialize. Others aren't picky.</TE>
<TE>   For Harvey Davids, it all started in 1988 in his Calgary
collectibles shop. Someone covering the Winter Games gave him an ABC
network pin.</TE>
<TE>   "I somehow got hooked," he says. "'It's every parent's nightmare.
The circus comes to town and the kid runs away. The Olympics came to
town and I haven't missed one since."</TE>
<TE>   Davids is sitting on the corner of West Temple and 200 South,
wrapped in a parka, looking for his next score. He has few takers,
but he's not worried. "It'll pick up," he says. "It always does."</TE>
<TE>   A block away, at Dare to Dream, it's a swapper's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Store employee Suzanne Lammle is dickering with two police
officers from Hurricane, Utah, over what their pins are worth. They
want to swap their pins shaped like police badges for her
badge-shaped, narcotic's officer pin.</TE>
<TE>   Even up. Two for one. One for two. Finally, the deal goes down.</TE>
<TE>   The store manager, Jack Frost, watches as people peruse boards
filled with pins that cost anywhere from $5 to $25 (the expensive
ones are behind glass), trying to decide if they want a bowl of ice
cream with the 2002 Olympic snowflake or a Valentine's Day tuxedo and
rose combination with the 2002 logo.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, they take both and throw in a few others for good
measure.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has authorized about 600 retail
pins, but there are hundreds of nonprofit organizations that have
permission to produce pins for fund-raisers. On top of those are the
hundreds of unofficial Olympic pins that poke gentle fun at Utah and
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Frost says the
number of designs tops 1,700.</TE>
<TE>   Local pin expert Bill Hipson and Salt Lake Tribune editorial
cartoonist Pat Bagley have sold out their series of pins that play on
Utah themes. "Seven Brides for One Brother," is a play on the banned
practice of polygamy. Another makes fun of sea gulls, Utah's state
bird. Yet another declares Utah is a "holy-owned subsidiary" of the
Mormon church.</TE>
<TE>   Many people in the store say the pins are inexpensive souvenirs
for children or grandchildren that are easy to pack in luggage. But
other folks are hoping to make a killing later on in the collectibles
market.</TE>
<TE>   Frost says as the games get closer, there's been a noticeable
shift from the former category to the latter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people coming in with lists, looking for specific pins
--say a Nagano participation pin --and they don't quibble when you
say $250," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are some notable exceptions among this year's pins
-- the original green Jell-O pin is selling for $150 -- the vast
majority of them don't appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   "People who buy pins to make money are buying pins for the wrong
reason," Frost says. "They come in here and say, 'These must be worth
something.' So I point and say, 'Let's walk over here to the $5
boards.'"</TE>
<TE>   Artistically, some pins are jewelry, while others are, well, not.</TE>
<TE>   Frost recalls one group of customers staring at a pin of a roasted
marshmallow, and then turning to him and asking, "Why would they have
a burning toilet paper roll?"</TE>
<TE>   He chuckles at the memory. "There's no negatives in the pin
business. Everybody's happy, everybody wants to be here. Pins can
make you smile."</TE>

<KH>COMMENTARY</KH>
<HD>Brady as Good as Belichick Would Allow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Game XXXVI, the most dramatic of the recent Super Bowls, climaxed so
spectacularly the other day that it rates one more look if only to
comment on what I think of as two major misperceptions:</LD>
<LD>   First, this wasn't a team victory, even though the New England
Patriots have been calling it that since they beat the St. Louis Rams
on the game's last play, 20-17. It was a Tom Brady victory.</LD>
<LD>   Second, it wasn't as brilliantly coached by New England as many
people thought. A four-week streak of good luck has made Bill
Belichick the champion of the NFL although, loath to pass, he
mismanaged each of the Patriots' three postseason games, the Super
Bowl among them.</LD>
<TE>   The winning quarterback, Brady, provided the only surprise of
XXXVI. Few realized he was that good. Judging between him and backup
passer Drew Bledsoe, New England's coach Belichick knew enough to
play Brady, but he didn't know enough to use him--until he had to.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the game is that Brady only burst into the public's
consciousness as a great passer in the last 90 seconds of the last
quarter, when he threw five perfect passes to position the Patriots
for their last-second field goal.</TE>
<TE>   If the football public had known that Belichick was concealing
that kind of quarterback, the Patriots would not have been 14-point
underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   90 Seconds</TE>
<TE>   New England's coaches made an unpardonable mistake when they
waited until the last 90 seconds to tell Brady to open up with
consecutive passes. What if they hadn't had 90 seconds? What if only
80 seconds remained when the Rams scored the tying touchdown? That
could easily have happened, and that, surely, would have led to
overtime--and what then?</TE>
<TE>   Well, the way both teams played the fourth quarter, the Rams were
clearly seizing control. The Patriot defense, so marvelously
prepared, so perfectly designed by Belichick, and so dominating for
three quarters, had been running so hard, so often, and so fast that
it was running out of gas. The Rams' long, three-play, tying
touchdown drive was one of the simplest and swiftest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, had the Patriots won the toss, they would only have
had one chance: Belichick, to win, needed to throw as aggressively
then as he'd had to throw in the last 90 seconds. The odds would have
been against that. Those who've watched Belichick for the last 27
years doubt that any passer of his would ever get the green light in
overtime. The Belichick way is to play defense and play for the
breaks--even with a tiring team. The Ram way under Coach Mike Martz
is to go for it.</TE>
<TE>   And because it's more exhausting to play defense than offense--as,
once again, the fourth quarter proved last Sunday--it would have been
a tough overtime for the Patriots. They won because they lucked into
a window of 90 seconds at the end--instead of less than 90 or more.
With less, they can't win in regulation. With more, they don't pass,
so they don't win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brady's Show</TE>
<TE>   The Tom Brady show was the most surprising in the 36 years of the
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he'd gone into the opening kickoff as the leader of a team
on an eight-game winning streak. Sure, he had successfully rallied
the Patriots earlier this season. Sure, it was understood that even
as a second-year pro, Brady is a cool, competent passer. Every
opponent was aware of the truth that, even with a bad ankle, he's
better than Bledsoe. But few reasoned he's that much better.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if Brady were remembered at all during the week before
the game, he was probably thought of as the guy who threw all those
passes in that Foxboro snowstorm last month. And that achievement
could have been an aberration. For only on selected occasions this
season has his coach, Belichick, used him as a passer. In the Super
Bowl, the New England coach was taking an unnecessary risk when he
tried to beat the Rams with his defensive team and with running back
Antowain Smith instead of with Brady's remarkable passing game. For,
in the first three quarters, an all-out Brady assault--mounted with
receivers as gifted as Troy Brown and David Patten and combined with
the early-game performance of Belichick's beautifully coached
defensive team--would have left no doubts. Had Belichick played
earlier the way he played the last 90 seconds, it's no contest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   17-17 Standoff</TE>
<TE>   The winning passer is, almost certainly, as good as he looked.
Those weren't wild, fluky passes that Brady was throwing in the last
90 seconds. Every one of the five was well calculated, well aimed and
well thrown by a quarterback playing with the poise of a 10-year
veteran and with undoubted talent. His size--at 6 feet 2, Brady has
built himself into a rugged 220-pounder--is ideal for a quarterback.
His throwing motion is ideal. His reading skills seemed ideal for one
so young, 24, and inexperienced. And the results were demonstrably
ideal--for the Patriots, plainly, and for Belichick personally.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram offense is also as good as it looked in the fourth
quarter, when, after New England had given Ram quarterback Kurt
Warner a hard time for 45 minutes, he took his team on the game's
best two touchdown drives--in the familiar Mike Martz way--to make it
a 17-17 standoff. The collective wisdom of his critics is that the
Patriots beat Warner up. But these folks came to that conclusion only
because midnight in New Orleans was closing in and they had to talk
about something, so they talked about what they'd seen for three
quarters. The real Kurt Warner was only on view in the fourth
quarter--along with the real Tom Brady. The whole game was played in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Lucky Streak</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl XXXVI was an unforeseen extension of Belichick's good
fortune and the Belichick way. His lucky streak began in January with
the playoff games that identified him as a superb defensive coach (no
surprise there) but as an inadequate head coach. The landmark
playoff-month events:</TE>
<TE>   * Round 1: The Belichick hot streak actually began with the
collapse of the Oakland Raiders, who lost their last three
regular-season games to fall from 10-3 to 10-6. That put the Raiders
out of the reckoning for the home-field advantage in their
second-round game against New England, although they did eliminate
the New York Jets on wild card weekend</TE>
<TE>   * Round 2: The Patriots just did win at home, outlasting Oakland
in overtime, 16-13, even though Brady fumbled the game away in the
snowstorm--or so he said afterward. The referee said otherwise after
checking instant replay. He ruled the fumble an incomplete pass
(which, according to the NFL book, it was) and gave the ball back to
New England.</TE>
<TE>   Even luckier for Belichick, the Raiders, a passing team,
unaccountably quit passing--on their key plays--after opening a 7-0
halftime lead with a touchdown pass. And thereafter, they were
clearly playing to protect a lead that grew to 13-3 entering the
fourth quarter. Now, Belichick had no choice. He had to let Brady
throw. And, completing 18 of his last 19 passes, Brady pulled it out.</TE>
<TE>   * Round 3: Seemingly unimpressed with Brady's work in the Foxboro
snowstorm, Belichick put him on hold again, for the most part, a week
later in Pittsburgh, where the Patriots prevailed again, 24-17,
winning this time on fortunate kicking plays--two of them for two of
their three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The first was in reality a two-kick sequence that began with a
64-yard Pittsburgh punt to the New England 24. A penalty against the
Steelers forced them to punt again. And this time they blooped it
only to the New England 45, where a Patriot All-Pro, Troy Brown,
caught it and raced to a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the Patriots blocked a Steeler field goal attempt and, in a
seldom-seen NFL play, raced that one back for a 60-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   * Round 4: The week before Brady saved him in the Super Bowl,
20-17, Belichick identified himself in New Orleans as a head coach
who has no conception of the real strength of his team.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Belichick told everyone who would listen that he
would have to find a way to score Super Bowl points without his
offense.</TE>
<TE>   The correct rejoinder to that is: What makes you think so?</TE>
<TE>   The quality of the New England offensive group begins with four of
the NFL's finest--wide receivers Brown and Patten, running back
Smith, and a quarterback, Brady, who has proved his excellence every
time he has been asked to. The Belichick problem is not that he lacks
an offense, it's that he doesn't use it. A great defensive coach, he
doesn't understand offense, and, so, he doesn't involve Brady often
enough. Heading into last Sunday's game, one principal question
confronted the contestants: Would the Rams win in a rout or by a
small score?</TE>
<TE>   The rout disappeared in the first half, but a bare Ram win was
still there with 1:30 to play--when Brady made that disappear, too.</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked from coast to coast is the truth that in the fourth
quarter, against the exhausted Patriot defense, the Ram offense
finally played like the Ram offense.</TE>
<TE>   Should Belichick be honored as the mastermind who won the game?
Hardly. It was predictable that the Patriots would tire and that the
Rams would rally.</TE>
<TE>   Should Brady be the MVP? Yes. His rally was as unpredictable, as
surprising, as shocking to Belichick (apparently) as it was
wonderful.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>For the second straight week, St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner was
on the opposite sideline from New England counterpart Tom Brady.</LD>
<LD>   But there's no way that Warner, the NFL's regular-season MVP,
could make up for last week's Super Bowl loss during Saturday's Pro
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "He's got what I want and I'm not going to get it through this
game," Warner said of Brady, who won the Super Bowl and the MVP
award. "This game is more to have fun and to try to enjoy it."</LD>
<TE>   Brady led the Patriots' final Super Bowl drive that set up Adam
Vinatieri's game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired. Brady,
24, became the youngest quarterback to win the game.</TE>
<TE>   Warner and Brady had to wait until Wednesday in Hawaii to finally
have the chance to speak to each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get to talk to him afterward because they were too busy
celebrating," said Warner, who won the 2000 Super Bowl after his
first MVP season.</TE>
<TE>   "I congratulated him and asked him how he was doing with the
whirlwind, since I went through it a couple years ago," Warner said.
"He seemed to be doing pretty good, he looked a little tired. He
looked like he wanted some rest."</TE>
<TE>   Brady, who has managed to calm down this week, admires Warner for
a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a heck of a player," Brady said. "He's a guy that's
consistent and is one of the best quarterbacks in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Warner started for the NFC on Saturday, while Brady backed up AFC
starter Rich Gannon.</TE>
<TE>   Brady is impressed with Warner, who threw for 4,830 yards and 36
touchdowns in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's tough to do," Brady said. "He's elusive and he makes good
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Warner and Brady took parallel paths from obscurity to stardom.
They were both backup quarterbacks who went on to become Super Bowl
MVPs in their first season as starters.</TE>
<TE>   Brady was the Patriots' sixth round draft pick in 2000, and was a
fourth-stringer well behind starter Drew Bledsoe last season.</TE>
<TE>   Warner was undrafted and spent time in the Arena Football League
and NFL Europe before joining the Rams in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some similarity there with the way we got into it and the
things we were able to accomplish in the first year," Warner said.
"Obviously, our backgrounds are a little different but the stories
and the way it played out throughout the first year is very similar."</TE>
<TE>   Although Warner can't take Brady's Super Bowl ring from him, he
does want his helmet following the Pro Bowl to add to his collection.
After St. Louis' Super Bowl win against Tennessee, Warner traded
helmets with running back Eddie George.</TE>
<TE>   Warner said he doesn't know Brady well, but he is impressed with
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Just what I see in the way he carries himself, I think he's a
good character guy," Warner said. "He's going to be a positive thing
for the league for a long time to come."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rich Gannon doesn't care what anyone says, the Pro Bowl means
something.</TE>
<TE>   And not just for the $30,000 you get if you win. Yet the Oakland
quarterback understands why it's easy to think of the Pro Bowl as
anything but a sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   It is billed as a weeklong party in paradise for the NFL's elite,
and that's fairly accurate. Players talk coaches into cutting short
practice, and an afternoon of beach bowling on popular Waikiki is the
newest featured event.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gannon's mind is made up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is taken seriously," he said. "Everyone wants to
play their best, especially when you get to the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity to shine in this game is short. Gannon will play
in his third Pro Bowl on Saturday at Aloha Stadium, starting for the
AFC. He expects to last about a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bill Cowher of the Steelers hadn't made a final decision on
playing time Friday morning, when both teams canceled practice
because of a downpour. Super Bowl MVP Brady and Pittsburgh's Kordell
Stewart will relieve Gannon in the game, which tends to favor the
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Warner will start for the NFC, followed by San Francisco's Jeff
Garcia and Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   NFC coach Andy Reid and others say it's hard to predict Pro Bowls,
though his team was the slight favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go out there and kick their butts," joked Brady.
"There's a lot of talent on this team from what I see. But I don't
know how they could even pick a line for this game."</TE>
<TE>   Keyshawn Johnson turned to Tampa Bay teammate John Lynch this week
and asked him if they could bring a Super Bowl title to the
Buccaneers with such an all-star roster.</TE>
<TE>   Good chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling John I wish we could always play with this team,"
Johnson said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, Lynch and Tampa's two other Pro Bowl representatives
found out Friday they still don't have a new head coach after talks
broke off between the team and Baltimore defensive coordinator Marvin
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said for now Reid is his coach. And the receiver could use
a good showing Saturday because he needs the extra money--players on
the losing squad leave with $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas linebacker Dexter Coakley compares the Pro Bowl to the
season. This is Coakley's second trip.</TE>
<TE>   "The first quarter is like the preseason, the second and third
quarters are like the regular season," he said. "And the fourth
quarter is going to be like the regular season and the playoffs,
because everyone realizes they have to pay for hotel rooms so they're
trying to play for the bigger checks."</TE>
<TE>   It depends on the player as to how much emphasis they place on the
Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the Super Bowl, that's for sure," said seventh-year Pro
Bowl player Aeneas Williams of the Rams. "With the atmosphere, it's
hard to get in a serious mode."</TE>
<TE>   Ahman Green is convinced the game means more to younger players
and to first-timers like himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it pretty seriously," said the Packers running back, who
dresses next to veteran Pro Bowl players Marshall Faulk and Mike
Alstott in the locker room. "To those guys it's routine. They'll
probably play five or 10 minutes in the first quarter."</TE>

<HD>Salt Lake's New Glimmer of Hip</HD>
<DH>Long perceived as Dullsville, Utah's capital is a little
sexier, a tad more sophisticated. But when the Olympics clear out,
will it be worth a visit?</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>At Lamb's Grill Cafe, an institution since 1939, you can get eggs
Vienna, a comforting concoction of poached eggs on toast doused with
hot milk, served by a waitress in white shoes. Down the street at
Bambara, on the ground floor of the chichi Hotel Monaco, breakfast
could be a plate of Atlantic salmon hash with chive-chervil creme
fraiche begging to get its picture taken by a photographer from
Gourmet.</LD>
<LD>   These two breakfasts sum up Salt Lake City as it welcomes the 2002
Winter Olympics and enters the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   During the Winter Games, which opened Friday and will end Feb. 24,
millions of TV viewers will likely be impressed by the city's
breathtaking setting against the massive Wasatch Range, the
superlative powdery snow and the Mormon orderliness. But others, who
know it as a plain Jane, homogeneous city with arcane drinking laws
and a sidewalk that rolls up after dark, will be skeptical. They'll
want to know what it will be like when the camera crews go home. Is
there reason to visit the city beyond its usefulness as a gateway to
skiing Park City (which hosts some of the downhill and snowboarding
events) or rock climbing in the canyon country to the south?</LD>
<TE>   After visiting Salt Lake City two years ago, I would have said no.
But when I went back last month, I found it changed in invigorating
ways. It's no L.A. or New York. And peculiarities persist, to be
sure. But some of them, like cleanliness, a healthy, smoke-free
environment, nice people, low prices, safety and devotion to
children, are more welcome than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The city, founded in 1847 by a band of Mormon pioneers, has a
singular and fascinating history, recalled at almost every turn in
statues and historical markers. As a portal to ski resorts, national
parks and the pristine back country, Salt Lake City is hard to top.
And then there's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, to my mind still the
hottest ticket in town.</TE>
<TE>   The city is the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, with its Oz-like bastion at Temple Square, low
hemlines, mortuary decor and prohibition against alcohol, caffeine
and nicotine. Almost half the population of 181,743 (that's Salt Lake
proper--the greater metro area is 1.6 million) is Mormon.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also a place straining to be more cosmopolitan, driven
partly by the 22% of the population that checks "none" when pollsters
ask about their religion. (This is the fastest-growing segment of the
population, chiefly composed of lapsed Mormons, according to Dan
Jones Inc., a Utah survey and research company.)</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in the transformation of Salt Lake City is Mayor
Rocky Anderson, a progressive Democrat who once tended bar at the
Twilite Lounge, a municipal institution that dates to 1919. The
city's rivalry with Denver as a jumping-off point for lovers of the
great Western outdoors has also played a role, spurring hotels and
restaurants to smarten up.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Salt Lake City aced Denver by getting the Olympics, never
mind the bribery scandal. For the Winter Games and the Paralympic
Winter Games (in which athletes with disabilities will compete March
7 to 16), the city partly remade itself, building a huge new mall
downtown and a 15-mile mass-transit trolley system that is expected
to eventually reach the airport. Giant portraits of Olympic athletes
decorate the sides of office buildings downtown; a copy of the
Declaration of Independence is on display through March 15 in the
Capitol; through April 15 the Museum of Fine Arts on the campus of
the University of Utah has an exhibition of ancient Greek Olympic art
from L.A.'s J. Paul Getty Museum, as part of a "cultural Olympiad"
organized to coincide with the Games; and a 10-acre parking lot near
Temple Square and the Delta Center (where the Utah Jazz plays
basketball) has been turned into an open-air pavilion with a stage
and a 30,000-pound retractile arch for the nightly presentation of
Olympic medals.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way that Paris benefited from the 1900 Exposition and
New York from the 1964 World's Fair, Salt Lake City will inherit much
after the Olympic circus folds. The airport, about 10 miles west of
downtown, has been equipped with detectors to check travelers for
traces of explosives. (All U.S. airports will have them eventually,
but because of the Olympics, Salt Lake got them first.) Highway
upgrades have made the trip from the airport to downtown a 10-minute
affair, even in snow. TRAX trolleys take visitors from the new
Gateway mall west of Temple Square to the University of Utah in 15
minutes or so and cost $1.25.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a crop of lavish hotels has opened recently. Above all
is the eye-popping 775-room Grand America, opened last March on the
south side of town. Salt Lake City billionaire Earl Holding, who also
owns Sinclair Oil and the Sun Valley ski resort in Idaho, supervised
construction of his Grand America down to the last detail, even
breaking open crates of white granite for the exterior walls that had
been quarried in Vermont and shaped in Spain. In a city where the
average room rate was $76 last year, prices at the Grand America may
seem high. But where else in the country can you get a huge,
luxurious chamber with French doors, mountain views and an Italian
marble bath for $185 a night during the week and $129 on weekends?</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
completed a modernistic conference center just north of Temple
Square, with a smashing 21,000-seat auditorium and roof garden. Salt
Lake City even has a hip neighborhood, the warehouse district, where
galleries, trendy restaurants, brew pubs, theaters and architectural
firms stretch along 300 South Street from West Temple Street to
Pioneer Park.</TE>
<TE>   It's a real city now, with all the good and bad that entails,
including homeless people and a hint of urban cynicism. I asked
almost everyone I met what they would do during the Olympics. Most
rolled their eyes and said they planned to avoid the crowds by
staying home and watching the Games on TV.</TE>
<TE>   I got here on a Thursday afternoon. The sky had already turned a
vague shade of blue, and the temperature was nudging freezing. The
descending plane yielded a view of a city like the kingdom of a snow
queen. I stayed three nights at the 225-room Hotel Monaco, which
opened in 1999 in an old bank building at Main Street and 200 South
and is part of a small chain of boutique hotels headquartered in San
Francisco. It serves free wine in the lobby at cocktail hour and has
a kind of "Alice in Wonderland" decor, where checks and stripes live
together and you'll find the occasional nutty piece of furniture,
like the red canopied settee in the lobby. My ninth-floor room ($129
a night) was the size of a suite. It had a plush king-size bed, robes
and Aveda toiletries, contemporary prints on the walls, lots of
lamps, sterling sunrise views over the Wasatch mountains and, most
important, a coffee maker with a Starbucks brew pack.</TE>
<TE>   I went downstairs to Bambara Restaurant and ordered a Belvedere
martini, on the rocks with olives. Alcohol is readily available in
Salt Lake City restaurants and private clubs (which are like bars,
except that customers must pay a cover charge of about $5 or find a
sponsor who already has a membership to get a drink).</TE>
<TE>   Still, teetotaler laws supported by Mormon church members make
imbibing in Salt Lake City an odd experience. The martini came in a
pretty fluted glass, but was heavy on the vermouth and minuscule
besides; by law, Salt Lake City bartenders can't make drinks with
more than one ounce of liquor and must use a dispenser to make sure
of it. The waiter brought me a wine list along with the menu.
(Technically, restaurants were forbidden to do so unless the customer
asks, but a court recently struck down this law.) I ordered a glass
of Chardonnay with my seafood stew. When it came, the waiter
sheepishly told me I had to finish my cocktail before he could serve
the wine, because regulations dictate that each diner have only one
drink on the table at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The fish stew was chock-full of lobster, shrimp and calamari, a
testament to the landlocked city's yearning for seafood--and to its
gourmet awakening. Known once upon a time for "funeral potatoes" (an
easy-to-make, frighteningly rich potluck favorite) and Jell-O (which
the Utah legislature last year proclaimed the state's official snack
food), Salt Lake City cooking has started to come of age.</TE>
<TE>   Chic new restaurants serving sophisticated cuisine and modest
places specializing in ethnic fare--Vietnamese, Italian,
Mexican--compete with old standards like Lamb's Grill Cafe, where
Mormon comfort food tops the menu.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner I walked up West Temple Street to Maurice Abravanel
Concert Hall to hear the Utah Symphony perform Vivaldi and Respighi.
The numbered streets, laid out in a grid emanating from Temple
Square, were virtually empty but didn't feel threatening. The concert
hall is a handsome contemporary building at the north side of Salt
Palace Convention Center, decorated with several garishly illuminated
glass sculptures by Dale Chihuly (part of a big Chihuly exhibit in
the Salt Lake Art Center next door, through March 17). The decor of
the wood-lined concert hall is far more low-key, and the symphony,
conducted by Keith Lockhart, played beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   I spent most of the next day touring Temple Square, a 35-acre
enclave that remains the city's chief point of interest. Outside the
south gate a demonstrator had raised a sign that said, "Utah hookers
service International Olympic Committee members but you can't
practice polygamy." Inside, young Mormon sisters wearing long, dark
overcoats, name tags and sensible shoes offered assistance. Almost
200 of them, from 40 countries as far afield as China and Italy,
serve two-year missions as Temple Square guides, demonstrating to
visitors the global reach of a church with more than 10 million
members worldwide. I toured the south visitor center, with displays
on Mormon family values and genealogy, and peeked over the wall
surrounding the six-spired temple (open to church members only). In
the north visitor center there is a model of Jerusalem with buttons
that illuminate various scenes from the life of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the way the wide, flat Salt Lake Valley yields to the
foothills of the Wasatch Range from the observation deck in the
Joseph Smith Memorial Building, formerly the Hotel Utah, and watched
"The Testaments," an hourlong film that dramatizes Book of Mormon
scripture about how Jesus came to the New World shortly after the
Resurrection, an eye-opener for an old-fashioned Protestant like me.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the noon organ recital in the domed
tabernacle, the organist demonstrated the building's remarkable
acoustics by dropping a pin onstage, which could clearly be heard in
the back row of the auditorium. In the nearby Beehive House, where
city and temple founder Brigham Young lived with his 20 wives and 57
children, I was shown around by Sister Shibazaki, a sweet 22-year-old
from Japan who told me she was drawn to the Mormon faith because of
how it nurtures families.</TE>
<TE>   Mormon comfort food is the specialty at the Lion House Pantry,
next to the Beehive House. There I lunched on stuffed chicken with
mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables, but couldn't get a cup of hot
tea. Church members shun caffeinated beverages, as well as alcohol
and cigarettes, which partly explains their robust health. (Mormon
death rates from cancer and cardiovascular diseases are 50% lower
than those of the rest of the U.S. population, according to a 1997
UCLA study.)</TE>
<TE>   But outside Temple Square, cafes are abundant. Among them is A Cup
of Joe, an amiable spot with overstuffed chairs, to which I retired
in the late afternoon. It is in the warehouse district, on the west
side of downtown, near the Rio Grande train station and Pioneer Park.
Street people congregate in this area, and the park has long been
home to drug pushers and users. Even so, I felt comfortable walking
there after dark, looking into shops, Italian delis and galleries.</TE>
<TE>   In the station's convivial Rio Grande Cafe, I had a zesty
margarita and a burrito, then caught Stephen Sondheim's "A Little
Night Music" at the historic Capitol Theater nearby, performed
without brio by the Utah Opera.</TE>
<TE>   I saw more of the city and surrounding area in the next two days,
including the dignified Capitol, which sits on a hill north of town,
and the modest collection at the Museum of Fine Arts on the campus of
the University of Utah. I rode the "Heber Creeper," a historic
railway that runs from the hamlet of Heber, in the mountains about 60
miles southeast of town, around Deer Creek Lake and into Provo
Canyon. I dined sumptuously on antipasto and whitefish with foie gras
at Fresco, a stylish little restaurant specializing in elaborate
northern Italian fare in the Sugarhouse neighborhood southeast of
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   And I spent one night at the Grand America, where a tape of the
first few bars of Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" plays nonstop by the
elevators and the lobby's tapestries, chandeliers and Oriental vases
evoke Vegas grandiosity rather than European grand hotel. I gorged on
seafood at the Sunday buffet in the Garden Cafe, sampled the watery
martinis in the well-hidden bar, got a lecture from a saleswoman in
the hotel shop about the deleterious effects on the young of
magazines like Penthouse and Playboy, and cuddled up in a king-size
bed, trying to make sense of a city clearly pulled in opposing
directions, new and old, sophisticated and parochial.</TE>
<TE>   Such contradictions had not occurred to me that morning, when I
attended a "Music and the Spoken Word" program performed by the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir in Temple Square. The 360-member chorus was
arranged on tiers around the tabernacle's massive organ, sisters in
white robes to the left, brothers in black suits to the right.</TE>
<TE>   When they sang, it was with one soul-stirring voice. No sense had
to be made of it. I stopped thinking about martinis and Mormon
conservatism in the powerful joy of hearing it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guidebook: Scouting Salt Lake</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: From LAX, nonstop service to Salt Lake City is
available on Delta, United and Southwest. Restricted round-trip fares
begin at $156.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake City International Airport is about 10 miles west of
the city, easily accessible from Interstates 215 and 80. Most major
car rental companies are represented. Taxis and a city bus serving
downtown are available.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: Most hotels are booked for the Olympics, of course,
with higher-than-usual rates. Below are post-Olympics prices. Room
rates fluctuate depending on availability; check for special
promotions.</TE>

pools and afternoon tea in the lobby. Doubles $185-$235 weekdays,

<LD>In the usual pattern of transatlantic travel, prices remain at their
winter lows through the middle of March, then begin to climb. Air
fares and hotel rates increase sharply in late March, soar in April
and climb again in May.</LD>
<LD>   But maybe not this year. The European market is so sluggish that
airlines and tour operators are extending their winter lows through
the end of March and are raising them only $100 to $200 in April and
May (an unprecedented low increase for those desirable months). The
result is that you can enjoy a warm-weather week in a great European
capital or area at bargain prices. Consider these opportunities:</LD>
<LD>   * $699 for an Aer Lingus flight, then a week tooling around
Ireland, staying in farmhouse B&amp;Bs: The Emerald Isle mixes high tech
with hedgerows and still manages to be charming. Ireland travel
specialist Sceptre Ireland, (800) 221-0924, www.sceptreireland.com,
continues its popular six-night fly-and-drive Emerald Package: a
hotel night in Shannon followed by five more in any of 450 country
bed-and-breakfasts (Irish breakfast included), a rental car to get
you from pub to pub (er, place to place) and a round-trip flight from
Los Angeles. The $699 price is available from March through May;
single supplement is $150.</LD>
<TE>   * $599 in March, $699 in early April and $799 in late April (all
prices per person, double occupancy) for six nights in Moscow and St.
Petersburg, including round-trip air fare, hotel and show tickets.
(From the West Coast add $325.) It's worth packing an extra sweater
or two to enjoy such czarist wonders as St. Petersburg's Hermitage
and Moscow's Kremlin--especially for $599--on the "Land of the Czars"
tour from Eastern Tours, (800) 339-6967, www.traveltorussia.com.
Included are round-trip air from New York on Finnair, three nights in
St. Petersburg and an evening at the Kirov Ballet. Next, take an
overnight train to Moscow, where you'll spend two more nights, with a

<HD>Two Landmark Hawaii Hotels Catch a Renovation Wave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two well-known Hawaii resorts have new management with new plans: the
Hotel Hana-Maui at Hana Ranch and the Molokai Ranch &amp; Lodge.</LD>
<LD>   The 78-room Hotel Hana-Maui is undergoing nearly $10 million worth
of what observers say is much-needed renovation. The landmark 66-acre
complex on the scenic Hana Highway, dating to 1946, was acquired last
year by the Ohana Hotel Co. Its new management is the San
Francisco-based Passport Resorts, whose owners also manage the luxury
Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur and Jean-Michel Cousteau Fiji Islands
Resort.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a grand hotel in her day," Doug Chang, the new general
manager, said last week of the Maui hotel. "The current management is
committed to restoring her former glory."</LD>
<TE>   The owners are redoing the interiors of 47 cottages built in the
1980s, and re-landscaping is expected to be completed by May, he
said. Last fall Larry Quirit, who formerly worked at the Grand Wailea
Resort, Hotel &amp; Spa on Maui and the Post Ranch Inn, took over as
executive chef. Room rates begin at $275 per night. (800) 321-4262,
www.hotelhanamaui.com.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Monday, the sprawling Molokai resort will be known as the
Sheraton Molokai Lodge and Beach Village, becoming one of more than a
dozen Hawaiian resorts that parent company Starwood manages under
various brand names. It has 40 "tentalows" (bungalow-like tents with
private bathrooms) and 22 guest rooms.</TE>
<TE>   A Starwood spokesman said the resort would focus on "the younger,
upscale traveler." Among the changes: Hotel employees will meet all
guests at the airport, and most food for the tentalows will be
prepared on site instead of at the lodge several miles away. Rates
begin at $175 for tentalows and $220 for lodge rooms, through June
30. (800) 782-9488, www.sheraton-hawaii.com.</TE>

measures to ensure their personal safety." More than 20 nations are

<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting April 7, United Airlines is adding 127 flights to help
restore service it cut after the Sept. 11 attacks. Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport will add 17 flights, and Denver International
Airport will add 26 flights; both are hubs for United. From LAX,
there will be 201/2 daily flights ("one-half" is a return flight) to
San Francisco instead of 17, six daily to New York's JFK instead of
five and seven daily to Washington's Dulles International Airport
instead of 51/2, among other additions.</LD>
<LD>   Other air service additions:</LD>
<LD>   * On July 2, American Airlines will begin its first nonstop
service between Ontario, Calif., and JFK. There will be two flights a
day.</LD>
<TE>   * On April 1, Switzerland will begin operating a new national
airline called Swiss Air Lines. It was formed by the merger of the
European regional carrier Crossair with Swissair, which filed for
bankruptcy protection last fall but will continue to operate until
April 1. No service changes are planned out of Los Angeles, where
Swissair operates a once-a-day nonstop to Zurich, a spokeswoman said.
Swissair tickets issued before March 31 are good on the new airline.

<LD>Museums in the East and Midwest are giving visitors plenty of excuses
to come in from the cold this month, and closer to home, San Diego is
debuting an ambitious examination of evolution. Some major openings:</LD>
<LD>   San Diego: The Museum of Man's "Footsteps Through Time: Four
Million Years of Human Evolution" occupies five galleries and 7,000
square feet of a newly renovated west wing. It includes more than 100

displays. Opened Saturday as a permanent exhibit. (619) 239-2001,
ww.museumofman.org.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago: Two very different shows here. One, called "here is new
york: a democracy of photographs," is the first showing outside New

World Trade Center. Through March 30 at the Chicago Department of
Cultural Affairs, 72 E. Randolph St., (312) 744-6630,

www.fieldmuseum.org.</TE>
<TE>   Houston: This city's Museum of Fine Arts is the first stop on a

26. (410) 396-7100, www.artbma.org.</TE>
<TE>   Stamford, Conn.: Here's one just for fun: "Ukulele Fever: The
Craze That Swept America." Billed as the first museum exhibit on the
topic, it includes more than 100 of the instruments whose popularity
on the mainland peaked in the '50s. Through May 26 at the Stamford
Museum &amp; Nature Center. (203) 322-1646, www.stamfordmuseum.org.</TE>

<LD>Two Ritz-Carltons are pampering frequent guests with what they call
"luggage-less travel": They'll clean and press your clothes, replace
your toiletries and store them until your next stay. You pay for the
cleaning and toiletries; the rest is free.</LD>
<LD>   The 300-room Ritz-Carlton Washington D.C. began the program in
October for guests who stay four times or more a month; the 341-room
Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia picked up the program in January for guests
who stay more than twice a month.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington hotel will even take digital photos of your room,
at your request, to ensure that everything is put back where you want
it. "If you sleep on the right side of the bed and want the photo of
your pet dog there, that's where it will be," a spokeswoman said.
Room rates begin at $450. (800) 241-3333, www.ritzcarlton.com.</LD>

<HD>Bearing Fruit in Vineyards of Temecula</HD>
<DH>Close to home, the region boasts a new B&amp;B that's regal--if
still a bit less than ripe.</DH>

<DL>TEMECULA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>My Internet-sleuth husband was scouting for an unusual weekend
getaway when he came across the new Inn at Churon Winery, Temecula's
first B&amp;B-winery combination.</LD>
<LD>   Although pictures of the inn--billed as a "majestic French
chateau"--weren't yet available online, we called the inn, and the
staff promised that each of the 22 rooms had a fireplace, a large
Jacuzzi tub, a granite and marble bathroom and a patio or terrace.
Breakfast and an evening wine tasting were included. And because the
inn was largely empty for the coming weekend, the reservations staff
offered us a standard room Friday and Saturday night at midweek
rates--$130 plus tax per night, instead of $195. (Suites run as much
as $275.)</LD>
<LD>   The destination fit our criteria: close enough to drive and full
of activities we enjoy--wine tasting and antique shopping. So we
booked it.</LD>
<TE>   Temecula is no Napa, but that turned out to be a good thing. It
was less crowded, cheaper and not as snooty. Like many people, we
appreciate wine but aren't fanatical about it, so it didn't matter
that the labels here don't have the same prestige. And though
Temecula made headlines in recent years because of a grape disease
that wiped out as much as 30% of the vines, we found that the
wineries are recovering nicely, the aftereffects invisible to the
average visitor.</TE>
<TE>   When Dan and I arrived at Churon one Friday last month, the inn
was so new that landscaping was still being installed. We knew the
place had recently opened, but we didn't know just how recently. It
turned out the winery had been open a full month, but this was only
the second weekend of operation for the inn. Windows still had
stickers on them.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Johnson bought the property with longtime friend Ron Tomas
(hence Chu-ron), who also owns the Inn at the Beach in Ventura. They
started the vineyard from scratch and hired seasoned winemaker Don
Frangipani.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who didn't know I was a travel writer, waltzed us around
so proudly we expected him to hand out cigars. No two rooms are
alike, but each features beautiful furnishings, mostly ornate
replicas of antique beds, armoires and tables. The basics are
impressive: 9-1/2-foot ceilings, crown moldings, floral wallpaper,
carved mantels, tasteful floral wallpaper, down comforters. The
bathrooms are as grand as any top-notch hotel's.</TE>
<TE>   Though Johnson seemed to favor the room with his newest
acquisition--a cherry four-poster bed--I chose a room with antique
white reproductions of Louis XIV pieces. From the balcony, we
overlooked the Churon vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the luxurious appointments, the room showed signs of being
a work in progress: no art on the walls, no plants, no phone. It
lacked comforts one would expect, like conditioner to go with the
shampoo, or bath gel for the big tub. I was surprised at the absence
of touches like fresh flowers, chocolates on the pillow, a newspaper
at our door in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   But these were minor points we chalked up to the recent opening.
Based on what we had seen so far, we expected these gestures would
come someday. Meanwhile, we agreed with other guests we met who said
the inn was an excellent value.</TE>
<TE>   At the evening wine reception, the Churon tasting room was so
beautiful and the guests and staff so delightful that we hardly
noticed the wines were just OK--a respectable first effort.</TE>
<TE>   From there we went to dinner at Nihon, a crowded Japanese
restaurant down the road from the inn. I had a spicy tuna roll, which
was good, and crisp tempura. The frazzled staff brought Dan the wrong
dinner, and when he finally got his chicken teriyaki, it was dry.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast back at the inn Saturday morning wasn't much better. We
had requested that our food be brought to the room between 8 and
8:30. Nothing arrived, so we went down to the dining room. No decaf
coffee. Eggs were rubbery. Toast wasn't brown. "They're new," we told
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   We moved on to Front Street, the heart of Old Town Temecula, for
antiquing. I'm no expert, but I do sometimes write about interior
design, so I like to keep developing my eye and appreciation for
furnishings. Though Temecula has a few stores that carry antique
furniture (most notably Longbranch), most deal in
collectibles--various items less than 100 years old. We didn't find
that perfect Renaissance-era entry table or Italian curio cabinet
I've been hunting for, but we did enjoy simply browsing.</TE>
<TE>   Come lunchtime, we headed for the wineries. While still a minor
player, with only 3,000 acres of vineyards compared with Napa
Valley's 40,000 acres, Temecula does have an advantage: a welcome
intimacy between vintners and their guests. Tastings are less
intimidating. Even the relationships between wineries seem more
cordial than competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-'90s those bonds have grown stronger as the region
faced an infestation of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, a
grasshopper-like insect that spreads the vine-killing Pierce's
disease. Vintners had feared the region would be wiped out, but last
year the pest seemed to be contained. The harvest was solid.</TE>
<TE>   Our first stop was Mount Palomar, the prettiest tasting room we
visited and a good place for lunch. We ordered roast turkey and
smoked Gouda sandwiches and a couple of bottles of cream soda from
the deli counter, then took the food to picnic tables overlooking the
valley of vineyards. After lunch, we tasted. We bought four bottles
of Shorty's Bistro, a red named after the proprietor's dog, before
moving on.</TE>
<TE>   Most wineries charge $3 to $6 per person for tasting, which often
includes an etched glass. But at Maurice Carrie, the tasting is free.
I bought several bottles of what I thought was a nice Sauvignon
Blanc, later reading that a top wine reviewer agreed, singling it out
as among his top picks for the region.</TE>
<TE>   At Wilson Creek Winery, the eye-opener was the almond champagne.
At Hart, the surprise wasn't the reds, for which the winery has a
good reputation, but the fact that the server wouldn't talk about his
favorite pours, as other wineries' servers had done. His
recommendation: "They're all good." I think he just wanted to close.</TE>
<TE>   But there was still time for Miramonte, our last stop for the day,
where I squeezed in one final sip of a fine Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting so many wineries, we were careful to take small sips,
dump anything that didn't thrill us and take a midafternoon break at
a coffeehouse.</TE>
<TE>   That night we set our sights on Thornton Winery, not for the
tasting room but for its restaurant. Cafe Champagne has a romantic
Old World ambience--upholstered walls, burgundy tablecloths, dark
woods and beamed ceilings--and a menu best described as French
fusion.</TE>
<TE>   The starters were excellent. Dan's bisque was nicely finished with
a drizzle of red pepper coulis. My pear salad was refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   For an entree, Dan selected crisp roast duck with
ginger-lavender-honey sauce that was aromatic and savory. I ordered
grilled Hawaiian ahi, sesame-crusted and served with a wild mushroom
butter sauce that overpowered the flavor of the fish. For dessert, we
shared a mocha mousse in a cup formed of solid chocolate, nicely
paired with a cinnamon scone and fresh raspberries.</TE>
<TE>   We woke Sunday to see some of the area's most popular attractions,
hot-air balloons, sailing over our balcony. I stepped out to wave at
one group so close that we had a conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks like a great party!" I hollered to about 10 people in a
basket, which beared a "Happy Birthday" banner.</TE>
<TE>   "Climb aboard!" someone shouted back.</TE>
<TE>   A good jog burned off the previous day's gluttony. Or so we
convinced ourselves. Soon we were back in the Churon dining room. I
had a Denver omelet made with sauteed fresh vegetables. Dan had the
yogurt, which was meagerly drizzled over fruit in a fluted champagne
glass. The accompanying granola mentioned on the menu turned out to
be prepackaged snack bars. The coffee was cold.</TE>
<TE>   "They're new."</TE>
<TE>   We went back to the antique stores. I picked up eight hand-painted
amber juice glasses, four dessert plates trimmed in 22-karat gold,
four hand-painted porcelain egg cups and two miniature porcelain
dolls--all for $85. A crusty old guy selling patio statuary and
fountains had vintage window frames to hang in a curved stairway in
my home. Sold, for $100 each.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving town, we visited one more winery that we had
resisted on principle. We like to support underdogs, and Callaway is
the nation's 15th largest winery. It produces 350,000 cases a year,
more than all the region's other wineries combined.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a little embarrassed to say I liked many of the wines,
especially the 2000 Sauvignon Blanc--an $8-a-bottle wonder, if you
ask my humble taste buds. Which sadly proved two things: I like what
the masses like. And my principles are for sale.</TE>
<TE>   We left town with a trunk full of new wines and old treasures,
plus a plan to return--not just to Temecula but to Churon, which
after some time will no doubt come into its own, like a well-aged
wine.</TE>

<LD>On a typical winter Saturday, Dr. Chris Hummel and his colleagues at
Mammoth Hospital in Mammoth Lakes see about two dozen patients "from
the mountain," as he calls the skiers and snowboarders injured on the
nearby slopes. It's nothing out of the ordinary for him to treat a
broken leg, a dislocated shoulder, a few sprained knees, a concussion
and a back problem during one of his shifts, he says.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, "skiing and snowboarding are very safe if you take the
right precautions," says Hummel, director of the hospital's emergency
department. He and other experts say they notice increased safety
consciousness among winter sports participants. Using common-sense
precautions, including wearing the proper gear, can help you avoid
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Skiing and boarding make different demands on the body, so
injuries won't be quite the same, doctors and researchers say. In
skiing, the legs can go in two directions; in snowboarding, the feet
are locked into the board. The quadriceps--the large muscle at the
front of the thigh--does more work in skiing than in boarding, says
Dr. Mark Niedfeldt, an assistant professor of family and community
medicine and an orthopedic surgeon at the Medical College of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who serves as team physician for the U.S.
National Snowboarding Team. Snowboarding also requires more torso
action.</LD>
<TE>   When you turn on skis, you use the inside or outside edge of the
foot. When you turn on a snowboard, you use the heel and toe.</TE>
<TE>   Downhill skiers are most likely to suffer knee problems, such as
injuries to the anterior cruciate and other ligaments surrounding the
joint, says Dr. Eric Schmitter, an orthopedic surgeon at UCLA
Orthopaedic Hospital Associates at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.
They can also suffer fractures of the upper and lower leg.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarders are more likely to suffer wrist injuries and
dislocate their shoulders, Niedfeldt says. Ankle fractures are rare
in skiers but not uncommon in snowboarders, he says, because most
boarders wear boots that are softer than ski boots.</TE>
<TE>   Some safety equipment is recommended for both sports; some is more
crucial in one than the other. Helmets seem to be on the top of every
doctor's list for skiers and boarders--and they're catching on, says
Hummel of Mammoth Hospital. Hummel asks his emergency room patients
whether they wear the right headgear, regardless of the injury. "It
seems more and more people are wearing a helmet," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Helmets for winter sports may even be reaching the "cool" stage,
Hummel says. Bicycle helmets weren't considered hip in years past but
have caught on, and the same has happened with ski and snowboard
helmets, he says. "When you see snowboarders and look at the leader
of the pack--and there is always a leader--it's not unusual to see
the leader wearing one," says Hummel, who skis and snowboards.</TE>
<TE>   The last holdouts? Older skiers who tell him they like to feel the
wind in their hair.</TE>
<TE>   Wrist guards are crucial for snowboarders. A recent study
published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine compared the
outcomes of more than 5,000 snowboarders in a three-month period.
Half wore wrist guards, and half did not. In the group wearing wrist
protection, only eight sustained wrist injuries, but there were 29
such injuries in the control group. Snowboarders who don't use wrist
guards should keep their hands in a closed fist, Niedfeldt says, to
prevent falling on a hyperextended wrist.</TE>
<TE>   For beginning boarders, knee pads and posterior pads aren't a bad
idea either, Niedfeldt adds. Beginning snowboarders might also
consider using ski poles, a technique that some instructors teach, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides wearing the proper safety equipment, warming up the
muscles by stretching is a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Skiers who feel themselves falling should just do so, Niedfeldt
says. "Most of the ACL [anterior cruciate ligament] injuries occur
when the skier tries to break the fall," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The skiers most likely to get injured are beginners and those who
race, says Schmitter of Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center. Those with
in-between abilities are at less risk, partly because they tend to be
prudent, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Beginners in either sport should take lessons, experts say. And
novice skiers should select shorter skis because they are easier to
maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   If you're wondering which sport to take up, Niedfeldt has some
advice. "I think skiing is easier to pick up [than snowboarding]. But
people can become very good boarders [more easily] than very good
skiers. If you have bad knees, snowboarding is better."</TE>

<HD>Classic Landscape in Malibu Creek Park</HD>

<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Crags Road, Malibu Creek State Park's most popular path, is a mellow
ramble through the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. The route
from the park entrance on Las Virgenes Road to a visitor center and
the former set of the TV series "MASH" is a classic Southland hike.</LD>
<LD>   Many folks already have made this trek. But for a lovely
variation, hike the usual route backward. Enter through the park's
rear entrance and start from a rarely used trail head at Malibu Lake.
For those who can arrange a car shuttle, this is a good one-way hike.</LD>
<LD>   Malibu Lake was created for a country club and real estate
development in the early 1920s, when a dam was built for Malibu
Creek. The Mountain Club, established on the lake shore in 1922,
still stands and is available for rent on weekends. During the 1930s
and '40s, the lake was a popular location for movies. "Wells Fargo"
(1937) and "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" (1938) are among the movies
filmed here.</LD>
<TE>   Although the lake is a nice place to start a hike, it doesn't have
much to offer, and it looks better from a distance than it does up
close. So the "no trespassing" signs you see aren't an issue; you'll
be hiking away from the lake, not around it.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Calabasas, exit on
Las Virgenes Road and drive three miles south to Mulholland Highway.
The main state park entrance is straight ahead, farther south on Las
Virgenes; instead, you want to turn right (west) on Mulholland and
drive 31/4 miles to an intersection with Cornell Road (extending
north) and Lake Vista Drive (which you follow west).</TE>
<TE>   Follow Lake Vista a short distance to Malibu Lake and Crags Road.
Turn left on Crags Road and continue about three-quarters of a mile
to a vehicle gate and the state park boundary. If you want to park,
stop about a quarter-mile back on Crags Road.</TE>
<TE>   Park legally and courteously in the neighborhood along Crags Road.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: From the trail head, walk east on the dirt road
one-third of a mile to an unsigned junction. (For a nice place to
have lunch, detour left, or north, along Malibu Creek and past
handsome rock-framed pools. This path ends in a quarter-mile at a
picnic table perched near Malibu Dam.)</TE>
<TE>   Continue on Crags Road past a signed intersection with Bulldog
Road, then go one-third of a mile more to the "MASH" site, marked by
the charred skeleton of an old jeep. The prominent Goat Buttes that
tower above Malibu Creek were featured in the opening of each
episode.</TE>
<TE>   Another mile of easy hiking brings you to Century Lake, made in
the early 1900s by the Crags Country Club, a group of wealthy
businessmen who had a nearby lodge. Hills of porous lava and
topsy-turvy layers of sedimentary rock tell of the violent geologic
upheaval that formed Malibu Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Continue three-quarters of a mile more past the lake to the
visitor center, open weekends, where you'll find interpretive
displays and a picnic area.</TE>

<HD>Graying Membership Puts a Chill on Ski Clubs</HD>
<DH>Group buying power and built-in camaraderie draw members,
but some clubs' numbers are dropping as skiers age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like tens of thousands of American skiers and snowboarders, I plan to
make the Presidents Day pilgrimage to the slopes next weekend. But
unlike many of them, I'll pay only $240 for my four-day trip,
including transportation, lodging and all meals except lunches. More
important, I'll be with friends.</LD>
<LD>   How do I do it? I belong to a ski club.</LD>
<LD>   My private, nonprofit club, Arriba!, geared to lesbians and gay
men in the Los Angeles area, has been around for more than 25 years,
members say. Besides the upcoming trip to Mammoth Mountain, it's
offering five other Mammoth trips this season, three out-of-state ski
trips, a week of skiing in Austria and a 10-night holiday open house
at Mammoth ($50 per person per night, Dec. 21 to 31).</LD>
<TE>   Group buying power helps keep the prices down, especially for
local destinations.</TE>
<TE>   I've noticed, though, that our club is getting grayer and smaller.
It has about 100 members; at one time it had 150 or so, long-timers
say. And when I attended a monthly meeting after a two-year absence,
I saw few new faces. My club is not unique in these respects.</TE>
<TE>   "Ski clubs are in a state of turbulence," says Terry Rowley,
president of the National Ski Council Federation, which includes 25
regional councils. Internet deals and the prevalence of low,
last-minute air fares are undercutting clubs' advantage on prices, he
says. As with other travel decisions these days, people seem less
willing or able to commit months in advance to trip dates , he adds.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to get statistics on membership because ski clubs are so
local and grass-roots. Rowley estimates that 300,000 skiers are
covered by his federation, which had 13 councils when it was founded
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Such councils may include "only a small fraction of the clubs that
exist," says Ed Knott, president of the Los Angeles Council of Ski
Clubs. Arriba!, for instance, is not among the 30 clubs that belong
to Knott's council; Saga, another group geared to gays in Southern
California, is a council member. Clubs formed at churches, schools or
workplaces may never join a council. (Those that do join may get
access to organized league racing, accident insurance at group rates
and the chance to share information, among other benefits, Knott
says.)</TE>
<TE>   Although Rowley says he thinks membership may be fairly stable
overall, Knott says, "I don't think the numbers [in ski clubs] nearly
approach the numbers of 10 or even 20 years ago." And participants
are "getting a little longer in the tooth," he says, estimating their
average age at mid- to late-40s.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs are graying partly because skiers are aging. Between
1990 and 2000, the median age of a downhill skier in the U.S. rose
from 26 to 30.1, according to the National Ski &amp; Snowboard Retailers
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the same period, the number of downhill skiers dropped from
11.4 million to 7.4 million, it reported. By comparison, the number
of snowboarders in the U.S. rose from 1.5 million to 4.3 million, and
their median age was 15.7 years, the survey found. Nearly 81% of
snowboarders are 24 or younger. In California, 40% or more of those
on the slopes may now be snowboarders, by some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   And snowboarders aren't joining ski clubs in large numbers to
replace the skiers who retire from the sport, Knott says, even though
some clubs have added "and snowboard" to their names. That's not
surprising, given the age difference alone.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, one club that focuses on snowboarding is
the Executive Board Snowboard Assn., which says it has about 30
members and is devoted to teaching snowboarding to youth.</TE>
<TE>   But if ski clubs take a powder, skiers will miss out on a range of
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the club, members may get discounted trips and gear,
access to ski resorts at peak holiday periods with no minimum-night
stays, the chance to race against other clubs, the option to pay for
trips in installments and the convenience of having someone else plan
the trip, Knott says. Many also offer year-round activities such as
hiking and theater- going.</TE>
<TE>   Some are more serious about skiing than others. Knott jokes of one
club: "They like to party a lot. They also like to ski occasionally."
Individual clubs in the U.S. may have from 20 to more than 5,000
members, Rowley says.</TE>
<TE>   Choices abound. On the Los Angeles council's roster there are
clubs for singles, skiers with disabilities, Asian Americans, African
Americans and aerospace workers. Most are nonprofit, with annual
memberships that average $40, Knott says.</TE>
<TE>   At the national level, the National Brotherhood of Skiers, geared
to African Americans, claims more than 14,000 members in more than 80
clubs. An often overlooked resource is the Sierra Club. Its Orange
County Sierra Singles section, for instance, offers weekend ski trips
to Mammoth for $195.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the No. 1 benefit of belonging to a ski club remains
camaraderie, clubbers say. "Most people, when they find the right
club, it becomes their second family," Rowley says.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley was interviewed as he was getting ready to leave
Albuquerque for a ski trip to Taos with an ad hoc ski club of 20 he
formed at work. He was looking forward to after-dinner schmoozing
with his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be lying--I mean, embellishing stories--about our great
jumps, falls and conquests that day," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Finding ski clubs can be difficult. It's often word of mouth
because many can't afford to advertise. Here is a sampling of some
resources on the Internet:</TE>
<TE>   * National Ski Council Federation, www.skifederation.org. Lists
contacts for regional ski councils and provides documents to help
form a club.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles Council of Ski Clubs, www.lacouncil.org. Has links
to sites of member clubs, including Saga.</TE>
<TE>   * National Brotherhood of Skiers, www.nbs.org. Lists clubs geared
to African Americans across the nation, including the Inglewood-based
Executive Board Snowboard Assn.</TE>
<TE>   * Arriba!, www.arribaski.org. Longtime L.A.-area club geared to
gay men and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   * Sierra Club, www.sierraclub.org. Known for its environmental
activism, this organization and its member chapters also sponsor
thousands of trips yearly, including cross-country and downhill ski
trips. Basic membership is $39 per person per year.</TE>

<HD>Into Kyushu's Mist, on a Budget</HD>
<DH>A trip to the southern island proves a fortune needn't be
spent to enjoy its riches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN JOHANNSEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NAGASAKI, Japan</DL>
<LD>"We are now traveling at 285 km/hour." I reached for the calculator
when I saw that startling announcement spooling by on the display in
our train. Japan, I determined, was racing past us at 176.7 mph. The
historic island of Kyushu whizzed by like a fast-forward video about
rice farms and train stations.</LD>
<LD>   My husband, Kevin, and I lived in Osaka from 1997 to 2000, but our
work schedules at a university left precious little time to explore
the country. So last October, armed with rail passes and hostel
information, we returned for a budget vacation to Kyushu, the
southernmost of Japan's four main islands. Kyushu is also the most
exotic, a fiery landscape of volcanoes, steam jets, hot springs and
boiling mud pools--a complete and welcome contrast to Osaka's urban
sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   "Japan on a budget" may sound like a contradiction in terms, but
it's quite possible. The country is notorious for high prices; a
tiny, stuffy room in a lower-end hotel can run $125 or more.</LD>
<TE>   But we found that careful planning made travel affordable. The
Japan Rail Pass, an extensive network of all-ages hostels and
family-run inns, and tourist information offices with
English-speaking staff all helped. Our prior knowledge of the country
may have made things easier, but it wasn't necessary.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived in Nagasaki, a city of about 450,000 near the island's
western tip, as a tropical storm threatened one evening. The city is
less than five hours away by train from Osaka, where we had spent
time with old friends, but it felt like a different country. We
dropped our bags at the hostel and set out to explore.</TE>
<TE>   As the two places where the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb, Nagasaki
and Hiroshima (on the neighboring island of Honshu) resonate with
World War II history. But as we soon learned, Nagasaki's story dates
back much further.</TE>
<TE>   On a tip from the tourist office, we walked up to Glover Garden at
sunset and watched the lights come on below us. Nagasaki climbs the
green mountainsides along a narrow ocean inlet. When the city was
reopened to European traders in 1859, they grabbed scenic locations
for their homes, and Scotsman Thomas Glover got one of the best, a
slope high above the harbor. His graceful tile-roofed bungalow forms
the centerpiece of a historical park preserving a romantic era in
Nagasaki history.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that Glover's marriage to a local geisha inspired
"Madama Butterfly," the tragic Puccini opera of love and loss, though
the marriage was long and apparently happy. Others believe that
Glover's house was merely used as the setting for the story.</TE>
<TE>   These Europeans were only the latest in a long succession of
foreign settlers. For centuries, Kyushu was Japan's window on the
world. From earliest history the Chinese traded here, and in the
mid-1500s Portuguese missionaries landed on the island, establishing
Nagasaki as an international port.</TE>
<TE>   The shogun expelled most foreigners in 1637, so Chinese and Dutch
traders allowed to stay in Nagasaki were Japan's only contact with
the outside world for more than 200 years. That left Nagasaki with an
international flavor that exists nowhere else in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   By morning the rain started. The massive red archway of Sofuku-ji,
a 17th century Chinese Zen temple, glowed in the rain. Even more
flamboyant was its inner gate, with tiers of ornate wooden bracketing
painted a dozen brilliant colors. Built in Ningbo, China, it was
transported to Nagasaki and reassembled. A 6-foot-tall iron caldron
in the courtyard shows the temple's central role in the Chinese
community. During a famine, monks cooked rice here to feed 3,000
people. Only in Nagasaki was Japan's close relationship with China
maintained, and the city still has an extensive Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the most famous date in Nagasaki's history is Aug. 9,
1945. At 11:02 a.m., a nuclear bomb detonated over the suburb of
Urakami, killing or injuring nearly two-thirds of Nagasaki's 240,000
residents, according to some estimates. Of all the heart-rending
exhibits we saw in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, two miles north
of downtown, what devastated me most was a simple display of clay
roof tiles that can be touched, their surface blistered.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the museum, the Peace Park abounds with uplifting
sculptures donated by different nations, and everywhere are strings
of 1,000 brightly colored origami cranes, a Japanese symbol of hope.
But the enormous Peace Statue of a man pointing skyward toward the
threat of another bomb was foreboding. At nightfall, as we walked the
19th century flagstone lanes of Dutch Slopes, a hillside of
Victorian-era European houses, I marveled again at how much the city
has preserved its past despite the atomic blast.</TE>
<TE>   The city's cosmopolitan roots also can be seen in its cuisine.
Portuguese influence is apparent in that quintessentially Japanese
dish, tempura, and bakeries still turn out a Portuguese cake called
kasutera, or castella. Nagasaki is more noted for Chinese-inspired
dishes, though. We stopped at a restaurant in Chinatown to sample
champon (sometimes called chanpon), a tasty mixture of thick noodles
with bits of pork, egg and seafood in broth.</TE>
<TE>   If Nagasaki is best described as an international city, Kumamoto
can be called pure Japanese. Our express train there, called the
Komame, was another Japanese marvel: black leather seats, parquet
floors and a vestibule in each car decorated with panels of
calligraphy in "ordinary" class. ("First class" and "second class"
strike the Japanese as unnecessarily blunt; "green car" and "ordinary
class" are the terms.)</TE>
<TE>   Kumamoto, a city of 630,000 about 150 miles by rail from Nagasaki,
was the seat of a powerful feudal lord who ruled from a hilltop
fortress. Though the tower of Kumamoto Castle is a modern
reconstruction, the original stone ramparts still stand, more than
three miles long and 30 feet high. They were built in 1601 without
mortar and were said to be so perfectly constructed that even a mouse
couldn't find a toehold.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, Suizenji Park hints at the wealth of the city's
feudal rulers, the Hosokawa family. The park originally was the
private garden of the Hosokawas' villa, where the lord could stroll
through miniature landscapes reproducing 53 scenic spots in Japan. We
walked in his footsteps, past exquisite dwarf trees, tiny lakes and
an instantly recognizable, 10-foot-tall Mt. Fuji made of earth and
grass.</TE>
<TE>   Urban Japan ends at Kumamoto, so no more speeding express trains.
Our cross-island local was a three-car diesel that chugged and
clanked across the wildest, greenest countryside we had seen in
Japan. Unbroken forest covered the mountainsides, while in the
valleys, bright pink spider amaryllis bloomed at the fringes of
ripening yellow rice fields.</TE>
<TE>   We were headed for Aso National Park, Kyushu's fiery heart. It's a
bit of a misnomer, since nowadays the mountain is actually a valley,
a crater 50 miles around, formed when Mt. Aso exploded 100,000 years
ago. At the center of the valley, five volcanoes later formed, one
still active. A plume of white smoke pours from the crater of Mt.
Nakadake, and its eruptions are so unpredictable that emergency
shelters have been built on the rim for sightseers.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan was to climb one of the mountains the next morning, so we
stopped for the night at the Aso Youth Hostel, about $20 per person.
The hostel's energetic housemother, Mrs. Shiotani, takes her
responsibilities seriously. Stuffing all the guests into her car, she
drove us down to the local supermarket, where leftover sushi and
sandwiches are marked down at 6 p.m., then browbeat an employee into
slapping half-price stickers on everything in sight. I feasted on my
dinner of cut-rate inari sushi in the hostel's homey TV lounge.</TE>
<TE>   Equipped with an English trail map, courtesy of the hostel, we set
out for the volcanoes the next morning. A path not far from the
hostel climbed through wind-swept pastures and lonely meadows, a
Japan I had never suspected.</TE>
<TE>   From the peak of Mt. Kijimadake, we hiked down to a broad, breezy
meadow called Kusasenri, "a thousand miles of grass." Across from it,
a tourist complex sprawls behind a parking lot with slots for 50
buses. Teenagers crowded around a stable of shaggy brown horses, and
I was surprised to discover they were paying $11 for a five-minute
horseback ride. A grassy field is apparently as much of a novelty as
a volcano.</TE>
<TE>   It was a long walk up and a longer walk down, leaving us stiff and
achy on the train that evening. We were ready for our final stop: the
hot-spring resort of Beppu.</TE>
<TE>   All of Kyushu is geologically active, but in Beppu, nature pulls
out all the stops. It looks like any touristy Japanese town until you
notice the steam rising everywhere--from manhole covers in alleys,
vents behind grocery stores, pipes in residents' flower beds.
Japanese travelers flock to relax at scores of hot-spring spas called
onsen, as well as scenic pools called jigoku (the word means "hells")
that are too torrid for bathing.</TE>
<TE>   Even our budget inn, Minshuku Kokage, featured a mineral bath on
the ground floor, and we took a soothing soak that night. But for the
full experience, we headed the next day to Hyotan Onsen, one of
Beppu's fanciest spas.</TE>
<TE>   How many ways can you cook yourself? I sampled the hot bath, the
extra-hot bath, the not-quite-so-hot bath. I tried the waterfall bath
(hot water pouring down from a bamboo pipe to pummel aching body
parts), the pebble bath (frigid water with rounded stones to walk
on), the steam bath (so hot I was blinded by sweat). I even tried the
sand bath. Wrapped in a thin cotton robe, I stretched out under a
foot of clean, hot volcanic sand, the classic pose of dads at the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all was the open-air bath. It was a quiet morning, and I
had it all to myself: the steaming pool of still water, the artfully
placed boulders where dragonflies sunned themselves, the deep blue
sky, the lacy red maple leaves rustling above the woven bamboo wall.
It's a testimony to my strength of character that I'm not still
sitting there.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Japan on the Cheap</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: The best way to fly from L.A. to Nagasaki involves
at least one change of planes. Varig flies to Nagoya, where Japan Air
System (JAS) or All Nippon (ANA) connects to Nagasaki. Varig also
flies to Tokyo, where JAS connects to Nagasaki. Restricted round-trip
fares begin at $1,252.</TE>
<TE>   United flies from LAX to San Francisco to Osaka, connecting on Air
Nippon to Nagasaki. Air Canada flies from L.A. to Vancouver, British
Columbia, to Osaka, connecting on Air Nippon to Nagasaki. Restricted
round-trip fares begin at $1,020.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code), 81 (country code for Japan) and the
local number.</TE>
<TE>   Getting around: The Japan Rail Pass is an excellent deal.
Seven-day adult pass for travel nationwide costs about $215;
seven-day pass valid for Kyushu only is about $152. (By comparison,
an hourlong trip by bullet train can cost more than $60.) Before
leaving home, travelers should buy a voucher, which can be exchanged
for a rail pass upon arrival in Japan. Several travel companies,
including JTB (www.jtb.co.jp/eng) and Kintetsu (www.kintetsu.com),
sell vouchers in the U.S.; details also available from the Japan
National Tourist Organization (contact information below).</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: During our budget trip we stayed at youth hostels,
which are open to travelers of all ages. Nagasaki Youth Hostel was
clean and comfortable though otherwise unremarkable. Dormitory-style
accommodations are about $22 per person, per night. 1-1-16 Tateyama,
Nagasaki 850-0007; 95-823-5032, fax 95-823-4321,
www2.ocn.ne.jp/~nyh/.</TE>
<TE>   Aso Youth Hostel offers dormitory accommodation (and kind

<HD>Is 'Freestyle' Cruising a Washout?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read with dismay the Jan. 20 Cruise Views column ("A New Star on
the Horizon"). A cruise is for adventure, good food, good weather,
the mystique of new lands and meeting and acquiring new friends. It
offers a chance to dress up and listen to good music and dinner table
discussions, to hold hands and watch the horizon. The ocean, not a
climbing wall, is what we come for.</LD>
<LD>   We have enjoyed 14 cruises in the past 25 years, but no more. The
advent of "freestyle" cruising has turned us off. Many cruise lines
seem to have lost their purpose and now serve fast foods and have no
assigned tables.</LD>
<LD>   Ships are catering to kids, who, after a couple of days of tearing
around, become disgruntled. The lines are charging in the restaurants
and allowing you to eat when you want. You might as well be at home.</LD>

<LD>Do not take your children to Las Vegas on a gambling trip. Despite
the recent hotel and casino industry propaganda, Las Vegas is not for
kids. There is nothing for them to do, and they get in the way of
adults who go there to take a break from family activities.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a safe place to let the tykes wander around by
themselves, and they have no business in casinos.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas is overrun with children, and it is annoying to the rest
of us who have a reason to be there. So leave the young'uns at
Grandma's, or hire a sitter, and enjoy the adult entertainment in Las
Vegas--without the kids.</LD>

<LD>As a lover of Peruvian cuisine, I find it interesting--no,
disturbing--that writer William Steigerwald chose to sample tacos and
Tony Roma's while in Lima, Peru ("In a Gray Light, Lima's Softer Side
Shines," Jan. 27). This makes about as much sense as dining on
lasagna and Sizzler while in Germany. He would have done a much
greater service to his readers--not to mention Peruvian chefs--had he
wandered into some of the world-class restaurants that have thrived
in Lima for the past 10 years.</LD>

<LD>Your article "Keeping Up With the Rules of the Visa Game" (Travel
Insider, Jan. 27) mentioned an Australian government Web site where
travelers can obtain an Electronic Travel Authority for approximately
$11. I was surprised that you failed to mention that ETAs can be
obtained free from the commercial carrier the traveler uses to enter
Australia. Most of them are part of the computerized network that is
used to obtain the ETA, and all the traveler has to do is provide
passport information when booking or ticketing passage.</LD>

<LD>Deloris St. John ("More Than Just Carsick Near Cairns," Letters, Feb.
3) complains about choppy seas on her Great Barrier Reef trip and
suggests that going to an island will solve that problem. When the
ocean is choppy, the viewing is poor whether you enter the water from
land or boat.</LD>
<LD>   We also took a boat to a pontoon last July, and we had a wonderful
time snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef. Luck and timing helped,
and, of course, checking the weather.</LD>
<LD>   We stayed in Cairns and enjoyed every minute.</LD>

<LD>Japan: The book "Water Walks in the Suburbs of Tokyo" (Tokyo on Foot,
2000) by Sumiko Enbutsu and Mimi LeBourgeois; and the store Good Day
Books, Ebisu 1-11-2-3F, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-0013; 011-813-5421-
0957, fax 011-813-5421- 0958. "'Water Walks' describes lovely
excursions into the older and lesser known part of Tokyo. The 14
walks range from one to four hours and include careful,
easy-to-follow directions for those who can't read Japanese. We
viewed parts of Tokyo that tourists rarely see. We found 'Water
Walks' at Good Day Books, adjacent to the Ebisu train station. The
store is a trove of English-language books about Japan--and about
everything else, since it allows travelers to trade in used books."</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: It's a view that is no more, from a landmark that no
longer exists. But in 1965, when Laguna Beach reader Adam Berestynski
was working in Kabul, Afghanistan, he and his wife crossed the Shibar
Pass and drove to the beautiful Bamian Valley, pictured above.
Berestynski scaled a heart-pounding path carved in rock and jumped
onto the head of an ancient, 175-foot statue of Buddha--the same one
that Taliban soldiers blew up in March. The statue, whose head is
visible at the bottom of Berestynski's shot, was one of two at the
site. Both works, which date to the 3rd and 5th centuries, were
reduced to rubble.</CP>

<LD>Some people just don't like to travel. At weddings and cocktail
parties they occasionally tell me so. I tilt my head and squint, as
if studying some strange organism in a petri dish. Then, as politely
as possible, I ask them why, even though the reasons are fairly
predictable: They hate long plane rides. Living out of a suitcase
makes them glum. Not being able to communicate in a foreign country
frustrates them. Or, like homesick kids at summer camp, they simply
can't stand to be away from home.</LD>
<LD>   None of it makes much sense to me because, next to veal chops and
the smell of autumn leaves, travel is what I like most. But when I
was in a sour mood recently, a few things I don't like about travel
occurred to me. The venting felt therapeutic. And the list kept
getting longer, so I broke my pet peeves into categories:</LD>
<LD>   * Other people's luggage: In line at airport check-in counters, it
irks me to see people standing amid a mountain of bags, boxes and
golf clubs. I check luggage, of course, but rarely more than one
piece, which is never too heavy for me to carry by myself. It isn't
that excess baggage slows the process at check-in, which it does, but
too much luggage is against the natural order of things. People who
overpack confuse traveling with relocating.</LD>
<TE>   It's generally the same sorts who plug up the lines at airport
security checkpoints by being disorganized and walking through the
metal detectors with handbags on their shoulders or keys in their
pockets.</TE>
<TE>   I can't stand oblivious backpackers who bang you with their packs
and travelers who steer their wheeled luggage over your toes. People
seem quite keen on bags with wheels, but licenses should be required
to use them.</TE>
<TE>   * Air travel: Admittedly, there's not a lot that's pleasant about
air travel these days. For this reason, people should do their part
to make it endurable, including those who hog the elbow rests and
legroom in coach class (mostly men, I'm sorry to say, unfamiliar with
the concept of personal space).</TE>
<TE>   Especially irritating are the people who unfasten their seat belts
and leave their seats before the proper time at the end of a flight,
as if getting their carry-on bags and disembarking were some kind of
race. Maybe they have tight connections, but I'm pretty sure most of
them are New Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   I don't like the way everyone crowds the gate when boarding begins
either. They should take a load off because, in most cases, boarding
proceeds by row number. Is that concept so hard to understand?</TE>
<TE>   * Hotels: Arrogant hotel staff members who guard the front doors
of fancy hotels as if they were monitoring the Mona Lisa really get
my goat. I also don't like hotels with beds that lack fitted bottom
sheets. Who can sleep on a bunch of wrinkles? And shouldn't every
hotel room be equipped with a coffee maker? Those that lack them are
part of an international conspiracy to make guests spend $10 for
coffee from room service, which never arrives soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   I'm perfectly happy to stay in hotel rooms with shared baths. But
I really hate having to get up and plod down the hall in the middle
of the night to use them.</TE>
<TE>   * Bathrooms: I detest the way the lines at women's restrooms are
always longer than those at men's. It points to a fundamental
difference between the sexes that has helped to subjugate women. In
airport bathrooms it bothers me that water tends to collect around
the sinks so you can't put your purse or makeup bag down without
getting it wet. And I hate having to use air dryers instead of paper
towels after washing my hands, even though I know air dryers are more
hygienic.</TE>
<TE>   I can handle dirty bathrooms, but the filthy ones make me
concerned about the future of the human race. These can be found
anywhere--at gas stations on American interstates and in New York
delis. Still, the worst I ever encountered was on the Punjab Mail, a
train I took in India on my way from New Delhi to the Himalayas.
Travelers need to stay hydrated, but I stopped drinking water so I
wouldn't have to use the unspeakably awful loo. The Indians on board
were smarter. When the train stopped, which it did incessantly, they
climbed down from the coach and heeded the call of Mother Nature
outside by the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   * Jet lag: Those surreal days and sleepless nights after a long
flight are purgatorial. I do all the rights things to assuage jet
lag. I never drink alcohol on long plane trips. I practice yoga and
meditation. I travel with prescription sleeping pills and try to
adjust to the time in my destination as soon as I can. But maybe the
Creator wanted us to stay in one place. There's no getting around jet
lag, I've found.</TE>
<TE>   * My things: It irritates me that I've left sunglasses, watches
and travel alarms all around the world. Also, after awhile on the
road, I can't stand my clothes.</TE>
<TE>   * People: I detest people with colds on planes; parents who don't
control their children on planes, trains, buses and, especially, in
swimming pools; women who dress inappropriately in conservative
places; pedestrians who wait for walk lights at intersections when
there are no vehicles in sight (this seems to be common in Canada);
shutterbugs who see the great sights only through the lens of a
camera; foreigners who complain about Americans; and Americans who
behave badly in foreign lands.</TE>
<TE>   I could go on, but I'll stop. When I get grumpy like this, it
means I need to travel.</TE>

<HD>A City at War With Itself</HD>
<DH>Joseph Tovares turned detective to document L.A.'s 1943
clashes for 'Zoot Suit Riots,' airing on PBS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Zoot Suit Riots," a new PBS "American Experience," is the first
major documentary about the 1943 riots that took place in Los
Angeles, pitting young Mexican American men--then known for wearing
baggy-pant zoot suits--against members of the armed forces and
civilians who considered the youths not only unpatriotic, but also
enemies of the country.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions ran high in wartime Los Angeles. At the same time,
Mexican American youths were rebelling against the tight-knit,
conservative neighborhoods where they lived, adopting jazz phrases
and wearing clothes inspired by African Americans. Their parents
feared they would become pachucos, or punks, and many whites found
the zoot-suiters a prime example of what was wrong with the city.</LD>
<LD>   It was in this atmosphere that 19-year-old Hank Leyvas sought
revenge in August 1942, after he and his girlfriend were beaten up. A
brawl ensued at a party near a spot called the Sleepy Lagoon, and
Jose Diaz, 22, was found dying. Within 48 hours, the police arrested
600 young Mexican Americans, and Leyvas and 21 others were indicted
for Diaz's murder.</LD>
<TE>   At the largest mass trial in the state's history, 17 of the 38th
Street boys, as the defendants were known, were found guilty.
Violence ensued between sailors and zoot-suiters in the months that
followed, peaking in the bloody riots of June 1943.</TE>
<TE>   The trial had been so tainted, however, that the Sleepy Lagoon
Defense Committee--which attracted the support of
Hollywood--successfully appealed the case, and Leyvas and his friends
were released in October 1944. Leyvas died in 1971, and the Diaz
murder remains officially unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Joseph Tovares wrote and produced "Zoot Suit Riots,"
which is narrated by Hector Elizondo. Tovares recently discussed the
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Question: This is the first major documentary on the zoot suit
riots. Why has it taken so long?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: First, remember, in terms of documentaries, serious
documentaries, there is very little having to do with Latinos to
begin with. I think it is a very difficult story. It is a very
complicated story, and it's a very difficult story for people in L.A.
I think a lot of people would just as soon forget about it.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons you'll notice from the film is that there are
virtually no images of the riot. It's a very difficult task with not
a lot of resources to really pull if off. You need money to conduct
the research and come up not with just some images you can use but
really track down the participants. It took an enormous effort to
find some of these folks who are on camera, especially the sailors,
and find an image of Jose Diaz. The murder victim was essentially
forgotten, lost. There was no picture of him.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you acquire a photo of Diaz?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was good, old-fashioned research--almost detective work--and
some luck.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think the zoot suit riots would have occurred if the
United States was not at war?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think it would have been very different. I think it was a
very unique time in L.A. history. You had the war putting a lot of
stress on the community. And in one way, because a lot of men were
gone to fight the war, the economy created by the war had created all
of these jobs, so you had all of these people of color coming in.
L.A. really saw itself on the front line of the war with Japan.
People in L.A. were expecting an attack any time. So there was this
incredible apprehension, and people were looking for an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The year before, the Japanese had been taken away, and they needed
another enemy. The fear of immigration probably increased in wartime,
and we have always had a problem with assertive young people of
color. How do we deal with them? People are supposed to know their
place, especially in 1942 and '43, and these kids weren't going to
accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You state in the documentary that most of the Sleepy Lagoon
defendants ended up back in prison.</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know if all, but most were in and out of prison. There
was a lot of drug use. It is not a good story. It really marked them
for life. You have to remember also--and we have to be honest
here--some of these guys were pretty tough guys going in. Hank
Leyvas--there is a line we cut out because of time--but someone said
that Hank was respected but feared. They were not altar boys. They
were tough guys, but this experience really made it worse.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Hank died in an East L.A. bar in 1971. What did he die of?</TE>
<TE>   A: The family says that he had a heart attack in a phone booth
inside a bar, but rumor has it that he did of a heroin overdose. Hank
did not do well.</TE>
<TE>   "American Experience: Zoot Suit Riots" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on
KCET and KVCR. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for

<LD>Re "Wade: Right Choice for D.A.," Editorial, Feb. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations to The Times. At last, after 17 months of
internally generated warnings, we have a public voice for what is an
extremely important issue for the hard-working citizens of Orange
County. Up to now, this has been a scandal below the radar screen of
most citizens.</LD>
<LD>   For most people, their only contact with the D.A. is when called
to serve jury duty. Yet the elected prosecutor is the most important
official in county government. He or she wields awesome, yet
well-established, powers. The prosecutor must fairly ensure
prosecution of the guilty and defense of the innocent. That duty to
prosecute fairly requires the uniform application of justice. But
that fundamental obligation has escaped our incumbent first-term
district attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Whether we're talking about badges for political supporters at
$5,000 a pop, or personally circumventing the assigned senior trial
deputy in the case of a major political campaign supporter, the net
result is the creation of a two-tiered system of justice in Orange
County. Every newly hired deputy prosecutor knows that when there is
a close connection to a subject, the potential conflict-of-interest
requires recusal.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone I know would like to have a Rackauckas badge to flash at
the CHP officer if we're pulled over for speeding on the freeway. But
everybody doesn't get one, do they? And not only is that obviously
unfair, but of longer-term significance, what does that law
enforcement officer think as he or she walks back to the patrol car
about the stature and credibility of the district attorney's office?</TE>
<TE>   Do you know someone who is an Orange County deputy district
attorney? We are very committed to representing our client, the
people of California. Did Rackauckas think we would all just close
our eyes or roll over while he whittled away the integrity of an
office that so many of us have committed our professional lives to
build and continue? Just so an ambitious politician could build a
springboard to the next political office? That's not what you pay
your taxes for.</TE>

<TE>   I am a senior assistant district attorney. I have been appointed
to the Superior Court bench and will soon be leaving the district
attorney's office. But before I leave, I would like to set the record
straight on my boss, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. Let's not forget
the man we elected by 63% of the vote in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Our district attorney was a prosecutor for 16 years; several of
those years he spent handling homicides and was well-respected. He
took a year off without pay to unseat a state Supreme Court justice
who was overturning all death penalty cases. He was successful and
well-respected for that. After that, Rackauckas was a judge in Orange
County for nine years. Again, he was well-respected for those years
of public service.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has done an excellent job of setting priorities. He has
given our prosecutors much-needed resources to combat crime and
secure convictions in the thousands of cases we see every year. He
created our felony charging unit and expanded our gang and
environmental crime units. He has rewarded our hard-working and
underpaid clerical staff with additional benefits. He has put his
trust in our prosecutors and allowed them to do the right thing on
criminal cases. He has created community outreach to minority groups
in order to instill trust in our justice system. He has created and
honored programs geared toward guiding youth to stay out of gangs and
crime. Rackauckas is an honest, efficient and ethical district
attorney who cares about the safety of our county.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad that Rackauckas' opponent has dredged up baseless
allegations in a smear campaign. Let's stick to the facts and look at
the qualifications of each candidate. Remember, those who have no
substantial qualifications often resort to attacking their opponent
to disguise their own shortcomings.</TE>

<TE>   Is Shirking Its Duties</TE>
<TE>   Re "Stirring Up the Water," Editorial, Feb. 3:</TE>
<TE>   I agree that the Orange County Sanitation District should not be
taking on urban runoff when it is not fulfilling its original mandate
to clean the sewage produced from toilets. The district has a waiver
that excuses it from full treatment of sewage. It should give up the
waiver and treat all sewage to full secondary standards before adding
urban runoff. We would like to be able to swim in the ocean knowing
it's free of sewage.</TE>

<TE>   Throwing away data and monitoring equipment that indicate a

on to its $550-million reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The turbidity analyzer may have not been required, but that's not
a good excuse to throw it away.</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon for the district to throw out "anomalously high
values" from their data so that their statistical mean will look
better on paper.</TE>
<TE>   It's obvious that the turbidity meter wasn't the first thing to be
thrown out just because it didn't show what the district wanted.
Thrown-out data and equipment are just ways to avoid using reserves
for the intended purpose: treating the sewage.</TE>

<HD>Financial Position of 91 Express Lanes Owner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Right Route for the 91," Editorial, Jan. 27:</LD>
<LD>   The Times erroneously speculated regarding the financial condition
of our company's franchise. Public documents show that California
Private Transportation Co.'s toll revenue grew from $7million in 1996
to $21million in 2000. And we will soon report that 2001 was the
company's best year ever, with revenue significantly exceeding
2000's.</LD>
<LD>   The 91 Express Lanes reached operating break-even in its third
month of operation and achieved positive cash flow in its third year
of operation. Any financial expert will tell you that these are
extraordinary accomplishments for an infrastructure project of this
size and nature.</LD>
<TE>   In July, CPTC substantially improved the 91 Express Lanes' short
and long-term profitability by refinancing the facility's original
construction debt with AAA-rated toll revenue bonds, taking advantage
of lower interest rates. The refinancing would have been impossible
if we were in "financial difficulty."</TE>
<TE>   By providing significant benefits to customers, the 91 Express
Lanes enjoy customer loyalty and significant market share. Today,
more than 50% of commuters who regularly travel the Riverside Freeway
through Santa Ana Canyon have FasTrak transponders.</TE>
<TE>   It was OCTA that approached our company regarding the potential
purchase of the 91 Express Lanes franchise, not the other way around.
We have pledged to meet with OCTA regarding its interest, even though
we are not pursuing a sale. If these discussions are to be
productive, they will need to focus on delivering a result that
benefits both CPTC and OCTA; one that is based on the full economic
value of the business and considers the interests of our customers,
employees and investors.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lido Man Seeks Separation of Church, Beach Parking," Jan. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Just when we thought Newport Beach newsmakers couldn't get any
more trivial, along comes the vigilante meter man from Lido Isle
(John Nelson) who believes it is his constitutional duty to see that
parking meters are duly enforced during church services on the Balboa
Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   Somebody please tell me that this man suffers from an
obsessive-compulsive disorder and doesn't actually believe that this
is what our forefathers meant by "separation of church and state."
Unlike Nelson, the brilliant minds that drafted our Constitution
entertained a vision called "the big picture."</LD>

this, especially, on Sunday morning? Aren't you fearful of divine
vengeance?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Role of Class Size in Success Unclear," Feb. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Go ahead and debate the value of class-size reduction, but the
fact remains that California's schools have the most students per
teacher in the nation. I teach upper elementary school and have had
30 to 36 students every year for 25 years. It should be obvious that
having fewer students results in more personal and effective teaching
and learning. Instead of considering increasing class size even more,
we should be asking why California won't fund and staff schools at
least at the national average. After all, it's not the testing that's
been improving our students' academic performance. It's the teaching.</LD>

<TE>   For the hour that I am working with these children, I am
overwhelmed with trying to help meet the needs of such a large number
of students and at the same time trying to keep the attention of the
group.</TE>
<TE>   I invite you to visit a kindergarten classroom and volunteer for a
while. After a brief experience, I am sure you will walk away with a
new appreciation for kindergarten teachers.</TE>

<HD>Read 218's Lips: No New Assessments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EUNICE CLUCK</AU>
<BD>Eunice Cluck is president of Irvine Taxpayers.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up and down the state, politicians and bureaucrats were wringing
their hands. Their ever-flowing magic wallet had snapped shut.
Proposition 13 had cut off unbridled tax increases. "You poor dears,"
Big Governmenters whispered in their ears, "we'll think of
something."</LD>
<LD>   And think of something, they did. It's called assessments. The
politicians were joyous. Instead of tax, tax, tax, it was assess,
assess, assess.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. came to the rescue with
Proposition 218, closing Proposition 13's loopholes by limiting the
authority of local governments and making them review how they were
collecting money. But politicians are a wily bunch. They read and
reread Proposition 218 to find a loophole to the two-thirds-vote
requirement for special taxes. "All we have to do," they jubilantly
shouted, "is call it an assessment! We'll say that all city
services--landscaping, parks, park lighting, street lights, etc.--are
'special benefits' to property owners. Everything is a 'special
benefit.' We'll get the money we would otherwise have to spend and
blow it on whatever we want!"</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 218 says assessments are allowed only if they provide
a "special benefit" (for example, street lighting would be required
to provide substantial illumination on a particular property), not a
general benefit to the public or a general increase in property
values. The bugaboo is whether a service should be classified as a
"special tax" that provides benefits to the general public and
requires a two-thirds vote of all local voters or an assessment
providing a special benefit to particular parcels and requiring a
majority approval of property owners by a weighted vote.</TE>
<TE>   A weighted vote means that votes depend on the number of parcels
owned. The fee for the special benefit must be billed on a
parcel-by-parcel basis.</TE>
<TE>   But Irvine is using a flat amount for every parcel on a public
residential street throughout the city. It's currently $41.05, and
the proposed increase is to $103.51.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 5, 2001, the California Supreme Court addressed the
general versus special benefit issue of Proposition 218, stating that
to earn the special-benefit tag, an assessment had to be for
particular and distinct benefits over benefits to the general public.
Enhancement of general property values was not sufficient. The court
concluded, "If everything is special, nothing is special."</TE>
<TE>   To explain what is happening in California cities, look at Irvine.
Normally, park maintenance, landscaping and street lighting is
financed by special taxes requiring a two-thirds vote. In a
compromise five years ago, Irvine voted to finance this by an
assessment to end this July. Instead of letting it die, Irvine is
mailing 35,498 ballots to Irvine property owners on Feb. 15, for
approval of an almost threefold increase. Irvine says parks and
lighting are a "special benefit" to property owners, which allows
them to call this an assessment requiring only a majority vote.
Admitting that street lights and parks benefit the general public
would require two-thirds approval.</TE>
<TE>   In assessment elections, ballots go only to property owners and
are allocated by the number of lots owned. I own one lot, therefore I
get one vote. The Irvine Co. owns 1,352 parcels, and gets therefore
1,352 votes. Cities realize that ordinary residents can be outvoted
if land owned by the city and big landowners is assigned enough
votes.</TE>
<TE>   In the Irvine election, almost half the votes will be controlled
by the city and developers and big landowners, including the Irvine
Co., Irvine Apartment Communities, Koll Center, Lakeshore Properties,
Spieker Properties, Jamboree LLC, Oak Tree Realty, Metropolitan Life,
AXA Advisors and ERP Operating Limited.</TE>
<TE>   Because developers and big landowners are dependent on the city
for building permits and approval of their projects, it is likely
they will vote for the city's position, especially considering that
landlords can pass on increases to tenants and developers won't be
paying the tax, purchasers will.</TE>
<TE>   Increases like this are devastating to many senior citizens and
families on limited incomes. Although Irvine calls it an
"assessment," it is an unending, upwardly spiraling tax increase that
will be added to the property tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it is double taxation. About two-thirds of Irvine
residents live in homeowners associations whose assessments already
fund most Irvine landscaping. Not only is this Irvine election
process unfair, the increase is unnecessary and greedy. Parks and
lighting costs have not tripled. Irvine is awash in money, running a
large surplus. The assessment is estimated to bring in $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation for cities such as Irvine to use the assessment
classification to shift costs from the general fund to the taxpayer
is to provide a never-ending cash flow, thus freeing up money to be
used for pet projects. California cities should be cutting taxes, not
raising them--shrinking government, not expanding. They should be
honest and submit tax increases to a two-thirds vote of all
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   What can the beleaguered taxpayer do?</TE>
<TE>   Challenge classifying assessments like landscaping, park
maintenance and park lighting as "special benefit assessments"
requiring only majority vote when they should be special taxes
requiring a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   Go to city council meetings. In the case of Irvine, telephone
those big landowners and tell them to vote "no."</TE>

<HD>Class-Size Reduction Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES A. FLEMING</AU>
<BD>James A. Fleming is superintendent of Capistrano
Unified School District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1996, then-Gov. Pete Wilson proposed, and the Legislature
approved, the Class Size Reduction Program, one of the most
significant educational reform initiatives in the country. The
program took the lowest four grades in elementary school, a time when
children's minds are the most fertile for learning, and greatly
reduced the number of students per classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Before 1996, kindergarten through third-grade classes averaged 31
students. In a bold move, Wilson proposed that class sizes in those
grades be reduced to no more than 20 students. This meant that
teachers would have more time to provide individual attention to
students.</LD>
<LD>   When class-size reduction was first implemented, the state did not
pay the full cost. Wilson wanted local school districts to make a
conscious decision to apply to participate and to pay a portion of
the cost out of their local discretionary budget. During the first
year, the Capistrano Unified School District assumed 10% of the cost,
with the state picking up the rest. Because of how financing was
structured, however, today the district assumes 24% of the cost, with
its local percentage share continuing to rise each year.</LD>
<TE>   The ever-increasing gap between the state's share and the actual
costs that districts must assume exists because, when the program
started nearly six years ago, districts throughout California hired
thousands of new teachers. As those "beginning" teachers gained years
of experience, they also received automatic salary increases.</TE>
<TE>   In Capistrano Unified, for example, for their first 12 years of
experience, teachers receive automatic annual increases of about
3.5%. Through collective bargaining, the district then grants all
teachers a general raise, an increase that is in addition to the
"step" increments already built in for less-experienced teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that the payroll costs to support those who
provide the services for class-size reduction are accelerating at a
higher rate than the very nominal increases that the state funds.</TE>
<TE>   To appreciate a second problem, it must be understood that all
funding to support schools in California comes directly from the
state. Unlike most other states in our nation, California school
districts have no ability to generate any portion of their operating
revenue independently.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amount of money school districts receive from the
state is increasing significantly each year, a growing amount of that
funding is earmarked by the state, which specifies how it must be
spent. With dwindling discretionary dollars received by school
boards, the ability of districts to assume their increasing local
share of class-size reduction costs is greatly compromised.</TE>
<TE>   As an illustration, in 2001-02, districts receive an additional
$888 for every student involved in class-size reduction. In the
governor's proposed budget for 2002-03, that figure is to increase a
modest $19. Meanwhile, the cost to enroll students in class-size
reduction classes in Capistrano Unified is $1,255 per student. This
adds up to $3.6 million in out-of-pocket expenses for our district.
With fewer discretionary dollars, it becomes more and more difficult
to assume this additional cost unless other parts of the budget are
cut.</TE>
<TE>   The slow demise of class-size reduction is sad for the youngest
children in California schools. In some ways, it is a natural but
unfortunate result of the political process. Class-size reduction was
the cornerstone education initiative of Wilson. Gov. Gray Davis,
elected in 1998, has his own initiatives. These initiatives include
such things as technology enhancement, child nutrition, the high
school exit exam, charter-school block grants, professional
development institutes run by the University of California, and four
types of bonus programs to teachers whose students perform well on
the State Accountability Program.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Davis wishes to concentrate on fully supporting the
success of his own initiatives, rather than ensuring the sustained
viability of a program begun by his predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   As class-size reduction costs grow higher and discretionary
funding continues to decrease, many districts have had to make cuts
to support their portion. At Capistrano Unified, we recently
eliminated elementary library clerks. We also increased class size in
grades four through 12. You can make cuts in other programs only for
so long, however. One logical way to salvage class-size reduction
might be for the governor and Legislature to defer some of their
projects to allow districts to use this funding to keep some class
sizes small.</TE>
<TE>   If something drastic doesn't happen soon, I fear that one of the
most significant educational reform initiatives this country has seen
will die a slow but certain death.</TE>

<HD>Times' Picks for Judges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most difficult decisions voters face is deciding how to
vote in judicial races, especially in instances where no incumbent
judge is on the ballot with a record of service and perhaps name
recognition.</LD>
<LD>   As a rule, most voters are in the dark in such low-visibility
contests. Never mind knowing anything about the candidates; voters
very often don't even know who they are.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called contests for election as judge to Superior Court
often aren't truly races at all. Campaigning is minimal. There are
usually no specific legal issues in dispute. The attorneys seeking
judgeships don't run scorched-earth campaigns or trash each other, as
candidates for other public offices do. They are legal professionals
in nonpartisan races that usually draw campaign funds only from
friends, relatives and the candidate's own bank account. Even some
judges and many other attorneys are equally unsure about who may be
best qualified.</LD>
<TE>   That describes the situation in the March 5 election, in which 11
candidates are seeking to replace four retiring judges.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a fifth contest not visible on the ballot. It's a
write-in campaign launched after filings closed to unseat an
incumbent judge now facing criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Although many voters may not be too familiar with everyone on the
ballot, they generally know what qualities they want their judges to
have. All surely will be looking for someone who is fair,
independent, knows the law and has integrity, compassion, patience,
experience, a solid record of performance, the proper judicial
temperament and the ability to see the issue and make a decision.
And, of course, a judge should have good judgment.</TE>
<TE>   To help voters make an informed decision on the most qualified
candidates for the open seats, we interviewed all of them. We also
checked with others in the court system in a position to evaluate the
candidates' qualifications and potential. As a result, we found the
following candidates best qualified and urge their election to
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Menninger, Office No. 3: In 14 years in the district
attorney's office, she has prosecuted gang members and murderers, and
launched and overseen a truancy response program designed to keep
children in school and out of trouble. Menninger is a supervisor in
charge of the Harbor Justice Center in Newport Beach. Outside of the
courtroom she is active working with at-risk children. She has the
legal knowledge and solid judgment that has won her strong backing
from judges and the law enforcement community. We, too, urge her
election.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Jensen, Office No. 8: A former "Outstanding Prosecutor" of
the year selected by the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District
Attorneys, Jensen can bring a varied court background to the bench.
He is assigned to the Adult Gang Unit of the district attorney's
office, but for three years he investigated and tried cases involving
both civil and criminal violations of environmental law. His range of
experience and sensitivity to the rights of both victims and
defendants make him a good choice for judge.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Mac Eachern, Office No. 22: Judges should have extensive
trial experience, and no one in the district attorney's office, and
perhaps few out of it, have tried as many cases in Orange County as
she has in her 20 years as prosecutor. Mac Eachern has specialized in
prosecuting child abuse and domestic violence cases, but also
recognizes the need for treatment facilities and rehabilitation. She
faces a tough challenge from another deputy district attorney, but
Mac Eachern is easily the most qualified of the three seeking the
open seat. She has the best judicial temperament and would be fair
and impartial. We strongly support her election.</TE>
<TE>   Glenda Sanders, Office No. 27: The contest for this open seat has
a field of strong candidates, but Sanders is the best choice. Her
extensive experience in both civil and criminal law makes her so. So
does her proven ability to understand complex legal issues and bring
opposing sides to common ground and reach a settlement. She has a
feeling for both the letter of the law and the spirit and humanity of
it. She knows the law, and teaches it as well. She can bring to the
Superior Court bench much-needed experience in complex civil law and
business cases.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders is the most impressive candidate seeking a seat on the
Superior Court bench in Orange County this election and should be an
outstanding judge.</TE>
<TE>   We are not making an endorsement in Office No. 21 in the write-in
campaign to unseat Judge Ronald C. Kline. He faces federal and state
criminal charges for allegedly molesting a child and possessing child
pornography. No one filed to run against him before the deadline, so
he is running unopposed on the ballot. But nine candidates have taken
out papers to wage write-in campaigns to unseat him. The deadline for
filing papers and being certified as an official write-in candidate
is Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The write-in route is probably the toughest way to win an
election. But that shouldn't discourage voters from trying to unseat
Kline.</TE>
<TE>   The list of official write-in candidates will be available at each
polling place. Voters should ask to see the list, write the name of
their choice as it appears on the list on the blank line under Judge
Kline's name--and be sure to punch out the ballot square at the end
of that line to record the vote.</TE>
<TE>   For the four other judicial races, recording a vote is easier.
Just punch the ballot squares after the names of Kimberly Menninger,
Lance Jensen, Kelly Mac Eachern and Glenda Sanders.</TE>

<HD>Chris Norby for Supervisor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The political pundit who first counseled against changing horses in
midstream obviously never tried to get the political horses on the
Board of Supervisors more in step with the electorate.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, such a change is a difficult maneuver, but we think
voters in the 4th District ought to make it. There is only one
supervisorial seat being contested March 5, and it provides an
opportunity for needed change. And so we recommend Fullerton
Councilman Chris Norby as the new 4th District representative.</LD>
<LD>   It's not an endorsement we make lightly. We recognize the
political reality of how difficult it is to defeat a well-financed
incumbent. But we believe Norby's 17-year record of city council and
regional government service make him a strong challenger. Most
important is our belief that he is best able to provide certain
qualities of leadership that have been missing in incumbent
Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad's term of office.</LD>
<TE>   Coad, the current board chairwoman, has come to represent the
intransigence and alienation of the board from many it is supposed to
serve. She is pleasant and good on some local community redevelopment
and policing activities. But with his broad experience, questioning
mind and sense of the big picture, Norby really is much better suited
for the regional leadership position of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's needless lawsuit against a doctor involved in a health-care
initiative turned off a lot of people; she and two colleagues
stubbornly blocked a popular measure that would ensure tobacco
settlement money went for medical needs. She also made a minority
vote to appeal the court decision that rejected the board's lawsuit
seeking to overturn the public vote supporting medical spending.</TE>
<TE>   She could have taken a much more inclusive and conciliatory
approach on the controversial El Toro base reuse question when it
became evident that the board majority was out of step with the
public, even with some who back some kind of aviation use.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where district residents stand on El Toro, they
should look at the broader need for strong, independent and more
visionary leadership. This is a board governed largely by a majority
of three--Coad, Chuck Smith and Jim Silva--that has walked too much
in lock-step and needs shaking up.</TE>
<TE>   With Supervisor Todd Spitzer's likely departure from the board
after the November election, if he is elected, as expected, to the
State Assembly, there is no telling what the new board makeup will
ultimately be, or indeed how a future board majority will line up on
the airport issue. But Spitzer has provided the board with
independence and a willingness to question assumptions and provide
fresh thinking. The board needs someone to stir the pot on a range of
issues that come before county government, and Norby can provide that
kind of style.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Norby will have to deal with the aftermath of the El
Toro vote, either airport or park. While he favors the park, and sees
it as a big issue, it's not his biggest concern. Whatever the outcome
of the vote on Measure W, and whatever comes of the
airport-versus-park debate, Norby promises to be far less rigid in
finding the solutions on this and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   As a councilman he has at times been contentious, and depending on
which side of the issue you were on, either stubborn or steadfast.
But he also has shown an independent streak that doesn't make him a
go-along-to-get-along type of public official. Facts and logic sway
him.</TE>
<TE>   The county board needs questioning, thoughtful, energetic and
independent leadership. It needs representatives with a keen
understanding of government and its countywide and regional, as well
as district, needs. It needs someone like Chris Norby, and we urge
his election.</TE>

<LD>Re "Runway or Walkway? Measure W to Decide," Commentary, Feb. 3:</LD>
<LD>   In their continued misguided effort to promote an unneeded,
unwanted and unsafe airport at El Toro, Stan Oftelie of the Orange
County Business Council and Reed Royalty of the Orange County
Taxpayers Assn. offer one more example of the "sky is falling"
alarmist mentality of the pro-airport faction.</LD>
<LD>   Their article contends that Orange County's "explosive growth"
over the last 20 years demands an airport at El Toro. They neglect to
point out that even with that growth, John Wayne Airport, in its
restricted capacity, has more than adequately handled the county's
demand for passenger service.</LD>
<TE>   John Wayne usage consistently has remained stable at well under
its capped capacity for several years, and Orange County is
anticipated to grow very slightly over the next 20 years. With John
Wayne currently operating at only 78% of the 9.8-million annual
passenger cap restriction proposed by Newport Beach, it is clear that
it can handle all of Orange County's needs well into the future.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, if Oftelie and the Business Council's solution to job
creation in this county is $6-an-hour baggage handlers and service
workers who will have to commute from Riverside County, further
congesting those thoroughfares, then we have a serious problem with
our county's business leadership. But then again, low wages do mean
higher profits for the wealthy entrepreneurs who will benefit from an
airport at El Toro. Maybe this explains whose "quality of life"
Oftelie and Royalty are really concerned about.</TE>
<TE>   I urge all voters to vote "yes" on Measure W, for your future and
your children's future.</TE>

<TE>   A majority "no" vote on Measure W on March 5 will bring to Orange
County a 21st century airport. An airport will bring thousands of
jobs and promote economic growth, something the county needs.</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union message, President Bush reminded us how
critical it is to revive the economy, and he said the way to grow the
economy is to grow jobs. An airport at El Toro would do just that. An
airport at El Toro would create more jobs than any other option,
directly and indirectly very important to both small and large
businesses. I think the president meant to include Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs are critical to one's standard of living and quality of life.
An airport at El Toro would create thousands of jobs of all types and
pay scales, critical to people buying homes, making mortgage
payments, paying rents, paying bills and ensuring property values
will be maintained.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who are silent on the matter or who have expressed
the opinion that an airport at El Toro would have little impact on
jobs or that jobs are really not that important to people in Orange
County. For example, it seems the Irvine Co. is more concerned about
extending and promoting its historic legacy of the Irvine Ranch and
probably would deny that an airport at El Toro has greater
long-lasting benefit to Orange County. So it remains silent.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland has said an airport at El Toro would have no
significant impact on its tourism business. It's hard to figure that
one out. There are congressional, state, county and city leaders as
well as academics and media types who spin the anti-airport at El
Toro sentiment. Even the ex-Los Angeles mayor and gubernatorial
candidate, Richard Riordan, recently returned to Orange County to
confess he was wrong three years ago when he then viewed an airport
at El Toro as necessary. Today he says an airport at El Toro is not
necessary. Yet he campaigns that jobs are important.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W fails to clearly tell the taxpaying voter what it stands
for and what the consequences of a "yes" vote would be. Measure W
should not have been presented to voters in its current form. I doubt
it would pass judicial review, should it be tested, because of this
lack of clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County will pay dearly for its inattentive concern if it
passes Measure W in its present form, in terms of time and millions
of tax dollars. The taxpayers of Orange County can prevent this from
happening by voting "no" on Measure W.</TE>

<TE>   As I read the commentaries on both sides, I found a few comments
to be disturbing. The pro-airport article refers to this past year's
utility crisis, national defense and Sept. 11. Is this done to put
fear in the anti-airport faction? Then there's the reference to
former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Could there be a more blatant
attempt to imply his endorsement of an airport and to capitalize on
his popularity? Please stop the posturing. The taxpaying residents of
Orange County will tell everybody soon enough what they do or do not
want.</TE>

<TE>   Our "war against terror" has revived a significant truth: The same
information can be seen very differently depending on who presents
it. In Orange County's big El Toro controversy, the information about
the airport versus the Great Park is so contradictory it is difficult
for a neutral observer to know what to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, it is best to judge each piece of information by who is
giving it. For instance, at the end of the two commentaries, The
Times provided information on the authors. The pro-airport view was
from Stan Oftelie, president of the Orange County Business Council,
and Reed Royalty, president of the Orange County Business Taxpayers
Assn. The pro-park plan was written by Alan Songstad, chairman of the
El Toro Reuse Planning Authority and a Laguna Hills City Council
member.</TE>
<TE>   Few of us have the time to research the accuracy of information,
but just identifying the authors and why they are arguing the issue
helps us determine which side of the debate better represents our own
interests. Check it out, I think you'll see what I mean.</TE>

<TE>   Several correspondents recently have questioned the need for the
Great Park as called for in Measure W. I can attest from my own
observation to the underutilization of William R. Mason Park, but
they are missing the point. Measure W is an extensive (and
potentially expensive) smokescreen. "Anything but an airport" is its
supporters' aim, and they will endorse any alternative, ignoring the
relentless increase in population (in the very areas that are
anti-airport) and the opportunity of using a heaven-sent tract of
land for the airport that Orange County will so desperately need in
the coming years. Where they depart from reality is in suggesting
that this pastoral pipe dream will be cost-free. In these difficult
times, what Orange County needs is more income and jobs, and less
overhead expenses.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro, Round 3: Read the Fine Print, Then Vote 'No,'"
Commentary, Jan. 27:</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Conger's article warning about the fine print contained in
Measure W (the park plan) sure hit a nerve with airport opponents.
The Feb. 3 Letters to The Times section was peppered with letters
from South County airport opponents unhappy with her observations.
Too bad.</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, want to thank her. Who of us has the time to
completely read every word of every initiative, let alone research
how to get it in the first place? She did just that, found some
serious concerns about Measure W that the park proponents failed to
mention, and quoted them to us. I believe they were significant
enough to take a pass on Measure W.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading both commentaries Jan. 27, I would call it a
third-round TKO. Champ: Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Conger left me perplexed when she said that though Measure
W purports to offer a pristine, open-space park, in reality, it
undermines the protections we already have. What exactly are those
protections we already have? Three supervisors hell-bent on a
polluting, 24-hour second airport with traffic and all the
accouterments that will accompany this unneeded project? I'll take
the protections that Measure W offers with a park.</TE>

<LD>Re "$100-Million Bolsa Chica Plan OKd," Jan. 31:</LD>
<LD>   The California State Lands Commission deserves applause for its
decision on the restoration of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. The coastal
wetlands have been and always will be an important part of the
Southern California ecosystem. With the majority of our wetlands
having been destroyed and developed, this is one last chance to
preserve this unique habitat, home to a significant number of
species.</LD>
<LD>   Many people realize the importance and natural beauty of the
wetlands. However, many do not. It is our responsibility to preserve
the few remaining coastal habitats in Southern California. Homes
continue to be built, but at least there will be some wetlands
preserved for the future generations to enjoy.</LD>
<TE>   Chase Wiles</TE>

<TE>   One hundred million dollars to "restore" the wetlands? I nearly
choked on my morning doughnut when I read that. To this admittedly
untrained eye, it already is a wetland. I see land there, and it sure
seems wet. Yes, I'm aware that Bolsa Chica currently doesn't receive
benefits of tidal flow, and there's the legacy of former oil
drilling, etc. But is this our society's best use of $100 million?</TE>
<TE>   Schooling in our state is by most accounts pretty miserable, yet
we're going to spend $100 million on a project that will bring
marginal benefits, at best, to a small sliver of our environment. Are
our priorities in order?</TE>
<TE>   Jim DeBeau</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's important to note that the money is not coming from our
taxes, and only marginally involves existing reserves. The
acquisition and restoration for this long-overdue project is being
financed with mitigation fees paid by the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has visited Bolsa Chica lately will also note that none
of that money, nor apparently any other, is being used to maintain or
repair facilities. Nearly every component of the original restoration
is in sad disrepair. The wonderful trail around the inner bay is
eroded and, in places, undermined. The only footbridge over a tidal
bay in Southern California has termites. The parking lots were last
resurfaced more than 10 years ago. Interpretive signs are weathered
and illegible.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Fish and Game is entrusted to care
for the reserve. As the responsible agency they must act soon or it
will be beyond repair.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fire Kills Dad, 3 Young Sons," Jan. 30:</LD>
<LD>   Our building codes should, at the least, require the installation
of permanently wired smoke detectors whenever a home is sold.
Battery-powered smoke detectors with dead or missing batteries are no
protection at all. Preferably, all homes should be required to have
permanently wired smoke detectors by a certain date.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, we couldn't do that. It would cost too much, right? Somehow, I
think the Ybarra family would consider it money well spent.</LD>

act of pure unkindness to print such a picture of this man in his
most intimate grieving moment.</TE>

<LD>A 51-year-old Simi Valley man died Saturday when he was struck by a
large tree that toppled in powerful winds, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Brian W. Smith was pinned beneath the 45-foot tree about 1:30 p.m.
while playing tennis at an athletic club in the 2600 block of
Erringer Road, police said.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 club members pulled the tree off Smith, who was
pronounced dead a few minutes later at Simi Valley Hospital, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   Wind gusts toppled trees and power lines throughout the county,
knocking out power for tens of thousands of residents and sparking a
small brush fire near a school.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for the area
through noon today, warning motorists of strong gusts in the
mountains and valleys.</TE>
<TE>   "We occasionally get this much wind when we have high and low
pressure systems around. At least I can say it's warm and sunny,"
said Bonnie Bartling, a weather specialist with the National Weather
Service in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Bartling said gusts of nearly 50 mph were reported in Camarillo
and Simi Valley. There were gusts of up to 42 mph at Oxnard Airport,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   High temperatures throughout the county were expected to be in the
70s today with nighttime lows in the mid-50s to high 40s, Bartling
said. The area's dry spell will continue with sunny skies and no rain
in the forecast.</TE>
<TE>   State lifeguard John Regan said nearly 1,000 people flocked to
Ventura beaches to walk, picnic and fly kites. Several dozen surfers
hit the water. Regan said the waves were coming in 3- to 4-foot sets.</TE>
<TE>   Strong winds snapped several eucalyptus trees along California 126
between Ventura and Santa Paula. The falling trees pulled down power
lines and forced the closure of highway lanes in Santa Paula and an
offramp in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, a 100-foot tree fell across a swimming pool and
onto a guest house at a home near California 23. No one was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said a tree fell into a garage in Simi Valley, but
there were no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Six power poles snapped next to Mesa School on California 118
between Saticoy and Somis, authorities said. The downed lines started
a small brush fire that closed the roadway for about an hour.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 customers across the county endured outages
between 30 seconds and several hours long, said Ernie Villegas, a
Southern California Edison spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The largest affected areas were in Fillmore, Piru and Moorpark,
where several hundred customers--including businesses in downtown
Santa Paula--were without power for most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all of this is from fallen palm fronds or trees or tree
limbs," Villegas said. "Any time you have a windstorm, it's the worst
because it affects everything, everywhere."</TE>

<LD>Two men died after a car carrying three people crashed into Lake
Hughes on Saturday night, a California Highway Patrol officer said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers did not know the condition of the third person, who was
flown to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia.</LD>
<LD>   CHP officers received a call about 8:45 p.m. about a car that had
gone over the side of Elizabeth Lake Road, east of Lake Hughes Road,
said Officer Douglas Kondo. When officers arrived, the car was
submerged in the lake.</LD>
<TE>   Lake Hughes is in the Angeles National Forest near the Antelope
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Officers were still trying to determine what caused the accident.</TE>

<HD>New Contract Keeps Brott on Symphony Podium</HD>
<DH>Arts: New West conductor agrees to a three-year deal worth
more than $300,000, plus travel expenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boris Brott, founding music director of New West Symphony, has
secured a new three-year contract that provides a six-figure income
and travel expenses from his home in Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Brott is in the final year of his current three-year contract. The
new agreement will take effect Sept. 1 and run through the
orchestra's 10th season that concludes in spring 2005.</LD>
<LD>   Under the contract, Brott, 57, will commit nine weeks to the
Thousand Oaks-based symphony in each of the first two years and 10
weeks in the final year. The New West Symphony's season runs from
September to May.</LD>
<TE>   His responsibilities include conducting the symphony's six
Masterpiece Series concerts, an opening night gala concert, a pair of
Discovery Artists concerts, plus the educational outreach Symphonic
Adventures programs.</TE>
<TE>   Brott's current contract pays him $87,000 for an eight-week
commitment. His revised contract will pay him $100,000 each season
and will include a 5% increase in the second and third years, said
Betsy Chess, the symphony's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Called an "evergreen contract," the agreement will renew every
second year for an additional year unless Brott or the symphony
decides to alter the terms.</TE>
<TE>   A $30,000 stipend that Brott receives to cover expenses--which
include air travel between Ventura County and his home in Hamilton,
Ontario--also comes out of New West Symphony's $2.2-million operating
budget, Chess said.</TE>
<TE>   While conductors' salaries can differ greatly, Brott's
compensation is within the range of salaries of orchestras with
budgets of $1 million to $3.5 million, said Kris Saslow Sinclair,
executive director of the Assn. of California Symphony Orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   New West Symphony was created through the merger of the Ventura
County Symphony and the Conejo Symphony in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Boris has played a vital role in the artistic growth of our
orchestra since its inception," Chess said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his position with the New West Symphony and
numerous international guest appearances, Brott is artistic director
of the Brott Music Festival, which is held in three Canadian cities
from spring through fall, and conductor of the McGill Chamber
Orchestra in Montreal.</TE>

<HD>Vibrant Bus Service in Santa Clarita Is Riding High</HD>
<DH>Transit: Ridership has ballooned by 67% in the last five
years. Experts praise its growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Santa Clarita, the car is still king. Nearly half of the workers
in the city commute to jobs outside the area, many of them crowding
the lanes of the Golden State Freeway, Santa Clarita's lifeline to
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But the suburb of 150,000 also has developed a vibrant bus
service. Santa Clarita Transit is logging nearly 3 million boardings
a year. In the last five years, its ridership ballooned by 67%,
making it one of the 10 fastest-growing systems in the country,
according to the Washington-based American Public Transportation
Assn.</LD>
<LD>   And while the city runs popular long-haul commuter routes, more
than 85% of the riders use the buses that travel within the Santa
Clarita Valley, transit coordinator Bob Murphy said.</LD>
<TE>   The bus system has grown in step with Santa Clarita's population,
which increased by 40,000 in the 1990s. Transit experts say the city,
incorporated 15 years ago, has done a good job of meeting and even
nurturing demand for the buses.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Santa Clarita opened a $2.5-million bus transfer
station, which serves eight of the system's 33 local and commuter
routes. It is a block from the Valencia Town Center, the city's main
shopping area, a big draw for bus riders. The center is also home to
office buildings housing businesses such as Princess Cruise Lines.</TE>
<TE>   "They're building [transit] strategically as they build a city,"
said Jim de la Loza, executive officer for planning for the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "This [station] is a good
indication of that."</TE>
<TE>   The buses also serve Valencia Gateway Park, where about 40,000
people work.</TE>
<TE>   "If the jobs exist at a discrete number of locations--at an office
park and a defined downtown--it's going to be easier to provide
transit service to those areas," said James Moore, a USC civil
engineering professor and transit expert.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Town Center, whose faux-Spanish roofs loom a block away,
the new transfer station exhibits an immaculate orderliness that L.A.
denizens might experience only on studio back lots. Buses navigate a
wide, U-shaped boarding lot, while riders wait for transfers on
stained wood benches under huge, kite-shaped canopies.</TE>
<TE>   Riders like Peter Van Dyke--who was coming home from his job at
the local hospital one recent day--say the station is a big
improvement over the cramped old transfer point on the other side of
the Town Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just nicer to be sitting in modern conveniences," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita has a large, bus-dependent working class. About 20%
of its 47,000 families are considered lower income, making less than
$41,000 a year, city planner Marika Modugno said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's buses also provide rides for 1,500 students in the
William S. Hart Union School District, which scaled back its service
after encountering budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   With Santa Clarita expected to grow by 50,000 in the next two
decades, officials like city transportation spokeswoman Gail Ortiz
hope those students stick with buses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that this builds lifelong habits," she said.</TE>

<HD>Offering Health Workers a Hand</HD>
<DH>Services: Four colleges unveil a program to help immigrants
who were in the medical field abroad find similar jobs here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ferdinand Rojo, 36, was once chief resident of anesthesiology at a
hospital in the Philippines. Since immigrating to the United States
in 1990, however, he has been able to work only as an
electrocardiogram technician.</LD>
<LD>   Fighting tears, Rojo explained to a gathering of academics and
health workers this week his struggle to become a doctor in this
country. In 1999, he applied for 150 medical residency programs. Last
year, defeated by a torrent of rejection letters, he sent out only 20
applications.</LD>
<LD>   Now Rojo is hoping that a Walnut-based center for immigrant health
workers, which officially opened this week, can help.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference Thursday at Charles R. Drew University of
Medicine and Science in Willowbrook, four Southland colleges unveiled
a network of assistance centers on their campuses, each designed to
train workers from other countries for jobs in the U.S. health-care
system.</TE>
<TE>   The program is intended to increase diversity in the industry as
well as provide jobs for which immigrants have skills.</TE>
<TE>   The Welcome Back: International Health Worker Assistance Center is
based at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut but has satellite offices
at Drew, Cal State Long Beach and Los Angeles City College.</TE>
<TE>   Center counselors will help immigrant health workers obtain the
appropriate licensing, credentials and training they need to re-enter
their old profession or learn a new one in a related field.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to helping the immigrant population ... better
themselves educationally," said Dr. Jackie Ireland, vice president of
academic affairs at Los Angeles City College. The project is run by
the colleges but funded by a $1.4-million grant from the California
Endowment, the state's largest health-care foundation. In addition to
the Walnut site, there is a Welcome Back Center in San Francisco, and
others are planned in Fresno and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   At the centers, counselors assess foreign health-care graduates'
backgrounds and recommend courses and programs that offer the
training they need.</TE>
<TE>   "Many international graduates are working menial jobs," said Dr.
Rosevelt Jacobs, interim dean at Drew's College of Allied Health.
"Even though they are trained in health care, they are unable to
practice." Rojo, who recently began working with counselors at the
Welcome Back center at Mount SAC, said he now has hope of getting
into medical school.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been very receptive, warm and encouraging," he said.
"Just doing it on my own is near to impossible."</TE>

<HD>Bribery Tarnishes Colton's Image</HD>
<DH>Corruption: One current and three former councilmen have
admitted taking cash for votes. 'It's out of control,' one local
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven oversized billboards rise from the valley floor like steel
totems of Southern California culture, hawking cars and casinos and
other emblems of easy living to motorists rushing through a major
freeway interchange in southwest San Bernardino County.</LD>
<LD>   But for residents of Colton, a quiet blue-collar town nestled
along the edges of the Riverside and San Bernardino freeways, the
billboards symbolize something darker: greed and corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last few months, three former and one sitting member of
Colton's City Council, including two former mayors, have admitted
pocketing bribes in a vote-selling scandal whose scope has surprised
even the most jaded of people in this cynic's paradise.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just out of control," said Abe Simon, 62, owner of a small
downtown clothing store within eyeshot of Colton City Hall. "A lot of
people are disgusted with them. They feel betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Colton's corruption scandals are purely local.
Longtime politicos, such as former Mayor Abe Beltran, and relative
newcomers, such as Councilman Don Sanders, have admitted taking cash
and gifts to help businessmen erect and sell some billboards, build
restaurants and market sites in a city-owned trailer park.</TE>
<TE>   But the scandal, which has ensnared two Orange County businessmen
as well, also touches on broader and more universal issues of trust
and faith, the personal motives of those seeking public position, and
the insidious role of money in politics.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the purpose of a politician?" asked Gary Kilbourn, 53,
who owns the Country Health store around the corner from Colton's
circular City Hall. "They don't serve the common good. They serve the
lobbyists. This is how they are bred."</TE>
<TE>   Colton, a poor cousin in Southern California's sprawling family of
high-priced cities, has a racially mixed population of 48,000 that
consists largely of low- and moderate-wage commuters who work in
Riverside, San Bernardino and other nearby cities.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly vulnerable to economic storms, Colton had a December
unemployment rate of 5.8%, compared with 4.5% for San Bernardino
County overall and 4.9% for Riverside County. The median price for a
home--the local architecture leans heavily toward single-story
bungalows--hovers around $125,000, less than half that of Orange
County. New developments offer single-family houses "with huge lots"
beginning at $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of place where patios are built by friends over a
weekend, and car repairs are done at home. The city library boasts 12
shelves of Chilton's auto repair manuals, the bible for driveway
mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   The bribes behind the indictments seem unimaginative. Instead of
wiring money to hidden overseas accounts, for example, the local
graft-takers pocketed wads of cash during clandestine meetings at
Orange County restaurants, accepted free carpeting and let their
corrupters pay off personal credit card bills, according to the
indictment and plea agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The pervasiveness of the corruption surprised the federal
prosecutor heading the investigations into Inland Empire graft.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of it might have been my own naivete of what goes on in
local government, and part of it is a reflection of the close-knit
and insular political culture that seems to exist in that county,"
said Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward Moreton.</TE>
<TE>   The Colton cases form the second wave of prosecutions mounted by a
task force that includes Moreton's office, FBI agents and San
Bernardino County sheriff's deputies--but not the San Bernardino
County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on in the investigation the decision was made that it would
be better for us to go forward without them," Moreton said, declining
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The task force is still active, Moreton said, but he wouldn't
discuss continuing investigations.</TE>
<TE>   In the first wave of indictments, four former San Bernardino
County officials and three businessmen pleaded guilty two years ago
to corruption charges centering on former county Chief Administrator
James Hlawek.</TE>
<TE>   Hlawek, who is awaiting sentencing while cooperating with
investigators, also is an unindicted co-conspirator in some of the
Colton cases for his role in setting up meetings and delivering
bribes, according to federal court records.</TE>
<TE>   Both rounds of investigations hinged on gathering evidence against
suspected bribe-takers, then pressuring them to implicate others.
Without offering specifics, Moreton said Hlawek was the common link
between the two waves.</TE>
<TE>   The Colton cases involve four scandals and eight defendants. Six
of the defendants pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges,
admitting to allegations in the indictment and agreeing to cooperate
with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two defendants, former San Bernardino County
Supervisor Jerry Eaves and Newport Beach businessman William S.
"Shep" McCook, pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in the
indictment of giving trips to Eaves and his relatives. Bribery
charges against both men were dismissed late last month by U.S.
District Judge Manuel Real, who ruled that the federal court had no
jurisdiction because the allegations did not involve federal money.
Eaves, however, will be tried in April on federal mail-fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   Moreton said task force members were trying to determine their
next step, but that they did not intend to drop the case.</TE>
<TE>   For Colton, whose working-class flavor can be found in the massive
cement works on the city's southwestern edge and in the union halls
sprinkled around downtown, the bribery scandals are just another,
more insidious wrinkle in a political culture notable for its
viciousness.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, the city endured six recall campaigns in six
consecutive years. In one 1997 contest, challenger James Grimsby
ousted incumbent David Sandoval after Grimsby backers accused
Sandoval of favoring projects that benefited his campaign
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Grimsby began selling his votes directly, according
to court records. He and former Mayor Karl E. Gaytan pleaded guilty
last year to accepting more than $25,000 from Laguna Beach
businessman Allan Steward in return for supporting four Steward
projects: the sale of land within the Cooley Ranch redevelopment
project and the construction of three chain restaurants. Steward also
has pleaded guilty in the case and to charges in the billboard
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to interview the defendants were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Cash Was Exchanged at Restaurants, Roadsides</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bribes were straight cash handouts. Some came during
meetings at Orange County restaurants. One came along a roadside near
the San Onofre nuclear plant. Sanders also admitted collecting $2,000
in cash from McCook at a gas station off the Costa Mesa Freeway,
although McCook maintains his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Other bribes came in the form of new carpeting and weekends in
Laguna Beach, Las Vegas and New York. Steward funneled cash to
Grimsby through his wife and ex-wife--some made while Grimsby was a
candidate in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Court records say Steward also paid some of Grimsby's American
Express bills and posted a $5,000 bond to spring Grimsby from jail on
misdemeanor charges of cruelty to a child involving an altercation
with his 17-year-old stepdaughter a few weeks before the election.
The charge was later dismissed</TE>
<TE>   In this classic crossroads city, the most telling aspect of the
bribery scandal is that the dirty politicians simply met many
residents' low expectations of them.</TE>
<TE>   Shady dealings have long been rumored in town. In 1997,
Anaheim-based trash hauler Taormina Industries sued local minister
Stephen Anderson for saying Taormina paid bribes to land a Colton
trash-collection contract.</TE>
<TE>   Over Anderson's objections, his insurance company settled the case
before the bribery indictments, which allege--but do not formally
charge--that a Taormina representative gave about $5,000 to
Councilman Sanders for his support in winning the city's contract.</TE>
<TE>   There were other hints of suspicious dealings. Beltran pleaded no
contest in 1997 to charges he failed to disclose that Steward owed
him $40,000 at the time Beltran was voting in favor of some of the
developer's projects. Steward pleaded guilty in the bribery case.</TE>
<TE>   And last year, Eaves, whose supervisorial district includes
Colton, pleaded no contest to violating state conflict-of-interest
laws by not reporting fishing trips and other gifts from a bond
underwriter during the mid-'90s, then voting to give the firm
lucrative county contracts. He was fined $20,000 and barred from
seeking reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Steel, Colton's former redevelopment director, said that
shortly after he started the job in 1998 he was told that key
decisions on projects were to be made by the council members alone,
without city staff recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "Colton has a long history of doing this kind of stuff, kind of
working the edge of ethics," said Steel, who now heads the
redevelopment agency in nearby Rialto. "People who did business with
the city took it in a humorous stride almost, that that's the way
business is done in Colton. You had to stroke somebody. They never
gave me evidence, but there were a lot of questionable business deals
that you wondered why those deals were done. They just don't make
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Colton's history of political drama, relatively few
residents involve themselves in elections. In the 2000 presidential
campaign, only 62% of Colton's 16,850 registered voters turned out,
compared with 67% for all of San Bernardino County. In a November
council election to replace Councilwoman Deirdre Bennett, who was
appointed mayor, only 362--or 9.8%--of the 5th District's 3,689
registered voters cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Scandals Give Way to Low-Key Campaign</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they don't know what kind of turnout to expect
for the March 5 election to fill the 1st District council seat
Sanders resigned last fall, a few weeks after pleading guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Three candidates--paralegal/youth counselor Gwendolyn Brown, youth
minister Ramon M. Hernandez and military retiree William W.
Hines--are seeking the seat, but the campaign has been all but
invisible.</TE>
<TE>   While the scandals are still unfolding, the guilty pleas have
already affected how the city conducts business. Suspicions ran so
high in the aftermath of the indictments that City Manager Daryl
Parrish demanded that developers involved in a real estate deal with
Steward sign affidavits that no bribes were involved.</TE>
<TE>   And City Council meetings now include a public reading of all
pending contracts, after which council members are required to state
under penalty of perjury whether they have received any gifts
exceeding $50 from anyone involved in the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the architects of those measures acknowledge their
limits.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone's going to commit a dishonest act, it's hard to stop
them from doing it," Parrish said. "It's part of their moral fiber.
They either will or they won't."</TE>

<HD>Obscure Theory Fells a Mayor</HD>
<DH>Election: 'Primacy effect,' in which items listed first are
preferred, swayed Compton case judge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after his testimony helped change the face of politics in
Compton, what surprised Ohio State University professor Jon Krosnick
most?</LD>
<LD>   1) His daughter enjoyed her tennis lesson.</LD>
<LD>   2) He managed to organize his study.</LD>
<TE>   3) He learned that, 2,000 miles away, his testimony unseated one
mayor and reinstalled another.</TE>
<TE>   If you picked tennis lesson, you're wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But don't despair, it's the "primacy effect" at work. The
phenomenon influences the way we answer test questions, pick our
favorite soft drinks and, yes, even vote, Krosnick said in a
telephone interview Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is simply this: When asked to select from a list of
choices, people tend to favor those choices at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is familiar to social scientists, pollsters and anyone
who always answers "heads" when asked to call a coin toss. It was
vaulted from ivory-tower obscurity into the harsh glare of the
political arena Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling in a trial over last June's election in Compton, Superior
Court Judge Judith Chirlin found that the primacy effect played a
major role in the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   She said City Clerk Charles Davis violated the law when he failed
to request a randomized alphabet from the California secretary of
state to determine the order of candidates' names on the general
election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he used a list that had been generated for the primary
election. As a result, Perrodin's name was first on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying for losing incumbent Omar Bradley, Krosnick had
calculated that the error cost the mayor at least 306 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin cited other problems with the election too, but leaned
heavily on Krosnick's testimony when she decided to oust the sitting
mayor, Eric Perrodin, and reseat Bradley, whom Perrodin beat by 281
votes.</TE>
<TE>   The decision shocked many legal experts, who wondered how an
election could turn on such a seemingly minor issue. But two decades
of studying the primacy effect have convinced Krosnick that the point
is not minor at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every race is the same," he said. "But there's lots of
evidence, and it overwhelmingly indicates that being first is the
best place to be."</TE>
<TE>   Began Study 2 Decades Ago</TE>
<TE>   Krosnick, a professor of psychology and political science, said he
began studying the phenomenon in 1982, focusing on its role in how
people answer survey questions.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask people if the most important problem facing the
country is crime, drugs or the economy, a certain number of people
are going to choose crime just because it's listed first," he said.
"If you do a taste test with five different beers, people are
especially likely to prefer the first one they taste."</TE>
<TE>   Pollsters try to thwart that tendency by varying the order of
possible answers to their questions, said Susan Pinkus, director of
the Times Poll, the organization that conducts polls for the Los
Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to rotate the list because people have a tendency to
remember what's at the top or the bottom and forget what's in the
middle," she said. "If we ask about three candidates, we'll try to
list each name first a third of the time, each name second a third of
the time and so on."</TE>
<TE>   Krosnick said the only other time he has testified about the
primacy effect was in the 1990 race for Ohio attorney general. In
that case, he testified that the primacy effect did not play a large
enough role to affect the election, and the Ohio Supreme Court
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Krosnick "hadn't done any work on its role in
elections," he said. "But my conclusions were sustained by the Ohio
Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, his research has expanded to include the role of the
primacy effect in elections. He said it is almost always present,
though not always to the same degree, depending on voters'
familiarity with candidates, level of education and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   'Good Fortune' Led to Testimony</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley Hertz, said Velma Williams, a law
student at USC who helped on the case, found an article about the
primacy effect in a 1972 law journal and contacted the author, who
pointed her to Krosnick.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just good fortune," Hertz said, adding that Krosnick was
on the West Coast at the time and was able to prepare his testimony
on two days' notice.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Gridley, the attorney who represented Perrodin, said he was
surprised at how much the court relied on Krosnick's testimony.
Gridley called his own expert, a professor from Caltech, but Chirlin
said she gave more weight to Krosnick's words.</TE>
<TE>   "We were ready for him, but we didn't think the judge was going to
find his argument very persuasive," Gridley said.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of only five states that require randomization
of candidate names on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "California is ahead of the curve in that regard," Krosnick said.
"It ought to be required in every state in the country to make it
fair."</TE>

<HD>Town Wants More Than Citrus Trees</HD>
<DH>Economics: Orange Cove has fruit groves and much poverty.
Mayor hopes to lure new jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORANGE COVE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Even in the dead of winter, as farm towns across the San Joaquin
Valley sleep their deep slumber, this little town awakens before
first light.</LD>
<LD>   Here at the foot of the snowcapped Sierra, the fields aren't the
usual vineyards or peach orchards waiting for spring to stir. This is
the heart of the citrus belt, and grove upon grove is filled with
oranges fat and sweet. The packinghouses shake with the steady pound
of 4 million navels rolling from field to conveyor belt to box.</LD>
<LD>   For the farm workers of Orange Cove, it doesn't get any better
than this. Winter's navel harvest will give way to spring's Valencia
crop--six months' worth of jobs. Yet even in steady times, this town
stands as one of the five poorest in the state. One of three
residents, who want no part of the low-wage harvest, is jobless. The
welfare dependency rate exceeds 60%.</LD>
<TE>   Seeking to add new industry to a place that lives and dies on the
dice roll that its fruit will dodge another killer frost, Mayor
Victor Lopez is prepared to offer the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll roll out the red carpet for anyone who is going to bring
jobs to Orange Cove," he vows. "Free land, free infrastructure, not a
single fee. We'll fast-track everything and anything, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   That's big talk for such a poor town, but Lopez can back it up.
The federal and state governments prop up Orange Cove to the tune of
tens of millions of dollars in aid. The largess can be seen in every
corner of this hamlet--from the fancy jobs development center named
after the mayor to the sparkling new child care facility named after
his mother.</TE>
<TE>   And Lopez, who began his 21st year as mayor, is now dangling the
biggest carrot of them all.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Orange Cove was among only 40 communities selected
nationwide to share in a $17-billion pot of federal tax incentives.
The credits will be used to create job growth, lure economic
development and build affordable housing in a region of the state
that seems plucked from south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   As word of the selection spread, the mayor with the jet-black
pompadour and fingers flashing gold began fielding calls from
businessmen looking for generous tax breaks. They filled his ear with
state-of-the-art packinghouses, mattress companies and insurance
call-in centers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one of those leaders who says we need to get rid of our
agriculture base," Lopez said. "But we are surrounded by 21,000 acres
of oranges, and if something happens, like the freeze of 1990, we've
got nothing else to fall back on."</TE>
<TE>   That this gateway town to Kings Canyon National Park threw its lot
to oranges is due, in no small measure, to the suburbanization of Los
Angeles. As the citrus groves of the Southland were paved over with
housing tracts and mini-malls, the growers came up and over the
mountain in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall Shows State's New Political Reality</TE>
<TE>   Though the groves and packinghouses remain, everything else has
changed. The town is now nearly 90% Latino. In the last five years
alone, the population has doubled to 9,000. The newcomers include
2,000 El Salvadorans who have risen to the ranks of crew bosses and
have pooled their incomes to buy houses and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   To step into City Hall--an old Santa Fe railroad depot--is to be
greeted by California's new political reality: Finance Director
Alvertina Rivera; revenue clerk Caroline Gomez; City Administrator
Jose Antonio Ramirez; city clerk June Bracamontes; Public Works chief
Gabriel Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Above them all is the tornado force of 58-year-old Lopez, a.k.a.
"Mayor for Life."</TE>
<TE>   He chuckles at the image of himself as the politician with the
ever-present tin cup. Three times a month, he travels to Sacramento
to meet with legislators and agency directors. They know his pitch
well but find it impossible to turn him away empty-handed. The same
with bureaucrats in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   This is a town, after all, with no stoplight, no fast-food
restaurant, no high school, no movie house, no pharmacy and no place
to dance. Blame the last one on him, Lopez concedes. He banned
dancing within city limits because the honky-tonks along Main Street
were selling beers for $5 a pop--just for the right to tango with a
bar girl.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very quiet community now," said Lopez, who grew up in
Orange Cove as the son of migrant farm workers. Cutting the jobless
rate in half is far more complicated, Lopez said. The problem isn't
the recent Latino immigrants breaking their backs in the fields for
minimum wage. Rather, it is the townsfolk two and three generations
removed from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in America, they see fieldwork and its $6- and
$7-an-hour wages as beneath them, he said. But instead of working
their way up a different economic ladder, they are dropping out of
school and having babies out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latino kids born and raised in this community have lost
hope," Lopez said. "We need to bring in the kind of industry that
will get them to work."</TE>
<TE>   As he gives a tour in his new silver Chrysler with the license
plate frame VPL--Very Powerful Latino--he points to the benevolent
hand of government everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Victor P. Lopez Rural Economic Development and Job Training
Center, a handsome building topped in Spanish tile, was built with
$3.5 million in federal grants. Since 1997, 27 welfare mothers have
become certified child care providers by attending classes at the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the graduates are working at the Julia A. Lopez Child Care
Center, a dawn-to-dark preschool for 150 farm workers' children.
Instead of spending all day in the fields at the feet of their
parents, they move from computer lab to art room to playground.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez says farm work--six months in the orange groves followed by
three months picking grapes and stone fruit--remains the
bread-and-butter of his community. The steady wages have enabled
field hands to move into gated apartment complexes with swimming
pools and clubhouses. More than 300 such low-income units have been
built in recent years by reeling in $25 million in state money.</TE>
<TE>   The complexes are spotless, not a graffiti mark in sight, and the
lawns are as green as the citrus trees. "Can you imagine a field
worker coming home and swimming?" he says. "It happens here in Orange
Cove."</TE>
<TE>   Across the way, 200 single-family stucco houses have been built
with $18 million in USDA rural assistance funds. That Orange Cove
will now share $17 billion in federal tax incentives could not have
come at a more opportune time. The city is building sewer and water
treatment plants with $23 million in state and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   'Orange Cove Is a Hidden Jewel'</TE>
<TE>   To fuel growth, it is negotiating a deal to secure 2,000 acre-feet
of river snowmelt delivered through canals. The water is needed
because decades of over-fertilizing have tainted the ground-water
table.</TE>
<TE>   A high school is about to break ground so the kids will no longer
be bused 11 miles to Reedley. On 19 acres, comedian Paul Rodriguez, a
native of these parts, is developing a shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange Cove is a hidden jewel," said Frank Iwama, a Silicon
Valley attorney who came to town last week representing investors
from Japan. "The view of the mountains alone is worth millions."</TE>
<TE>   But venture down Main Street and there is grumbling.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the money seems to be going down a big hole," said Vince
Vasquez, standing behind the counter of Orange Cove Hardware, the
oldest business in town. "As far as downtown goes, all we've gotten
is a new street median and some landscaping."</TE>
<TE>   At Joe's Barbershop, customer Art Morin wondered about all the new
buildings named after the mayor and his relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with his family name everywhere," he said. "But
everything seems to be lined up now. The water, the sewer, the
housing, the $17 billion. I think we're finally going somewhere."</TE>

<HD>Bamieh, Totten in a Calm Face-Off</HD>
<DH>District attorney: The candidates tout their qualifications
at a forum in Thousand Oaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Questions over who is best qualified to serve as Ventura County's
next district attorney dominated a public forum Saturday in Thousand
Oaks between candidates Ron Bamieh and Greg Totten.</LD>
<LD>   The two rivals, locked in a bitter and costly campaign to replace
retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, squared off in front of
several dozen residents at the Grant R. Brimhall Public Library.</LD>
<LD>   Totten, 47, said his two decades as a prosecutor and experience as
the No. 2 man in the office, with a budget of $47million and a
600-member staff, make him the best choice for the county's top law
enforcement post.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been in leadership positions for 15 years," said Totten,
who has served the past three years as chief assistant district
attorney. "This is a great office and we live in the safest county
west of the Mississippi and I have played an important role in that."</TE>
<TE>   Totten was also quick to note he has the endorsement of Bradbury,
Sheriff Bob Brooks and every police chief in the county. Last week he
also received the support of the Ventura County Prosecutors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh, 36, a senior deputy district attorney, said voters
should decide who is the county's next district attorney, and not
big-name endorsements from people such as Bradbury, first elected to
the job in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, who has worked in the district attorney's office since
1993, said the office has become bloated with prosecutors who rarely
step inside a courtroom. Painting himself as an outsider willing to
buck the status quo, Bamieh said he will trim administrative costs by
having more prosecutors trying cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There are enough prosecutors in our office," Bamieh said when
asked by an audience member about staffing. "Our office is too
heavily weighted down on the administrative level."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said he would assign prosecutors to outlying cities and
focus more on prosecuting misdemeanor crimes as a way to prevent more
serious offenses.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks the candidates have argued over how best to treat
defendants in domestic violence cases, the accuracy of their
respective trial records and the amount of time each has spent in a
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday Totten called a news conference to accuse Bamieh of
running misleading campaign adds on Totten's trial experience. Bamieh
quickly shot back, contending the accusation was a sure sign Totten's
campaign had become desperate.</TE>
<TE>   But no such acrimony was present during Saturday's debate. The
candidates shook hands warmly and did not level any attacks during
the one-hour forum, moderated by Herbert E. Gooch, chairman of the
political science department at Cal Lutheran University.</TE>
<TE>   During the debate, both candidates were asked how long they would
like to serve as district attorney.Totten said he supported term
limits for legislators but not for district attorney, "because you
don't want your D.A. to be a politician."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said he supported term limits and would only run for
reelection twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to retire as the district attorney," Bamieh said. "I
don't believe it's healthy to be the D.A. for 25 years."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Turns Election Into a Litmus Test</HD>
<DH>Voting: O.C. candidates are being judged by their position
on the airport question, even when they'd have no authority over use
of the former Marine base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters will go to the polls next month to decide
whether to forgo an airport at the former El Toro Marine base that
has been nearly eight years in the planning.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the fourth time voters have weighed in on the question
of building a regional airport at the closed 4,700-acre base. But the
issue has been an overarching one in many more elections since the
proposed airport was narrowly approved the first time in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   The airport question comes before voters March 5 as Measure W,
which would rezone El Toro to become an urban park and prevent an
airport from being built there. On the same ballot, the airport
question looms large in the race for one county supervisor's seat, as
well as three other countywide offices that arguably have no
authority over the base's future.</LD>
<TE>   Yet in each case, candidates' statements or their actions
regarding El Toro are being attacked by challengers seeking support
from anti-airport South County residents.</TE>
<TE>   The airport factor is obvious in the race between incumbent
Cynthia Coad, chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors, and
Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby. Coad is one of three
pro-airport votes on the five-member county board. Norby, who opposes
the airport, has raised about $125,000 as of last month, much of it
from donors in South County.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the rancorous fight for the district attorney's seat, the
airport has emerged as an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade has met with South County political
leaders, urging support for his campaign against Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas. His pitch: Rackauckas was among four signers of a ballot
argument opposing passage of anti-airport Measure F in 2000. That
measure, which required a countywide vote before construction of
airports, large jails near homes or hazardous waste landfills, passed
with 67% of the vote. It was later overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In the nonpartisan race for county clerk-recorder, Irvine attorney
Bruce Peotter is reminding South County community groups that his
opponent, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, has been a leading supporter of an
El Toro airport. But Daly has a counterpunch: potent endorsements
from anti-airport Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman Chris
Mears.</TE>
<TE>   And county Assessor Webster J. Guillory is being challenged by
deputy appraiser Larry Bales. Bales hopes his study showing an
expected drop in property values around a future airport at El Toro
will draw support.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport has clearly become a litmus test among south Orange
County voters, affecting even races that have nothing to do with it,"
said Cheryl Katz, who conducts polling for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "On issues where people feel very personally affected, they assign
a huge emotional investment in the outcome," Katz said. "For
candidates, it's a good way to become known for people who otherwise
are not getting attention." North County voters make up about 70% of
the county's registered voters. Some analysts predict, however, that
motivated South County voters could boost their influence in
election-day turnout to 50% of the votes cast.</TE>
<TE>   Some frustrated airport opponents in South County regard the
airport as a litmus test even for candidates for state office.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, I, for one, will simply not vote for any candidate
for any office in the state of California if they have not expressed
opposition to this airport," one voter wrote on an anti-airport Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Another message said state Sen. Richard Ackerman (R-Irvine),
running for California attorney general, should be shunned by
Republicans because he endorsed Coad, even though he has issued
recent statements opposing the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another questioned the position of Irvine-based Assemblyman
John Campbell, who wants to change airport zoning at El Toro to
become an urban park. Campbell supports Measure W--but his recent
declaration was too little, too late for some hard-core anti-airport
activists.</TE>
<TE>   "This is single-issue politics," said Mark Petracca, head of UC
Irvine's political science department and an airport foe.
"Traditionally, these have been issues like abortion, school choice,
school prayer, gun control. They're issues upon which, despite a gap
between the person you're voting for and their responsibility over
the issue that concerns you, you use that issue to cast your vote."</TE>
<TE>   The race in which the airport arguably plays the greatest role is
Norby's challenge to Coad. From early on, Norby sold his campaign to
South County residents as the only way to unseat one of the airport's
strongest allies and tip the board majority against the project.
Whatever happens with the airport, the Board of Supervisors will
continue to play a pivotal role in plans for the former Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   The same argument was made by former Huntington Beach City
Councilman Dave Sullivan, who raised more than $400,000 in South
County donations in his unsuccessful 1998 race for supervisor against
Jim Silva. Silva, an airport supporter, is running unopposed this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Norby will try to use the airport against Coad as an issue of good
governance, Petracca said. Measure F is an example of supervisors not
listening to their constituents, he said: Voters in every Orange
County city but two--Newport Beach and Costa Mesa--backed Measure F,
only to see supervisors successfully challenge it in court.</TE>
<TE>   Coad campaign manager Dave Gilliard said El Toro has been a factor
in the race in only one way--money.</TE>
<TE>   "His [Norby's] whole campaign-finance structure is based on
raising money from South County," Gilliard said. In the district
attorney race, the airport wouldn't have become a factor if
Rackauckas hadn't been so visible on one side of the issue, Petracca
said. The district attorney's involvement in the "No on Measure F"
campaign so angered his traditional donors in South County that they
called him to a meeting to defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' explanation: He opposed the measure because it would
have made it more difficult to build badly needed jails.</TE>
<TE>   Wade recently met with several South County groups to promote his
candidacy, but so far, he hasn't attracted the sizable donations seen
in other races. As of last month, he had raised about $75,000, with
donations spread from around the county.</TE>
<TE>   Tying Rackauckas to the airport issue hasn't worked because donors
don't consider the race pivotal to the airport, said Gilliard, who
also is handling the district attorney's reelection campaign. He
noted that Rackauckas also has been endorsed by Assemblywoman
Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) and Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Mimi
Walters, as well as other anti-airport lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   In the assessor race, meanwhile, Bales said he leaped on the
airport issue because an airport would have an impact on the value of
homes nearest the flight paths. He provided airport opponents with a
study showing properties nearby would lose, in total, $1.1 billion to
$3.5 billion in value. That impact, Bates said, should be factored in
when evaluating the airport's cost.</TE>
<TE>   Peotter, in the clerk's race, began placing signs around South
County last week with dual messages to vote for him and for Measure
W. He added a third rationale for certain circles: He's a Republican
and Daly is a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if the clerk-recorder's office has no impact" on the
airport controversy, Peotter said. "It has an impact politically
because it shows the issue is important enough to people in the
county that they'll elect people based on that issue. That sends a
message to the politicians."</TE>
<TE>   He said he's disheartened that Agran and Mears endorsed Daly.</TE>
<TE>   "They've shown they're more willing to put being a Democrat ahead
of being against an airport," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly called it "farfetched and absurd" to suggest that a job like
clerk-recorder has any control over the fate of El Toro. He said he's
gotten endorsements from South County leaders--including Mission
Viejo Councilwoman Susan Withrow, a Republican--because "They respect
my record of public service."</TE>
<TE>   "El Toro permeates all other campaigns and issues in some way
because it's the biggest issue to hit this county politically," said
Scott Hart, a campaign consultant from Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Every morning, there are at least 100,000 people who wake up in
South County and say, 'There will be an airport over my dead body at
El Toro,'" he said. "At the same time, there are probably 10 people
who wake up in North County and say, 'There must be an airport built
at El Toro.' There's no comparison."</TE>
<TE>   Hart is managing the campaign of Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside),
who will be representing a slice of Orange County for the first time.
The 44th District, including Riverside, Corona and Norco, now
includes half of San Juan Capistrano, all of San Clemente, Coto de
Caza and Las Flores.</TE>
<TE>   A Calvert postcard mailed this week highlights Calvert's
opposition to the airport and support for Measure W. Calvert wants to
expand commercial airline service at the former March Air Force Base
in Riverside. He also was instrumental in the release of an airspace
study late last year by the Federal Aviation Administration, critical
of the proposed El Toro takeoff and landing patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even if Measure W passes next month, most residents don't
believe it will end the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-quarters of voters said the March election is
somewhat or very unlikely to end the debate, according to a survey by
the Orange County Business Council and Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Most voters don't see the Measure W vote as "an ultimate El Toro
death match," council Executive Director Stan Oftelie said. "They see
the March 5 election as just another step in a long, difficult
process that's full of small setbacks and even smaller victories.</TE>
<TE>   "They see this as dragging well into the future," Oftelie said.
"They're probably right."</TE>

<HD>On Sept. 11, L.A. Reached Out to Its Own</HD>
<DH>Donations helped the families of victims deal with their
sudden financial hardships and demonstrated local generosity.</DH>

<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those touched by charity drives in Los Angeles County since the
terror of Sept. 11, the donations have let loose a range of emotions.</LD>
<LD>   There's the sense of gratitude among recipients, and patriotic
generosity among donors.</LD>
<LD>   But mixed in with those positive feelings, for some recipients of
the money, is a sense of guilt that comes from being among those who
survived, and from being the recipient of such heartfelt largess.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County chapter of United Way raised more than $1
million for terror relief. Most of that money was sent to the
organization's nationwide relief fund. But $329,500 has been divided
among 18 families in Los Angeles County that lost loved ones on that
dark September day.</TE>
<TE>   The money came from many different sources, but United Way
staffers say that one of the largest gifts came from 286 employees at
Panda Express restaurants in the area.</TE>
<TE>   People With Least Tend to Give Most</TE>
<TE>   Many of those workers earn relatively little, but they fit a
typical profile of donors, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   "You find that people who give the most are the people who make
the least," said Sandy Mendoza, who ran the United Way's fund-raising
effort for local victims. "They understand the need far greater."</TE>
<TE>   The checks often were accompanied by small notes or patriotic
messages intended for the recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Other key donations came from corporations, including $100,000
from the Mattel Children's Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   United Way staffers in Los Angeles County launched the fund on the
day of the attacks. By the end of the day, they had drafted an
advertisement to publicize the fund in local newspapers. They also
arranged for a toll-free telephone number to help bring the money in.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign came to dominate Mendoza's life, first as a
professional who promised next-day replies to letters from victims,
and then as a friend whom some would call late at night, seeking
solace. One widower told her he had lost his heart. Others simply
wept. Some were unable to speak directly with her or other United Way
staffers, asking friends or relatives to speak for them.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza started a file of correspondence related to the fund,
which grew into a thick binder.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 18 families of victims received two checks, one in
November for $5,000, and another in January for $7,500. Families with
children received more.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, using news reports and a database of the Sept. 11
victims, found 22 families in Los Angeles County and sent letters to
all of them offering help. There was no requirement that the
recipients prove they needed the money. All they had to do was sign a
form verifying they were who the United Way thought they were.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, four families eligible to receive the funds
declined, saying they didn't need it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really nice to see that," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Neira, a retired American Airlines mechanic whose wife was
on American Flight 11, was the first to get a check. Even before the
letters from United Way went out to next of kin, Neira had heard of
the fund and visited Mendoza's office in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Mendoza later, Neira wrote: "We, the Neira family,
found that our country is made of people of all walks of life and
that their good feelings and kindness came out in such a way that it
makes us feel so proud to be an American."</TE>
<TE>   As it was for others, Neira's check from United Way was no
financial windfall. But it did help.</TE>
<TE>   The $1 million collected in Los Angeles County was typical of
fund-raising efforts throughout California and the nation. Survivors
have received help from various funds. The Sept. 11 Fund raised so
much money--$425 million--that last month officials asked the public
to stop sending money, saying they should help other charities in
need.</TE>
<TE>   For Lisa Keller, a Manhattan Beach resident who lost her husband
Chad in the terrorist attacks, the money was a help but also largely
symbolic. Chad was on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Chad and I had been house-hunting back in August," Keller said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no children," she said, adding that she is sympathetic to
those who had to explain the death of a parent to a child. Still, she
said, those survivors with children may have a way to move forward
that some like herself lack.</TE>
<TE>   "You have something to focus on. Someone to be strong for. I don't
have that," she said through tears.</TE>
<TE>   The generosity of donors, however, helped her meet her routine
expenses without having to dip into the down payment that she and her
husband had put away for a house.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a home is still a goal for her--a way of carrying out the
plans they had made together.</TE>
<TE>   Other husbands or wives of victims, especially those with
children, found themselves facing heavy financial burdens because of
the loss of their spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter Is Born 2 Days After Attack</TE>
<TE>   Kellie Lee lost her husband, Danny, a stage carpenter for the
singing group Backstreet Boys. He was aboard Flight 11, which crashed
into the World Trade Center's north tower.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, their daughter Allison was born.</TE>
<TE>   "We were living paycheck to paycheck before the attack," Lee said.
"I had two kids, no money and a lot of debt."</TE>
<TE>   She said she was forced to move from Van Nuys to her parents' home
in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   But with the help of agencies such as United Way, she hopes to be
able to move back to California and reestablish her life here.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started receiving help," she says, "I was just so
grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I went to the bank, I cried."</TE>

<HD>Coach Won't Be Charged</HD>
<DH>San Marino: Evidence Patrick Gillan molested a basketball
player is lacking, prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing insufficient evidence, the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office will not file charges against a San Marino girls
basketball coach who was accused of molesting one of his players.</LD>
<LD>   San Marino police arrested Patrick Gillan, 36, in December on
suspicion of assault with intent to commit a felony. A former player,
now an 18-year-old college student, alleged that the coach sexually
molested her between June 2000 and April 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors were not able to find sufficient evidence to support
the allegations, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no corroboration of the victim's story," she said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Gillan, who has coached at San Marino and La Canada high schools
for more than 10 years, was placed on paid leave from his job as an
instructional aide at San Marino just before the arrest. His
attorney, Michael Mayock, said Gillan is eager to return to work. The
girls basketball season, however, is almost over for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Mayock said that since his arrest, Gillan has received many calls
and letters of support from parents, students and others. The coach
forwarded one letter, signed by many of his players and their
parents, to the district attorney's office, the lawyer said,
suggesting that it might have helped make the case that evidence was
lacking.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino police refused to comment and referred all inquiries to
the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Mayock criticized the department's handling of the case, saying
police announced the arrest at a news conference before they had
conducted a thorough investigation. "I hope someone learns a lesson
from this. You can't have a press conference and then investigate
someone," he said.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Defends GOP Credentials</HD>
<DH>Debate: At the state party convention, the front-runner in
race for gubernatorial nomination answers charges that he isn't
Republican enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Besieged by his two primary rivals, Richard Riordan vigorously
defended his age, abortion stance and Republican credentials Saturday
in a sharp-elbowed debate before a raucous crowd at the state GOP
convention.</LD>
<LD>   In one hour and the confines of a ballroom, the fight for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination was distilled to its essence:
Should the party trim its conservative principles to better position
itself for November's general election?</LD>
<LD>   Bill Jones and Bill Simon Jr., who trail the more moderate Riordan
in the polls, insisted that fealty to philosophy was the thing that
mattered most.</LD>
<TE>   "We're a party of principle," businessman Simon said, to wide
applause from the lunch crowd of 850 of the GOP's most faithful
followers. "We don't need to nominate someone just because the
chattering elite say he can win."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have more than just the name ID," echoed Jones,
California's secretary of state. "You have to believe in the basic
philosophy of the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   But former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan, saying he has been a
Republican "all my life," parried that the party would be stuck in
permanent minority status in California until it shows a greater
tolerance for a diversity of views.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the fractious abortion issue, Riordan said the party's
official stance opposing legalized abortion tells "millions of women:
Don't support the Republican Party.... We have to respect people who
differ from us."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who has been battered by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis over
whether his stance on abortion is as moderate as he claims, explained
his position this way: "I very strongly dislike abortion. But I just
as strongly respect the right of a woman to make a choice with
respect to her own body."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Simon and Jones reiterated their opposition to
legalized abortion, with Jones citing exceptions in the cases of
rape, incest or to spare the life of the mother.</TE>
<TE>   As the front-runner with just over three weeks to go until the
March 5 primary, Riordan was confronted at virtually every turn.</TE>
<TE>   He was forced to defend his oversight of the Los Angeles Police
Department during eight years as mayor as well as his financial
support for Democratic candidates and causes over the years.</TE>
<TE>   He twice expressed regrets: for a 1991 interview calling abortion
murder--a moment highlighted in one of Davis' TV ads--and for giving
a $1,000 contribution to liberal Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Until my dying day I will regret that," Riordan said to cheers
and laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates spent time back on their heels as well.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was forced to defend his support for a $7-billion tax hike
under Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in the depths of the early 1990s
recession, when Jones was an assemblyman. At the time, Jones said,
the state's shortfall was roughly 30% to 40% of the state budget,
compared with 12% today. That is the key difference, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the real difference is Bill now is running for governor,"
Simon shot back.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Palisades millionaire, making his first run for
political office, abjectly apologized for his failure to vote in
several of the party's past primary elections. "I have no excuse," he
said. "I should have voted."</TE>
<TE>   Debate Turns Personal at Times</TE>
<TE>   The debate, the second among the GOP's three top contenders,
proved a far more lively meeting than the first, held last month just
a few miles away on the San Jose State University campus.</TE>
<TE>   The session Saturday was the luncheon special at the party's
semiannual convention, and the audience members cheered, hooted,
jeered and chortled despite an admonition at the start to refrain
from any demonstrations until the end of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Whether goaded by the crowd or the oncoming election day, the
candidates engaged in several pungent exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   One turned highly personal when Simon chided the ex-mayor for
failing to provide a detailed state budget plan and also questioned
his tax-cutting credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, clearly agitated, noted that he and Simon were fellow
parishioners at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica. Turning
to face his rival, Riordan said, "I think you ought to be ashamed
about the folklore that came out of your mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Later, at a post-debate news conference, Simon shrugged off that
admonition. "You're going to have to highlight differences between
the candidates," said Simon, who has been hesitant throughout most of
the campaign to do so.</TE>
<TE>   At another point in the debate, the 71-year-old Riordan used humor
to lance a question about his age and physical aptitude.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting a line that President Ronald Reagan famously used in 1984
against the younger Walter Mondale, Riordan told the questioner--Cy
Musiker of KQED radio--he would not hold his youth and inexperience
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I know much more today than I did when I was your age," Riordan
told the 49-year-old Musiker, to laughs and applause. "And I learn
something new every day."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates, wearing identical-looking dark suits, white shirts
and muted ties, slipped comfortably into the roles they have played
throughout the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has spent 20 years in politics and stands as the sole
Republican left in statewide office, repeatedly touted his years of
loyal service to the party and his experience in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He praised his role pushing the state's "three-strikes" anti-crime
legislation and sarcastically welcomed Riordan and Simon to the GOP
convention, expressing hope they would find cause to come again.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not enough to come to the party only when you need the
party," Jones said. "It is not enough, Dick, to come to the party
with a record of giving to Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   The only way to beat Davis, Jones said, was with a candidate "who
has a message and who has a record. I have that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon called himself the "candidate of ideas" and the only one of
those running who has produced detailed proposals on such issues as
economic stimulus, schools and the state's aging infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   True to his free-market philosophy, he repeatedly extolled the
virtues of the private sector over government. "I think that private
solutions should be emphasized to the greatest degree possible,"
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   He was pressed by one of the media panelists about his
conservative stance on issues such as abortion and gun control.
Although those stands appeal to core Republican voters, they would
seem to resonate less well with the rest of the state's more moderate
electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he would broaden his appeal in a general election, Simon
replied that his policies on the economy, education and such workaday
matters as water and traffic congestion "will help all Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan emphasized his nonpartisan stewardship of Los Angeles,
citing the city's eight straight balanced budgets--required by
law--and said he would bring a similarly pragmatic approach to
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He called himself the most electable Republican in November,
saying that was why Davis has launched an unusual series of
preemptive attack advertisements in the midst of the GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also defended the LAPD, saying the officers involved in
the Rampart scandal were rogue exceptions to an otherwise upstanding
force. "To taint the whole Police Department with that is wrong,"
Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Trouble Within the Party</TE>
<TE>   Feelings have turned raw among Republicans as the race has
progressed. That was highlighted at a news conference on the eve of
Saturday's debate, when former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian--a
Jones backer--and several other GOP luminaries said they would not
support Riordan should he win the nomination on March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian has a particularly personal gripe against Riordan, who
lavishly funded his rival, Tom Bradley, when the Democratic mayor of
Los Angeles waged two futile runs for governor in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Asked during the debate about Deukmejian's comments, Riordan said,
"George has a bad memory. The only things he remembers are his
grudges."</TE>
<TE>   The statement drew gasps and groans from the audience, and at a
news conference afterward, Riordan expressed regrets for the third
time Saturday. He called it a failed stab at humor that "didn't go
over too well."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates will debate for the third and final time Wednesday,
when they meet at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>Center Helps Bring Life to a Dead-End Street</HD>
<DH>Community: Mar Vista facility's effective educational and
counseling programs played a role in turning a neighborhood around.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slauson Avenue slices hard through a Mar Vista neighborhood of low
and sometimes sagging apartments before coming to an abrupt dead end.
This is where a notorious gang once prowled, boozed and plotted
revenge and practically held a whole neighborhood hostage.</LD>
<LD>   The dead end seemed to imply that if you come from this stretch of
Slauson, the street won't let you go far.</LD>
<LD>   "It was hard for people to imagine much beyond here," said Tammi
Peterson, who has raised two children in the neighborhood. The area,
dubbed "Little Tijuana" by many residents, spreads around a small
chunk of Slauson sandwiched between Culver City and Venice.
Encompassing a housing project, it long had a reputation as a hotspot
fought over by Latino and black gangs.</LD>
<TE>   "Times have changed," Peterson said. "Today, there's actually a
lot of hope."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the hope, say those who live here, comes from the work
done at the Mar Vista Family Center, a small, two-building complex
that sits at the dead end.</TE>
<TE>   Just over two decades old, the center has steadily gained a
powerful hold on this small patch of West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians credit its mix of educational programs and counseling
with helping make broken families whole. Police herald it for helping
calm what was once one of the city's most troubled
neighborhoods--crime is down nearly 40% in the last five years.
Parents in the area say they feel better about their children's
future.</TE>
<TE>   The center, meanwhile, has gained national notice. Over the last
several years there has been recognition from the Children's Defense
Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group known for its advocacy
work; a commendation from then-Vice President Al Gore; and a visit
from then-first lady Hillary Clinton. "This is the village that we
talk about, that I wrote about," she said, while touring the grounds,
in reference to her book, "It Takes a Village to Raise a Child." Most
recently, the center was given a $500,000 grant from the
Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation. The money can be used
however the center pleases. Part of it may go to boost an ongoing
fund-raising effort aimed at adding another building, creating space
for a cafe, library and senior center.</TE>
<TE>   "There are few places in the county like Mar Vista," said Kathleen
Noonan, a Casey associate who travels coast-to-coast studying
outstanding grass-roots programs. "They are literally transforming a
neighborhood that was once ravaged. If we can duplicate what they
have there, we'd solve a lot of problems."</TE>
<TE>   Noonan spelled out a number of reasons why she feels Mar Vista is
so unusual.</TE>
<TE>   As is implied by its name, the center embraces entire families.
All told, an average of 500 residents take advantage of the
nonprofit's services each week. For teens, there's a well-established
tutorial plan and a school for dropouts. For parents bringing their
kids to the thriving preschool, there are mandatory classes covering
everything from child-rearing to stress management to creating
healthy marriages.</TE>
<TE>   When they feel ready, parents can take classes in child
development provided by UCLA, whose teachers come to Mar Vista.
Scores of once poorly educated parents have ended up taking the UCLA
classes. Many have earned enough credits to get jobs as assistant
teachers in local schools.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most distinctive, Noonan said, is the grass-roots nature
of the place. When the Mar Vista Family Center began, its leaders,
educators and social workers from outside the neighborhood set a
singular goal: Within a decade they would turn over the reins to
community members trained to become the new leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "If the center was going to be a success, the people living in the
neighborhood needed to run it," said Betty Factor, who founded the
center. "What we needed was to find that one special person, someone
capable of leading. It's clear we found her."</TE>
<TE>   That woman is Lucia Diaz, now the executive director of the
center, which runs on an annual budget of $1 million, raised mostly
through government grants and a mix of corporate, foundation and
individual giving.</TE>
<TE>   A small woman with long black hair and bright, intelligent eyes,
Diaz was once a parent seeking help from the center. She entered its
doors for the first time in the early 1980s, a young mother fresh
from her native Mexico. She was poor, worked as a maid and had little
understanding of how to raise a child. Frustration at times almost
made her react with fury when dealing with her infant daughter and
young son.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz says she came to the center after her daughter one day said
that what she hoped for out of life was to follow in her mom's
footsteps; she wanted to be a maid.</TE>
<TE>   "That made me shudder," said Diaz, 43. "I did not want my daughter
to follow my footsteps. I knew there was more for her in this life
... and for me."</TE>
<TE>   Living about a mile from the center, Diaz was determined to learn
how to be a better parent. Too poor to afford a stroller, she'd plop
her daughter in a grocery cart and wheel her off to the center,
walking fast down Slauson Avenue, where one year 10 gang members were
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the start, Diaz was a leader.</TE>
<TE>   Though she barely spoke English, Diaz volunteered to counsel other
parents--those who only spoke English. She rapidly took to the
center's emphasis on nurturing kids with patience and gentleness. She
took advantage of the UCLA child development classes, giving her
enough experience to begin working at the center.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Diaz proved so successful that she became the
nonprofit's program director in 1986 and its chief executive nine
years later.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people lead with fiery personalities. Lucia leads with
humility and grace," said Noonan of the Casey foundation. "It seems
like every moment, even the small moments, she sees as an opportunity
to reach people ... especially children."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz' bottom-line philosophy is that everyone can learn to take
responsibility for themselves, adults and toddlers alike. Even the
smallest children are encouraged to find ways to probe their
feelings, to learn how to talk out problems and share solutions.</TE>
<TE>   As Diaz walked through the center's playground on a recent day,
3-year-old Frida and her ponytailed, pink-shirted playmate Andrea, 4,
got into a loud tussle over who should carry a bucket of water. They
both began to cry and wail.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz held them close, reminded them that problems are to be solved
with words and offered to take them to what is known as the "talking
rug," a space cordoned off for toddlers needing to ease frustration.
Soon after, Frida and Andrea apologized to one another.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz stepped aside with a smile. "We put a lot of trust in the
idea that all of us, even the very small and the very young, can
still find a way" toward self-empowerment, Diaz said. "We feel having
this way of thinking is one way for our community to change."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy is used on the neighborhood's toughest characters
as well.</TE>
<TE>   The center makes a point to reach out to the gangs that once tore
the neighborhood apart. Slauson Avenue has long been known as the
stomping grounds for the Westside gang known as the Culver City Boys,
the group that once hung out at the dead end. Bent on intimidation
and reclaiming their space, police say the gang in 1980 set fire to
the center, leaving its insignia throughout the charred rubble.
Despite a once-rocky relationship, the center today works hard to
ensure gang members who come for help are treated with respect and
dignity. It's the best way to get them to turn around, said Diaz, who
has worked closely with police and Mayor James K. Hahn to ensure that
gang members could gather at the center for counseling and tutorials
without violating an injunction forbidding gangs from clustering
together.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the center's most successful parents, and many of Slauson
Avenue's strongest and most positive leaders, were once deeply
involved in gang life.</TE>
<TE>   "This place does not shy from you just because you have been
involved in doing some dirt," said Victor Chavez, a former gang
member.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, 33, sends his kids to the center's preschool, attends its
adult counseling classes, volunteers at its community cleanups and
works full time as a gardener. As he spoke, he stood in the dead-end
street, looking north down Slauson Avenue. The street was calm and
children strolled carefree.</TE>
<TE>   "This place meets you where you are, if you are old or if you are
practically a baby," he said. "We've all come a long way because of
it, this whole community. Thank God for that."</TE>

<LD>Firefighters from three agencies were fighting to control a large
brush fire east of Anaheim Hills on Saturday night, but officials
said they were confident no homes were in jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   The fire erupted about 9 p.m. and had consumed 40 to 50 acres of
brush near the Coal Canyon offramp on the Riverside Freeway, said
police Sgt. Dave Kussman.</LD>
<LD>   Efforts to battle the fire were hampered by 20 mph winds that were
pushing the blaze in a southwest direction toward Anaheim Hills,
Kussman said.</LD>
<TE>   Still, firefighters estimated the fire was several hours away from
any homes, and police and fire officials were not evacuating any

<HD>Winds Are Final Insult to Tree</HD>
<DH>History: Moving ficus to allow development killed it,
observers say. Councilman laments 'tragic mistake.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A historic Ficus Rubiginosa, one of the oldest and largest trees in
Orange and the object of a two-year campaign to protect it from a
developer's bulldozers, toppled over in 45-mph winds Saturday, the
apparent victim of the very act that saved it.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a landmark in east Orange," Councilman Dan Slater said of
the 100-foot, 150-ton tree in the parking area of the Ralphs Market
at 2620 E. Chapman. "This is a great loss for the city."</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported when the tree fell about 9 a.m. during
brisk Santa Ana winds. Planted in the early 1900s by rancher Thomas
Flippen near his house, the tree--also called a Morton Bay Fig--was
listed by the city in 1973 as historic and worthy of protection. In
1992, however, its fate came into question when the owners of Lucky's
Market, on whose property it stood, decided to remove it to expand
their facility.</LD>
<TE>   Public outcry eventually led to a plan to save the tree by moving
it about 150 feet. The move--described at the time as the most
ambitious project of its kind in California history--took place in
1997 at a cost of about $100,000, paid for by the market at the site,
which had become a Ralphs.</TE>
<TE>   Several observers said Saturday that the move apparently weakened
the tree's root system, paving the way for its demise.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving the tree killed it," said Slater, who was elected shortly
before the plan was approved. "Arborists warned us that that would
happen and now it has. It's that simple. If the tree hadn't been
moved it would still be alive and healthy today. It was a tragic
mistake that I regret."</TE>
<TE>   About $50,000 in damage was done to the market, Slater said, and
two cars parked in the lot suffered damage totaling about $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Mark Murphy said he would ask city staff to investigate the
causes and ramifications of the fall. "While there is no way to
replace this tree," he said, "I want to make sure that a tree is
replanted at that location of a formidable size to continue the
heritage. I don't want to see the tree forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Slater agreed. "I think a lot of people will miss this tree."</TE>

<HD>Finally Tackling L.A.'s Worst Air Polluter</HD>
<DH>Harbor: Twin ports add more to smog than any other site,
but have been little regulated. Officials seek to protect health but
not hurt the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A container ship as long as three football fields glides into the
still waters of the Port of Los Angeles, where it disgorges sneakers,
electronic components and a plume of black exhaust.</LD>
<LD>   With each docking and departure, one ship pumps an average of four
tons of pollutants into the skies. On a typical day, 16 container
ships arrive at the port complex that stretches from San Pedro to
Long Beach, releasing more smog-forming gases than 1 million cars, or
more than twice as much as all of the power plants in the Los Angeles
Basin.</LD>
<LD>   No other facility produces more air pollution than the port
complex, and air quality officials have known it for a long time.
Though strict regulations have been imposed on polluters across
California, the L.A. ports have gone largely unregulated for a
variety of reasons, from lack of jurisdiction over foreign-flagged
ships to fears of losing trade to other cities.</LD>
<TE>   Now, officials are struggling to craft new rules that will protect
people's health without jeopardizing the economic benefits of being
the nation's busiest waterfront. There's a lot on the line.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex is a gateway to one
quarter of a trillion dollars in Pacific Rim and Latin American
trade. As trade continues to grow, ship emissions are expected to
double in the next 20 years in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   And the big cargo ships are not the only serious source of
pollution. Tugboats, harbor craft and fishing fleets add 11 tons
daily, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.</TE>
<TE>   Onshore, hundreds of trucks laden with computers from Japan, toys
from China and furniture from Malaysia rumble over the Vincent Thomas
Bridge toward distant cities. Smaller "yard tractors" scurry like
beetles stacking containers on the docks under a pall of haze that
stretches to the Long Beach skyline and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Though nearby communities such as Wilmington and San Pedro get the
worst of it, onshore breezes blow the pollution inland, where it
forms ozone, an acutely toxic gas, and haze that blankets suburban
valleys. Smog causes bronchitis, lung irritation and chest pains.
Microscopic specks of unburned fuel are linked to cancer, asthma and
heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, Santa Barbara County's chief smog fighter, Douglas
Allard, has identified 102 smoky ships as "frequent fliers." They are
vessels that routinely visit California waters, traveling the
shipping lanes between the Channel Islands and the mainland, although
there are no plans to clean them up.</TE>
<TE>   In 15 years vessel smokestacks will account for two-thirds of the
county's smog-forming gases, too much to maintain healthy, blue
skies, Allard said.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the open ocean, scientists say ship smog spreads farther
than previously thought. Soot from smokestacks adds to haze and traps
heat from the sun, which scientists say contributes to global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   "For most people, this is an invisible industry. You know when you
get stuck behind a truck that smells dirty, but people are not even
aware that 65% of all consumer goods are transported by ships," said
James J. Corbett, professor of marine policy at the University of
Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to controlling emissions from ships," he said,
"we're just at the beginning stages, about where we were in 1965 with
cars. The industry is beginning to make the transition toward
cleaning up, but it's the least regulated source of all."</TE>
<TE>   Millions in Incentives for Cleaner Vessels</TE>
<TE>   To control emissions from L.A.'s harbor, air quality officials
have provided $22 million in incentives in the last few years for
low-polluting barges, passenger ferries and tugboats.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the giant cranes that unload cargo containers are now
electric-powered. About two-thirds of the ships have reduced speed as
they enter the harbors under a voluntary program, reducing nitrogen
oxide emissions by about two tons daily.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn persuaded the Harbor
Commission to adopt a goal of "no net increase" in emissions from the
port, although it is unclear how that will be achieved.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has primary
authority over ship exhaust, two years ago enacted the first
emissions standards for boats, including ferries, fishing vessels and
tugboats. Those limits apply only to new vessels and take effect
between 2004 and 2007.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit by environmentalists forced the EPA to propose the
nation's first emissions limits for oceangoing ships. A draft
proposal covering new, U.S.-registered vessels is due April 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We're stepping up to the plate. We're as concerned about this as
anybody else," said Jean-Marie Revelt of the EPA's Office of
Transportation and Air Quality.</TE>
<TE>   But air pollution is outrunning the remedies.</TE>
<TE>   In the next decade, cargo shipments are expected to grow 100%,
port official say. Berths are expanding to accommodate increased
traffic, high-speed rail lines are being built to move cargo more
efficiently and ships are getting bigger and carrying more
containers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're completely dissatisfied with the regulatory approach," said
Russell Long, executive director of the Bluewater Network, the San
Francisco-based environmental advocacy group that sued the EPA over
ship smog. "There's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be
done. It's a shame this has been on the back burner so long."</TE>
<TE>   The shipping industry has escaped a cleanup partly because of the
economic clout it wields. Last month, President Bush stood on a dock
in Louisiana and proclaimed that expanded trade will lead the nation
out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, port officials acknowledge that regulation must be
gradual and careful or ships will pull up anchor and head for other
ports, taking jobs with them.</TE>
<TE>   "In cleaning up, we must not put ourselves at a competitive
disadvantage to other ports," said T.L. Garrett, environmental
scientist for the Port of Los Angeles. "I'd love to tell you cleaning
up these boats was easy, but it's not or it would have been done a
long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Government agencies in this country have limited authority over
maritime pollution, since many of the ships that visit U.S. ports are
based in foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, a number of countries agreed in principle to control
pollution from ships, but they deferred specific action to cut
exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four years later, the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution From Ships was amended, and for the first
time set limits on sulfur in fuel and emissions of nitrogen oxides, a
precursor to smog.</TE>
<TE>   Yet today, too few nations have ratified the agreement to make it
binding. Although government officials say voluntary compliance is
high, the limits are so lenient that they allow 50% more sulfur in
fuel than ships typically use.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo ships are powered by house-size engines that are cheap to
run and have changed little since diesel engines replaced steamships
in the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The ships can last for 40 years, so replacing them with
cleaner-burning new models is a slow process. Most ships have no
pollution controls and burn "bunker fuel," low-grade petroleum that
produces about 50 times more haze-forming pollutants than the
dirtiest diesel trucks on U.S. highways.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Budget Eliminates Funds for Retrofitting</TE>
<TE>   Not even the United States requires existing ships to retrofit
with clean technologies, although some improvements have been made on
smaller vessels. California had paid for that work using state funds,
but Gov. Gray Davis' new budget eliminates the program to help make
up a projected $12-billion budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few places in the U.S. and Europe where aggressive
measures are being pursued.</TE>
<TE>   In Sweden, low-polluting ships pay discounted fees to unload goods
in harbors, while large portions of the Baltic and North seas have
been designated "emissions-control areas," where only vessels
equipped with low-polluting technologies can operate.</TE>
<TE>   Houston authorities are powering harbor boats and other equipment
with cleaner-burning diesel fuel, a method being studied for the L.A.
harbors.</TE>
<TE>   In Alaska, cruise ships get electricity from docks so vessels do
not run diesel engines to keep lights and pumps running. But port
officials in Los Angeles say dockside electrification doesn't work
for all vessels and is too costly.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhoods in the harbor area bear the brunt of the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   A recent AQMD study shows that diesel exhaust from ships, trucks
and trains is so prevalent around the ports that people living near
Wilmington are subject to significantly greater risk of cancer than
people living elsewhere in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in Wilmington and San Pedro are the ones who pay the
price so everyone else can have bananas in winter," said Dr. John
Miller, an emergency room physician who has lived in Wilmington for
22 years. "I think it's unfair the burden of this falls
disproportionately on the shoulders of people who are economically
disenfranchised."</TE>
<TE>   Wilmington is an industrial, mostly Latino community, its skyline
dominated by spires poking up from oil refineries.</TE>
<TE>   Ships pass so close to neighborhoods that the vessels seem to be
moving through the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning, hundreds of trucks jam the Harbor Freeway to pick
up goods from the ports. About 34,000 move in and out of the harbor
each year, and the number of trips is expected to triple in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   A big American flag at the Wilmington Avenue offramp is coated in
grime.</TE>
<TE>   "At 5 or 6 in morning, you can smell the exhaust in the air," said
Jesse Marquez of the Wilmington Coalition for a Safe Environment. "We
know they are going to have new trucks and port expansion; we just
don't want to die in the process."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the slow pace of cleanup, the Legislature is
beginning to regulate pollution at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach) sponsored a
law that required port officials to cover enormous piles of coke, a
byproduct of oil refining that can cause cancer if inhaled in
sufficient quantities.</TE>
<TE>   The AQMD had delayed controls on the coke piles when port
officials complained about costs, even though residents said black
dust was soiling their cars and laundry and the U.S Customs Service
and the Los Angeles Fire Department had relocated operations away
from Terminal Island to protect workers. Today, large pipes and
towering concrete domes cover the coke piles.</TE>
<TE>   "The ports are part of a greater community, and the environment
there does not just impact the ports, but the neighborhoods around
them as well," Lowenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   "The regulators have taken a long time to come to grips with the
impacts of this giant economic engine," he said.</TE>

<LD>Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   --F. Scott Fitzgerald</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   All the wannabes who watch the surfing scene and all the hodaddies
who actually hit the water are following in the wet footsteps of
George Douglas Freeth Jr., the Anglo Hawaiian phenomenon who brought
surfing to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80 years after his death, many of Southern California's
normally irreverent surfers and lifeguards still regard Freeth as a
god. Billed by promoters as "the man who walked on water," he was the
first person to hang 10--walk the nose of the surfboard. He also was
the region's first official lifeguard.</TE>
<TE>   He popularized the Australian crawl, invented the torpedo-shaped
rescue buoy and introduced water polo to the West Coast--all legacies
that endure to this day.</TE>
<TE>   He also won a congressional medal for heroism.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, he trained a generation of lifeguards, saved
hundreds of lives himself and set a standard of athletic excellence
that others have tried to emulate ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Freeth was born on the island of Oahu in 1883 to a prominent
Hawaiian family.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an English sea captain and a well-heeled half-Hawaiian,
half-English mother, he took to the ocean at an early age to swim,
high-dive and surf. He revived the once-banned Hawaiian sport of
surfing, which New England missionaries had deplored and then
outlawed because of its "immodesty and idleness."</TE>
<TE>   His surfing and swimming prowess caught the attention of several
writers, including novelist Jack London, who immortalized him in an
essay on sports as "a Mercury--a brown Mercury. His heels are winged,
and in them is the swiftness of the sea."</TE>
<TE>   In July 1907, bearing a letter of introduction from the author,
Freeth, 23, left Hawaii for the first time and sailed to the
mainland. An official member of the Hawaii promotion committee, he
touted tourism to the islands and demonstrated surfing in California.</TE>
<TE>   His timing could not have been better. Two months before Freeth's
arrival, Venice and Redondo Beach were on their way to becoming dream
beach communities. Pacific Electric Railway developer Henry
Huntington ran a trolley to the marshland he owned and was busy
promoting Redondo Beach, while his friend and sometimes rival, Abbot
Kinney, had already built a utopian residential community and theme
park a dozen miles away in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   To lure buyers and tap into the fitness craze sweeping the nation,
both developers built indoor saltwater plunges.</TE>
<TE>   But out on the ocean, even experienced swimmers were drowning at
alarming rates. Potential buyers afraid for their children's safety
were reluctant to buy near the beach, wrote lifeguard and history
professor Arthur C. Verge in a California History article, "George
Freeth: King of the Surfers and California's Forgotten Hero."</TE>
<TE>   To help Huntington and Kinney in their sales job, 28 men formed
the volunteer Venice Lifesaving Crew. But after one of them drowned
in front of his stunned crew mates, it triggered fund-raising for
training and equipment for volunteer lifeguards.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californian beachgoers first spotted Freeth gliding
across the waves off Venice on his 200-pound, 8-foot-long solid wood
surfboard. He quickly made newspaper headlines throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Kinney and Huntington were soon knocking at his door, and Freeth
began dividing his time between the two resorts, where he gave
crowd-pleasing surfing performances. But his bread-and-butter came
from teaching swimming and diving at the Venice and Redondo pools.</TE>
<TE>   Freeth's chief concern was water safety. In his free time, he
trained young swimmers to become lifeguards, showing them how to use
rip currents to help speed them out to victims. The technique, which
is still used today, was responsible for saving hundreds of lives in
the first five years it was used, according to Verge.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 16, 1908, a sudden squall blew in from the Pacific and
slammed into Santa Monica Bay. Freeth was standing on the Venice Pier
as huge waves broke in front of him, and he watched Japanese fishing
boats bob in the bay. When one began to sink, Freeth broke into a
run, hurled himself into an oncoming wave and swam through the gale
to reach the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Within a matter of moments, he would bring seven fishermen safely
to shore. Freeth held on to the men, one or sometimes two at a time,
barely cresting the first wave as the water pitched and rolled toward
shore. Again and again, he plunged into the frigid surf as thousands
of spectators watched.</TE>
<TE>   While his fellow lifesavers tried for more than an hour to launch
the lifeboat in repeated avalanches of water, Freeth dived in one
last time to keep four more fishermen afloat until the lifeboat
finally rescued them. No one drowned.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls crowded around just to pat his tanned shoulders and smile
at him," reported the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   The rescued fishermen gave Freeth a gold watch, donated money to
the lifeguard fund and changed the name of their village near Pacific
Palisades from Maikura to Port Freeth. The village was destroyed by
fire five years later.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two years after the heroic rescue, Freeth received the
Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor for
bravery. It recognized his lifesaving techniques, which were being
adopted throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Freeth continued to pioneer modern lifeguard procedures. He
preached the importance of quick action, and showed that boats and
rowing crews took too long to reach victims. He warned swimmers of
potential dangers and invented the red torpedo-shaped safety "can," a
flotation device that is now standard issue for ocean lifeguards the
world over.</TE>
<TE>   Never charging a dime for his ideas or mentoring, he turned pupils
into well-rounded athletes, teaching children and adults confidence
and fearlessness of the water.</TE>
<TE>   During the off-season, he conditioned volunteer lifeguards by
organizing the West Coast's first water polo teams. In 1909, he began
to teach high-diving from the rafters of Huntington's new plunge. The
facility was equipped with a phone so that if someone was at risk of
drowning outside at the beach, Freeth could be summoned.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach city fathers pitched in and bought him a motorcycle
with a sidecar to patrol the shoreline and paid him $25 a month as a
special lifeguard.</TE>
<TE>   Without realizing it, that stipend ruined his hopes of competing
in the Olympics. It made him ineligible for the 1912 Games. By the
rules of amateurism, Freeth was a professional with a paying job.</TE>
<TE>   Although Freeth never made it to Stockholm that year, his good
friend Duke Kahanamoku did and won the 100-meter freestyle, for the
first of five Olympic swimming medals in his career. Later, under
Freeth's guidance, Kahanamoku would improve his freestyle stroke and
turns in the pool at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, where Freeth
coached the club's swim team. Kahanamoku called Freeth "the world's
greatest diver."</TE>
<TE>   In 1915, Freeth headed to San Diego, moving from seasonal job to
seasonal job. Three years later, when the military began training a
million recruits for World War I, Ocean Beach overflowed with
thousands of swimmers. Without professional lifeguards, 13 men
drowned the first week of May 1918.</TE>
<TE>   The resort owners, fearing financial ruin, hired Freeth as a
lifeguard. That summer, large crowds flocked to the beach to watch
Freeth turn somersaults in the air from his surfboard, then regain
his balance and surf on in to the beach. Not a single swimmer drowned
on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, at the age of 35, this exceptionally fit man became one
of the millions of young and healthy people who died in the brutal
Spanish influenza epidemic that wiped out 20 million people
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The pier at Redondo Beach has a sculpture of Freeth's face.</TE>
<TE>   "Freeth was never a man of money; instead, he was a man of deeds,"
Verge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   What he had in the way of worldly goods when he died could fit in
the same small suitcase that he had brought to California a dozen
years earlier.</TE>

<HD>Gust-Driven Fire Destroys Orange Home</HD>
<DH>Weather: Firefighters--and tile roofs--keep the flames in
check. More winds are expected today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 80 firefighters descended on a wind-buffeted hillside
neighborhood of half-million-dollar-plus homes in Orange on Saturday
morning to battle a blaze that destroyed one house and ignited three
spot fires nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Forty- to 50-mph Santa Ana winds and a wood shingle roof sent
glowing embers floating through the community.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors and firefighters said they were relieved that the fire
didn't spread.</LD>
<TE>   "It could have been hundreds of houses," Orange Battalion Chief
Frank Eickhoff said. "With these kind of fires on a Santa Ana wind
day, you have the potential of having a Laguna or Oakland Hills."</TE>
<TE>   A 1993 Laguna Beach wildfire destroyed more than 300 homes. In
1991, an Oakland Hills fire destroyed 3,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hurt in the 8 a.m. fire in the 3400 block of East
Westridge Drive, where Mike Ernst, his wife and three children had
been renting for several years. The family paced the street, cried
and sought comfort from friends as they watched the house burn.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the shower; I smelled smoke," said Amy Ernst, 18, the
only family member at home when the fire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Mike Tuggle said the teenager woke a friend who was asleep
in another room. Both young women told firefighters they saw flames
coming from the garage.</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling two-story house was gutted, as was a small sedan
parked in the driveway. Investigators determined that a
malfunctioning water heater caught fire in the garage and flames
quickly roared through the home. Fire officials said the structure
and contents were valued at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Santa Ana winds start up, this is your greatest fear,"
said Ernst family friend Julie Cicero. "This is awful. They are
devastated. All their family pictures. All their sports pictures. The
things you can't replace."</TE>
<TE>   When next-door neighbors Sherry and Anthony Sosnowski saw the
fire, they called 911, then grabbed water hoses and immediately
doused plants and bushes.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Buttress lives across the street. When she opened her front
door, she said she could feel intense heat and see flames shooting 20
to 30 feet into the air. The smoke was so black and thick, she
couldn't see to the end of the block.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, both stories and the car were engulfed in flames,
she said. Firefighters tried to extinguish the blaze to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   A helicopter helped guide firefighters stationed throughout the
neighborhood at the northern edge of Villa Park to smaller blazes on
roofs and in palm trees.</TE>
<TE>   One street away, Bruce McCann and his family were awakened by the
sound of people on their roof. He walked outside and saw smoke
billowing from his wood shingles and firefighters working quickly to
put out a small fire. He was unaware that his house was on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that in five minutes, the roof would have been gone,"
McCann said. "God saved me this time, but I'm going to have to dig in
and (get a new roof)."Throughout the neighborhood, homeowners have
been replacing shingle roofs with Spanish or concrete tiles. Pat
Buttress, head of the architecture committee for the homeowners
association, has approved six or seven new roofs since August. "I
have a feeling there will be a lot more," she said, including her
own. "I am changing it out next week. I don't want the risk. It's a
real wake-up call when you see what fire will do to a wood-shake
roof."</TE>
<TE>   Warnings for high winds were in force for much of Southern
California on Saturday. Winds were 35 to 50 mph in some areas, with
local gusts over 60 mph. The warnings were expected to continue
through 2 p.m. today, the National Weather Service said.</TE>

<HD>The Koran as a Classroom Lesson? At the Right Time, Yes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I get many things from my mother, but usually not news tips. Yet
there she was on the phone a couple of weeks ago, asking if I'd heard
about the school in California where students were being taught from
the Koran. She wondered if it were possible.</LD>
<LD>   Not likely, I said. For one thing, they wouldn't be able to teach
religion in a public school. More to the point, I told her, I was
sure I'd have read something about it had it been true. We then moved
on to the more serious subject of how I liked my new mini-blinds.</LD>
<LD>   Subject forgotten, until last week when I saw a story from a
Garden Grove-based Christian wire service known as ASSIST News
Service. And there it was.</LD>
<TE>   A school district in Contra Costa County in Northern California
had taken some heat over a lesson in which 7th-graders at Byron
Intermediate School had to wear Muslim garb, learn how Muslims pray,
memorize Islam's Five Pillars of Faith, and discuss and act out other
Islamic practices and beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   It was a role-playing exercise for a reputable teaching program
known as History Alive.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt many people would give any of this a second thought,
except that the exercise apparently was taught not long after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attack by Islamic extremists. If nothing else,
that put the timing of the class exercise in question.</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, however, Karen Hershenson, a Contra Costa Times
columnist who defended the classroom program, said the detractors
seemed more upset by the "teaching" of Islam than they did with the
lesson's proximity to the Sept. 11 attack.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense was that [the local protests] were all about teaching
prayer in schools," Hershenson says. In so many words, if schools are
teaching Islam, why not Christianity?</TE>
<TE>   I'll let readers figure out for themselves whether a couple of
days discussing in class the tenets of one of the world's major
religions--albeit one many Americans don't know much
about--constitutes prayer in schools. The real question you want
answered is whether the lesson was taught in Orange County schools.</TE>
<TE>   Two county Department of Education officials say they aren't sure.
Both say the same lesson plan is available to Orange County teachers,
but don't know whether any teachers used it. However, no directives
were issued that teachers were not to use the lesson.</TE>
<TE>   All right, then, let's take on that question: Should it have been
used, when events of Sept. 11 are so fresh in our minds?</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple schools of thought after Sept. 11," says
Deborah Granger, the coordinator of history and social sciences
programs for the county's public schools. "One was, you stay way far
away from Islam and pretend like it's not there. It's too hot a
button to press. Others said, 'We want our students to understand who
these people are, where they come from, so they [students] are not
frightened about what's going on, and it will help them with a better
sense of understanding.'"</TE>
<TE>   Asst. Supt. Linda MacDonnell says the question of using such
material is best left to the teacher: "It's a judgment call. If you
know your kids, and have a really good relationship with the kids and
they trust you, you can teach anything."</TE>
<TE>   Why not teach such a lesson? "The only thing I can think of is the
emotional environment, if the kids are fearful ... [if] they saw the
planes go into the towers, saw the destruction," MacDonnell says. "If
this raises more anxiety, that isn't something we want. But we can't
turn our backs on it. I'm glad you brought this up."</TE>
<TE>   I asked both administrators-- who are former teachers--what they
would have done. "That's a tough question," Granger says. "I don't
know if there is a right answer to that."</TE>
<TE>   The parent in her, she says, would want her teenagers to learn
about Islam. The educator in her tells her that teaching a lesson so
potentially controversial, so close to the Sept. 11 trauma, should be
preceded at minimum by a teacher informing the parents of students
who might take part.</TE>
<TE>   My instinct--just a gut feeling, nothing more--would have been not
to use a lesson that dramatic last September. It's hard to see how
that would have been the optimal time to get the historical points
across.</TE>
<TE>   But I give straight F's to those who said such instruction had no
place in the classroom. Especially, as was the case in Contra Costa
County, when the students were already studying the Middle East and
Islam when the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, according to Hershenson.</TE>
<TE>   The Christian news service says lawsuits may be filed against the
district over the issue. I couldn't confirm that, but let 'em sue.
Maybe they'll believe a judge when he tells them how silly their
argument is.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Why did Kim Murphy choose to revisit the story of Tom Wales now,
months after his murder took place ("Tom Wales Fought for Gun Control.
Maybe He Died for It," Jan. 13)? No substantive new information has been
presented since October, when she wrote several Times articles about the
Wales case. In fact, police won't even reveal what kind of firearm was
used, let alone any significant details that might be newsworthy. Is it
just coincidence that both the Washington and California state
legislatures are going back into session about now, with a raft of
gun-control bills waiting in the wings? Looks to me as if this article
was printed just to stir up the gun debate caldron.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks A. Pangburn</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find the Tom Wales story to be a prime case of irresponsible
journalism. It describes Wales as a low-level Washington state bureaucrat
who was the voice of many liberal fringe organizations and causes, and
who had the kind of "in-your-face" personality that aggravated people at
every level. Yet of all the unpopular causes and organizations that he
was involved with, you print a story that draws the unsubstantiated
conclusion that the NRA or one of the local gun organizations had him
killed because, among other things, he was pro-gun control. This is
outrageous. He was killed by one of the many people who knew him because
he had the personality to drive people to do it.</TE>

<HD>A Last Word on Steve Hirsch</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am deeply disturbed by the portrayal of Steve Hirsch ("The
Actress, the Producer and Their Porn Revolution," by Ralph Frammolino and
P.J. Huffstutter, Jan. 6). You chose to paint him in a negative,
self-centered light, which could not be further from the truth. I have
been under contract with Vivid Video since 1990, and in 12 years I have
never found him to be anything but honest, trustworthy and a true friend.
I have seen him give thousands of dollars to girls who were not under
contract with him. When one ex-Vivid girl's husband left her and their
newborn baby, Hirsch gave her nearly $40,000. Do you think he ever
expected to see a dime returned? No. He did it because he cares. In 1991,
during the middle of a big-budget Vivid production, I decided I wanted to
quit. After the second day, I called Hirsch at home to tell him that I
couldn't finish the film. Did he threaten me with a lawsuit? No. He
wished me luck and said he wanted me to be happy. Through the business I
have made a very comfortable life for myself, and I never have to work a
day again. Your writers got Hirsch 100% wrong.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Kraul refers to bullfighting as a glorious tradition in
Mexico and seems concerned about its possible demise ("Last Days of the
Bullring?" Jan. 13). Perhaps we should lament the loss of other glorious
traditions that involved abuse: enslavement of the native Indian
population in Mexico and bearbaiting and cockfighting in the U.S. We need
to hasten the demise of abusive and cruel practices that stem from a time
when societies behaved in ways we find totally unacceptable today.
Cruelty for pleasure cannot be a glorious tradition. It can only be a
reminder of how close we are to the barbarism of our recent history.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Cardin</LD>
<LD>   Costa Mesa</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One wonders why, in an open and tolerant society such as that in the
U.S., bullfighting is illegal. Could it be that the unredeemed cruelty to
bulls and horses is distasteful? I believe it is. The lethal combination
of the arrogance of moral ignorance, testosterone and sadism creates a
cultural climate where such unmitigated, perverse cruelty is not only
tolerated but celebrated. Mexico is entering the 21st century, and
whatever the reasons for the decline in interest in this barbarism, I
truly rejoice. Bravo, Mexico!</TE>

<HD>Pakistan's Amazing Technicolor Dearm Quilts</HD>

<LD>Sometimes it takes a village--to make a quilt. Such is the case
with the exquisite handiwork available at Entertaining Elephants, an
eclectic home furnishings and children's boutique in Studio City. The
colorful throws are hand-quilted by groups of women in rural southern
Pakistan, where relatives and friends include them as part of a dowry,
says store owner Ellen Massee. "It takes days, if not weeks," she says.
The sturdy textile creations are used in Pakistan as rugs, carriers for
kids and for other day-to-day purposes.</LD>
<LD>   They are usually pieced together from existing material such as
religious vestments, and are meticulously stitched with intricate
borders.  "That's all they can afford sometimes," Massee, 36, says, "but
those scraps end up coming together to form beautiful things."</LD>
<LD>   Massee says that customers have been snapping up the dense, 100%
cotton throws, which cost from $220 to $280. "A lot of people are buying
them as special keepsakes for their kids," says Massee, whose 3-year-old
daughter is the inspiration behind the store. However, it has gotten more
difficult to obtain the pieces, she says. "I'm not sure how much the
elevated tensions have to do with it, but the woman I get them from tells
me they're becoming rarer," Massee says. "I'll be sad when I can't find
them anymore."</LD>

<HD>Intimate Lighting</HD>
<DH>Lamps That Glow in wood, Silk and Rice Paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>

<LD>The key to bedroom lighting is "flexibility," says designer Peri
Shefik. "That fixture over the bed is good to clean by," but "you want
several options so you can have intimate lighting or light to read by,
not one bright source."</LD>
<LD>   Shefik, 46, has been designing and manufacturing lamps for eight years
out of her downtown loft. Her handmade creations sell at chic interiors
stores such as Blueprint in West Hollywood and City Design in Los
Angeles, and they enjoy something of a cult following that owes much to
the designer's choice of materials: honey-colored paper-thin birch
plywood, delicate rice paper, sexy red Dupioni silk. "Having softer,
warmer material in the bedroom fits," says Shefik, who designed
"Flashdance"-style Lycra bodywear before turning to lighting.</LD>
<LD>   Painter Lisa Palmer and her architect husband, who are currently
between homes, had three Peri lamps in their last bedroom. "They have a
very intimate light to them," says Palmer, in addition to being
"functional pieces of art."</LD>
<TE>   Of the 20 or so designs in Shefik's line, which range from $200 to
$500, her favorites for the bedroom include the rectangular-shaded
"Joshua" lamp, whose complementary rectangular base is weighted by river
rocks reminiscent of a Zen garden, and the spare, playfully modernist
"Jake," whose diminutive profile and spare lines Shefik favors over those
"oversized, ceramic bulbous things from the '50s." "Lower lighting makes
it intimate, subdued, like when people have candles on low tables," she
says. "You're relaxing in there. You're not balancing your checkbook."</TE>

<TE>   Soapscum bath candies ($12): "Remember the bath fizzies, the big bath
bombs that come in a single ball? Well, these are miniatures. They come
in little candy papers in boxes of 12, and you need like three per bath.
They fizz a little, dissolve and scent  the water. They have the most
amazing flavors: tea rose, peach-ginger, cucumber, peppermint, almond
vanilla and  orange vanilla, which is like a 50-50 bar."</TE>
<TE>   --Jacqueline Smith, owner</TE>
<TE>Lather, Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   Yuzu Body Wash ($24): "Everyone loves this product. It's made with
yuzu (a Japanese citrus) essential oil. We press the rind to get the oil
out of it. It has the sweetness and sharpness of grapefruit, but many
other, deeper flavors: notes of bitter and sweet. Use it in the bath as a
bubble bath or in the shower as a liquid soap."</TE>
<TE>   --Emilie Davidson-Hoyt, owner</TE>
<TE>Splash Bath and Body, Hermosa Beach</TE>
<TE>   Milk &amp; Honey Sugar Scrub ($27): "This is a sugar scrub we make that
can be used on the face and body to gently exfoliate. People open up the
tester jar to smell it and say, 'Oh, God, I have to have that.' It almost
smells like a sugar cookie.  Because of the sugar and milk proteins and
sweet almond oil and kukui nut, it's exfoliating and moisturizing at the
same time. And it's a scent that really lingers."</TE>
<TE>   --SueBarbis, co-owner</TE>
<TE>Glisten, Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   Mango Watermelon Candle ($13): "We started with just this one candle.
But it's still by far the best seller. For some reason, people just go
nuts for the smell. It actually smells like a really pungent mango or
watermelon, but it's not sickly sweet. People bring it into the bathroom,
take a tub and have it burning."</TE>
<TE>   --Amanda Silverman, co-owner</TE>
<TE>Glow, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Glow Cakes ($5 each): "These are  super-large, all-natural fizzy cakes
shaped like miniature bundt cakes [to place in] the tub. They're very
skin softening. We do  eight different scents.  Gardenia is probably the
most popular, but the vitamin C and eucalyptus mint are great for this
time of year. My personal favorite is the geranium lavender."</TE>
<TE>   --Terri Williamson, co-owner</TE>
<TE>Palmetto, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   La Bouquetiere Plaisir D'Amour Body  Wash ($26): "This is a bath and
shower  gel that leaves no residue. The scent, which means 'the joys of
love,' smells of amber woods laced with lily of the valley. And it comes
in a beautiful silver and white metal container that looks so lovely in
the bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   --Helena Apothaker, manager</TE>
<TE>Fred Segal Essentials, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   Fresh Brown Sugar Body Polish ($60): "Everybody's buying it. We sell
it to  moms and daughters. It smells like you're baking cookies. It's
great for this time of year because it exfoliates all your dead  skin and
gives you a nice, thick  moisturizer.  You use it in the shower."</TE>

<LD>Even though it dates back thousands of years, there's nothing like
glistening glass to transform a bleak bathroom. Five entrepreneurial
friends have been championing glass tiles since launching Oceanside
Glasstile a decade ago. But the Carlsbad company doesn't just manufacture
tiles--it recycles mountains of beer, juice and sauce bottles in the
process. "[Recycling] is a great rallying point for us," says Sean
Gildea, 34, president of the eco-conscious business.</LD>
<LD>   Every two weeks or so, 50 tons of crushed glass from neighborhood
recycling programs arrive at the factory, ready to be transformed into
squares of art. After a night in the furnace, the molten substance is
then scooped into molds and cooled. Jon Stokesbary, an Oceanside
Glasstile founding partner, designs the prototypes; he's a ceramic and
glass artist from South Laguna who often exhibits at the Laguna Beach Art
Festival.</LD>
<LD>   The finished product, which retails for about $20 to $30 per square
foot, sparkles like ripples in a pond. Tessera tiles, one of four lines,
are particularly popular in bathrooms, Gildea says. The tiny squares,
available in colors such as Midori (light sage green) and Moonstone
(ultra-pale blue), can be laid out in mosaics. The Casa California line's
4-inch squares are embossed with oceanic motifs such as conch shells and
starfish, and are available in clear or amber, with or without iridescent
finish.</LD>
<TE>   Gildea notes that the tiles are sturdier than homeowners might expect.
"People think of glass and they tend to picture something fragile, but
our product is very durable," he says, adding that the breaking strength
of Oceanside's tiles is about two to three times that of ceramic tiles.
"Just be careful if you happen to be using a hammer nearby."</TE>

<LD>Perhaps you pictured "the Beverly Hills Organizer" lobbying for
feng-shui-ed closets in exotic woods outfitted with titanium hangers.
While Linda Koopersmith would be happy to create such a closet for you,
she is aware that most of us spend more time in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond than we
do at Pratesi. The designer, consultant, author and instructor is on a
mission to organize the masses. We asked for talking points on the
closet.</LD>
<LD>   Where do you stand on the "banish clutter" question?</LD>
<LD>   I truly believe you can keep everything you've ever had your whole
life if you can put your hands on it.</LD>
<TE>   What's the biggest mistake people make with closets?</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people call in a contractor and think, "It's going to be
great when they're done," and they don't think it through.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't that why you're paying a contractor?</TE>
<TE>   There's a difference between a designer and a contractor. You can't
count on contractors to take issues like [garment length] and your height
into account. I have had to do rescue work on countless high-end closets.
People spend tens of thousands on these fabulous rooms and can't reach
half their stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about fantasy closets you've worked on.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, I've been in closets that were exquisite, finished in beautiful
woods, with antique furniture, center islands--just amazing. But all that
beauty is worthless if what you want to wear isn't at your fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   What faux pas makes you crazy in a high-end closet?</TE>
<TE>   Deep drawers. Unless you're storing pillows or towels or comforters,
you're digging for stuff. If you really want drawers in your closet,
install them with glass fronts, so you can see what you're looking for.</TE>
<TE>   What's another closet nightmare?</TE>
<TE>   Shoes. While you can have a beautiful shelving system built, there are
great over-the-door, expandable shoe racks available. Just look for one
that your shoes can sit on rather than the ones where your shoes
hang--the racks leave indentations in the leather.</TE>
<TE>   How much does a really fabulous closet run?</TE>
<TE>   Even pre-made is already a few thousand dollars. To have a contractor
do it costs tens of thousands. [But] anybody can do it on their own.</TE>
<TE>   How does one achieve nirvana without a design degree?</TE>
<TE>   It's not that hard. For under $200, including hangers, you can get a
$1,500 look with all the functionality. A linear measure of all your
hanging stuff will tell you exactly how much rod space you need. And if
you organize your clothes by length, you can install hanging rods (one
up, one down) for the short stuff and get twice as much clothing into
half as much space. Those stacking storage units are terrific. Stack as
needed and you've got a closet wall unit you can take with you when you
move.</TE>
<TE>   Who is your role model--Joan Crawford in "Harriet Craig"?</TE>
<TE>   I model myself after the kid in "The Emperor's New Clothes." [After
I'm finished], everything that's escaped you all these years will be at
your fingertips. Whether I'm working with a group or one on one, I've
changed a life.</TE>

<LD>You could say Suzy and Elaine Rabuchin live by the motto, "It's
what's inside that counts." The duo run Formal Drawer, a Santa
Monica-based company that lines drawers, closets and other cubbyholes
with everything from plush velvet to luxe moire.</LD>
<LD>   "It may sound extravagant but it protects your drawers, and the
linings make it easier to keep [drawers] clean because you can scrub most
of the fabrics," says Suzy, who started the business in 1980
(daughter-in-law Elaine joined her later).</LD>
<LD>   Offering hundreds of textile choices, the pair can line almost any
storage space. After taking precise measurements, they get to work
covering thin pieces of chipboard with a chosen fabric. The side pieces
are then attached in the drawer using double-sided tape. The bottom
linings are removable for easy cleaning. The soft linings protect
undergarments and hosiery from snags. Men's drawers are often lined with
a more masculine suede cloth, with partitions to separate accessories.
"Sometimes the guys have these great big cowboy belts that they want to
protect," Suzy notes.</LD>
<TE>   They also create jewelry trays covered in suede or velvet and drawer
compartments (sometimes in Lucite) to organize smaller articles. "We take
those million little things you have lying around--hair clips, cuff
links, brushes," Suzy says, "and give them proper homes "</TE>
<TE>   Their clients include local film execs and range from coast to coast.
"We love seeing the reactions on people's faces when we're done," Suzy
says.</TE>

<DH>They are spaces in which to hide out, to disconnect. Or they're
electronic palaces with hidden screens. They might be private domains for
romance or family gathering spots. This issue of the magazine is devoted
to the art of the bedroom suite. In the pages that follow, you'll
encounter Southern Californians who have lavished care on beds, linens,
floor coverings and sinks. You'll meet closet freaks and learn to shop
for a mattress. And you can start your journey here with kevin roderick's
primal question: What does your bedroom say about you?</DH>

pleasure of Martha Stewart), work out and gab on the phone with friends.
We groom the cat, sort the laundry and fret over the next day's
appointments. And we also sleep, lying inert through a good third of our
lifetimes--or more for some of us.</LD>
<LD>   If you have a bedroom, you also have a bedroom style, know it or not.
It's your own personal world view of the sleeping quarters, and these
days it can help define you. One camp insists that the space fulfill its
traditional functions and nothing more. Adherents of this belief sleep
and maybe make love there and get out; their furnishings and decor tend
to the spare and no-nonsense.</LD>
<LD>   These days, though, many people like to watch films or surf the Web in
comfort, so they equip the room with a bit more utilitarian detailing. A
flat-screen Sony and DVD player shouldn't sit on the floor, after all.
For others, the idea of electronics invading the inner sanctum is almost
sacrilegious. For these purists the bedroom signifies a haven, a cloister
where they escape from the day's noise and veg out on high-count Egyptian
cotton sheets and luxuriant comforters. These boudoirs overflow with
pretty things and are, foremost, private enclaves.</LD>
<TE>   They could not be more different in style from those bedrooms treated
as an integral wing of the home's public area, a second family room to
gather in and watch TV or talk with children and friends. These rooms
demand seating for visitors and perhaps a good sound system. Or any
combination of the above.</TE>
<TE>   The bedroom today can be anything you want it to be, a trend that I've
encountered through trial and error over the past year. Locked into an
extensive home remodeling project that would force me to examine my own
wishes for the bedroom, I found it's a jungle out there. There are no
rules anymore; bedrooms are allowed to suit the personality and needs of
the occupants. This leads to a provocative question: What does your
bedroom say about you? And the even more troubling query: What does my
bedroom say about me?</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, I should point out that it's not just my bedroom. It is
our bedroom, and its personality would be shaped as much by the laws of
marital harmony (and budgetary restraint) as by my selfish desires.</TE>
<TE>   As wives with a honed creative sense often do, my spouse was possessed
of passionate wishes for her--that is our--bedroom. It wasn't quite like
Monica on "Friends" shooting down Chandler's demand for a big yellow
"merge" sign over their newly shared bed; I'm not that style-deficient.
Let's say, however, that we each made some compromises.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, we each had to inquire of our inner bedroom muse. It
fell to our architect and friend, Lisa Landworth of the mid-Wilshire firm
of Landworth DeBolske Associates, to abet our search for the ideal,
affordable, doable bedroom. She began with the news that, in our case,
the city of Los Angeles' zoning code would have some input too; due to
insufficient setback from the house next door, our new lair would be on
the small side--with less open floor space than in our previous bedroom,
but potentially better, she assured us. Now, if we could just inform her
which school of design we align with.</TE>
<TE>   Separate closets or together? A tub and a shower? Warm carpet or cold
hardwood? TV hookup or not? If you think it's easy to define yourself
neatly, think again.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa had a client, a film editor, who does everything in his
bedroom--"literally from his bed," she says--and who needed his remodel
to accommodate that fact of life. She had to install a wall that would
house his editing machinery plus TV, VCR, stereo, cassettes and CDs. This
is a man who keeps 10 remotes by his bed. Clearly not our style.</TE>
<TE>   She has been asked to equip bedrooms with sinks, mini-bar
refrigerators and furniture arrays based on the focus-group stylings of
fine hotels. "Some people who travel a whole lot just have a good feeling
about hotels. They would like their whole house to look like a
Ritz-Carlton," Lisa says. Hmm. We adore traveling, but that isn't us.</TE>
<TE>   This was harder than we thought, and with much at stake. We had
stretched financially to pull off this whole-house remodel and knew we
would have to live with this bedroom for a long time. Trouble was, there
were so many ways to go.</TE>
<TE>   Think of some famous bedrooms and how they reflect the life and
manners of the person in residence. Television's best-known bedroom right
now is probably Carrie Bradshaw's on HBO's "Sex and the City." Hers is
part New York babe's seduction nest, painted a soothing celery green
(with an iridescent lavender wash to make it pop on television) with an
inviting wide and typically unmade bed dressed in white Calvin Klein
sheets and a gray cover.</TE>
<TE>   The Bradshaw bedroom is also an Upper East Side fashionista's salon,
strewn with the latest magazines and her prized Manolo Blahnik shoes. Her
bed also serves part time as the desk of a newspaper sex columnist on
deadline, so there is a telephone and, sometimes, a PowerBook flipped
open on the duvet. No tips for us there; we were going for something a
little more dignified, and we definitely prefer to keep work out of the
bedroom as much as possible. However, mixing eclectic uses into the
sanctified space of the bedroom is not such a modern concept. Thomas
Jefferson's private quarters at Monticello were a marvel of
Revolutionary-era multi-tasking. From his French-inspired alcove bed he
could stand up to the left into the bedroom or to the right into his
cabinet, or study, where he performed experiments and tallied his daily
weather observations. A loft closet tucked in the wall above the bed held
his clothes. Like in today's extravagant master suites, Jefferson had his
own privy at hand, though without the benefit of an electrically warmed
seat or jet flush, or even hot running water. Large windows and skylights
and an obelisk clock stationed at the bed's foot helped him stay true to
his early-up principle: "Whether I retire early or late, I rise with the
sun."</TE>
<TE>   Legend has it that Jefferson never slept late in 50 years. That
madness would not be a factor in our deliberations. We often loll in bed
well past sunup, so the room should be inviting in the daylight as well
as at night. My demands on that point are simple--lots of sunshine and
fresh air and a comfortable bed with a good reading lamp I can burn at 2
a.m. without feeling guilty about the glare.</TE>
<TE>   My wife's longings are closer to those of Los Angeles designer
extraordinaire Rose Tarlow, who prescribes fashioning the bedroom into an
intensely personal refuge. "It's the one place in the house where you can
put yourself into it. Every other room you have to share," says Tarlow,
whose clientele has included David Geffen and Eli Broad.</TE>
<TE>   Tarlow designs fabric, wallpaper and furniture, and in her own bedroom
in Bel-Air she surrounds herself with things she likes: books, beautiful
blankets and whatever else she might need to feel properly cocooned if,
for instance, she has to spend a week in bed with the flu. "I can live in
there," she says. Her bedroom is designed both as private sanctuary and
as a place for conversing and entertaining visitors. So it includes
comfortable seating.</TE>
<TE>   "The bedroom is for sleeping, but it is also a meeting place," says
Tarlow, whose book "The Private House" was published in November by
Clarkson Potter.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice home of therapist S. Scott Mayers takes the open bedroom
concept to an extreme. The bed, a bath and a walk-in closet take up an
entire early 1900s cottage set in a secluded garden with a rambling deck,
hanging lamps and fountains. French doors that swing onto the deck are
seldom shut in good weather so that Mayer and his friends and party
guests invariably drift from the adjacent cottage into the bedroom,
furnished with designer chairs, a plump bed and surround-sound speakers
for movie watching. A small refrigerator relieves Mayers and his visitors
of the need to walk outside to the adjacent cottage containing the
kitchen and living room.</TE>
<TE>   "People congregate in this room as much as they do in the living
room," Mayers says of the bedroom cottage. "In terms of entertaining,
it's just another room. People are very comfortable piling on the bed."</TE>
<TE>   He enjoys sharing the entire compound with visitors, but the bedroom
is also his personal retreat, made homey with cherry-finished Douglas fir
floors, strategically placed sheepskins and a generous fireplace. Oil
paintings and collectibles (including a shelf of wooden nutcrackers)
adorn the walls. Around a corner from the bed is a lushly worn leather
chair and a bookcase of his favorite fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles designer Barbara Barry is such a proponent of bedroom
serenity that she likes to create rooms that are blank spaces, visually
and aurally. In her own bedrooms, she banishes artwork (and, of course,
TV) from view and favors simple fabrics with subtle patterns and colors.
Her lines of fine linens are named "Serene Stripe" and "Peaceful Pique"
to reflect the desire for tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   "My bed is the center of my universe and I want it to be perfectly
delicious," Barry says. "If you wrap yourself in soft bed linens, wearing
even softer pajamas, and you fall asleep enveloped by that softness,
perhaps you will remember that as hard as life is, it can be balanced by
gentleness."</TE>
<TE>   That's all great, but for most of us the bedroom has to do double or
triple duty. It can't just be a place to unwind. So we make choices,
hoping to achieve a blend of style and usefulness that we can enjoy for
years. Our personal advisors were of mixed minds.</TE>
<TE>   Landworth, whose late father, William V. Landworth, was the project
architect for the Beverly Prescott Hotel and designed Don the
Beachcomber, has a pair of desks in her room but no television, by mutual
decision with her professor husband. It's intended as a cozy place to
read and talk, with French doors leading to a deck to connect with the
outdoors. She admitted that her ideal bedroom would include a private
dressing room-cum-parlor, where she could retreat to read in peace. In
fact, she explained, the most common request of remodelers, besides a new
kitchen, is a master suite with a bathroom and ample closets, preferably
separate ones. Food for thought.</TE>
<TE>   Our friend Susan, a fashion designer who has moved into bed linens,
recently created a bedroom of such simple elegance that my wife would be
overjoyed simply to re-create it. It features a platform bed, sisal-look
carpet, a soft armless chair and a gorgeous window view into a Pasadena
canyon. Yet we would need our own look, something that says Us. To help
assess my own innate style, I signed on to the House Beautiful Web site
and took an online quiz called "What's Your Sleeping Style?" After
responding that I prefer being naked to wearing silk pajamas, like to
snooze with open windows and would opt for the tunes of Marvin Gaye over
recorded nature sounds or James Taylor, I was pronounced a "Free-Spirited
Sleeper": My decorating style was found to be "complex and hard to
pigeonhole"--as any woman I've lived with could have testified--and I was
advised to "remember that too much clutter and confusion can
overstimulate your senses, making it tougher to unwind."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I know. In all of my previous bedrooms, the bedside stand and
the floor around it collected inked-in crosswords, scribbled notes and
partially read New Yorkers not always of the current year. Books get
finished and gradually move down in the pile, but rarely onto a shelf. My
wife's side also supports a formidable library, only somewhat more neatly
stacked.</TE>
<TE>   In this new bedroom, we've both resolved to keep down the clutter.
That's because with just a bit over three feet of clearance on either
side of our bed, the reading material and discarded clothes would quickly
devour us. We could have gone bigger, but it would have cost us one of
the most beguiling features of our newly completed home. It sits just
high enough on a Mar Vista slope that, while lying in bed on a haze-free
day, we can gaze 23 miles across the basin to Mt. Wilson. On those few
mornings when snow shimmers on the San Gabriels, the trade-off looks
pretty good. Opening the bedroom onto a deck to take advantage of the
view and morning sun was a no-brainer for us. So was adding to the glass
area, building in large aluminum casement windows that begin close to the
floor. On other design points, it turns out we are a lot like most of
you. We wanted a master bedroom suite where we can close the door on the
family and be apart, or throw the door open and hang out.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa managed to give us the view and to fit in a walk-in closet and a
full bathroom (with an oversized China Lotus slate shower for me and an
airy bathtub under a window for her). A laundry closet is a few steps
away. It's all of modest size but allows privacy when we need it. Into
this skeleton we added tight-weave carpets over the wood floors and, to
further reduce the clutter, moved our dressers into the closet. The only
furniture out in the room, other than the bed and small night tables,
will likely be a simple chair and a low credenza that can hold flowers,
candles and the phone. We sank separately controlled can lights in the
ceiling over each side of the bed so that we don't even need
free-standing lamps. We're undecided on the great TV question; there's a
cable outlet all wired in and ready to go, but for now no set.</TE>
<TE>   Like most 21st century bedrooms, ours borrows from many style idioms.
All it truly says about us, I guess, is that we wanted the bedroom for
ourselves and not to impress anyone else. We love our bedroom, and that's
all you can ask.</TE>

<HD>Designers Give Distinctive Looks to Five Different Bedroom Suites</HD>

<LD>"I think every room in the house has its designed purpose," says
software entrepreneur Bradford Karns. "And the bedroom is a place for
sleeping. I don't hole up there with a box of candy." Karns wanted a
sleek, minimalist environment with an indoor/outdoor feel and
gallery-like space where he could hang his extensive collection of modern
and contemporary art. And he needed durable, easy-to-clean surfaces that
would withstand his 8-year-old, 140-pound Akita, Grendel, who has free
range of his Windsor Square home. Interior designer Joseph Terrell of
Sign Language Habitat in Tucson, Ariz., designed a row of closets of
laminated frosted milk glass, which forms the entry to Karns' master
bedroom suite. "We made the space neat and tidy," says Terrell, who added
a 10-foot bay of laminated closets in the bathroom to hold drawers for
socks, belts, ties and underwear. Limestone covers counters as well as
the walls and floor. In lieu of a formal bathroom, a doorless area houses
both shower and tub. "I originally wanted an outdoor shower," says Karns,
"but on the second floor, that wasn't very practical." Los Angeles
architectural designer John C. Barone, who conceived the bathroom, added
a band of high windows that frame treetops to give Karns a feeling of
"being outside in a treehouse." The focal point of Karns' spare
21-by-29-foot bedroom is a Terrell-designed king-size platform bed with a
low-slung shelf of padauk wood stained ebony. A 4 1/2-foot-high
Ultrasuede headboard provides a backrest for reading in bed or watching
TV, while sisal covers the floor, where Grendel sleeps. "I've invited him
into bed, but I think it gets too warm for him," he says. An east-facing
window that overlooks his basketball court and a floor-to-ceiling
southern window bathe the room with early morning light. "One of the most
important things was to have a light-filled bedroom," says Karns, who
hasn't hung any window coverings. "I like to get up naturally to my own
internal alarm clock. And if I don't, Grendel wakes me."</LD>
<TE>Streamlined Contemporary</TE>
<TE>   The master bedroom suite in the remodeled 1950s Castellammare home of
Jerry and Doreen Rochman is a serene, self-contained world. "Our children
were grown and we wanted a home that accommodated our needs," says Jerry.
The late Frank Israel was the initial designer for the two-story modern
house, with work on the home later completed by his firm, Callas
Shortridge Architects in Culver City. "The living, dining, kitchen and
office areas are on the upper floor," says Barbara Callas, "but Jerry and
Doreen have everything they need to live downstairs if they wanted to."
The master bedroom suite and exercise room on the lower level bookend a
laundry/kitchenette. The small galley is appointed with an electric hot
plate, coffee pot and toaster, as well as a dumbwaiter leading to the
upstairs kitchen, which reduces trips up and down the stairway. A
eucalyptus tree emerging through the master bedroom's 50-foot deck offers
shade, privacy and dramatic views of the Malibu coast. "The deck and
bedroom have become one large room for us," says Jerry, who often reads
outside or sits in the Jacuzzi. "We used to camp a lot, and we love the
feeling of being outdoors. If it's warm enough, we often shower with the
door open." Alongside the shower, a concrete radiant-heated tub is
another warm place to bathe and soak up the view. The bedroom's special
feature is a built-in Douglas fir platform bed with attached night tables
and a storage closet and a bookcase. A large door off the downstairs
corridor pivots to enclose the room. When open, it becomes a seamless
extension of the built-in wall. For added comfort, the Rochmans, who are
both psychotherapists, had the California king-size bed placed sideways.
"We're not too tall, and the California king is longer than it is wide,"
Jerry explains, "so we turned it around to have more width." At night in
bed, the couple hear sounds of surf and leaves rustling in the ocean
breezes. "I grew up in Chicago, which was cold and windy in winter and
hot and muggy in summer and where windows always wore screens to keep the
bugs out," says Jerry. "Having everything open is heaven."</TE>
<TE>20th century eclectic</TE>
<TE>It's so quiet up here you have a feeling of being away from the city,"
says interior designer Paul Fortune of his Laurel Canyon bedroom. "It's
where I read, nap, sleep, daydream, hide out." In the second-floor room,
his Danish Modern desk faces a corner window overlooking a garden. He
uses the desk for writing personal notes, he says, "but not to do any
business." Nearby, a built-in bookcase holds Hollywood gossip books and
biographies, which he often reads in a Paul McCobb chair by the fireplace
or in the bed he designed with a 5-foot-high linen-covered headboard. "I
hate tons of cushions, and the upholstered headboard does away with all
that." A pair of two-tiered night tables hold his magazines, books,
prints, flashlights, candles, water carafe, lamps and " all the other
things you have to have by your bed." Walls are hung with drawings and
photographs from his mid-century portrait collection, which he
periodically rotates." When I get tired of them, I take them down and put
up something new." Adjacent to the bedroom, Fortune's master bathroom
serves a dual purpose, acting almost like a sitting room. It's so roomy
and comfortable, in fact, that one night he had dinner there with a
friend. "There was a fire in the fireplace, a small tray of food to pick
at, a glass of wine--it was all very 18th Century." The designer has
filled the room with a sophisticated mix of 20th century furnishings,
ranging from a 1940s French console inset with a wenge-wood sink to an
Art Deco mirror, '50s floor lamp and '60s chandelier. A comfortable
vintage club chair stands next to the tub, which he encased in mahogany
and fitted with a Euopean brass shower. Below, luxurious ivory-colored
leather tiles cover the floor. "Everyone was horrified I was going to do
it, including the manufacturer. I just sealed the tiles with carnauba wax
and wipe them with a damp cloth once in a while. It's so warm to walk
on--there's no shock of an icy bathroom floor." Just outside, sandwiched
between the back of the bedroom fireplace and the hillside, is his
outdoor shower. "There's no ceiling but the sky, and the steam goes
straight up and doesn't fog up the windows." In mid-September, Fortune's
TV quit working while he was watching the news, and he hasn't replaced
it, making his bedroom more serene. "I used to think it was a great place
to have a TV, now I think it's a great place not to have one."</TE>
<TE>European Romantic</TE>
<TE>   Dark and rustic with exposed ceiling beams is how artist Melinda
Salinger remembers the early decor of the master bedroom in her Rustic
Canyon home. "I wanted a soft, feminine and enticing bedroom," says
Salinger. "I spend a lot of time here. To me it's the most important room
in the house." Inspired by elegant Old World hotel rooms--such as those
in the Plaza Athenee in Paris, where she stayed on family vacations as a
young girl--she began transforming the room into a romantic retreat to be
shared with husband Fred, who is president of Phoenix Software. A 1920s
allegorical painting featuring cherubim adorns the ceiling and sets the
European tone. An antique Aubusson rug in tones of mauve and dark rose
mirrors the colors in the painting above, and walls are done in a
complementary pale lilac. "When I saw that the color of the paint was
named Lancelot, I had to have it. It was just so romantic," says
Salinger, who had named her previous dog, a whippet, Valentine, and her
current dog Romeo.  The bedroom's furnishings--which include an antique
bombe chest, a wisteria-painted armoire and a French chaise
longue--continue the continental theme. Windows are creatively draped
with vintage textiles that Salinger collected during her travels.
Opposite the simple white wood bed stands a 1930s mirrored vanity lined
with the original blue moire silk. A pair of cherubs--part of her
300-plus angel collection that graces ceilings and walls and shelves
throughout the house--flank the vanity. Another seemingly floats on the
wall directly above the bed. In the newly renovated bathroom, which was
designed by architect Brian Murphy of BAM Construction/Design in Santa
Monica, rose branches have been fashioned into a halo, sprayed white and
hung from the ceiling to complete the ethereal theme. "I love having
angels all around--they watch over me," says Salinger. "I feel completely
safe and happy in my bedroom. It's really a place for daydreaming--a
pastime I don't think we do enough of anymore."</TE>
<TE>Mixed Media</TE>
<TE>"The bedroom was so dark I left the lights on all day long," recalls
Shirley McKernan. And it wasn't just the redwood-paneled walls that
needed updating in her 1968 Brentwood residence. McKernan called in
interior designer Nick Berman to modernize the master suite she shares
with husband Peter, President of Star Helicopter. Berman first expanded
the room by 600 feet, adding a high side window to bring in much needed
light. He replaced the wall-to-wall orange shag carpet with South African
prairie slate. But the centerpiece of the room is a low-slung
contemporary bed with a customized Christian Liagre headboard of
quarter-sawn oak and canvas. Next to the bed are two 8-foot-long night
tables of rift oak and wenge wood that hold the couple's collection of
Pre-Columbian sculpture. The designer then reconfigured a large master
bath. A tub, encased in dry-stacked prairie slate and a deck of green
onyx, divides the room into nearly mirror-image spaces, each with its own
free-standing TV cabinet. His-and-her copper sinks are set in
marble-topped teak cabinets, while a large double-door shower connects
the two spaces. At the rear of the bath is a 12-foot-long clerestory
window of sandblasted glass. "I don't do it often, but once in a while I
lie in the tub and look at the TV and think to myself, this is pretty
luxurious," says Shirley. But her favorite pastime is cuddling in bed
with dogs Molly, Bogie and Bandit. "It's definitely their favorite spot
in the house."</TE>

<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>Times staff writer Roy Rivenburg last wrote for the magazine on growing
up in L.A.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goldilocks had it easy. When she tried out beds at the Three Bears
Mattress Warehouse, she had only a trio of models to choose from: Too
Hard, Too Soft and Just Right. Things are a lot more complicated now.
Shop for a mattress in 2002 and you'll encounter "densified torso support
zones," air beds, water beds, latex beds, "memory foam" beds, innerspring
beds with a jillion different coil configurations, and a $5,000 Stearns &amp;
Foster mattress with a cover that resembles a stained-glass window from a
European cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   Which raises a crucial question: Do people really sleep better on
mattresses inspired by stained glass? The answer, according to the latest
scientific research, is: Yes. No, wait. That research comes from Stearns
&amp; Foster. Real scientists have a somewhat different opinion. They also
offer surprising views on what constitutes the ideal sleeping surface for
the human body.</LD>
<LD>   In North Hills, at the Center for Sleep Research, Jerry Siegel,
professor of psychiatry at UCLA, studies the slumber of whales,
platypuses, Doberman pinschers and people, among others. He's kept tabs
on creatures snoozing in trees, water, on the ground, even while flying.
He's heard of humans sleeping on or in everything from water-filled
goatskins to World War II foxholes. So when it comes to mattresses, he's
wary of the claims made by manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of pseudo-research," says Siegel, who is chief of
neurobiology at the Sepulveda VA Hospital, home to the Center for Sleep
Research. "But the truth is, most sleep problems are not substantially
helped by mattresses, unless you've been sleeping on a bed of nails."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill M. Mitler, who runs the Scripps Research Institute's
Laboratory for Sleep, Fatigue and Safety, is equally skeptical. Although
few studies have been done, he says, the best research shows that "after
a night or two of adaptation, most people can sleep as well on a thin pad
over a concrete floor as they can on the most elaborate mattress." The
exception is someone who has a physical ailment requiring a particularly
soft or firm sleeping surface, he explains in "101 Questions About Sleep
and Dreams," a booklet he wrote with his wife, Elizabeth, another veteran
sleep researcher.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say all mattresses are created equal. It simply means
you can tune out most of the sales pitches and focus on which model feels
the most comfortable. That's rule No. 1 in the search for a perfect
mattress.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, with 800 U.S. mattress makers peddling thousands of
models (some with identical innards but different covers and names from
store to store), finding the right bed at the right price can be a
nightmare. In searching for the ultimate sleeping surface, I turned to a
resort in Ojai, a Swedish mattress boutique in Brea, the NASA space
center in Houston, a consumer watchdog in New York and a Santa Ana
department store that offered twin-size mattresses for $38. It was a
bewildering journey--the mattress industry profits from customer
confusion--but there are ways to avoid some of the obfuscation.</TE>
<TE>   One striking feature of modern mattresses is their height. While
computer chips and cell phones have been shrinking, mattresses have been
puffing up. Some "pillow-top" models now have more tiers and loft than a
wedding cake. But this "Princess and the Pea" approach doesn't guarantee
more comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "Our tests show that mattresses with more padding have a better chance
of sagging," says Jennifer Shecter of Consumer Reports magazine.
Paradoxically, firm mattresses can also sink, she warns. If the store has
a cutaway display of the mattress, look for convoluted foam. It has an
egg-carton appearance and feels soft, resilient and almost moist to the
touch. It offers more support.</TE>
<TE>   As for coil counts and spring design, they're important for comparison
shopping--but not much else. In 1997, Consumer Reports rolled a 300-pound
ribbed drum back and forth 84,000 times over each of the mattress sets it
tested. That's equal to four years of normal use. The upshot: Except in
the cheapest models, coil count and design had no effect on quality or
durability.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "You should try the mattresses at the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Spa," one
colleague assured me. "They're so comfortable I almost skipped my massage
appointment to stay in bed." As it turns out, the secret to Ojai's "Nest
Un-feather Bed," which can be bought at the resort gift shop, isn't the
mattress. It's the super-fluffy pad under the sheet. Alas, I didn't like
it. The pad looks like a swimming pool air mattress and the ridges and
valleys felt awkward against my back.</TE>
<TE>   Next up was the Duxiana mattress from Sweden. At $3,200 for the
cheapest queen-size, it's the Rolls-Royce of sleep systems. But when I
test-drove some Duxes in Brea, I was unimpressed. Maybe I was like a
Burger King aficionado trying to appreciate foie gras, but I found the
"cheapest" Dux too bouncy and the $6,000 top of the line less cozy than
my current, peon-brand mattress.</TE>
<TE>   Another Swedish mattress with a cult following is the Tempur-Pedic,
made from "memory foam" developed by NASA. I have Tempur-Pedic pillows
from Brookstone, which I like, but when I tried an entire mattress at a
store, it felt weird, like lying on clay. Maybe space foam is an acquired
taste.</TE>
<TE>   Much of a mattress is marketing, from the materials inside
(silver-plated corner guards, "cumulus" foam) to the model names on the
outside (Merlot, Pendulum, Jewel of the Universe). One of the newest
gimmicks is the no-flip mattress. Popularized by Simmons in 2000, the
idea was quickly imitated by others. But there's debate over whether it's
a true convenience or just a ploy to sell half a mattress for the price
of one. In an attempt to play both sides of the issue, Sealy now markets
an "optional flip" mattress: "You don't have to turn it over unless you
want to."</TE>
<TE>   Some mattress makers claim their products improve sleep by reducing
the number of pressure points on the bed surface. Pressure points
restrict blood circulation, forcing the body to toss and turn at night.
By that standard, the best mattress in the world should be in outer
space. While sleeping in zero gravity, astronauts move around very
little, says a NASA spokeswoman. They climb into a bag and hang from a
wall. However, they don't sleep very well, says researcher Siegel,
although it's hard to pinpoint why.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, comfort is purely subjective. Rip Van Winkle enjoyed years
of undisturbed shut-eye slumped under a tree, while Snow White preferred
the firm support of a glass coffin. Andrea Herman of the Better Sleep
Council, a group funded by the mattress industry, recommends testing
several beds before buying. "Rest on your back, your side and whatever
position you usually sleep in, and see how it feels." Move on if there's
too much pressure on your shoulders or you can easily slide your hand
under the small of your back. "The mattress is supposed to do the work,
not your body," she says. "What you're looking for is the 'ah factor,'
which is when you crawl into bed at night and go, 'Ahhhh.' "</TE>
<TE>   Once you've found it, a new round of headaches begins. "What most
people don't know is that the price of a mattress is as negotiable as the
price of a used car," says Consumer Reports' Shecter. The catch is trying
to comparison shop, because identical mattresses have aliases and
different fabric covers at competing stores.</TE>
<TE>   The only way around it, which isn't foolproof, is to write down your
favorite mattress' brand, coil count, coil gauge, type of padding and box
spring construction, then march to the next merchant and ask for their
comparable model--at a lower price. It's a hassle, but playing merchants
against each other can save hundreds of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But the final price might still keep you awake at night. For a decent
quality mattress and box spring set (experts advise buying both
together), expect to pay $450 for a twin set, $600 per full, $800 for a
queen and $1,000 per king.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, even after you've negotiated a deal, you can still get
ripped off. Consumer Reports recommends insisting on a "no-substitutions"
clause in the sales contract.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the store can deliver an "equivalent" model if the one you
ordered is out of stock. Also pay attention to the fine print on return
policies. Many retailers allow you to try out a mattress for several
weeks, but if you decide to exchange it, you can get stuck paying
delivery costs or be forced to fork over full price for whatever model
you choose next.</TE>
<TE>   If you manage to get past all that, you can finally relax. But only
for about eight to 10 years, the average life span of a mattress.
Pleasant dreams.</TE>

<DH>What Is Your Idea of the Ultimate Closet? Four Aficionados Have
Some Suggestions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA THORNBURG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael DePerno, owner of Ren antiques store</LD>
<LD>   "When I'm neat, I'm neat, and when I'm a slob, I'm known for letting
things lie on the floor. You can't be too obsessive about it. It's just
stuff. If you're a borderline clothing addict like me and you have a
small closet, you have to have a system. Mine is to hang things in the
same direction and color coordinate everything. I have a thing for
shirts. There were more than 100 blue ones at last count, and
sweaters--don't ask how many, I'm embarrassed--and I buy in a pretty
monochromatic way to keep them organized. Getting dressed is a cinch. I
just grab some slacks, a shirt and a pair of shoes, and I'm out the door
in five minutes."</LD>
<TE>Pearl Harbour, rock singer/comedic actress</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of pairs of seasoned shoes and boots pepper the floor of rock
singer Pearl Harbour's closet, which was a spare bedroom in her 1917
Hollywood home until its conversion a year ago. The singer, whose mother
is from the Philippines, says friends teasingly call her the "Imelda
Marcos of L.A." Although the closet is chockablock with her extensive
collection of costumes and vintage clothing, Harbour defends it as
"extremely organized." Four commercial clothing racks on rollers hug the
walls. Each is filled with different categories of apparel: costumes and
event clothes; evening wear; skirts, suits and daytime dresses; jackets
and coats. A three-tiered rotating rack she bought from a shoe store
going out of business sports her 30 favorite pairs of '50s high-heeled
evening shoes. Others are grouped in rows by decade and sit under the
racks. A free-standing commercial belt rack holds 12 dozen belts divided
by color and category: blacks, browns, reds, studded cowboy, rock 'n'
roll and evening rhinestone. Nearby, cashmere and beaded sweaters are
arranged dark to light on satin hangers with cedar blocks hung around
their necks. Harbour's hanger preference runs to the "multicolored thick
plastic ones you buy at the drugstore, 10 for $1," which she says are
kinder to the clothes. Heavy coats get real wood hangers; wire hangers
are verboten. "If I don't wear something for a whole season, the wire can
discolor the outfit."</TE>
<TE>   Given the size of her collection, she is surprisingly self-disciplined
about limiting it to one room. "I've kept the same amount of clothing for
years," says the singer. "When I start getting too many things, I grab
the ones that don't thrill me anymore and sell them to Palace Costume on
Fairfax. I really do try to keep it under control. I'm pretty good about
not going overboard."</TE>
<TE>Lenore Kayne, member of board of directors, Kayne/Eras School for
emotionally and physically challenged children</TE>
<TE>   "I told my architect, Robert Earl, the closet needed to be spacious
and airy and I needed to be able to see all my clothes, otherwise I don't
know what I have. I also wanted a central island where I could pack and
lay out my clothes, as well as have storage drawers. I took an
approximate count of my lingerie, belts, gloves, scarves, bathing suits
and T-shirts, and two ladies lined the drawers and made Lucite cubbyhole
compartments to keep everything in order. All the closets are open except
for the clear glass ones holding my formal evening wear. Before the main
closet was completed, we extended the room by six feet so we could add a
small cedar closet to keep my heavy winter things, shoes and handbags."</TE>
<TE>Katie McGloin, interior designer</TE>
<TE>   "The walk-in closet with built-in shelves and a center island was here
when my husband, Tommy, and I bought the house. I added the vintage
chandelier and painted the interior Chinese red to make it more
theatrical. We share the closet. He keeps his things (socks, underwear,
shirts, workout gear, jewelry and watches) in the 10-drawer island and is
extremely neat. I have a tendency to throw things on the floor. He's also
more of a clotheshorse and comes to my side to borrow things. He can be
quite a flamboyant dresser. Sometimes he wears one of my vintage scarves
as an ascot, which makes him look like 'The Godfather.' Occasionally he
gets into my Indian jewelry collection and puts on the bracelets and big
rings. We often hang out here and talk."</TE>

<HD>Julia's Kitchen-In Name Only</HD>
<DH>The New Napa Restaurant Bears the Burden of its Lineage</DH>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"There's Julia's Kitchen," a woman visiting the new Copia center
for wine, food and the arts trills excitedly to her friend. The two hurry
to the reception area as if expecting to glimpse the octogenarian
cookbook author and television star at the stoves. "Any chance of a
reservation for lunch?" they ask.</LD>
<LD>   "Sorry," murmurs the approachable maitre d', explaining that they're
fully booked. It's dead-on winter in the Napa Valley, but Julia's Kitchen
is a hot ticket in the valley. On a soggy, cold day, the parking lot is
packed at Copia, a $55-million museum and cultural center that opened in
November. The brainchild of winemaker Robert Mondavi and his wife,
Margrit Biever Mondavi, Copia is named for the goddess of abundance.</LD>
<TE>   From its inception, the project has provoked controversy in the
largely blue-collar city that was left behind in the evolution of Napa
Valley from grape-growing county to the Shangri-La of wine country
lifestyle. That's why the Julia Child connection is so important.
Everybody loves Child, who turns 90 this year. I always have, certainly,
and I especially appreciate her verve and great good sense in this era of
politically correct cooking shows. Instead of attempting to dazzle the
audience with ever more arcane tricks and tips, she simply cooks. Her
warmth and unflappable optimism in the face of kitchen disasters cheered
on a generation--or two--of fledgling cooks, most of whom had likely
never tasted the French country dishes she made so enticing. This was
armchair cooking in the very best sense.</TE>
<TE>   Watching an old TV show recently, I caught Child playfully dancing a
couple of sawed-off calves' feet across the kitchen counter. Nobody would
dare show anything so graphic these days. The gregarious Child added a
big pinch of fun to middle-class Americans' idea of cooking. With a wave
of her wooden spoon, she enchanted an entire country.</TE>
<TE>   That's why most of us would jump at the chance to eat in Julia's
Kitchen. And that's exactly what Copia's management is counting on--a
name that conjures up a kitchen redolent of garlic and goose fat. I'd
love to taste how closely her cassoulet resembles the one I used to make
from her first French cookbook every New Year's.</TE>
<TE>   Julia's Kitchen, however, has little to do with Child, other than that
she has lent her name to it. Few can resist that wily charmer Robert
Mondavi when he comes calling, and Child is no exception. As the fairy
godmother of cooking, she's for any project that dangles the possibility
of bringing more people into the food-and-wine fold.</TE>
<TE>   As much as it was meant as a tribute to Child, Copia's use of her name
is deceptive. Julia's Kitchen, in fact, is run by a local catering
company, Seasoned Elements. Given the Mondavis' involvement in Copia and
the couple's intense interest in food and wine, it's puzzling why they
didn't do the logical thing and install an independent restaurant in the
space.</TE>
<TE>   That said, executive chef Mark Dommen comes with quite a resume. A
graduate of San Francisco's California Culinary Academy, he's worked at
Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, Lespinasse in New York and as sous-chef
for the late Jean-Louis Palladin in New York. Overall, the 75-seat
restaurant is respectable, better than expected, but not brilliant. The
designer has struck just the right note with the large, welcoming dining
room with open kitchen and counter at one end. With its sleek,
contemporary design, it feels a little like a gourmet dining hall, which
is not a bad thing. The view is toward Copia's olive trees and organic
garden.</TE>
<TE>   The menu reads like a compendium of everything fashionable in food
right now and emphasizes quality ingredients. Copia's garden supplies
some of the herbs and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   One day at lunch with winemaker Helen Turley--dubbed a "wine goddess"
by no less than wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr.--the chef sends out a
little tribute: an intriguing sea urchin flan decorated with osetra
caviar. There's a lovely calamari salad special with frisee, blood orange
and bouquets of mache that day, too. The calamari must be fresh, it has
so much flavor. I was less fond of a messy beet and goat cheese salad.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, many of the dishes have a classical underpinning, such
as the subtle oxtail broth, its transparency broken with diced oxtail and
vegetables, with a bone marrow flan sailing in the broth. Another good
choice is the roasted onion and shrimp soup served with the aplomb of a
three-star restaurant. Out comes a soup bowl with a few curls of shrimp
and pearl onions. A server then pours in the saffron-yellow puree from a
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen suffers a bit from gourmet correctness, tending to
undercook both risotto and beans. Seared shrimp garnished with deep-fried
prosciutto come with beautiful pale green flageolet beans that aren't
cooked through. A sunchoke risotto features rice that's both chalky-hard
and gummy. The combination of nutty Jerusalem artichoke with the rice and
herbs is wonderful, though. Both are embellished with sauces whipped to a
foam, the latest in culinary pretension.</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense with the delicious seared sea scallops, with yellowfoot
chanterelles on a creamy potato puree swathed in a port wine reduction.
Foam here might be construed to have something to do with the sea.</TE>
<TE>   A dish I love is the seared foie gras paired with quince. The fruit's
tart component is an ideal foil for the duck liver's richness, set in
high relief by a Madeira sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The service staff seems well-coached in the menu. I like the direct,
easy way the waiter asks if we have any questions. No one should feel
embarrassed about not knowing what chanterelles or osetra are. Waiters
bring appropriate stemware for the wine and are careful not to pour too
much in the glass. One even offered to decant the wine.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses tend not to be as polished as first courses. The best
dish I tried was steamed black sea bass in mushroom consomme. Encircled
with dried baby shiitake and enoki mushrooms, the snowy filet is
beautifully complemented by a light, musky consomme. Roasted monkfish,
though, is dominated by a vinegary sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Braised veal short ribs with custardy breaded sweetbreads sit in a
natural jus splashed attractively around in a contemporary way. My Niman
Ranch steak seems more steamed than grilled, but a swatch of parsley
persillade makes a brilliant accompaniment. Somehow I don't think Julia
would be smitten with the double chocolate bread pudding topped with
marshmallows. She might enjoy the trio of creme brulees better, or the
apple consomme with green apple ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Julia's Kitchen is a serious effort for a museum
restaurant. If it had another name, though, I wouldn't be left longing
for the homey dishes Julia might have cooked.</TE>

<HD>A. Fadiman, 85; Screenwriter, Journalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter and foreign correspondent
during World War II who co-wrote, with Theodore H. White, the
best-selling book "Thunder Out of China," died Tuesday in Captiva,
Fla. She was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Fadiman suffered from Parkinson's disease and breast cancer. A
supporter of the Hemlock Society and the right to commit suicide, she
ended her life.</LD>
<LD>   Born Annalee Whitmore in Price, Utah, she moved with her family to
California after her banker father lost his job in the Depression.
She attended high school in the Oakland-area city of Piedmont, then
was accepted to Stanford University, where she was the first woman to
be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper. She graduated in
1937.</LD>
<TE>   By 1939, she had moved to Los Angeles and was hired by MGM as a
stenographer, even though she did not know shorthand. One day she
heard about a problem in the studio's production schedule: A movie
starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney had suddenly been postponed,
and the studio needed another project to keep them busy.</TE>
<TE>   An Andy Hardy feature was rushed into production, but there was no
script. Over the weekend, Fadiman wrote a treatment and on Monday
showed it to a producer. He liked it and teamed her with another
junior writer. The result was the script for "Andy Hardy Meets
Debutante," the 1940 movie that starred Garland and Rooney.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Fadiman had her own office, secretary and glamorous
career, secured by a seven-year contract. She helped write "Babes in
Arms," also for Garland and Rooney, as well as "Ziegfeld Girl,"
"Honky Tonk" and other movies.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood's allure faded quickly for her as war in China
escalated. Soon she "found the prospect of seven years of Hollywood
fluff when the real world was falling apart unendurable," Nancy
Caldwell Sorel wrote in her 1999 book, "The Women Who Wrote the War."</TE>
<TE>   Fadiman wanted to go to China as a correspondent, but the War
Department was not allowing female journalists there. She gained
entree through a job with a relief society in Chungking and worked
directly with Madame Chiang Kai-shek. In Chungking, she fell in love
with Time magazine correspondent Melville Jacoby, whom she had met
when both were students at Stanford. In 1941, they wed in Manila, and
she became a correspondent for Liberty magazine, filing dispatches on
the Japanese hostilities there. The couple endured three months with
U.S. troops retreating from Corregidor and Bataan, finally escaping
to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Tragically, Jacoby died after a runaway propeller struck him on an
Australian airfield in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of White, a Time correspondent and best friend of
her late husband, Fadiman joined Time Inc.'s staff as his assistant
and, in 1944, became the only female correspondent in residence in
Chungking.</TE>
<TE>   She collaborated with White on "Thunder Out of China," which
examined that nation's role in World War II and became a bestseller
in 1946. It remains in print and is still considered one of the best
insider accounts of wartime China.</TE>
<TE>   When it was picked for the Book of the Month Club, she met Clifton
Fadiman, the essayist, critic, anthologist and longtime Book of the
Month Club judge. She saw him again, she said in a 1985 interview
with The Times, "when I was a scared guest on 'Information Please,'"
a popular radio show he emceed. Four years later, in 1950, they were
married. He died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by their daughter, writer Anne Fadiman; a son,
Kim; a sister, Carol Whitmore; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>California state universities bear some of the blame for public
school students who arrive at college ill-prepared, said the system's
chancellor.</LD>
<LD>   "Universities have got to help improve the public schools. We have
not done a very good job of that in the past 20 years," CSU
Chancellor Charles Reed told Associated Press in an interview
Saturday. Reed was scheduled to speak later at the American Council
on Education's annual meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Reed, 60, said CSU officials have pledged to reduce the number of
incoming freshmen who need remedial math and English classes.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000, about 45% of the 33,822 freshmen entering the CSU system
needed remedial math. That number was down 3% from the previous year.
Nearly 45.6% needed remedial English courses.</TE>
<TE>   Reed said the improvement in math may have been caused by the
system spending more than $200 million a year on programs to help
K-12 students and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Those programs include mentoring for new central-city teachers and
online training for emergency and alternative-certified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Reed said university faculty and administrators need to be more
concerned and more vocal about teaching quality and funding levels at
public schools.</TE>

whether to forgo an airport at the former El Toro Marine base that
has been nearly eight years in the planning.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the fourth time voters have weighed in on the question
of building a regional airport at the closed 4,700-acre base. But the
issue has been an overarching one in many more elections since the
proposed airport was narrowly approved the first time in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   The airport question comes before voters March 5 as Measure W,
which would rezone El Toro to become an urban park and prevent an
airport from being built there. On the same ballot, the airport
question looms large in the race for one county supervisor's seat, as
well as three other countywide offices that arguably have no
authority over the base's future.</LD>
<TE>   Yet in each case, candidates' statements or their actions
regarding El Toro are being attacked by challengers seeking support
from anti-airport south county residents.</TE>
<TE>   The airport factor is obvious in the race between incumbent
Cynthia Coad, chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors, and
Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby. Coad is one of three
pro-airport votes on the five-member county board. Norby, who opposes
the airport, has raised about $125,000 as of last month, much of it
from donors in south county.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the rancorous fight for the district attorney's seat, the
airport has emerged as an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade has met with south county political
leaders, urging support for his campaign against Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas. His pitch: Rackauckas was among four signers of a ballot
argument opposing passage of anti-airport Measure F in 2000. That
measure, which required a countywide vote before construction of
airports, large jails near homes or hazardous waste landfills, passed
with 67% of the vote. It was later overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In the nonpartisan race for county clerk-recorder, Irvine attorney
Bruce Peotter is reminding south county community groups that his
opponent, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, has been a leading supporter of an
El Toro airport. But Daly has a counterpunch: potent endorsements
from anti-airport Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman Chris
Mears.</TE>
<TE>   And county Assessor Webster J. Guillory is being challenged by
deputy appraiser Larry Bales. Bales hopes his study showing an
expected drop in property values around a future airport at El Toro
will draw support.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport has clearly become a litmus test among south Orange
County voters, affecting even races that have nothing to do with it,"
said Cheryl Katz, who conducts polling for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "On issues where people feel very personally affected, they assign
a huge emotional investment in the outcome," Katz said. North County
voters make up about 70% of the county's registered voters. Some
analysts predict, however, that motivated south county voters could
boost their influence in election-day turnout to 50% of the votes
cast.</TE>
<TE>   Some frustrated airport opponents in south county regard the
airport as a litmus test even for candidates for state office.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, I, for one, will simply not vote for any candidate
for any office in the state of California if they have not expressed
opposition to this airport," one voter wrote on an anti-airport Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Another message said state Sen. Richard Ackerman (R-Irvine),
running for California attorney general, should be shunned by
Republicans because he endorsed Coad, even though he has issued
recent statements opposing the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another questioned the position of Irvine-based Assemblyman
John Campbell, who wants to change airport zoning at El Toro to
become an urban park. Campbell supports Measure W--but his recent
declaration was too little, too late for some hard-core anti-airport
activists.</TE>
<TE>   "This is single-issue politics," said Mark Petracca, head of UC
Irvine's political science department and an airport foe.
"Traditionally, these have been issues like abortion, school choice,
school prayer, gun control. They're issues upon which, despite a gap
between the person you're voting for and their responsibility over
the issue that concerns you, you use that issue to cast your vote."</TE>
<TE>   The race in which the airport arguably plays the greatest role is
Norby's challenge to Coad. From early on, Norby sold his campaign to
south county residents as the only way to unseat one of the airport's
strongest allies and tip the board majority against the project.
Whatever happens with the airport, the Board of Supervisors will
continue to play a pivotal role in plans for the former Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   The same argument was made by former Huntington Beach City
Councilman Dave Sullivan, who raised more than $400,000 in south
county donations in his unsuccessful 1998 race for supervisor against
Jim Silva. Silva, an airport supporter, is running unopposed this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Norby will try to use the airport against Coad as an issue of good
governance, Petracca said. Measure F is an example of supervisors not
listening to their constituents, he said: Voters in every Orange
County city but two--Newport Beach and Costa Mesa--backed Measure F,
only to see supervisors successfully challenge it in court.</TE>
<TE>   In the district attorney race, the airport wouldn't have become a
factor if Rackauckas hadn't been so visible on one side of the issue,
Petracca said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's involvement in the "No on Measure F"
campaign so angered his traditional donors in south county that they
called him to a meeting to defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' explanation: He opposed the measure because it would
have made it more difficult to build badly needed jails.</TE>
<TE>   Wade recently met with several south county groups to promote his
candidacy, but so far, he hasn't attracted the sizable donations seen
in other races. As of last month, he had raised about $75,000, with
donations spread from around the county.</TE>
<TE>   In the assessor race, meanwhile, Bales said he leaped on the
airport issue because an airport would have an impact on the value of
homes nearest the flight paths. He provided airport opponents with a
study showing properties nearby would lose, in total, $1.1 billion to
$3.5 billion in value. That impact should be factored in when
evaluating the airport's cost, said Assemblywoman Patricia Bates
(R-Laguna Niguel).</TE>
<TE>   "Building this airport is going to affect tens of millions of
dollars in tax revenue," Bales said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-quarters of voters said the March election is
somewhat or very unlikely to end the debate, according to a survey by
the Orange County Business Council and Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "They see this as dragging well into the future," said director
Stan Oftelie said. "They're probably right."</TE>

<HD>Developers and the Race for a New Supervisor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The developers in Ventura County are showing that they have big-time
worries. They have just circled their wagons to protect themselves
from the possibility that Linda Parks might become our next county
supervisor.</LD>
<LD>   They fear Parks because of her commitment to good planning that
produces buildings on our land that benefit the needs of residents
and not the needs of developers, who only care about their profits.
Parks wants to protect us from over-development that leads to traffic
congestion, poor air quality and strains our schools and police
resources.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter distributed to area newspapers, billionaire developer
David H. Murdock said Parks asked for his help last fall.</LD>
<TE>   At first Murdock says that she asked him for money, then he says
that she asked for his help. Parks says that she was not there at
all. It looks like Murdock not only has his dates mixed up, he also
has what he was asked mixed up!</TE>
<TE>   Murdock is one of the largest developers in Ventura County. He
donated more than $90,000 to Randy Hoffman's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Now on to another tactic. Assemblyman Tony Strickland sent me a
letter stating that he supports Hoffman and "slings mud" at Parks. He
did this using my tax dollars. The letter was sent to all the
Republicans in his district. I would think that it is illegal to use
government money to support candidates for office. I know that is
immoral!</TE>
<TE>   I have a dream that the tactics of the developers will be seen by
the voters and that Parks will be our next supervisor. Then the
developers will be stopped from over-building in our town and the
needs of the residents will be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Jim McHarg</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When asked about a claim by David Murdock that she approached him
for financial help in her campaign for the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors, the best Linda Parks could do was change the subject by
saying, "What you have here is [her opponent, Randy Hoffman] trying
to justify taking [money] from the largest landowner in District 2."
(Times, Feb. 5)</TE>
<TE>   Why Hoffman's name would come up in regard to the validity of
statements made by somebody else is anybody's guess. And when Parks
says, "I have never taken a developer contribution in my life," a
very Clintonesque air suddenly fills the room. After all, her claim
may be technically true, but it does not answer the question of
whether or not she has asked developers for contributions and was
turned down.</TE>
<TE>   It may not seem like much and the people of Thousand Oaks are more
than free to have her make city decisions for them, but the authority
of the government seat she is vying for affects the entire County of
Ventura. And the last thing the rest of the county needs is a
politician that cannot answer simple questions.</TE>

<HD>Rating Totten and Bamieh in D.A. Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have listened to both candidates for district attorney and heard
what they have to say and, frankly, I am not impressed by Greg Totten
at all. He has not given any real reasons why he should be in the
office, unless you count riding on people's coattails as a real
reason to be in office. He expects to win just because he is a part
of the good old boy network! It is time for a new D.A. who really
wants to make a difference in our community.</LD>
<LD>   I am very impressed with Ron Bamieh. I've known him personally for
several years and can attest to the fact that he truly cares about
our community. He is an independent leader and has the experience
necessary to be our district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   While some may pass themselves off as "experienced" prosecutors
while holding a cushy, bureaucratic position in the D.A.'s office,
Bamieh is gaining the respect of Ventura County citizens by
protecting our communities in the courts. Bamieh does not shy away
from taking on those who threaten the safety of our children and our
families. His record shows that he has never lost a felony case. If
Ventura County voters want a tough experienced prosecutor, then
Bamieh is their candidate.</LD>
<TE>   Heidi Graves</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the race for district attorney, each candidate offers something
very different. I know each of these candidates because I worked as a
prosecutor in the Ventura County district attorney's office between
1984 and 1995. I will vote for Greg Totten because I know he is not
just the better candidate, but because he is the only qualified
candidate. However, if I did not know Totten personally I would vote
for him anyway for the following undisputed reasons:</TE>
<TE>   While Totten was distinguishing himself as a leading prosecutor in
the Ventura County district attorney's office, Bamieh was still in
law school.</TE>
<TE>   While Totten led the California District Attorney's Assn. in
Sacramento as executive director, Bamieh was just learning to
prosecute misdemeanor cases.</TE>
<TE>   While Totten has the bipartisan support and confidence of almost
every elected official in Ventura County, Bamieh has hardly any.</TE>
<TE>   While Totten has the endorsement of nearly every law enforcement
agency in Ventura County, Bamieh has little.</TE>
<TE>   While Totten financed his campaign with modest contributions from
numerous supporters in Ventura County, Bamieh financed his campaign
almost entirely with hundreds of thousands of dollars from one
source, his wealthy parents in San Mateo County.</TE>
<TE>   While Totten's campaign was planned by many local volunteers,
Bamieh spent $39,000 for a professional New York-based advertisement
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, while Totten's credentials demonstrate the ideal
character, leadership and experience necessary to be district
attorney, Bamieh has no such traits and therefore can only resort to
baseless appeals to popular prejudices and false claims and promises
as designed by his New York ad agency.</TE>
<TE>   John Geb</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Money may be the mother's milk of politics, but there are other
kinds of currency in the political arena. Endorsements from groups
and influential individuals constitute one part. The media follow
money, so reported stories, consciously or unconsciously, imbue
credibility upon candidates with bigger bank balances.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to distinguish between the two candidates for D.A.: Both
are middle-aged white men who are Republican and hold law degrees.
Both work in the D.A.'s office. One has fair hair and one has dark
hair; both are married. One has a father with both the desire and
ability to contribute money to his son's campaign. The other is the
heir apparent, with a cadre of established power players contributing
endorsements. Thus both are awash in political currencies. Having the
most money or the most endorsements, however, does not always
translate into a win.</TE>
<TE>   Please stop the whining about buying the election. Who cares if
Ron Bamieh's father wants to give him money for his campaign? It's a
nice gesture, one which most parents might make if they had the
inclination and means. How could the American political contacts of
Bamieh possibly hurt Ventura County? Perhaps we will be a blip on
radar screens and invited to participate in policymaking at the state
or federal level.</TE>
<TE>   I have never met either Greg Totten or Bamieh, but I am going to
vote for Bamieh for district attorney because (a) his father believes
in him; (b) the current establishment did not endorse him; and (c)
it's time for a change!</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Weber</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article of Jan. 25, you indicated that district attorney
candidate Ron Bamieh received nearly all of the cash for his campaign
from one source: his wealthy father who lives in San Mateo. This is
in stark contrast to Greg Totten, whose campaign has received
numerous, but relatively small contributions, from bipartisan and
grass-roots supporters within Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to something as important as this election for
district attorney, Ventura County simply needs the man that has
earned the job himself, Greg Totten.</TE>
<TE>   It is no accident that Totten is endorsed by nearly all Ventura
County's elected officials across party lines. Further, Totten is
supported by nearly all law enforcement agencies and their leaders in
Ventura County. As with Totten, these men and women earned their jobs
as leaders in our community. They support and endorse Totten because
they know both candidates and they know which one will get the job
done.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign contributions reveal much about a candidate's character.
In that same article, Bamieh attempts to justify his virtual total
dependence on his father in supporting his campaign by saying that
his parents love him. Perhaps Bamieh is in the habit of getting his
father to buy him whatever he wants. But that is not what the voters
of Ventura County want. I have no problem with a loving father
helping his son financially, but I do have a problem with a father
giving his son everything he wants.</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, the voters of Ventura County are going to tell Bamieh,
his loving father and their $39,000 New York-based campaign
consultant to pick up their bat and ball and go home because we don't
want to play with them.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jimenez</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I tend to cast my votes by what I know of a candidate's deeds, and
not by party or campaign advertisement. I am also prejudiced in favor
of those who work for children and young people in our community.</TE>
<TE>   I first came to know Ron Bamieh as the volunteer coach of the
Buena High School mock trial team. He contributed hundreds of hours
coaching these young people in the law and ways of our court system.
When my stepdaughter moved on to UC Berkeley, she continued her
involvement in mock trial. When her team could not find a coach,
Bamieh generously contributed his time at the team members' request
to help them improve their performance.</TE>
<TE>   The local newspapers over the years spoke of Bamieh's efforts in
the courtroom to fight gang violence. He has offered his services to
schools to help students understand the positive and negative
consequences of the choices they make. He teaches his profession,
making a difference in the lives of our young people.</TE>
<TE>   During this political season, Bamieh has not shelved his efforts
to help young people as they tackle life. Even though he is involved
in a campaign for district attorney, he continues to volunteer
countless hours to mock trial at Buena High School.</TE>
<TE>   My vote goes to Bamieh as he walks the walk and talks the talk. He
supports and guides our young people in their efforts to become
productive citizens in our community.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Pickrel</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   D.A. candidate Ron Bamieh's statement in your Jan. 25 article that
his enormously wealthy father's contributions to his campaign--in
amounts unprecedented for a Ventura County race--keep flowing because
his father and mother love him was honest and straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bamieh insults the people of Ventura County when he says
that he is limiting his campaign contributions from county residents
because "you can't be naive. People contribute because they want to
have some say. They want access, and I always worry about insiders
trying to gain influence inside the district attorney's office."</TE>
<TE>   It is disheartening that Bamieh has so little respect for the
electorate of Ventura County that he believes they cannot in good
faith contribute as much money to him as can his father and his
out-of-county friends. After all, do we really believe that Bamieh's
father or his friends give a hoot about Ventura County?</TE>
<TE>   And should we elect as district attorney a candidate who harbors
so many suspicions about the motivation of Ventura County's own
residents?</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's
office have played key roles in helping to keep our crime rate lower
than in other counties. The voters of Ventura County have been
responsible for electing the public officials in charge of those
agencies, and those public officials appear unanimous in their
endorsement of Greg Totten, Bamieh's opponent whose father apparently
is neither fabulously wealthy nor politically well-connected.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear from his comments that Bamieh does not respect Ventura
County voters enough to think that they would contribute to a
district attorney candidate because they want to keep their streets
safe and do not want the higher crime rates of the counties in which
his father and other contributors live.</TE>
<TE>   That is as clear a message as we need to support Totten than any
amount of money could buy.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old boy shot in the head when gunmen opened fire at a
teenager's birthday party in North Hills remained in critical
condition Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The youth was one of eight wounded in the shooting, which occurred
about 9:45 p.m. Friday in an apartment carport area in the 15000
block of Nordhoff Street, police said.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 youths, most between 13 and 16 years old, were at the
party when as many as three males walked up and opened fire. Police
said the attack may have been gang-related. No arrests had been made.</LD>
<TE>   Rico Caguingin said his 14-year-old daughter and her friends told
him the gunmen fired at least two blasts from a shotgun, then used an
assault weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, it could have been much worse," said Caguingin, who
picked up his daughter shortly after the shooting. "I just thank God
nothing happened to my daughter or niece."</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the wounded were taken to area hospitals and five were
released by Saturday. The critically injured teen and another youth,
who was in fair condition, remained at Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills.</TE>

Orange and the object of a two-year campaign to protect it from a
developer's bulldozers, toppled over in 45-mph winds Saturday, the
apparent victim of the very act that saved it.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a landmark in east Orange," Councilman Dan Slater said of
the 100-foot, 150-ton tree in the parking area of the Ralphs Market
at 2620 E. Chapman. "This is a great loss for the city."</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported when the tree fell about 9 a.m. during
brisk Santa Ana winds that swept across Orange County, felling many
lesser trees and spreading roof fires in another area of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Planted in the early 1900s by rancher Thomas Flippen near his
house, the tree--also called a Morton Bay Fig--was listed by the city
in 1973 as historic and worthy of protection. In 1992, however, its
fate came into question when the owners of Lucky's Market, on whose
property it stood, decided to remove it to expand their facility.</TE>
<TE>   Public outcry eventually led to a plan to save the tree by moving
it about 150 feet. The move--described at the time as the most
ambitious project of its kind in California history--took place in
1997 at a cost of about $100,000, paid for by the market at the site,
which had become a Ralphs.</TE>
<TE>   Several observers said Saturday that the move apparently weakened
the tree's root system, paving the way for its demise.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving the tree killed it," said Slater, who was elected shortly
before the plan was approved. "Arborists warned us that that would
happen and now it has. It's that simple. If the tree hadn't been
moved, it would still be alive and healthy today. It was a tragic
mistake that I regret."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McCormack, a landscape architect who at the time was a member
of the city's design review board and who opposed the move, said he
wasn't surprised by the tree's collapse. "Any time you move a tree
that big," he said, "there's a 50-50 chance that it won't survive. I
think the city needs to take this as a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   The manager of the Ralphs Market, Ralph Castle, declined to
comment. About $50,000 in damage was done to the market, Slater said,
and two cars parked in the lot suffered damage totaling about
$30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I got paged while I was out planting trees" in another area, the
councilman said. "I went over to look at it and it was a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly sorry to see it happen," Mayor Mark Murphy said,
"but we are blessed that no one was hurt at the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said he would ask city staff on Monday to investigate the
causes and ramifications of the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "While there is no way to replace this tree," the mayor said, "I
want to make sure that a tree is replanted at that location of a
formidable size to continue the heritage. I don't want to see the
tree forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Slater agreed. "I think a lot of people will miss this tree," he
said. "It was clearly a landmark. Grocery stores will come and go,
but a tree like that is irreplaceable."</TE>

<HD>Restoring a Portion of the San Joaquin River's Glory</HD>
<DH>Preservation: A 22-mile stretch will become a parkway,
thanks to a campaign by local activists. Passage of a bond measure
could help buy more land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>For nearly 150 years, ever since this valley passed from Yokuts to
white men, the river that runs through its heart has bent to the will
of a wealthy few.</LD>
<LD>   It has served as an irrigator for cattle barons and fruit kings, a
country club for duffers and a lush backyard for Fresno bluebloods
who, truth be known, claimed their piece of the river as squatters.</LD>
<LD>   Now a parkway is taking shape along a 22-mile stretch of the San
Joaquin River through Fresno and Madera counties, spreading its gifts
from a handful to the larger community. After almost 15 years of
rancor and planning, 2,800 acres of parkway land have been donated or
purchased by the state for $48 million. A bond measure set for a vote
in March could bring in an additional $25 million to buy even more
land.</LD>
<TE>   A five-mile trail replanted with native grass begins at Woodward
Park in Fresno and meanders along the gentle bluffs carved out by
California's second-mightiest river, though it looks like little more
than a creek on this side of Friant Dam.</TE>
<TE>   An 1890s house near the river bottom is being gutted and turned
into a museum with rooms that pay homage to the Yokuts, the natives
who fished the river's salmon, and pioneers such as Henry Miller, the
cattle king who first diverted its flow and paved the way for the
salmon's demise.</TE>
<TE>   "The San Joaquin is one of the most abused rivers in the country,
and to see a parkway rising feels very hopeful," said Mary Savala,
one of three Fresno women who began pushing the idea in 1986. "It's
actually happened faster and better than we ever envisioned."</TE>
<TE>   Here in the middle of the San Joaquin Valley, it is the river that
breaks the tedium of the fields and suburbs spread across the
flatland. Fresno's sprawl now reaches the bluffs, but down in the
river bottom, Savala says, the temperature and quality of light and
sound seem different. Though parkway proponents seek to preserve this
vanishing habitat through land purchases, they also want to make the
river more accessible to fishermen, bird watchers, hikers and
joggers. Last summer, 800 children attended camp there.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how jaded they are, everyone who goes out on that river
in a canoe feels the serenity, the removal from urban life," Savala
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the days when tule elk and mustangs roamed in great herds and
wildflowers carpeted the plain, the river that gave the valley its
name was hardly serene. Like so many newcomers, the Mayfields, a clan
from Kentucky, stood in wonder as they trudged over the bare hills in
the spring of 1850 and caught a glimpse of a "shining thread of
light" flowing through a "crazy quilt of colors."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Rio San Joaquin, and a peaceful tribe of Yokuts was
living amid the oaks and tules.</TE>
<TE>   "My Daddy had traveled a great deal, and it was not easy to get
him excited," Thomas Jefferson Mayfield recounted in a memoir,
"Indian Summer." "But he said that he would not have believed that
such a place existed if he had not seen it himself. And my mother
cried with joy, and wanted to make a home right here in the midst of
it all."</TE>
<TE>   The Mayfields ended up heading 30 miles south, to the Kings River,
but families from Illinois, Missouri and Texas were right behind
them. Hundreds settled along the San Joaquin and planted crops in its
flood plains, driving out the Yokuts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, no major river in America, not even the Colorado, has seen
more of its flow choked off by man, water experts agree. Nearly 98%
of the Sierra snowmelt crashing down the upper river is shunted
through a network of dams and canals to distant farms. Downstream
from the parkway, the river runs dry for 50 miles. The only trickle
in this stretch is the polluted runoff from the irrigated farm
fields.</TE>
<TE>   "The lower San Joaquin is dead. It's nothing more than a sewer
drain," said Lloyd Carter, president of Save Our Streams, a
Fresno-based group seeking to revive the river downstream.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sierra snowpack is a public resource worth billions of
dollars each year. Why should all of it go to farmers? Why not a
little to bring back the river?"</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't farming, but the ambitions of developers that gave
Savala and her two friends, Clary Creager and Peggy Smith, the idea
to push for a parkway. In the mid-1980s, after the big floods seemed
an inconvenience of the past, Fresno County began accepting proposals
to build housing tracts, condos and Scottish link golf courses in the
river bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Developers argued that the history of the river was a history of
trespass, from Friant Dam to the squatters to the gravel mines to the
mobile home parks to the three golf courses already planted in the
river bottom. What was the big fuss about a few thousand new houses?</TE>
<TE>   "The more we thought about it, the more ridiculous it became,"
Savala said. "There were lots of places to build, but only one river.
What could we do to save it?"</TE>
<TE>   A Cal State Fresno professor, Harold Tokmakian, told them such a
plan had already been commissioned by the city of Fresno--in 1918.
The passing of 80 years had made the words of Charles Henry Cheney,
the plan's author, only seem more relevant.</TE>
<TE>   "A large park on the San Joaquin River [is] essential, where city
people can get away and feel free of the cramped and narrow city life
which holds them most of the time," Cheney wrote. "Such a large park
would therefore be not only recreational and ornamental, but could
well promote the commercial welfare."</TE>
<TE>   Savala took the plan to one of Fresno's most prominent and wealthy
women, Coke Hallowell, and in 1988 they formed the San Joaquin River
Parkway and Conservation Trust with 10 others. Four years later, the
state Department of Fish and Game bought the parkway's first piece of
land, a 270-acre heron rookery known as Rank Island.</TE>
<TE>   Parkway proponents got more than a little help from the river
itself. In 1997, a historic flood washed away bridges, mobile homes
and the dreams of developers. Looking to salvage the right to develop
parcels along the higher ground, river bottom landowners in Fresno
and Madera counties began approaching the parkway to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Even the gravel mining and asphalt companies, after digging more
than 1,000 acres of pits during 70 years of operation, wanted to get
into the act. One company donated the 20-acre Riverview Ranch with
its 19th century house for the Coke Hallowell Center for River
Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the parkway has reached half of its 6,000-acre goal, though
it is unclear who will pay for public safety and the operation and
maintenance of the 22-mile main trail and restrooms. Local
governments are looking to the state, and the state is looking to
fish and bait shops and other businesses that may locate inside the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Parkway supporters see hope in a decade-long lawsuit brought by
environmentalists challenging agriculture's right to divert so much
of the river's flow. A federal judge in Sacramento has ruled that the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation must comply with state law and provide
enough water to sustain the river's fish habitat. The two sides are
trying to decide how much downstream water is needed.</TE>

<HD>Princess Margaret, 71; Sister of the Queen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Queen Elizabeth II's sister, Princess Margaret--whose life was marked
by glamour, thwarted love and gilded sadness--has died at age 71,
Buckingham Palace announced Saturday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The queen's sole sibling, four years Elizabeth's junior, had been
frail after a series of strokes and was in a wheelchair for her last
public appearances, including Queen Mother Elizabeth's 101st birthday
in August.</LD>
<LD>   The princess suffered another stroke Friday, developed cardiac
problems during the night and was rushed from Kensington Palace to
the hospital before dawn.</LD>
<TE>   She died "peacefully in her sleep about 6:30 a.m.," the royal
bulletin said. Her children, Lord David Linley, 40, and Lady Sarah
Chatto, 37, were with her.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling his "darling aunt," her nephew, Prince Charles, told
reporters: "The last few years with her awful illness were hard for
her to deal with, particularly as she was such a wonderfully vibrant
woman with such a free spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The queen, who had been with her ailing mother at Sandringham, the
royal residence in Norfolk, returned to Buckingham Palace. The death
casts a shadow over Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee celebrations, which
began last week and will culminate in July.</TE>
<TE>   The nation went into mourning as flags flew at half staff from
Buckingham Palace, the primary royal residence in London, to city
halls in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Crowds of mourners milled
outside the palace as well as the Royal Palace of Kensington, where
the princess' body was taken so friends and family could pay respects
privately.</TE>
<TE>   Early this week, it is to be moved to St. James's Palace and will
remain there until the funeral Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, is expected
to be attended only by members of the royal family and friends, while
a memorial service will be held at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Tributes poured in Saturday from the prime minister, other
politicians, heads of state, working people and pensioners.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole country will be deeply saddened by Princess Margaret's
death," Prime Minister Tony Blair said during a trip to Africa. "She
will be remembered with a lot of affection.... She gave a great deal
of service to the country."</TE>
<TE>   Her former husband, socialite photographer Lord Snowdon, said he
and the children were "extremely saddened."</TE>
<TE>   A blue-eyed beauty in her youth, Margaret was the Diana of her
day. She was gorgeous in a wardrobe judged second only to that of
Grace Kelly--the Hollywood actress who became princess of Monaco--and
was often in photographers' lenses.</TE>
<TE>   As the queen's sister, Margaret had the wealth and privileges of
royalty without the responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   She partied at West End theaters and Mayfair clubs, smoked and
drank in public when women of her social standing rarely did, and was
romantically linked to leading actors and eligible aristocrats of her
day.</TE>
<TE>   But, although she had no constitutional role, she soon learned
that there were limits on what she could do. Her life became a public
tragedy of renounced love.</TE>
<TE>   The Church of England, the British government and the Times of
London joined the royal family in opposing her plan to marry a
divorced commoner 16 years her senior who had won her heart.</TE>
<TE>   Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a World War II Battle of Britain pilot
and equerry to King George VI from 1944 to 1952, was by all accounts
the love of Margaret's life. But under threat of exile and financial
ruin, she put duty first and announced that she would not marry him.</TE>
<TE>   Henceforth, she never spoke publicly about him or anything else in
her personal life. Like her sister and mother, she did not give
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Townsend, however, reflected on the ill-fated romance in his 1978
autobiography. "I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to
counterbalance all she would have lost. It was too much to ask of
her, too much for her to give," he wrote. He died in 1995 at age 80.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Rose was born to the duke and duchess of York in 1930 at
Glamis Castle in Scotland. Six years later, her uncle, King Edward
VIII, abdicated to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson, and
Margaret's father assumed the throne as King George VI.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret reportedly said to her sister at the time: "Does that
mean you're going to be queen? Poor you."</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Buckingham Palace, where the girls grew up and
were educated privately.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, Margaret insisted that she did not suffer from
"second daughteritis" and that, although they had very different
personalities, she and her sister rarely argued.</TE>
<TE>   "In our family, we don't have rifts. We have a jolly good row, and
then it's all over. And I've only twice ever had a row with my
sister," she said. She never revealed the source of the two
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, the family lived in Windsor Castle, about 40
miles west of London, to escape continual German bombing, hiding in
the dungeons along with the crown jewels. Margaret once described the
war years as "black and gloomy" and V-E Day as a "wonderful sunburst
of glory."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, she embarked on the life of a socialite, as well as
one of royal duties. After her renunciation of Townsend, she married
socialite photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones in 1960 at Westminster
Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   They had two children, and Armstrong-Jones was made Lord Snowdon.
The couple led a public life among celebrities and front-page figures
of the '60s rather than slavishly following royal protocol.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, royal life proved to be a burden for Snowdon, and the
pair had a highly publicized divorce in 1978. Britons were
sympathetic to a woman whom they viewed as star-crossed in love.</TE>
<TE>   Snowdon married again, while Margaret embarked on a life of
parties and affairs with younger men and set up another home on the
Caribbean island of Mustique.</TE>
<TE>   She was musical and had a gift for mimicry, but was a chain smoker
and heavy drinker and later paid dearly for it. She suffered
respiratory illnesses and had part of a lung removed in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   She had a mild stroke in February 1998 and scalded her feet in hot
bathwater a year later--an injury that hobbled her for weeks. Another
stroke followed last March.</TE>
<TE>   The princess was last seen in public before Christmas at the 100th
birthday party of Princess Alice, the dowager duchess of Gloucester.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a wheelchair, Margaret wore dark glasses, and her face
appeared swollen by medication. She had lost some eyesight and
mobility after the strokes.</TE>
<TE>   During her life she was an assiduous patron of the arts,
particularly the Royal Ballet and the Scottish Ballet, as well as
children's organizations such as the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the orphanage charity Barnardo's
and the Girl Guides.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area Tourism Reeling From a Double Whammy</HD>
<DH>Study: Dot-com crash and dramatic post-9/11 drop in
business and in-state leisure travelers hit the region hard.
Officials remain optimistic nonetheless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Bay Area will feel the sting of the post-Sept. 11 tourism slump
longer than any major national destination other than Manhattan and
should not expect its visitor numbers to return to normal for a year
to 18 months, according to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   "Of 25 markets we cover, the Bay Area ranks near the bottom in the
eyes of tourists--alongside Manhattan," said analyst Troy Jones of
the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, which this week released its 2002
National Lodging Forecast.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which examines the travel-dependent hotel industry,
says San Francisco's 34,000-room lodging  business had fallen off
before last fall and is "further challenged" in its attempt to lure
back travelers.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco officials downplayed the report.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they're saying this," said Laurie Armstrong, a
spokeswoman for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau,
adding that she has yet to see the study. "I mean, 9/11 affected
tourism all over the world. Why pick on San Francisco?"</TE>
<TE>   The accounting study blamed San Francisco's tourism recession on
last year's high-tech crash as well as recent cutbacks by United
Airlines, a major air carrier serving the city.</TE>
<TE>   "With more than 80% of San Francisco's visitors arriving by air,
consumer flying concerns and airline cutbacks are reducing lodging
demands across all segments" of the region, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, between 2000 and 2001, the city experienced a 10%
decline in hotel occupancy rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We admit we took a tourist hit even prior to Sept. 11, and our
business travel was affected the most," Armstrong said. "When the
dot-com boom busted, not as many business people came to call on
clients or their home office."</TE>
<TE>   On average, as many as 25 million tourists visit the nine-county
Bay Area annually, fostering an $18-million industry that affects
everyone from cab drivers to restaurant waiters. About 200,000
residents work in tourism-related jobs.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, the jewel in the crown of Bay Area attractions,
attracted 17 million visitors in 2000--tourists who spent $7.6
billion, or $20.8 million a day, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said that in-state travelers account for 43% of San
Francisco's visitors. The rankings show that most domestic tourists
come from Los Angeles, followed by New York, Sacramento, San Diego
and Chicago. In 2000, 2.8 million overseas visitors came to the
city--led by Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Spring, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of Southern
California, acknowledged that Northern California has traditionally
been among the top travel destinations for Los Angeles-area
sojourners, but that rate has dropped recently.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, from January 2000 to January 2001, flights
from Southern California to San Francisco dropped by more than 50%.
But San Francisco hotel bookings by Southern Californians are still
strong. "My sense is that people are still going there, but that
they're driving," Spring said.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11, most Southern Californians have stayed closer to
home, he said. "They're going to Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego and
Santa Barbara," Spring said. "We're also seeing a pickup in cruises
and tours."</TE>
<TE>   The Ernst &amp; Young report concludes that the Southern California
tourist economy could recover as early as this spring as residents
drive to such places as Disneyland and SeaWorld.</TE>
<TE>   The study said that with its government contractors, the Los
Angeles area enjoys a more diverse economy than San Francisco, which
relies more heavily on tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said she believed many of those Southern California
travelers heading to San Diego and Phoenix this year would venture
north to the Bay Area as well. "We want to get those state residents
back to our city," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One strategy being touted by local promoters for the Presidents
Day weekend this month is called "Stay. Park. Play," a program in
which about 60 hotels will offer specials that include free parking.</TE>
<TE>   "That might not mean much to the tourist who flies into town,"
Armstrong said. "But we believe for state residents free parking is
key."</TE>
<TE>   While San Francisco hotel room prices--a reflection of
demand--dropped 24.3% in the months after Sept. 11, officials say
they expect those prices to rise 1.4% over normal for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   David Bratton, research manager for the visitors bureau, said that
might not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We had three amazing years in San Francisco, and then the bottom
fell out," he said. "And it's hard to say we've rebounded. We relied
too much on the technology boom."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton acknowledged that San Francisco was an expensive place to
visit, especially in a recession: "So our brand of a few days away
might not be seen as a cheap deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ernst &amp; Young report was even more dire, predicting a
$100-million shortage in the San Francisco city budget in light of
the downturn in tourists and technology jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bratton sounded hopeful. "We're still one of America's most
beloved destinations," he said. "I'm completely confident things will
rebound."</TE>

<HD>Parents Are Asking for Answers</HD>
<DH>Palmdale: School district comes under fire after a survey
questions some elementary pupils on sexual topics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palmdale fifth-grader Jimmy Fields came home from school on a recent
afternoon, made sure his three younger siblings were out of earshot,
and told his mother about the survey he'd just taken.</LD>
<LD>   A school counselor for a Los Angeles nonprofit agency administered
the questionnaire. Among other things, it asked Jimmy how often he
thought about having sex, how often he thought about touching other
people's private parts and how often he wanted to kill himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so floored, I was almost speechless," said his mother,
Tammany Fields. "He's 11."</LD>
<TE>   According to the Palmdale School District, the surveys were given
to 12 third- and fifth-graders at Mesquite Elementary School in
January, after their parents signed consent forms. But some parents
like Fields say the forms were vague and indicated only that the
questions would measure exposure to "early trauma."</TE>
<TE>   The survey has become a major embarrassment for the K-8 district
in this bastion of high desert conservatism. Some residents are
calling for the resignation of school district Supt. Nancy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The counselor who conducted the survey, Kristi Seymour, said she
was fired as a result by the Children's Bureau of Southern
California, an agency dedicated to fighting child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Distribution of the survey is also under investigation by the
California School of Professional Psychology, where Seymour is
enrolled in a doctoral program.</TE>
<TE>   The Palmdale school board will consider stricter rules for surveys
at its Feb. 19 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, many conservative and parental rights groups have
battled school districts over questionnaires that pry into the most
intimate corners of the student psyche. Allen Parker, chief executive
of the San Antonio-based Texas Justice Foundation, says too many
schools are taking the otherwise laudable concept of in loco parentis
too far.</TE>
<TE>   "This comes up all the time--you'll get this attitude from a
school district that 'these are our kids, and we can do what we want
with them.' That's a nice idea," Parker said, "but these are not
their kids. They're the parents' kids."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, his group sued the San Antonio Independent School
District over a survey that, among other things, asked high school
students if they ever wanted to switch genders. As part of the
settlement, Parker said, the district set up a parents advisory board
that now screens all questionnaires.</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey, the state Legislature passed a law last month that
strengthens parental consent rules for surveys. The bill was
influenced in part by a lawsuit that parents brought against a
Ridgewood district over a questionnaire that asked about sex, birth
control and suicide.</TE>
<TE>   In New Milford, Conn., parents complained to administrators at
Schagticoke Middle School after sixth-graders in a gym class filled
out an explicit sex survey in 2000. The school board apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "[Schools say], 'We're going to ask these very intrusive questions
about sex and drugs,' and they're really trying to find out what's
going on at home," said John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford
Institute, a Virginia-based conservative group, which joined parents
as plaintiffs in the New Jersey suit.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea being that if the kids are doing bad at school, it's the
parents' fault," he said. "Parents have become the suspects in our
society."</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale schools spokesman Isaac Barcelona said district officials
were shocked when they learned that the survey had been conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona and Seymour agree on the events that led to the issuance
of the questionnaire, up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   Both say Seymour--who had developed a good reputation after a year
and a half of counseling at the school--had approached district
officials in 2001 about a districtwide survey.</TE>
<TE>   She told officials that the responses would be used for her
doctoral thesis but also might help the district secure grants for
counseling programs, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Officials turned her down, saying the project was too big. She
returned a few months later with a pilot survey that would focus on
students at Mesquite School.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona said the district psychological services director,
Michael Geisser, reviewed the 54 questions.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona said Geisser asked Seymour to remove six questions he
thought were inappropriate and bring the survey back for further
review.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona said the counselor apparently administered the survey
without omitting the questions.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know why she went ahead with it," he said. "She never
got the final clearance."</TE>
<TE>   Seymour, 34, said Geisser only told her to take out the questions
for first-graders she had wanted to survey. She said he approved the
entire questionnaire for the older students.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 letters were sent to parents asking for their consent,
but only 20 forms were returned. The letters promised
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   The contractual portion read, "I understand answering questions
may make my child feel uncomfortable." It added that Seymour would
help parents find a psychologist for their children if they become
too uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Tammany Fields said the letter, which arrived at her house in a
district envelope, did not mention sex or suicide. "We didn't see
anything that put up a red flag," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also said the survey was a collaborative effort with
the California School of Professional Psychology and the Children's
Bureau. Both deny any involvement in the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Ellin Bloch, director of the psychology school's clinical
doctorate program, said the survey "was not carried out under the
auspices of our school."</TE>
<TE>   Bloch said the matter was "under very serious investigation" by
the school. She added that Seymour did not get the required approval
for the survey from the college's "human subjects" committee.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour said she did not submit the survey to the committee
because the district was pressuring her to send out the questionnaire
in January.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, she cried as she told of devoting her
life's work to helping children. She said that if she could do it
over again, the survey would go only to children referred to her by
police or shelters. But she said she would still consider giving it
to younger children.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of kids that age who have serious problems and
need help," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Feinberg, assistant executive director of the National Assn.
of School Psychologists, said the survey did not sound like it was
appropriate for third- and fifth-graders. But he said sensitive
questionnaires should have a place in schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very important to keep your finger on the pulse of
what kids are feeling and thinking," Feinberg said. "It needs to be
done in a responsible and scientific way."</TE>
<TE>   Tammany Fields agrees. But in this case, she said, she wasn't
given enough information on the consent form.</TE>
<TE>   "There was much that was misleading here," she said.</TE>

<HD>Hyman Weintraub, 84; Teacher and Labor Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officially, he taught American history. But he also roused--in the
finest sense of grass-roots democracy--plenty of rabble to improve
social and equal rights.</LD>
<LD>   Hyman Weintraub, who organized everything from the Jewish Labor
Committee to the California Federation of Teachers to his mobile home
park neighbors while teaching the history of the American labor
movement in classrooms from East Los Angeles to what is now Sri
Lanka, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Weintraub died Jan. 26 in the Santa Monica Pavilion rehabilitation
facility of heart failure, said his wife, Miriam. She said he had
been hospitalized since surgery Dec. 14.</LD>
<TE>   "Hy Weintraub," said their son, attorney David Weintraub, "was a
leader, an organizer and a man of great ideals.... He had a lifelong
commitment to a vision of democratic socialism, liberty and
equality."</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher, at Los Angeles High School and other campuses, but
mainly at East Los Angeles Community College, from which he retired
in 1978, Weintraub helped organize a number of unions and advocacy
groups for educators. Among them were Local 1521 of the Community
College Guild, the American Federation of Teachers of Los Angeles and
the California Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The state group made him its president, and in 1979 gave him its
Ben Rust Lifetime Achievement Award.</TE>
<TE>   One of his finest triumphs came as a tenants association
president, when he led his neighbors to convert their Malibu Village
Mobile Home Estates into a condominium complex in 1984--the first
such conversion in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Weintraub, who had lived in the park since 1976, had to win
approval from the county Planning Commission, the state Real Estate
Department and the California Coastal Commission. He also had to
persuade the landlord to sell the property to his tenants instead of
evict them, as he had planned. The battle took five years.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with most tenant groups is that they enter these
battles with a splurge, a splash, vent some anger, and then fall
apart and lose," Weintraub said. "We prevailed because we stayed
together in opposition to the eviction notices.... We had a positive
alternative, a goal, which was ownership."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City to an anarchist mother and a father who was
a leader in the Jewish Socialist Bund and an editor of the Jewish
Daily Forward, Weintraub grew up steeped in the pursuit of education
and socialist goals. He earned a bachelor's degree from Case Western
Reserve University in Ohio and a master's degree and doctorate at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In his youth, Weintraub was a speaker for the Young People's
Socialist League and an organizer for the American Student Union, and
served as educational director for the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union. He campaigned for Norman Thomas in his Socialist bid
for president and was on the Socialist Party's national executive
board.</TE>
<TE>   Practicing the labor philosophy he taught about in class,
Weintraub was an organizing leader of the Workmen's Circle and Jewish
Labor Committee and directed Camp Kindering, a Workmen's Circle
summer camp, in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Weintraub wrote a biography published in 1959, "Andrew Furuseth,
Emancipator of the Seamen," about the organizer of the seamen's
union. He also wrote a study of the International Workers of the
World (Wobblies).</TE>
<TE>   Weintraub, who served in the Army in Europe during World War II
and camped all over the world throughout his life, was a Fulbright
scholar in 1962 and taught the history of the American labor movement
in Ceylon.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 55 years; his son; two daughters,
Shelly Reagan and Debby Krupnick; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in his name may be made to the Hy Weintraub Scholarship
Fund, c/o Joel Busch, 935 Fiske St., Pacific Palisades, CA 90272.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned for 1:30 p.m. March 2 in the Sequoia
Room of the UCLA Faculty Center.</TE>

<HD>Strong Winds Fell Trees; Man Is Killed</HD>
<DH>Weather: He is pinned beneath a toppled tree at Simi Valley
tennis court. Brush fire warning is issued, with more gusts expected
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fierce winds knocked down a 45-foot tree in Simi Valley on Saturday,
killing a man who was playing tennis, and the gusts fanned fires and
downed power lines throughout Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Brian W. Smith, 51, was pinned under the tree about 1:30 p.m. at
the Oakridge Athletic Club on Erringer Road, police said.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 club members rushed to the tennis court and pulled the
tree off the victim, who died a few minutes later at Simi Valley
Hospital, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Winds reaching speeds of nearly 50 mph wreaked havoc in Ventura,
Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 80 firefighters descended on a wind-buffeted hillside
neighborhood of half-million-dollar-plus homes in Orange on Saturday
morning to battle a blaze that destroyed one house and ignited three
spot fires nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Forty- to 50-mph Santa Ana winds and a wood shingle roof sent
glowing embers floating through the northeastern Orange County
community.</TE>
<TE>   The house was destroyed, but neighbors and firefighters said they
were relieved the fire didn't spread.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been hundreds of houses," Orange Battalion Chief
Frank Eickhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   "With these kind of fires on a Santa Ana wind day, you have the
potential of having a Laguna or Oakland Hills."</TE>
<TE>   A 1993 Laguna Beach wildfire destroyed more than 300 homes. In
1991, an Oakland Hills fire destroyed 3,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hurt in the 8 a.m. fire in the 3400 block of East
Westridge Drive, where Mike Ernst, his wife and three children had
been living for several years. The family paced the street, cried and
sought comfort from friends as they watched the house burn.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the shower; I smelled smoke," said Amy Ernst, 18, the
only family member at home when the fire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Mike Tuggle said the teenager woke up a friend who was
asleep in another room. Both young women told firefighters they saw
flames coming from the garage.</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling two-story house was gutted, as was a small sedan
parked in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators determined that a malfunctioning water heater caught
fire in the garage and flames quickly roared through the home. Fire
officials said the structure and contents were valued at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warnings for high winds were in force for much of Southern
California on Saturday, and were expected to continue through much of
today, according to the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the Fire Department declared Saturday a "red flag
day," a condition in which winds exceed 25 mph and humidity remains
below 15%, spokesman Bob Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   The department staffed several fire stations in the San Fernando
Valley, including Chatsworth and Sherman Oaks, with an extra engine
and 15 more firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Crews responded to nearly a dozen downed or drooping power lines
and were on hand for possible brush fires, Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison spokesman Steven Conroy said the power
outages were widespread, hitting parts of Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service issued high wind warnings for the
mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, as well as for the
Inland Empire and the Ventura coast.</TE>
<TE>   Winds were 35 to 50 mph in some areas, with local gusts over 60
mph. The warnings were expected to continue through 2 p.m. today,
meteorologist Chris Jacobson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, this has been a pretty quiet year in terms of wind,"
Jacobson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the strongest stint we've seen so far this
season."</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol issued its own wind advisories,
urging trailers and campers to reduce speeds or stay off the roads
until the winds die down.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very unpredictable," Officer Ed Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP advisories were in place Saturday on the Foothill Freeway near
Altadena, on the Antelope Valley Freeway and at the 215 and 91
freeways in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Holly J. Wolcott, Louis Sahagun, David Haldane
and Stuart Pfeifer contributed to this report.</TE>

<DH>Philadelphia Has Become the City of Brotherly Love for
Jordan, Who Has Respect of the Younger Crowd</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The icon returneth, as kindly elder statesman.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson, who first met famously and
contentiously in a 1996 game, when Jordan told the rookie he had to
respect those who had gone before him and Iverson snarled at Jordan
to get out of his face.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Iverson is 26, a six-year pro and the reigning most valuable
player. Jordan is 38 and an MVP candidate, having revived the
Washington Wizards and his career after his latest retirement.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday, they met again in the First Union Center interview room,
partners on the East team for today's NBA All-Star game, and in
crime, both having blown off Friday's interview session.</TE>
<TE>   See, they had something in common, after all!</TE>
<TE>   A lot, it turns out.</TE>
<TE>   "All you got to do is look in his eyes," said Iverson, who must
have actually respected him in private, "you see the same Michael
Jordan. That mystique, it don't ever go nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the guy all of us wanted to be like. We wanted to be in game
situations like Mike. We wanted to overcome different things he's
overcome in his life. I tried to learn as much as possible from him,
to know what all the stuff is he went through with you all [press].</TE>
<TE>   "And for him to be that good, you knew he wouldn't come back if he
couldn't. Everybody was looking forward to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always a big game to have Michael Jordan on the other
team. I don't care if you said it wasn't, you'd be lying if you said
it wasn't. I can't say he's doing better than I thought he would. I
never thought about judging how well he would do. I knew Michael
Jordan would be Michael Jordan. That's the best in the world. To take
Michael Jordan's shoes and try to fill them, they just wouldn't fit.
There will never be another Michael Jordan. Nowhere near."</TE>
<TE>   And that's how it's going this weekend, which has become a Jordan
lovefest.</TE>
<TE>   East players say they're happy to be here because Mike is here.
Tracy McGrady, who was hoping to get the start after Vince Carter was
hurt, only to learn it would be Jason Kidd, instead, said it was OK,
because he'd still get to play with Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse, who wasn't selected, said his only
real regret was not being able to be in the team photo with Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Jordan can remember what it was like to be like
Iverson, when Jordan was the new kid in 1985 and the veterans, upset
at his rapid rise and his big Nike contract, reportedly froze him
out.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Jordan says, he's just happy to be here and content to leave
the show to the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll play my five minutes, six minutes in the first half, maybe
in the second half and let the young guys play," he said. "I don't
think I have to prove anything with these young kids. It's not my
style of game at this stage of my career. For them, it's their
showcase.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there once. I'm happy to be here. I'm going to enjoy the
game. I enjoy talking to the fellas, learning what they think at this
stage of their lives....</TE>
<TE>   "My competitive juices are to go out and try to relive 1988.
Physically, I know my body better than anybody and I'm just trying to
go to my limitations. I'm not going to try to log 20-something,
30-something minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I already told Kobe [Bryant], if he tries to make this thing
personal, I'm going to foul out in the first five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Bryant, in his first All-Star game, shot the ball almost
every time he touched it in the first quarter, determined to duel.</TE>
<TE>   But that was in Mike's previous incarnation as dynastic ruler. Now
he's back, looking more human and, dare they say it, cuddlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor," said Iverson, "something I will cherish the rest
of my life, something my son will get a chance to enjoy. He's four
years old. We sit around the house. He'll say, 'You're Allen Iverson.
I'm Michael Jordan.'</TE>
<TE>   "We play one-on-one."</TE>
<TE>   Interjected Jordan: "I hope Michael Jordan wins."</TE>

<HD>Like Magic? Scott's Not Kidding Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liz Robbins of the New York Times, commenting on the play-making
skills of Jason Kidd and the surprising New Jersey Nets who have a
32-15 record, best in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break:
"Kidd's most significant assist is the boost he has given to his
team. Like the alley-oop passes he lobs as a challenge for his
teammates in the half-court offense, or the bounce passes he rifles
to a sprinting Kerry Kittles on the break, he has elevated his
teammates to a level they have never experienced before....</LD>
<LD>   "Byron Scott, the Nets' coach, pays Kidd the ultimate compliment.
He said Kidd reminds him of Magic Johnson, Scott's former teammate
and close friend."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which player has participated in the most NBA
All-Star games?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unprecedented: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times on the
Detroit Pistons' decision to cut ticket prices by as much as 45%: "'I
think they're keeping an eye on us,' Pistons executive Dave Wieme
said with a laugh, indicating there might be some teams that don't
wholly approve of the idea. 'We've had people tell us it's totally
against the grain. But we just thought tickets prices are getting out
of hand, and we had to do something to change it.'</TE>
<TE>   "What they did was guarantee they would lose money this year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yo, I! In college football recruiting, Georgia Tech landed a
player who would have to qualify for the "all-name team": defensive
back I-Perfection Harris of Brooklyn Poly Prep.</TE>
<TE>   I-Perfection is his given name. His nickname? Just plain I.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trash talk: Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski on the trash talking
prevalent in college basketball: "Kids think that's the way of being
tough, that that's part of gamesmanship. It's put out there [by the
media] and you get notoriety. It's always been there because of the
competitive nature of the game. What we need to do is make sure it
doesn't become a prominent part."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad life: Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz has been in the NBA
since the 1985-1986 season, but he doesn't have any immediate
retirement plans, saying: "I don't know what else I'd be doing right
now. You can only hunt so much, fish so much, drop the kids off so
much at school. So I choose to work, and it pays pretty decent too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1962, Jim Beatty became the first
American to break the 4-minute mile indoors with a 3:58.9 in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charged up: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "Out in Boltland, Marty Schottenheimer and John Butler could be
prime arm-wrestlin' partners, as whispers from Mike Riley's regime
say the front office flexed its muscle when it came to personnel
calls [Flutie v. Brees] and practice speed [keep 'em fresh for
Sundays, the suits reasoned]. This could be verrry interesting since
Riles is country club compared with Martyball's boot camp."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 18.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Golf World magazine reports that courtesy cars for
pro golfers are now longer the perks they once were.</TE>
<TE>   Some players who played in the recent Heineken Classic in
Melbourne, Australia, chose to commute to the course by helicopter
and avoid traffic jams.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Loses a Fight to the Finish</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were punches, pushes, screaming and whistles aplenty.</LD>
<LD>   And some basketball too.</LD>
<LD>   Marquis Daniels made five free throws late, including two with 3.5
seconds left, as Auburn upset No. 17 Georgia, 75-72, Saturday at
Auburn, Ala., after a heated final two minutes in which two players
and Georgia Coach Jim Harrick were ejected.</LD>
<TE>   Harrick was still steamed at the officials after the loss that
dropped his team out of first place in the Southeastern Conference's
East Division.</TE>
<TE>   "With 46 seconds to go and the magnitude of the game, you just
don't kick a guy out," Harrick said. "You manage the game. If they
get mad and I get mad, then the game is exactly as it turned out."</TE>
<TE>   It turned out badly for Georgia, 18-6 overall and 7-4 in the SEC,
as Auburn (11-12, 2-8) ended its longest streak in eight seasons at
six.</TE>
<TE>   With 2:01 left, Kyle Davis of Auburn and Georgia's Steve Thomas
were ejected for fighting in front of the Auburn bench after Adam
Harrington's three-point basket had pulled the Tigers into a tie at
60.</TE>
<TE>   The melee started after Thomas hit Davis with an elbow under the
basket, and the Auburn center responded with a punch to the head.
Thomas appeared to also take a swing and chased Davis toward the
Auburn bench, where several players scuffled and two referees fell to
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Both players will be suspended one game for flagrant fighting.</TE>
<TE>   After play resumed, Derrick Bird scored on a runner in the lane to
give Auburn a 62-60 lead with 53 seconds left. Tempers flared again
on the ensuing possession when Georgia's Chris Daniels was whistled
for a foul away from the ball after knocking Brandon Robinson to the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick erupted, and received a technical. He stalked referee
Olandis Poole across midcourt before getting ejected by Tim Higgins.</TE>
<TE>   "We got three off-the-ball fouls on our end of the floor when we
had the ball, and fouls were 19 to six [Auburn] in the second half,"
said Harrick, who occasionally ran afoul with Pacific 10 referees in
his eight seasons at UCLA. "It seemed like we got called for
something almost every possession."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who had 13 points, blamed Georgia's frustrations and
physical inside play for the eruptions.</TE>
<TE>   "They were getting a little frustrated," he said. "We got in their
head. We came out playing hard, and they didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Auburn started four freshmen and a junior college transfer as
Coach Cliff Ellis shook up a struggling lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 95, Georgia Tech 63--Jason Williams scored 28 points
and Mike Dunleavy had 23 at Atlanta as the Blue Devils (22-1, 10-1 in
the Atlantic Coast Conference) established the best start in school
history. Georgia Tech (10-14, 3-8) lost for the first time in four
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Oklahoma 68, Texas A&amp;M 64--Aaron McGhee scored 21 points at
College Station, Texas, as the Sooners (19-3, 8-2 in the Big 12)
defeated the Aggies (9-15, 3-7) for the 16th time in 17 games. Texas
A&amp;M hurt itself with 61% free-throw shooting (17 for 28).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State 76, No. 5 Alabama 62--The Bulldogs (18-6, 5-5 in
the Southeastern Conference) made 12 of 19 three-point shots at
Starkville, Miss., to end a winning streak at six for the Crimson
Tide (20-4, 8-2).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Cincinnati 103, No. 19 Wake Forest 94--Steve Logan scored 30
points and Immanuel McElroy, a senior guard, had a career-high 19 at
Winston-Salem, N.C., as the Bearcats (22-2) shot a season-best 58%.
Wake Forest (17-7) is 0-5 against Top 25 teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Kentucky 68, Louisiana State 56--Tayshaun Prince scored 18
points and blocked six shots at Baton Rouge, La., as the Wildcats
(16-6, 6-4 in the Southeastern Conference) handed the Tigers (12-11,
2-8) their sixth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Florida 80, Vanderbilt 54--The Gators (18-4, 7-3 in the SEC)
converted 22 turnovers into 28 points in a rout of the Commodores
(14-9, 4-6) at Gainesville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Gonzaga 77, San Diego 76--Sophomore center Cory Violette
scored a career-high 25 points and had 15 rebounds as the Bulldogs
(22-3, 9-1 in the Big West) held off the Toreros (12-11, 4-6).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Marquette 72, Southern Mississippi 58--At Hattiesburg,
Miss., Cordell Henry scored 21 points--all in the second half--as
Marquette (21-3, 10-1 in Conference USA) extended its winning streak
to 10. Southern Mississippi is 7-14, 2-9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Illinois 69, Purdue 67--The Illini (17-7, 6-5) overcame an
18-point deficit at Champaign, Ill., with Frank Williams scoring
eight points in a 17-0 run in an eight-minute span of the second
half. Joe Marshall's three-point shot at the buzzer rimmed out for
Purdue (11-14, 3-8).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baylor 81, No. 22 Missouri 80--Matt Sayman's two free throws with
11 seconds left at Waco, Texas, were decisive for the Bears (14-9,
4-6 in the Big 12). Kareem Rush had 29 points for Missouri (17-7,
6-4).</TE>

<LD>Rock Mills and Ed Montague each hit two home runs and Pepperdine
collected 20 hits in a 30-21 victory over Tulane, ranked No. 3 in the
nation by Collegiate Baseball, in a nonconference game Saturday at
Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   With Santa Ana winds nearing 30 mph, the Waves (3-3) had five home
runs and came within three runs of the school single-game record.
Pepperdine defeated Whittier, 33-2, in 1955.</LD>
<LD>   Mills, a senior catcher, and freshman outfielder Jason Durbin each
had three hits and drove in five runs for the Waves, who defeated
Tulane (0-2) for the second consecutive day.</LD>
<TE>   The teams combined for 17 walks, 12 for Pepperdine, and 10 wild
pitches, as the pitchers struggled in the high winds.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's Carlos Quentin was hit by five pitches to set an NCAA
Division I record in the Cardinal's 15-11 victory over Florida State
at Tallahassee, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The previous single-game record was four--done seven times--most
recently by Casey Hildreth of Princeton in April, 2000 against
Pennsylvania.</TE>

<DH>Daytona 500: Rookie Johnson continues his dominance by
winning pole. Harvick, also 26, joins him in first row.</DH>

<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>

<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The easy part, winning the pole, is over for rookie driver Jimmie
Johnson. Now comes the hard part, the Daytona 500.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, 26, of El Cajon, and Kevin Harvick, also 26, of
Bakersfield, will start on the front row in next Sunday's 500 after
qualifying a pair of Chevrolets faster Saturday than 51 other drivers
around Daytona International Speedway's 2.5-mile triangular oval.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, a protege of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon, won
the Bud Pole with a lap of 185.831 mph in a car co-owned by Gordon
and Rick Hendrick, continuing his monthlong dominance. Harvick, last
year's rookie of the year and also a first-time starter in the
Daytona 500, was a tick back at 185.770.</LD>
<TE>   In both January test sessions and Friday's two practice stints,
Johnson has been in the fastest car.</TE>
<TE>   "Qualifying reflects so much of the team and very little of the
driver," said Johnson, whose career started in off-road racing as a
three-time champion in the Mickey Thompson Stadium series in the
early 1990s and winner of the 1994 SCORE desert championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe it's real. But it's really neat to see all
the hard work at Hendrick Motorsports pay off. We had shown our hand
during testing and practice. We thought some guys had an ace in their
back pockets and we didn't expect Kevin Harvick to jump up there. I
went through two packs of gum and wore out my shoes waiting for
qualifying to be over."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was the fourth driver off the line and had to sweat out 49
others before earning the pole.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, defending Winston Cup champion and a two-time Daytona 500
winner, qualified third at 185.491 in a car he said was identical to
Johnson's.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so close that when I saw Jimmie get loose over there in
Turn 4 [during his fast lap] I figured my car would do the same
thing. And it did.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot to do with picking Jimmie to be part of our team.
Maybe I saw some of myself in Jimmie. I like his style. I like the
way he does things. I like the way he handles himself in the race car
and I like the talent he has. You just hope that the experience of
the other teams at Hendrick Motorsports will benefit a new team
coming in. They've obviously done a great job of getting off to a
great start here at Daytona."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Harvick will start on the poles in Thursday's Gatorade
Twin 125 races, which serve as qualifiers for all other drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick did not race in the 500 last year because he was driving a
Busch Grand National car the day before the 500 and got into Winston
Cup only when car owner Richard Childress called on him a few days
later to take over Dale Earnhardt's car after Earnhardt's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as excited now as I was when I won my first Winston Cup race
last year in Atlanta," said Harvick. "Maybe I should wear rookie
stripes like Jimmie because it's my first 500, too."</TE>
<TE>   Never before have two drivers started at the front of the Daytona
500 who have never even raced in it before. When Johnson was asked
about it, he laughed and said, "Could be one heck of a wreck,
couldn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   The two Southern Californians are longtime friends who credit
stock-car veteran Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale for jump-starting
their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Said Harvick: "We were both fortunate enough to have Ron to take
both of us under his wing, and he's part of the reason why we're both
sitting up here today. I was living on Hornaday's couch and Jimmie
was getting ready to move in. I left when I got the ride with the No.
98 truck and then with Richard Childress. That was all a California
connection."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I had met Ron at a Chevrolet function in Detroit
and he said that if I ever needed a place to stay to call him. The
day I landed at Charlotte airport, I called him to see if I was still
welcome. Kevin had moved out not long before and Ron let me in and
wouldn't let me move out until I could [afford] to buy a house. We
called it Camp Hornaday."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson might be the least-experienced pole-sitter in 500 history.
He has been in only three Winston Cup races, with a best finish of
25th at Homestead, Fla., although he was running in the top 10 at
Lowe's Motor Speedway until mechanical problems forced him out.</TE>
<TE>   "Running those three races last year taught myself, and the team,
a whole lot," he said. "Now I have some time to practice and get in
some drafting. I need experience, so every lap I get in Thursday will
help.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a great environment. We have great equipment and I have a
great mentor in Jeff, and Terry [Labonte] and Jerry [Nadeau] help,
too. Our goal is to make the races and finish on the lead lap."</TE>
<TE>   The only other Californian to win the Daytona 500 pole was Mike
Skinner of Susanville in 1997. He was a rookie but had been in 15
previous Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving off-road racing, Johnson drove in the Busch series
and last year finished eighth in points for William Herzog and Herzog
Motorsports.</TE>
<TE>   "The Busch series was great in preparing me for Winston Cup," said
Johnson. "There have been times when drivers have come right out of
the Busch series and successfully moved into Winston Cup. Then again,
there are those who haven't.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a big advantage in driving for Jeff [Gordon], though. He
doesn't like to be called the owner. He'd rather be called the
teammate. He's phenomenal, what else can you say? I'm hoping I can
hook on the back of him and follow him through the race, and learn
when and why I need to make the moves I need to keep myself in the
front of the pack and out of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick, who has fielded five Winston Cup championship cars--four
with Gordon and one with Labonte--agreed with Gordon that what
attracted him to Johnson was that he reminded him of Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   "I got Gordon the same way," Hendrick said. "When I first saw
Jeff, I was reminded of Tim Richmond, who drove for me in 1985 and
'86 and I have always felt that Tim would be one of the greatest
drivers ever if he'd lived. So the way I look at it, Gordon is like
Richmond and Johnson is like Gordon and that means we've got a great
lineup this year."</TE>
<TE>   Richmond died of AIDS on Aug. 13, 1989.</TE>

<DH>Despite Struggles in Big 12, Texas Tech Is Thriving Under
Former Indiana Coach and Trademark Motion Offense</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Jayhawk students rattled the pages of the University
Daily Kansan in the stands Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "What's Up, Knight," the oversized headline in the student paper
blared. "Welcome to Our Conference."</LD>
<LD>   Welcome, indeed.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the rigors of the road in the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kansas, playing near the top of its game, smoked No. 24
Texas Tech, 108-81, in rowdy old Allen Fieldhouse--scoring the
second-most points against a team coached by Bob Knight. Michigan
beat Indiana, 112-64, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas Coach Roy Williams dulled the pregame boos for Knight by
his support for the coach he considers one of the greatest--a coach
for whom Williams' wife, Wanda, regularly bakes brownies when Knight
brings a team to town.</TE>
<TE>   The fans were less hospitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby Knight's Rage Gauge," read one sign, with a mug of Knight
ready to slide up and down the scale.</TE>
<TE>   "Support Your Local Elderly Secretaries," another said.</TE>
<TE>   "Grouse," a sign read, with a picture of a grouse. "Not a Grouse,"
another sign said, a reference to the 1999 hunting accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby, Don't Shoot," said the next.</TE>
<TE>   What people might find difficult to believe after seeing the
Kansas-Texas Tech margin--especially if they saw Kansas lose to
UCLA--is that Knight's team is quite good.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas (21-2, 10-0), with its devastating transition game, is on a
seven-game roll--scoring 100 points in three of its last four games,
and 98 in the other.</TE>
<TE>   But Texas Tech--even after losing three of its last four--looks
not only like an NCAA tournament team but one that could win a
first-round game, something so many of Knight's later Indiana teams
failed to do.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Raiders (16-6, 5-5) have beaten Oklahoma and Oklahoma
State at home, but are finding the Big 12 outposts rough, going
1-4--including a stumble at Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Three nights before the Kansas game, it was No. 14 Oklahoma State
that beat Texas Tech--on a tip-in with seconds left. A deafening,
orange-clad Cowboy crowd seemingly willed its team to victory as
Oklahoma State rallied from 15 points down despite an injury to their
best player, Maurice Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "They're good, I'll tell you what," said Oklahoma State Coach
Eddie Sutton, whose team lost by 24 at Texas Tech and was lucky to
win at home.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson's fourth-ranked Sooners beat Texas
Tech by 26 at home, then lost by 13 at  Lubbock.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Knight has done an unbelievable job with that team. He
really has," Sampson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not only coach of the year in this league, I think he's
coach of the year in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech was 9-19 last season before Knight arrived, and only
3-13 in the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Raiders--picked to finish 10th in the league by
coaches--have turned it around with Knight's trademark discipline,
defense and motion offense.</TE>
<TE>   But don't be mistaken, he has some players.</TE>
<TE>   There is Andy Ellis, a finesse senior center who shoots the
three-pointer and isn't afraid to bang down low. There's Andre
Emmett, a muscular 6-foot-5 guard with tremendous offensive skills
whose game has grown by leaps and bounds in his sophomore season. And
there's Kasib Powell, a sinewy, athletic forward recruited by Knight
from a junior college.</TE>
<TE>   "That triangle could play anywhere in the league, outside of maybe
Kansas," Sampson said.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech lost to Kansas by such a large margin partly because
none of those players logged 30 minutes. Powell suffered an ankle
injury and Emmett was hurt by foul trouble and a subpar shooting
night. (He made only six of 17 and finished with 15 points.) The Red
Raiders also left a sometime starter, guard Nick Valdez, at home with
an ankle injury, but walk-on freshman Nathan Doudney was excellent as
his replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's team took a seven-point lead in the first 12 minutes, but
Kansas surged ahead on a 13-0 blitz that was the doing of guard Kirk
Hinrich--turning in his latest marvelous game with 28 points and
three assists--and Drew Gooden, who had 21 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "What they have, their most important ingredient, is just
relentlessness," Knight said. "We just got beat by a better team.</TE>
<TE>   "They just keep going full-tilt. It's really fun to watch. They
come at you full throttle. If you make a bucket, they're right back
at you. If they throw the ball away, they're right back at you.
There's a relentlessness to the way they play that's found very
rarely."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas' running game was fueled by a 47-36 rebounding edge and
Texas Tech's poor shooting--only 36.7%, allowing the Jayhawks to take
the ball off the boards and go.</TE>
<TE>   If Kansas has a vulnerability, it is the size of its three
guards--none of them as tall as 6-4--who struggled to shoot over
UCLA's taller perimeter players in their loss at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech took advantage of some of those mismatches early, but
the injury to 6-7 Powell and Emmett's foul trouble spoiled that.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech's flaw is uncertainty at point guard and a certain
inability to hold big leads, with the Red Raiders sometimes crumbling
in the crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a problem all year long in several different games
where we've gotten a lead and then it's like, 'Well, this game's
over,'" Knight said a few days earlier after late turnovers and
failure to block out doomed the Red Raiders against Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we think we're bringing Randy Johnson in to pitch for
the last three outs, and that just doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kansas players see how much Texas Tech's team has
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're much more disciplined," Hinrich said. "And they set
screens left and right, all kinds of screens, lateral and back. It
gets annoying. You have to stay with it."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Nick Collison agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really notice Coach Knight on the sidelines, but you
could tell from the way they played it was his team."</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks understood they were only part of the show Saturday</TE>
<TE>   "It was just weird, all those cameras: He came in, and they all
rushed over and we couldn't even do our layups," said Hinrich--the
sort of player Knight can appreciate, a coach's kid who does all the
right things.</TE>
<TE>   "He tapped me on the rear," Hinrich said with a faint smile. "I
was kind of surprised."</TE>
<TE>   The fans wanted what one sign called a Texas Technical--but Knight
has yet to receive one this season.</TE>
<TE>   He came closest in a meltdown at Oklahoma State, pursuing official
Kerry Sitton for not heeding his call for a timeout, but his son Pat
Knight, an assistant, helped urge Knight back to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Against Kansas, he held a grudge for an offensive interference
call and also threw a towel. But never mind, so did Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is cognizant of the scrutiny. On good behavior, some say.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter, seemingly trying to bait him, twice asked Knight to
step outside into a larger area for the crush of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The second time, Knight was ready with a retort.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd have said, 'Can we step outside,' you guys would have a
headline," Knight said.</TE>

<HD>Fun and a Game for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: When they aren't part of the spectacle,
Richardson, Miles and Brand take in the festivities and enjoy their
stardom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>And now for a brand-new All-Star phenomenon, a multi-Clipper sighting
on All-Star weekend!</LD>
<LD>   Two of them, Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles in Saturday's
rookie game. One, Richardson, in the three-point contest. One, Elton
Brand, in today's real game.</LD>
<LD>   For the Clippers, the weekend got off to a big start when
Richardson scored 22 points with nine rebounds and Miles came off the
bench to score 20, making nine of 11 shots, for the second-year
players, who lost to the rookies, 103-97.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we are very proud," Richardson said. "In the past, there
haven't been a lot of guys from the Clippers in any of these events,
besides the rookie game, because we make the lottery a lot....</TE>
<TE>   "We thought Elton [Brand] was going to be here from the beginning,
but we are glad he got put in to replace [Shaquille O'Neal]....</TE>
<TE>   "I think for me, I don't think it will really sink in until we're
through playing. This is our second year in a row being on the same
team and being able to be here All-Star weekend, and we're just happy
to be here right now. We've seen the older players and we're happy to
get to hang with them and stuff like that. Even though we're here
playing, we're still fans of everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Golden State's Jason Richardson, who scored 26 points for the
winning rookie team, was the game's MVP. Sacramento's Peja Stojakovic
won the three-point contest in a 24-second shootout with Cleveland's
Wes Person, 9-6. Golden State's Richardson won the dunk contest.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner David Stern insisted the league does not want to
leave Charlotte, but because the franchise has not been able to
secure a new arena, owners George Shinn and Ray Woolridge will be
allowed to move to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the situation is the fact that there is no
communication anymore between Charlotte officials and the Hornet
owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fair to say that in any situation, where [a team] is
moving and there's been a problem, then I think ownership has to have
a responsibility along with the league and some part of the city,"
Stern said. "I think that we moved from Vancouver and I'm not going
to point the finger only at Vancouver."</TE>
<TE>   If the Hornets move, it will be the second franchise shift in two
seasons, after the NBA went 16 years without one, a feat Stern used
to brag about.</TE>

<HD>This Game Has Lacked Star Appeal Since 1992</HD>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>I got those Low-Down, All-Star, What-Am-I-Doing-Here (well, you've
got to do something) Blues Again, Baby.</LD>
<LD>   Oh no, bloated corporate sellout time again so soon?</LD>
<LD>   With Michael Jordan back in the nick of time, the NBA bids
farewell to prime time, network style, with today's All-Star game,
the last one to go out over the air before the event moves to cable
as part of the new TV deal next season.</LD>
<TE>   As they say in the league offices, please, Mike, don't ever leave
us again.</TE>
<TE>   When Jordan made his last appearance, in New York in 1998, Kobe
Bryant, then 19, tried to shoot it out with him before a Madison
Square Garden chock full of celebrities. The NBA was still deemed
healthy and its leaders marketing geniuses.</TE>
<TE>   Then Jordan departed. Let's just say the transition to the NBA's
young stars wasn't everything Commissioner David Stern hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   This event, in particular, suffered. The 1999 game was called on
account of lockout. In 2000, the day after Vince Carter's electric
lead-in in the dunk contest at Oakland, Tiger Woods ran the NBA over
in the ratings. Last season at Washington, the East came from 19
points behind in the fourth quarter to slay the mighty West, but the
ratings ticked upward only slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, All-Star games are now hard sells everywhere.
Baseball's game, once a marquee event--the Midsummer's Night
Classic!--sets new rating lows annually. Being selected doesn't even
mean anything any more, since every team must be represented. Barry
Bonds was an All-Star last season, along with Ben Sheets.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's Pro Bowl was a nonstarter. Baseball and basketball
players may be able to put on a show while coasting, but it doesn't
work in football, where the attraction is speed and contact. It's a
rare newsman who can talk his boss into a trip to Waikiki.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL just held its game in Los Angeles, whether or not you were
aware of it, while several players suggested that, with Olympic play
next, it was superfluous.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's this game, swallowed as it has been by a three-day
marketing and sponsor-schmoozing pageant known as All-Star weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Old-timers hate it. Even if he couldn't get reservations in Cabo
at this late date, Phil Jackson would rather be staked over an
anthill than here. Milwaukee's resident philosopher, George Karl,
compares it to "the burning of Rome."</TE>
<TE>   The first one I covered was here in 1970. The NBA threw a banquet
for everyone involved, players, team officials and press.</TE>
<TE>   Now it takes three hotels just to house them. In order of
importance, it's 1) high league officials, team owners and sponsors
at the Four Seasons; 2) players at the Marriott; 3) press at the
Marriott Courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   As a peculiarly star-driven enterprise, the NBA was well-suited
for All-Star competition, which thrives on star turns, assuming, of
course, your stars feel like taking turns.</TE>
<TE>   As late as 1992 in Orlando, where HIV-positive Magic Johnson made
his controversial appearance and Isiah Thomas, his estranged friend,
led everyone over for a group hug, it was still great.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it has been downhill, like riding a bicycle off a
cliff.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a galvanizing personality, like Magic, Larry
Bird, Pete Rose or Wayne Gretzky, it's merely an exhibition, no
longer a show.</TE>
<TE>   Once, such NBA stars as Johnson or Julius Erving talked about
passing the torch. Then they passed it to Jordan, who left it in his
hotel room. After making his rep in the '80s, Jordan began showing up
late, paying his $10,000 fine for ducking the media session and
chilling through the game as long as no one tried to embarrass him.
Now, you never hear a word about any torch.</TE>
<TE>   After '92, the most memorable moments were the '94 game in
Minneapolis, when the West ganged up on Shaquille O'Neal, and the '96
game in San Antonio, when Shaq stomped off after the writers gave
Jordan the most-valuable-player award.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's dunk show at Oakland breathed life into that hype for all
of one weekend. The next season, Vince dropped out, leaving a bunch
of nobodies to dunk it out. This season, they're down to four
entrants with the Phoenix Suns' Shawn Marion sending his regrets.</TE>
<TE>   In the '80s, Jordan, himself, defended his dunk title, including
the big dunk-off with Dominique Wilkins in Chicago in '88. Now for
the stars, it's one and done. The winner may start lamenting he
doesn't "just want to be known as a dunker," while they're handing
him his trophy.</TE>
<TE>   These days Stern has enough to worry about, just getting his stars
into the game. The new rule is, if you're playing in your team's
games, you have to play in this one. The Lakers thought of a nifty
way out, resting O'Neal against the lowly Chicago Bulls so he could
take the weekend off and rest his sore big toe. There was speculation
he would attend the Bulls game in a wheelchair, with his leg up, a
cast on his foot and, perhaps, a bandage on his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Lakers thought they'd win. Now they'll really have
to pay the Bulls back the next time they see them.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Gerald Wallace says he's excited to be here, but
he's not only a dunker.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome back, Mike. We missed you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   No rookie game for you guys: On All-Star Saturday, a large chunk
of NBA personnel people went instead to nearby Trenton, N.J., to see
a high school junior, 6-foot-7 LeBron James from St. Vincent-St. Mary
High of Akron, Ohio. James is already rated the hottest prospect in
high school and a lottery pick whenever he comes out. ... Apparently
doesn't believe a new dynasty is at hand: Minnesota General Manager
and former Boston Celtic great Kevin McHale, on new-generation stars
Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker: "C'mon, they couldn't carry Larry
Bird's jock. ... You're considered a great player when you win. Bill
Russell, [Bob] Cousy, [John] Havlicek, [Dave] Cowens, Jo Jo [White],
the Jones boys [Sam and K.C.], that's elite company. You win some
championships, then you mention their names. Prior to that, it's a
tad premature." ... New Jersey's Richard Jefferson, after the Nets'
34-point victory against the Sacramento Kings, on how it felt to beat
the best team in the West: "They're not the best team in the West."
... Sacramento insiders now predict King fans will pelt Jefferson
with mail and insults, possibly for the rest of his life. As one
said: "That's just the sort of comment that sets Goober and Aunt Bee
off." ... With the Suns in the Bay Area, guard Joe Crispin, cut by
the Lakers earlier, attended the Arizona-Stanford game at Maples
Pavilion. Randomly selected from the crowd to attempt a half-court
shot, he made it. He may now be eligible to return for a $100,000
shot and says he'd be happy to. Said Crispin: "That's what you get
for looking like a normal dude."</TE>
<TE>   More red meat, please: Portland's Rasheed Wallace dived into the
press section for a loose ball in the Delta Center, failed to save
it, took a swing at a TV monitor and grazed the glasses of the Salt
Lake Tribune's Steve Luhm, knocking them askew. Returning to the
floor, Wallace then got into an argument with referee Hue Hollins,
who ejected him. Then the Trail Blazers lost. The next day, an NBA
official called Luhm, noting that after reviewing the videotape, they
concluded that Wallace hadn't actually touched Luhm. Luhm noted he
didn't rearrange his own glasses. Wallace wasn't suspended. ... Trail
Blazer rookie Coach Maurice Cheeks, showing how overmatched he is: "I
have no problem with [Wallace] when he gets thrown out of the game.
Obviously, I would like him in the game because he gives us more of a
chance to win. But I have no problem when sometimes his emotions take
over, if for some reason he thinks he is not getting a fair call."
... Just another week in the life of your Mailman: After scoring his
34,000th point, Karl Malone is on pace to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
record 38,387 in the 2003-4 season, at his current pace (23.5 points
a game). Malone said he intends to stay around at least that long:
"Who says that's all the years I'm going to play? I know what people
are saying--that I won't be able to play too much longer. But I know
what my skills are and how hard I work. I know I will still be able
to contribute to my team. So maybe I've got more time than everybody
thinks." ... Mailman, a few days later, after a loss at Houston in
which Steve Francis shot 22 free throws: "Out with the old, in with
the new. The NBA doesn't want their game to be played the way we
play. They want an up-and-down game. Oh well, they won't have me to
worry about." ... Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, after Malone
sprained an ankle in the preceding game and played against the
Rockets: "I've seen a safe fall on him and he played the next game."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six days after leading the New England Patriots to a Super Bowl
victory, 24-year-old Tom Brady was a third-string quarterback
Saturday in the AFC's 38-30 victory over the NFC at Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it was Rich Gannon of Oakland who threw two touchdown
passes in just more than a quarter as the AFC starter, including a
55-yard strike to Marvin Harrison for the squad's first score after
trailing 10-0.</LD>
<LD>   Gannon was selected the player of the game for the second
consecutive year, becoming the first two-time winner. He completed
eight of 10 passes for 137 yards as the teams combined for 34
first-quarter points, the most in a Pro Bowl quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Brady finally got his chance with 14:16 to play and with the AFC
well on its way to winning its fifth Pro Bowl in six years. He
completed two of five passes for 22 yards and had a pass intercepted
by Champ Bailey of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A human rainbow of red, white and blue covered the field in a
patriotic pregame ceremony that featured a bald eagle soaring through
the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   One member of the Super Bowl champions did dazzle. Ty Law
intercepted Donovan McNabb's pass late in the game and ran 31 yards
before pitching the ball to Ray Lewis, who went 13 yards for the
AFC's final touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Buffalo Bills hired former San Diego Charger coach Kevin
Gilbride as their new offensive coordinator, the team said. Gilbride

<TE>   Tom Watson shot a six-under-par 66 to take a two-stroke lead over
Hale Irwin after the second round of the Senior PGA Tour ACE Group
Classic at Naples, Fla. Watson had a two-day tournament-record
14-under 130 on The Club at Twin Eagles course. Irwin shot a 64. Dana
Quigley (68) was three strokes back at 133, and Allen Doyle (67) and
Jim Thorpe (68) followed at 134. Ben Crenshaw, the two-time Masters
champion making his senior debut, rebounded from an opening 76 with a
67 for a one-under 143.</TE>

Paul Haarhuis and Sjeng Schalken rallied the Netherlands to a 2-1
lead against defending champion France, beating Cedric Pioline and
Fabrice Santoro, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5. The other matches each stand 2-1
and will depend on today's reverse singles as Spain leads Morocco,
Britain jumped ahead of Sweden, Russia has the advantage over
Switzerland, and Croatia leads Germany. In Birmingham, England, Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski came from a set down to maintain their
unbeaten Davis Cup doubles record, beating Australian Open champion
Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6 (1), 2-6, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-3.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Loses Way at California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a game so close, Amit Tamir said the basket never looked quite so
large.</LD>
<LD>   California's 6-foot-10 freshman forward came off the bench to make
14 of 19 shots for a season-best 39 points as the Bears handed No. 13
Oregon a 107-103 loss in double overtime at Berkeley, the Ducks'
second consecutive overtime defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Tamir, a 22-year-old from Jerusalem, scored six of his points in
the second overtime, helping California, which fought back from a
19-point first-half deficit and registered its biggest comeback
victory since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Tamir made five of six three-point attempts in the fifth-highest
individual scoring effort in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "The basket looked so much bigger than it ever has before," Tamir
said. "I just felt in the zone. Everything I shot somehow made it
inside the basket."</TE>
<TE>   After a tip-in, Tamir made a three-pointer to open the second
overtime giving Cal (17-5, 8-4) the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks (17-7, 9-4), who lost, 90-87, in overtime to No. 20
Stanford on Thursday, got a career-high 29 points from Luke Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon made 55% of its shots, including 10 of 14 by Jackson, but
the Ducks committed 21 turnovers and just couldn't slow Tamir or the
Bears, who scored 72 points after intermission.</TE>
<TE>   "The question was whether we could come back from that loss to
Stanford," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "We played hard, but the
ball just didn't go our way. That's life on the road in the Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Arizona 85, Washington State 68--Luke Walton had 26 points
and 10 rebounds as the Wildcats took sole possession of first place
in the conference with a victory at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Salim Stoudamire had 17 points and Rick Anderson 11 for the
Wildcats (17-6, 10-3), who won their fourth consecutive and 34th in a
row over the Cougars (5-16, 1-12). Washington State hasn't defeated
Arizona since Jan. 30, 1986, when it won by two points in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bush had 23 points and seven rebounds for the Cougars, J
Locklier had 13 points--all in the second half--and 12 rebounds, and
Marcus Moore had 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats led by 21 points at halftime and maintained a
double-digit lead throughout the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars got within 11 points twice--at 47-36 on the first two
putbacks by Milton Riley in a 24-second span. But Walton and Anderson
answered each basket by Riley with three-point shots--Anderson's
boosting the Wildcats to a 55-40 lead with 14:19 remaining--and
Washington State was on the way to its 14th loss in 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Stanford 77, Oregon State 55--Curtis Borchardt had 20
points and 12 rebounds to record his fourth consecutive
double-double, and 10th of the season, to lead the Cardinal at Palo
Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Teyo Johnson scored a career-high 15 points and Casey Jacobsen had
13 as Stanford (15-6, 8-4) won its ninth consecutive against the
Beavers at home.</TE>
<TE>   J.S. Nash scored 12 points to lead Oregon State (10-13, 3-10),
which lost its fourth consecutive game and fell to 0-8 against ranked
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is part of a four-way tie for third place in the Pac-10,
where one game separates first from sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford opened a 57-47 lead after Jacobsen scored with 7:52
remaining to play. The Cardinal maintained a double-digit lead the
rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 86, Washington 74--Chad Prewitt scored a career-high
33 points, including 21 in the second half, and grabbed nine rebounds
to lead the Sun Devils (13-9, 6-7) over the Huskies (8-15, 2-11) at
Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn scored 30 for the Huskies, who have lost 12 consecutive
at the Arizona schools. Washington has been swept at the Arizona
schools in 12 of the last 14 seasons and has a combined 2-28 record
in Arizona since 1989.</TE>

<DH>Negro League Players Recall When Baseball Was Special to
Blacks</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Preston played the Dodger Stadium organ as it had never been
played before. The stands rumbled with the rhythm of the afternoon,
the rhythm of a celebration, an appreciation.</LD>
<LD>   Singing the Negro national anthem, then "God Bless America" and
finally the "Star-Spangled Banner" loud and proud was Elmer Carter,
who turns 91 on April 12 and who was one of 33 former Negro League
baseball players at "The Game of the Century." This was an exhibition
game sponsored by the Black Baseball Players Assn., played by former
African-American and Latino players representing the Los Angeles
Black Sox and Houston Black Jax.</LD>
<LD>   The uniforms were vintage. The play was spirited. Players slid
into bases and ran out ground balls, and Glenn Braggs even hit a
massive home run that almost left the stadium, landing in the
left-field bullpen in a 4-3 Black Sox win.</LD>
<TE>   But the afternoon wasn't about runs, hits and errors. It was about
what baseball once missed--the supreme talent of the black
athlete--and what baseball is now missing--the presence in
significant numbers of black baseball fans in major league ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   There were about 4,000 people in the stands and if only each of
them could have talked to the two 90-somethings who walked straight
and tall onto the field to be honored.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, who came from Sacramento, played only two years in the
Negro Leagues, for the Birmingham Black Barons and the Kansas City
Monarchs. Carter was 19 when he left his Oklahoma home for life on
the road. He was happy to ride in old buses and older cars and room
in cheap hotels with four or five other teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived, breathed and dreamed baseball from the time I was a
little boy," Carter said. "I played with a rag ball from the time I
was a little boy. They used to call me 'Snake' because, they said, I
could spot a ball in the grass like a snake in the grass. That was a
little funny because my daddy died of a snake bite."</TE>
<TE>   Left blind by diabetes, which, Carter said, only makes it nicer to
listen to baseball games on the radio, Carter was not sitting in
Dodger Stadium for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "When they cut the ribbon on this place, I was here," Carter said.
"When they played the first game here, I was in the seats. I ate
Dodger Dogs before they were called Dodger Dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Carter remembered playing with Josh Gibson. "Greatest player I
ever saw," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He left the Monarchs when he was 20. "My mama said I had to come
home and get married or she'd break my ears," Carter said. "I didn't
want to, but mama said. After the wedding I was riding in the car
with some of my friends. We were celebrating my marriage and the car
turned over. I broke my right shoulder and could never play baseball
again."</TE>
<TE>   Never played it, always loved it even while he stayed away from
the game because his longing to play made it too hard to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Porter, who will turn 92 next month, had a longer career,
22 years. He played for the Nashville Elite Giants. He played for
money in Mexico, Canada and Cuba. He played because, he said, "the
game was in my blood."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers did the smart thing and the right thing by donating
the use of the stadium to Ted Milner, a former professional player
who organized this game.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed as if there were more African-American people in the
stands on this February afternoon than there are for weeks all
totaled during the Dodger season.</TE>
<TE>   Porter said it had made him sad, over the years, to see how the
game he so loved had evaporated from the communities he had lived in.
"You used to see black kids playing in parking lots or dirt fields,
it didn't matter," Porter said. "Now you don't see black kids playing
baseball and I wish they would. It is a great part of our history."</TE>
<TE>   Milner, chief executive of Executive Temps, put almost $400,000 of
his money into this game. The old Negro League players were flown
from all over the country to Los Angeles. They were entertained at a
dinner at Dorsey High on Thursday and at a pregame reception.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know so many people remembered us," Carter said. "This
means a lot."</TE>
<TE>   For Milner, the triumph of the day came when he ran into the
outfield. He played in the game and when he looked along the outfield
wall, where there are pictures of Dodger greats, where he saw the
images of Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, Milner said, "Thank
you, Jackie; thank you, Roy; thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Smith, 42, of Compton, had his three sons with him. They
had bought Black Sox caps and were standing in line for Dodger Dogs.
Smith's three boys--Warren Jr., 12; Henry, 10; and Byron, 7--have
never been to a major league game.</TE>
<TE>   "The price, the expense of parking, it's hard for a working man to
take his family to big league games," Smith said. "And my kids,
they'd rather play basketball. They're always after me to get Lakers'
tickets. The interest in baseball just isn't in my kids. I wish it
was. My dad used to hit balls to me, but I can't get my kids outside.
It just seems like baseball isn't a game for us anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it weren't so," Porter said. "When I grew up in Arkansas,
all us black kids did was play baseball. We loved the game so, even
when we couldn't dream of being in the big leagues or making all that
money. We just loved the game."</TE>
<TE>   The game was simple Saturday. A foul ball in the stands had
hundreds of kids squealing in pursuit. Youngsters were asking
80-year-olds for autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Milner wants to make this an annual event and bring it to other
cities, other stadiums. If major league baseball officials have any
sense, they will not want Milner using his money, or having to raise
it, to do these events. If the millionaire players of today have any
sense, they will not want Milner using his money or raising it
either.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners and players should take up Milner's cause. The
fans already have.</TE>

<LD>The sellout crowd at the Bren Center anxiously awaited a Jerry Green
moment and it finally came at the usual time.</LD>
<LD>   Green had the ball in his hands with the Anteaters down by one
point, and Utah State had visions of Jan. 10 flashing in its minds.
The scene was set for another buzzer-beating shot, perhaps one like
the floating jumper that the senior guard made back in Logan to beat
the Aggies.</LD>
<LD>   Green was forced to give up the ball as the seconds dwindled, but
he found Mike Hood behind the three-point line. Hood missed a
three-pointer as the buzzer sounded and Utah State held on Saturday
night for a 62-61 Big West Conference win.</LD>
<TE>   With the victory, Utah State (18-4, 10-3) pulled into a
first-place tie with Irvine (17-7, 10-3).</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough game," said Green, who had 16 points but made only
two of 13 shots. "I tried to drive and penetrate and I kicked it out
to Mike."</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies can thank Desmond Penigar for saving them from blowing
a 16-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Missed free throws allowed the Anteaters two chances to win. On
the first possession, Toraisno Johnson and Brennan Ray switched off
on Green and forced him to alter his shot. Penigar rotated over and
swatted it away.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Idaho 64, Long Beach State 62--Playing for the first time since
Wayne Morgan announced he intends to resign as coach at the end of
the season, the 49ers blew a 35-20 halftime lead and lost their
second consecutive conference game at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Bethuel Fletcher hit the second of consecutive three-pointers with
4:40 left to give the Vandals (8-14, 5-8) their first lead of the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach (8-16, 4-9) trailed, 60-59, with 1:50 left, but Ron
Johnson missed a layup. On the 49ers' next possession, Idaho stole
Johnson's inbounds pass and Fletcher hit two free throws for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had 23 points for Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara 58, Cal State Northridge 51--The Gauchos clamped
down defensively in the second half and won before 2,474 at the UCSB
Campus Events Center.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara (14-8, 8-5) employed an extended zone defense and
held the Matadors (8-13, 7-5) without a basket for a 9:41 span until
Jermar Welch scored on a turnaround shot with 2:47 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge guard Markus Carr scored 20 points, only five in the
second half. Mark Hull led Santa Barbara with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside 70, Cal State Fullerton 58--Ted Bell scored a
career-high 23 points to help the visiting Highlanders end a six-game
conference losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Bell matched his previous high of 18 points with a four-point play
midway through the second half that gave Riverside a 48-42 lead. Bell
sank a three-pointer two minutes later that completed a 9-0 run and
put the Highlanders (7-13, 4-8) ahead, 53-42. Bell made six of seven
shots from beyond the three-point stripe.</TE>
<TE>   Babacar Camara had eight blocked shots for Fullerton (4-17, 1-11),
tying the conference record set by Fullerton's Steve Shaw in 1978.</TE>

<HD>A Good Knight for Alford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Barrero</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Alford spent a recent restless night reading a book about
legendary former North Carolina coach Dean Smith.</LD>
<LD>   And it gave the Iowa coach some inspiration the next day.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm on my way to work, and I'm saying, 'He's the winningest coach
of all time, a great coach,'" Alford told several Iowa papers
Thursday. "But I played for what I think was the greatest coach of
all time. It's crazy why I don't just pick the phone up and call
him."</LD>
<TE>   Alford, who played at Indiana, spoke, of course, of Bob Knight,
now at Texas Tech. The two have had their differences since Alford
took the Iowa job in the spring of 1999 and hadn't had a conversation
since then.</TE>
<TE>   So Alford made the call, and to his relief, Knight took it.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked to me for about a half-hour," Alford said. "He said,
'Hey, I've got three things here to tell you. One, great job last
year with what you did with your team. That's a phenomenal job. Two,
you got off to a great start this year. Three, you've got problems,
let's talk.'"</TE>
<TE>   Although the conversation eased Alford's mind, it didn't do
anything to help his team recover from an awful stretch of late.</TE>
<TE>   Since starting the season 12-3 and appearing to be on cruise
control for an NCAA tournament bid, the Hawkeyes have dropped seven
of 10 and are in ninth place in the Big Ten Conference, including
Saturday's 86-78 home loss to Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Happy returns: Trevor Huffman returned to his roots and showed
everyone what they're missing.</TE>
<TE>   The Petoskey, Mich., native, who had a difficult time attracting
Division I attention before Kent State took a chance on him, scored
21 points for the Golden Flashes in a 96-66 victory against Central
Michigan at Mount Pleasant, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman, a senior, scored 19 points in the second half as Kent
State further established itself as a team few will want to face come
tournament time.</TE>
<TE>   The unranked Golden Flashes, whose RPI climbed to 43 this week,
improved to 18-5 overall and 11-1 in the Mid-American Conference,
stifling the early-season talk about conference rival Ball State
taking center stage. Ball State lost 85-71 to Ohio on Saturday to
fall to 8-4 in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the ball: At NBA All-Star festivities this weekend in
Philadelphia, Kobe Bryant had this to say about what kind of game he
acquired playing in nearby Lower Merion, Pa., as a youth:</TE>
<TE>   "Playing in Philly, you learn about the overall game," Bryant
said. "In New York, it's mainly handles. In Los Angeles, it's pure
shooters. In Philadelphia, they try to teach you to be the best
all-around player you can."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schmieder, who attends Drexel in Philadelphia, certainly has
had the city's mentality rub off on him, despite being from Long
Valley, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Schmieder recorded the first triple-double for Drexel
in 15 years, scoring 19 points, grabbing a career-high 12 rebounds
and passing for 10 assists in a 97-89 victory over Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   The last Drexel player to achieve the feat was Michael Anderson,
who had 37 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists against Liberty on Nov.
30, 1987. Anderson had triple-doubles six times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shot(s) in the dark: When considering that Marcus Hatten of St.
John's shot six of 26 from the field, including one for seven on
three-point attempts, it doesn't add up that he'd finish with a
career-high 34 points in the Red Storm's 85-83 overtime victory over
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   But those numbers don't include Hatten's record 21-of-25
performance at the free-throw line, including six in a row after
technical fouls were called against the Connecticut coaching staff
late in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Hatten's free-throw exploits set a Big East Conference record. The
junior college transfer leads the team with an 18.9 scoring average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making waves: It has been a rather uneventful season for former
Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff, who left the Waves after last
season to coach at St. Bonaventure in Olean, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it wouldn't be surprising if Van Breda Kolff is a bit
envious of what he left behind in Malibu, considering the Waves have
victories over UCLA and USC this season, have won 12 in a row overall
and are 10-0 in the West Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday, Van Breda Kolff's Bonnies (14-8) put a stamp on
their season by ending the nation's longest winning streak with an
80-79 victory against Xavier.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the streak only had reached 12, but it's still something
to put on the resume.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Mire Chatman scored a career-high 46
points and had eight assists despite being ejected with 1:57 to play
after receiving his second technical foul in leading Texas Pan
American to a 110-105 victory against Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Nicholls State fell to 1-21 overall and
0-15 in the Southland Conference after blowing a 39-34 halftime lead
against San Houston State in an 80-65 loss. Nicholls State shot 29%
in the second half.</TE>

<HD>No Doubles Jeopardy for the U.S.</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Partners Fish and Blake end 0-5 skid for Americans,
who clinch a victory over Slovakia in Davis Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Whether it was Diego Nargiso, Kevin Ullyett or Juan Balcells, there
has been a certain consistency on the middle day of Davis Cup rounds
involving the United States after the doubles.</LD>
<LD>   A hero for the day was created, even if you might not remember him
a few days later. The shelf life for a doubles hero from Italy,
Zimbabwe or Spain may not be long, but there was the prospect
Slovakians Karol Beck or Jan Kroslak could join the list on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But two animated friends and teammates prevented the potential of
fleeting foreign fame. Though even the most veteran American doubles
teams have stumbled in Davis Cup action, rookie Mardy Fish and James
Blake were poised enough to withstand its up-and-down nature,
defeating Beck and Kroslak, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4, in 2 hours 18
minutes at the Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   The doubles victory clinched the first-round match for the United
States, which defeated Slovakia, 3-0. After the Americans took a 2-0
lead on Friday with four-set victories by Pete Sampras and Andy
Roddick, advancement into the quarterfinals was essentially a
foregone conclusion. The next opponent will be either Morocco or
Spain, April 5-7. Spain leads Morocco, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the quarterfinal could be held on grass, possibly
either in the Southern California desert or in Florida. In today's
reverse singles, which were rendered meaningless, Blake, substituting
for Sampras, faces Kroslak and Roddick plays Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Though Slovakia was hampered without its injured stars, Dominik
Hrbaty and Karol Kucera, in Oklahoma City, the Americans' ability to
secure the doubles point at least put an end to a dubious streak. The
United States was 0-5 in doubles--most recently winning against
Australia in the 1999 quarterfinals--and 3-12 in the last 15 matches.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say I am glad to get the monkey off our back to win a
match," U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe said. "I'm not making any
predictions about the future, about who is going to play or what, but
obviously the way these guys played was a big statement."</TE>
<TE>   The Slovaks were impressed by Fish and Blake, and in particular
with Blake's volleying ability. Blake faced two break points in his
opening serve game and never faced another. Fish had his serve broken
once, when he served for the victory, at 5-2, in the fourth set.</TE>
<TE>   Fish plays regularly with Jeff Morrison, but Blake and Fish were
partners three times last year in tour events, reaching the
quarterfinals at Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems they knew exactly what to do every ball," Kroslak said.
"They play really good doubles, and I cannot say on the day they were
really better than us. We had some chances but the biggest difference
between us was on the volley. They were much better on the volley."</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Blake had little trouble staying energized, breaking Beck
at love in the fourth game of the first set. They also were able to
retain their focus after losing the second in a tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere is unlike anything else and it's above any win you
can possibly have in any tournament, I would think," Fish said. "I
think I've had a few good wins in my career, not even close, not even
in the same league."</TE>
<TE>   Said Blake, whose first-serve percentage was 77: "I am going to
get fired up for any Davis Cup match I'm playing, dead rubber, live
rubber, 2-0, 0-2. It's exciting. One point is pretty important so I'm
going to get fired up for any match I get a chance to play."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe may have finally found the right doubles combination. Fish
and Blake aren't planning on combining at any ATP events between now
and the next Davis Cup match in April because of Fish's partnership
with Morrison, but Blake may play with Todd Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult throwing combinations together, No. 1, which we
have done a lot," McEnroe said. "I didn't want them to feel that this
was a match where if they lost it, they weren't going to play again.
I know I felt that when I played Davis Cup, and I know guys that were
along the same years as I, felt the same way, that you sort of have
one shot."</TE>
<TE>   The world landscape has changed since the days of Rick Leach-Jim
Pugh and John McEnroe-Peter Fleming and Stan Smith-Bob Lutz.</TE>
<TE>   "The other thing is that the other countries are better, have
gotten better in the last 20 years, and we used to dominate the
doubles," Patrick McEnroe said. "That's going to be more difficult,
but in some sense the doubles has become more specialized on the
tour."</TE>

<HD>Woods Won't Play at Riviera</HD>
<DH>Golf: He withdraws from next week's Nissan Open to take a
break and prepare for Match Play event at La Costa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods, who is as familiar to the Nissan Open as the eucalyptus
trees at Riviera Country Club, isn't playing in next week's event.</LD>
<LD>   Woods withdrew from the Nissan Open to take a break from
tournament golf. He said he needs to rest up, and his agent said he
needs to get ready for the $5-million Accenture Match Play
Championships on Feb. 20-24 at La Costa.</LD>
<LD>   Woods says he hasn't been at full strength since he got sick last
week before the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.</LD>
<TE>   "I just want to go home and get my strength back," Woods said
Saturday. "I've been sick for almost two weeks now."</TE>
<TE>   Woods shot a three-under 69 in the third round of the Buick
Invitational, his second tournament in two weeks. He is six shots
behind co-leaders Jerry Kelly, Mark O'Meara and J.L. Lewis with one
round to play at Torrey Pines.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods had entered Riviera, he would have been committed to four
consecutive weeks of events and six in the last six weeks to begin
the year, counting the Mercedes Championships and the New Zealand
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Steinberg of IMG says Woods is going to be busy on the
practice tee next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to go through a pretty intensive week of
preparation for the match play," said Steinberg, who claimed Woods
thought a lot about pulling out of Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult decision for him because he's got such strong
ties to the tournament and Riviera, but he just feels like at this
point of the year, it's a good time to practice intensely instead of
playing tournament golf."</TE>
<TE>   Woods was included on Nissan's original commitment list, but
withdrew. He has not missed the Nissan Open since turning
professional in September  1996. He also played it twice as an
amateur, in 1992 and '93, and was 16 in his first appearance at
Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   The closest he came to winning was in 1998 when he lost to Billy
Mayfair in a playoff at Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Woods missed the cut at the Nissan in his amateur appearances as a
teenager. In his first appearance as a pro in 1997, he tied for 20th.
He was runner-up to Mayfair in 1998, tied for second when Ernie Els
won in 1999, tied for 18th in 2000 and tied for 13th last year when
Robert Allenby won in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Pulchinski, tournament director of the Nissan Open, was
disappointed at not having Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, you'd like to have Tiger at your tournament,"
Pulchinski said. "But we have a great field, 40 of the top 50 on the
money list, a great international contingent including Sergio Garcia,
Darren Clarke, Jose Maria Olazabal, Lee Westwood and Vijay Singh,
plus David Duval.</TE>
<TE>   "If people want to see a good product, we've got it. It's not like
we have a weak field and everyone comes to see Tiger play."</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he will return to Southern California for the World
Golf Championship match play event.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Won't Survive Dog Days of February</HD>

<LD>I don't like to jump to conclusions, so I waited all the way until
today to announce the Dodgers have already been eliminated from
contention this season--thereby extending their streak to 14 years
without winning a playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   I called Manager Jim Tracy on Saturday to tell him there was no
need to rush to Vero Beach this week, and after his wife, Deb, had
conducted a search of their home, she came to the telephone to say
her husband and the family dog were missing. This upset their son,
Mark, who whelped, "The dog's missing?"</LD>
<LD>   Tracy gets more respect in the Dodger clubhouse, of course,
because he was a miracle worker a year ago by getting 86 victories
from an injury-jumbled roster, but in return for this spectacular
managerial debut, his bosses have let him down.</LD>
<TE>   From the start of the off-season, Tracy stressed the importance of
getting a closer, and now four days before pitchers and catchers are
to report, he still doesn't have a legitimate game-saver. The fear in
Dodger circles is Tracy placed a call to General Manager Dan Evans to
tell him how he felt about this, but since Evans doesn't return
anyone's phone call, he never got the message.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EVANS SAID in the paper Saturday: "We're trying to win here," but
after dumping the team's closer, power hitter and No. 2 starter, it
appears he's trying to save money while playing a shell game with
those who think there are better days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't have been surprised to learn Tracy had run away after
taking a closer look at his roster. And if I'm the Dodger manager's
dog, Maggie, I'm already long gone knowing my master's coming home
each night to kick something after his leadoff hitter begins every
game with an out and his closer can't get anyone out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that bad," said Tracy, and I said, "OK, if the season
started today, who is your leadoff hitter?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure if that was Maggie whimpering in the background or
Tracy covering the mouthpiece while trying to wipe his eyes and
regain his composure.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't answer the question," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the manager of the team," I replied.</TE>
<TE>   I could picture poor Maggie cowering under the table.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of dogs, I persisted: "As of today, who is your leadoff
hitter?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, geez. Oh man, boy, I don't know," Tracy said. "It could be
McKay Christensen, or Thomas Goodwin or Dave Roberts."</TE>
<TE>   In baseball terms, that's known as strike one, strike two, strike
three, and when you have Eric Karros batting sixth, that's two
guaranteed outs before getting to the pitcher's place in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Karros has done a tremendous amount of work and looks better than
at any time a year ago," Tracy said, which means Tracy must have seen
him make contact with the ball at some point this off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he has talked with Shawn Green about moving between
Paul Lo Duca and Brian Jordan in the lineup, but now he has decided
to keep Green at No. 3 followed by the other two--before Karros kills
the rally.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're healthy, I don't see why we can't win as many games (86)
or more than we did last year," Tracy said, and I thought he was
joking, so I laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll put a dinner on it," Tracy said, and since he was born on
New Year's Eve, I guess from the very start this is a guy who just
won't wait until next year.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all bleak, of course. There's lots of giddy talk about
shortstop Cesar Izturis, who turns 22 today, and may ultimately be
the leadoff answer, but unless he swings a bat like Gary Sheffield,
this looks like an anemic lineup.</TE>
<TE>   That brings the Dodgers back to the closer they don't have. Fewer
runs probably mean closer games. A year ago they played in 58 one-run
games, and Jeff Shaw gave them 43 saves. Now Matt Herges and Paul
Quantrill will share closer duties, but disaster looms--because I
have a feeling Evans will try to save the day.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows pitching quite like Evans, who has already brought to
L.A. such certified stiffs as James Baldwin, Terry Mulholland and
Mike Trombley. Now he's compiled a seven-man rotation with Omar
Daal--one of his pickups--considered the worst of the lot, and trade
bait now to get a closer.</TE>
<TE>   I imagine George Steinbrenner will get first crack at giving up
Mariano Rivera for Daal, but if that fails there's talk Evans will go
back to the White Sox, who passed over him when it came to hiring a
general manager, to try and wiggle Bob Howry free. Howry lost his job
as closer last year--and that's how far the Dodgers have sunk.</TE>
<TE>   It will probably take Eric Gagne to acquire Howry or a similar
closer on the rebound, and now that the Dodgers have signed Kazuhisa
Ishii to a contract that could keep him here six years, they might be
more inclined to let Gagne go.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii wanted to play in the major leagues. I'm glad he didn't say
he wanted to play in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   I went to a Web site where English is translated into Japanese so
I could pass a note to him: "You can stick a fork in the Dodgers."
But in Japanese that comes across: "As for you it can attach the fork
of the swindler."</TE>
<TE>   He'll probably think I'm talking about Evans, and if the Dodger
season goes like I think it will, I probably am.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Dan McCarney:</TE>
<TE>   "I have the solution for Shaq's toe injury--why don't they just
cut it off? Not only would he get rid of the pain, he'd probably lose
a few pounds."</TE>
<TE>   I'll arrange a meeting for you to discuss your solution with Shaq.</TE>

<HD>Three-Peat Bid Fails for Bruins</HD>
<DH>College basketball: UCLA loses to Villanova, 58-57, as
Knight is unable to make another game-winning shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>A stroke of scheduling genius, that's how UCLA insiders billed this
game.</LD>
<LD>   Simulate NCAA tournament conditions by traveling across the
country. Face a mid-level team that struggles against ranked
opponents in a cavernous arena to mute the home-court advantage.
Serve it up on national television.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes the best-laid plans ...</LD>
<TE>   "None of this was what we expected," Bruin forward T.J. Cummings
said.</TE>
<TE>   A 58-57 loss to Villanova on Saturday, with UCLA blowing a
four-point lead in the last 1:15 and Billy Knight missing the same
outcome-determining three-point shot he made against USC three days
earlier, was a fitting end to a dizzying, distracting weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The venue changed from First Union Center to Villanova's
claustrophobic 6,500-capacity campus arena because of the NBA
All-Star game and accompanying festivities, which transformed the
city into the biggest celebration east of Mardi Gras.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin hotel lobby crawled with men dressed to impress and
women wearing considerably less. Players were boldly approached and
Coach Steve Lavin was handed an invitation to a party called "The Big
Sexy," boasting a long list of special guests, including Elton Brand,
Kevin Garnett and "Ced the Entertainer."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin didn't go, instead making sure his own Ced--freshman point
guard Cedric Bozeman--and the rest of the team was safely tucked in
bed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird, there were a lot of people in the hotel we don't
usually see," Cummings said. "But [the coaches] kept us in our rooms.
They wouldn't let us out."</TE>
<TE>   There probably was little to worry about given the low-key nature
and advanced age of most of the Bruins. In fact, the lineup of
Knight, Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes, Rico Hines and Jason Kapono
employed by UCLA much of the game was older than the NBA lineup
competing in the rookie game Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   But superior experience did not help No. 15 UCLA (16-7) against
the Wildcats (13-8), a young team with a new coach that had not
defeated a ranked opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-paced, rough-and-tumble game was led by Villanova most of
the way, but a six-point possession put UCLA ahead, 48-47, with seven
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Knight made a free throw to complete a three-point play and Barnes
was fouled flagrantly by Ricky Wright during the foul shot. He made
one of two free throws, UCLA retained possession and Barnes was
fouled while shooting, this time making both.</TE>
<TE>   Knight made a steal and layup with four minutes to play to extend
the margin to 54-50, but on Villanova's next possession Bozeman
barely missed stripping the ball from Wright, who passed to Gary
Buchanan for a three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman's surgically repaired right knee bumped Wright on the play
and the Bruin guard crumpled to the floor seconds later. Although he
was helped to the bench and did not return, trainer Mark Schoen said
afterward that Bozeman is fine.</TE>
<TE>   The same couldn't be said for the rest of the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan hit the last of his six three-pointers with 1:15 left to
slice the UCLA lead to 57-56. Kapono, the Bruins' leading scorer, was
on the bench because Lavin did not want him on defense, and his
absence was felt on UCLA's next possession. The Bruins sputtered for
32 seconds before a Wildcat knocked the ball out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono was inserted, and his inbound pass was stripped from
Barnes. Brooks Sales was fouled by Gadzuric on a drive in the lane
and made the free throws to put Villanova ahead with 21.2 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA got the ball to Knight, whose three-point effort with five
seconds to play bounced off the rim. He ended up with the loose ball
and hurried an off-balance miss before time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Knight and Barnes each scored 17 points. Buchanan was hotter,
scoring 20 on open perimeter jump shots against the Bruin zone
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe they came out in a zone," Buchanan said.
"Everybody plays man against us."</TE>
<TE>   Villanova employed an aggressive man-to-man that focused on
Kapono, who scored nine points on three-of-nine shooting. In last
season's 28-point victory over the Wildcats at UCLA, he equaled his
career high with 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this was a different game in a different city, where nothing
for the Bruins went as planned.</TE>

<HD>Irish Win in Fourth Overtime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Matt Carroll scored seven of his 30 points in the fourth overtime and
Notre Dame won its fifth in a row, outlasting Georgetown, 116-111,
Saturday in the highest-scoring game in Big East history.</LD>
<LD>   This was the first four-overtime game for Notre Dame, and
Georgetown's first in 48 years.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll scored the final seven points for Notre Dame, 17-6 overall
and 7-3 in the Big East, He had a three-point basket and four free
throws over the final 46 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Notre Dame freshman point guard Chris Thomas was the only player
to go all 60 minutes and he finished with 22 points, 12 assists and
eight rebounds. His jumper with just under two minutes left in the
fourth overtime gave the Irish the lead for good at 109-108.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Humphrey had 23 points and 14 rebounds for Notre Dame. Harold
Swanagan had the third double-double by an Irish player with 11
points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sweetney had career-highs of 35 points and 20 rebounds for
Georgetown (14-8, 5-5) but was one of four Hoyas to foul out.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Wilson (26 points), Kevin Braswell (12 points, 10 assists)
and Gerald Riley (eight points) all fouled out, leaving Georgetown
with an inexperienced lineup over the final two minutes of the fourth
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoyas had chances to win at the end of regulation and each of
the first three overtimes. Braswell made a jumper in the final
seconds of the third overtime, but it was waved off because the shot
clock had expired.</TE>
<TE>   The record for points in a game was 219 in 1990, when Pittsburgh
beat Providence, 117-102, in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The Division I record for overtime periods is seven set Dec. 21,
1981, when Cincinnati beat Bradley.</TE>

<LD>Calm did not completely prevail Saturday in the second meeting
between UCLA and USC. But the Trojans prevailed over the Bruins,
71-58, before 3,217 at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Led by guards Aisha Hollans, who had 24 points, and Jessica
Cheeks, who had 13 of her 15 points in the first half, the Trojans
recorded their first regular-season sweep of the Bruins in five
years. USC (13-10, 9-5) also won successive games for the first time
since defeating Oregon on Dec. 22 and California on Dec. 28.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (7-16, 3-11), got 21 points from Whitney Jones, tying her
career high. But no other Bruin reached double figures. Brianna Winn
was next with nine points.</LD>
<TE>   USC shot 36.8% from the field (21 of 57), but led from start to
finish. UCLA, which shot 45% (22 of 49), got as close as 22-21 with
4:02 left in the first half. By halftime, however, the Bruins were
down, 34-27, and trailed by as many as 17 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   In their Jan. 13 meeting, a short fight broke out in the second
half between USC's Ebony Hoffman and UCLA's Shalada Allen. Both
served a one-game suspension. On Saturday, the only incident happened
when Bruin guard Natalie Nakase was charged with a flagrant foul in
the second half for knocking Cheeks into the basket's support
structure while Cheeks was shooting.</TE>
<TE>   If Cheeks thought of retaliating, Hoffman made sure she didn't get
the chance, grabbing her and walking her around to the free-throw
line.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said there were plenty of leftover feelings from the first
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lie. There were a lot of feelings out there,"
Hoffman said. "I knew they would come after me, try and aggravate me.
I was trying to keep my cool."</TE>
<TE>   When Nakase was asked if there was remaining ill will, she coyly
replied, "Maybe. After all, it is USC."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany Elmore, who missed seven games because of a sprained
ankle, returned to action Saturday for the Trojans.</TE>

<TE>   Notes</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas' Linda Frohlich and Petra Glaser were declared
ineligible for Saturday night's game at San Diego State. Glaser, a
sophomore center, is ineligible for eight games for violating the
NCAA's rules on amateurism. UNLV officials determined she
participated on a professional club team, BV Chemnitz, in her native
Germany. Frohlich, a senior forward from Oldendorf, Germany, played
for SC Rist Wedel before attending UNLV and could be ineligible for
the season.</TE>

<HD>Kelly Finds His Way Out of Woods</HD>
<DH>Golf: Co-leader shoots 66 to join Lewis, O'Meara atop
Torrey Pines field. Tiger is six strokes back after recording 69.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>A cloud of smoke swept across Torrey Pines, and while he waited on
the tee, Tiger Woods blinked as he looked up and squeezed eye drops.</LD>
<LD>   Just where was that smoke coming from Saturday at the Buick
Invitational? Was it from out of the top of Woods' head after his
double bogey at his 16th hole? Was it Mark O'Meara trying to torch
his birth certificate? How about from the clubs of Mr. Cheesehead,
Jerry Kelly, who burned up the course with a 66? Or could it have
been J.L. Lewis trying mightily to stick to his homey philosophy,
whatever the heck it is?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the smoke came from a brushfire across the way. And when
it cleared, more than a few people had to rub their eyes like Tiger,
probably because they couldn't believe what they were seeing.</LD>
<TE>   Only six players shot in the 60s on a semi-breezy, cloudless day
along the Pacific Ocean on the beefed-up South Course that was equal
parts headache and heartache.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, Lewis and O'Meara are tied for the 54-hole lead at 10-under
206 at Torrey, where somebody's going to win today, although it's
probably not going to be Woods ... unless he starts smoking, and
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   After he turned in a 69, Woods is six shots off the lead and knows
his chances are only slightly better than Kelly ever saying anything
bad about his beloved Green Bay Packers.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to get off to a start like Mark O did on Thursday," Woods
said of O'Meara, who had a 31 on the front nine the first day. "I
need to do that. Then at least I'll give myself a chance on the back.
And try to get it going."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt it's a good plan, but there are 19 players in front of
Woods and none of them look like they're too eager to move out of his
way. John Daly, who shot a 68, is only a shot behind the leaders,
deadlocked in a five-way with K.J. Choi, Rory Sabbatini, Jay
Williamson and Kent Jones.</TE>
<TE>   After he signed his scorecard, Daly was asked if he was hungry, as
in hungry to win, not to have a box of cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Well, said Daly, yes, he really was hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hungry, I'm just not going to force it," Daly said.
"Hopefully it will happen. The way I'm thinking and the way I'm able
to focus on my game, I think it will get me through it."</TE>
<TE>   The degree of Kelly's hunger is unknown, but he already has won
this year at the Sony Open. He has a new three wood and a new
confidence, both of which should come in handy.</TE>
<TE>   The wind did not blow off the ocean, but were Santa Anas instead,
Kelly noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mind game out there, the more the wind blows the more it
is a game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly had seven birdies and one bogey and he closed with a birdie
at the 551-yard 18th, where he laid up to five feet and made the
putt.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara hasn't had a great recent history, missing cuts at Phoenix
and at Pebble Beach, but he certainly hasn't acted like a 45-year-old
guy who hasn't won in four years. He had a 67 on the first day and
his 70 on Saturday was precise and effective. He kept the ball on the
fairway, gave credit to his new Titleist driver, and gave thanks that
his neck that affected him recently isn't sore anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little nervous out there, but that's a good feeling to
have," O'Meara said. "I have to look back ... I've been doing this a
long time now. Hopefully, I'll do well. If I don't it'll be all
right.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things can happen."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Lewis is hoping for. The 41-year-old from
Horseshoe Bay, Texas, was a second-round co-leader of the U.S. Open,
where he eventually tied for 30th. He bogeyed two of the four par
fives Saturday on his way to a 71, but had an explanation handy.</TE>
<TE>   "Birdies," said Lewis, "are hard to find."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, are philosophies, apparently. Lewis would acknowledge no
goals, except one: "To play each shot to the best of my ability.</TE>
<TE>   "As for winning or losing, there's no point in putting emphasis on
them."</TE>
<TE>   Leave that to Woods. He had worked his score to five under par,
although he was again having trouble keeping the ball on the fairway.
At the par-four seventh, his 16th hole, Woods knocked his drive far
right into a bush. He had an unplayable lie and was forced to take a
drop. Woods managed to sky the ball over a tree and onto the green,
some 35 feet from the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Putting for his par, Woods rolled it about four feet past the
hole, then missed the one coming back for a double bogey, his third
double in three days. When Woods missed a two-foot birdie putt at the
next hole, the par-three eighth, the only thing that would make him
feel any better was a birdie at the 590-yard ninth. And despite
another drive in the right rough, Woods got it, closing with a
birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw away some good strokes today," Woods said. "I just didn't
get a whole lot out of my round."</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else, he's got one more chance.</TE>

<LD>Fairfax High's 66-62 victory over boys' basketball juggernaut
Westchester two weeks ago has given other coaches a glimmer of hope
entering the City Section playoffs, which open Friday with
first-round games.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, two-time defending champion Westchester (24-2) was
the top-seeded team when the 16-team bracket was released Saturday
morning at Manual Arts. Fairfax (26-3) was seeded second, Dorsey
(17-6) third and Crenshaw (19-7) fourth.</LD>
<LD>   But Westchester's aura of invincibility has vanished, Carson Coach
Richard Masson said.</LD>
<TE>   "Fairfax showed they can be beaten," said Masson, whose Colts
could play Westchester in the quarterfinals. "You've just got to go
in without being afraid to play them and do some things to negate
some of their athleticism."</TE>
<TE>   Carson can't afford to look that far ahead, though. The Colts
(17-7) play host to Woodland Hills Taft (16-8) on Friday in the best
first-round matchup, even though Carson won, 75-57, when the teams
played in mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors have been up and down because of inconsistencies in
their lineup. All-City Section guard Steve Smith didn't play until
mid-January because of a knee injury suffered during football season.
Around the same time, though, Coach Derrick Taylor kicked three
starters off the team, including point guard Mustafa Ashgari, who was
averaging 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   Masson expects to lose shooting guard Bryan Harvey, a freshman
starter, and reserve junior center Kevin Lyles to academic
ineligibility, a factor that could wreak havoc on several teams as
grade reports are issued this week section-wide.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester, which has won three of the last four City titles, has
the depth to make it to the title game even if half its lineup was
declared ineligible. But the Comets could face a challenge in the
semifinals against Fremont (20-5), which has improved since being
routed in last year's final, 109-80.</TE>
<TE>   The Pathfinders first must get past Crenshaw on the Cougars' home
floor--something that hasn't happened in Sam Sullivan's 25 seasons as
Fremont coach.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani and the Lions haven't won a City title
since 1987, but they probably have the best chance of knocking off
Westchester. The Comets have won two of three in the season series,
but the Lions won the most recent matchup. The teams wouldn't meet
until the championship at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we can compete with them," Kitani said. "If everyone
sticks to the game plan, it should be a good game. We've played them
enough times during the summer and the season that our kids know
their kids."</TE>

<HD>Prudhomme's Team Sets Sights on Force</HD>
<DH>Drag racing: The Snake has one driver in top five of
qualifying, which is dominated by three of John Force's drivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don "The Snake" Prudhomme grew up in Van Nuys and made his name in
funny cars. He calls Pomona Raceway his backyard, and though the U.S.
Nationals in Indianapolis is the big cheese among drag racing events,
the Snake still attaches a lot of value to the 42nd K&amp;N Filters
Winternationals.</LD>
<LD>   The owner of a three-car team won 10 races last season and would
like nothing more than to begin his 40th year in drag racing with a
season-opening victory today in the Powerade NHRA Drag Racing Series.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always more important to win in your backyard," Prudhomme
said Saturday as his funny car drivers, Ron Capps and Tommy Johnson
Jr., ended the day in the No. 5 and 16 qualifying positions. "I first
raced here in 1963, and won the Winternationals in '65 [in Top Fuel].</LD>
<TE>   "In my mind, it's one of the biggest races--if not the biggest--on
the circuit."</TE>
<TE>   And Prudhomme wants to win. Badly.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me," Prudhomme said, "[John] Force can be beat." But Force
was in the driver's seat after Saturday's third and fourth rounds of
qualifying. Force, from Yorba Linda, retained the No. 1 qualifying
position--his 107th--with his first-round elapsed time of 4.749
seconds (296.57 mph on qualifying run). His team took three of the
top four spots.</TE>
<TE>   Bellflower's Gary Densham was No. 3 at 4.783 (326.87 mph), setting
a national speed record that is measured in the last 66 feet of the
track. Tony Pedregon of Chino Hills was No. 4 at 4.792 (303.57 mph).</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's one of the proudest days of my life. I've never
held a funny car record," Densham said.</TE>
<TE>   "To get the speed record back for Team Force, now we have the ET
record [Force's 4.731 last season] and speed record. As many good
cars as we have out here this weekend, both those can fall."</TE>
<TE>   Whit Bazemore, who held the previous speed record at 325.45,
prevented a Force Racing sweep by qualifying second with a 4.762, the
day's quickest elapsed time at 324.05 mph. Capps ran 4.814 (314.68
mph).</TE>
<TE>   "They built a hell of a team around them, and they're not ready to
lay down for anybody," Prudhomme said of Force Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Prudhomme, 58, has spent 40 years in racing, 32 as a driver. He
won 49 races as a driver, including four consecutive Winternationals
from 1975-78 in a funny car.</TE>
<TE>   Capps won this event in 1998 for Prudhomme.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks had their season-best six-game winning streak
stopped Friday in a 4-1 loss to Carolina. Now the key will be to
prevent backsliding into their previous cycle of losing.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel upset about [Friday] because we beat better teams than
that," defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said. "For some reason, we felt we
were good enough to go out there play fancy and score 4-5 goals."</LD>
<LD>   They won't be able to do that tonight, when they play Dallas, a
team that owes them one. The Ducks routed the Stars, 6-1, on Jan. 25,
the same day Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock was fired.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure Dallas will remember we embarrassed them in their
home building," Tverdovsky said. "They are the kind of the team that
responds well."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Ducks also respond is to be seen. In December, they
won four of five games, only to lose those gains with an 0-6-2
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Not letting one loss lead to a string of defeats was Coach Bryan
Murray's concern.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big point," Murray said. "We got to come back and play
with emotion and intensity [tonight]. Dallas is in a real fight for
its life as far getting into the playoffs. Every game for them is a
huge game. We have to play accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya said that X-rays on his left pinky were negative.
Kariya was struck by a Jason York shot early in the third period
Friday and left the game. He underwent X-rays and returned midway
through the period. He is expected to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Steve Rucchin, out 42 games because of an ankle injury,
participated in practice for the first time Saturday. Murray said he
will return after the Olympic break.</TE>

<HD>Trip West Doesn't Slow Summer Colony in La Canada</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: She takes control with an eighth of a mile to
go and wins her sixth race in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once Summer Colony discovered the thrill of victory, the 4-year-old
daughter of Summer Squall apparently forgot how to lose.</LD>
<LD>   Unable to win in her first six races for owner-breeder Edward
Evans and trainer Mark Hennig, Summer Colony has rattled off six
victories in a row after her 6-1 upset in the $200,000 La Canada
Stakes on Saturday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Before her first trip to California, the dark bay miss had done
all of her winning against inferior competition in New York--two
victories at Saratoga, including a 323/4-length crushing of maidens,
one at Belmont Park and two at Aqueduct. It was questioned how she
would fare on the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   In a Grade II where favored Affluent and Royally Chosen, the 1-2
finishers in a thrilling El Encino Stakes on Jan. 20, may have felt
the effects of that grueling race--they checked in fourth and fifth,
respectively, on Saturday--Summer Colony proved she belongs.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Gary Stevens, who had gotten instructions in the morning
by telephone from the filly's regular rider John Velasquez, who
stayed in Florida to ride also-ran Graeme Hall in the $500,000 Donn
Handicap, Summer Colony was well positioned close to the surprisingly
slow pace. She took the lead with an eighth of a mile to go and won
by a length in 1:491/5 for the 11/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not often that other jockeys will call you and be as up
front and forthright as [Velasquez] was," Stevens said. "He called me
at the request of Mark and told me all about the filly.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically just told me not to worry about having her on the
lead, that she would do whatever you want.</TE>
<TE>   "She hadn't faced this kind before and even when they win like she
has been winning, there's still a question if they are for real. I
think she just proved that she is. She is a really, really classy
filly."</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, the 5-2 second choice who had won her first three starts
for trainer Laura De Seroux, was second, a length ahead of 14-1
longshot Ask Me No Secrets, who had gained the lead into the stretch
from a tiring Royally Chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to become only the third filly to sweep the three-race La
Canada series, joining Taisez Vous and Mitterand, Affluent was beaten
31/2 lengths as the 9-10 favorite, but never looked dangerous at any
stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It just was not her day, she did not fire at all," said Eddie
Delahoussaye, Affluent's rider. "It's tough to put three races
together like that."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Sanchez, Hennig's assistant who came to California with
Summer Colony while the trainer remained in Florida, said the filly
will return to Gulfstream Park on Tuesday, but could return for the
$300,000 Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap on March 10.</TE>
<TE>   Mongoose, whose only previous stakes victory had come as a
2-year-old at River Downs, became a Grade I winner with his mild
surprise in the Donn.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mary and Gary West and making his second start for
trainer H. James Bond after previously being under Bill Mott's care,
the 4-year-old Broad Brush colt took advantage of a perfect trip
under Edgar Prado and won for the sixth time in 15 outings.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-1 fourth choice while racing coupled with Ubiquity, he
completed the 11/8 miles in 1:493/5 and won by a neck.</TE>
<TE>   Red Bullet, the 2-1 favorite, crossed under the wire second and
would have won had he not broken slowly.</TE>
<TE>   But the 5-year-old, who was ridden by Jerry Bailey, was
disqualified for interference on the backstretch and was moved to
fourth by the stewards.</TE>

<LD>Believe it or not, there was a silver lining in the cloud that hung
over the Kings after they coughed up a four-goal second-period lead
and lost in overtime to the Phoenix Coyotes, 6-5, on Friday night at
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least Coach Andy Murray seemed to spot one.</LD>
<LD>   After giving up five goals in a stretch of only 14 minutes 6
seconds spanning the second and third periods to fall behind, 5-4,
the Kings drew even and sent the game into overtime on a power-play
goal by Ziggy Palffy with 10:02 to play.</LD>
<TE>   As ugly as it was, it netted them a point in the standings. They
have earned at least one point in 22 of their last 28 games, 14 of
their last 16 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have laid down when it was 5-4," Murray said. "It would
have been very easy for us to roll over right at that particular
point. Everything was going against us. The crowd was into it. They
were rolling....</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the determination we showed there because we could have
stopped playing and just given it to them. We kept playing."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "There's absolutely no reason for us to lose the
hockey game. It just shouldn't have happened that way.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes back to the fact that we were up four goals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday, the last time the Kings had squandered a 4-0 lead
was Nov. 20, 1990, a game in which they defeated the New Jersey
Devils, 5-4, at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they had squandered a 4-0 lead and lost was Feb. 24,
1986, when the Pittsburgh Penguins rallied for a 6-5 overtime victory
at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   And the last time the Kings had lost when one of their players had
a hat trick, as Palffy did Friday night, was Nov. 28, 2000, when
Palffy scored three goals in a 7-6 loss to the New York Rangers at
Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If it's going to take 93 points to make the playoffs, as Murray
has been telling them for months, the Kings need 31 in their last 26
games.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, they accumulated 31 in their last 23 to finish
seventh in the West with 92 points, two more than the Coyotes and
Vancouver Canucks.</TE>

<LD>Steve Sullivan and Kyle Calder scored second-period goals Saturday
night, and the Chicago Blackhawks won, 3-2, at Denver to hand the
Avalanche its fourth consecutive loss at home, a first for Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the franchise lost four in a row at home was in
February 1994 when playing as the Quebec Nordiques.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Amonte had a goal and an assist, and backup goalie Steve
Passmore made 21 saves for the Blackhawks. Passmore, making his first
start since Jan. 10, earned his third consecutive victory.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado's Patrick Roy had 18 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Dan Hinote and Joe Sakic gave Colorado a 2-1 lead in the
first period. Hinote deflected Stephane Yelle's shot from the right
point at 2:46.</TE>
<TE>   Amonte, fighting for position in front of the net with Colorado's
Adam Foote, tipped in a rebound at 8:04 to tie it for his 21st goal.</TE>
<TE>   Sakic scored his 18th goal a minute later on a backhander from the

also scored for the Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Ottawa 2--Sergei Fedorov scored his 350th and 351st
career goals to lead the Red Wings at Ottawa. All five goals in the
game were scored in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Duchesne also scored for Detroit, which lost two one-goal
leads before Fedorov scored his second of the period at 18:15 to put
the Red Wings in front for good.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov joined teammates Steve Yzerman, Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille
and Brendan Shanahan to give the Red Wings five players with more
than 350 career goals.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Hossa and Daniel Alfredsson scored for Ottawa.</TE>

minute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 1, Columbus 0--Denis Arkhipov split two defenders and

<LD>Austria's Stephan Eberharter is finally ready to ski out of the
shadow of countryman Hermann Maier in today's men's downhill on the
Grizzly course at Snowbasin. While the Herminator was dominating the
World Cup circuit, Eberharter had to learn to live with the
designation as the best of the other Austrians. He finished second to
Maier 12 times in World Cup races over a three-year period and was
second to him last year in the World Cup standings.</LD>
<LD>   But Maier was injured in a motorcycle accident last summer and is
not competing this year, leaving Eberharter as the favorite in the
downhill and the super-G. Austrians could sweep the downhill, but
Daron Rahlves of Truckee, Calif., last year's super-G world champion,
was third in a training run Friday.</LD>

<LD>Favorite Felix Gottwald's chances to become the first Austrian to win
the individual competition were literally blown off course when the
winds arose during Saturday's 90K jump. He is in 11th place beginning
today's 15K freestyle. But another Austrian, Mario Stecher, is
second. The United States has a chance to win its first medal ever in
Nordic combined and should at least improve on its best-ever finish
of ninth. After Saturday, Todd Lodwick is seventh and Bill DeMong
eighth. Lodwick is a better skier than a jumper.</LD>

<HD>Nowhere to Go but Downhill</HD>
<DH>Skiing: Rahlves has a chance in big event, but the winner
more likely will be an Austrian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>The men's Olympic downhill scheduled for today promises to be a
mountain vs. man snow-down involving Ephraim's Face, John Paul
Traverse, Flintock Jump, four Austrians and maybe, just maybe, a guy
named Daron.</LD>
<LD>   This is the race, of course, Alpine's Kentucky Derby, a roughly
100-second rough ride in which legends are born, myths are made and,
in the case of Hermann Maier in Nagano, orbit is nearly achieved.</LD>
<LD>   One can become a famous skier without winning an Olympic downhill,
as the Austrian Maier proved with his Hakuba header, although
finishing the race has always been the more preferable path.</LD>
<TE>   For international skiers, winning the Olympic downhill has always
been about validation--the crowning moment in a larger body of work.</TE>
<TE>   For Americans, winning the downhill has been more about jingoism
and one-shot, slingshot flings to fame.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Johnson in 1984 and Tommy Moe, a decade later, became
household words with their improbable Olympic downhill victories.</TE>
<TE>   Daron Rahlves, a 28-year-old former Jet Ski champion from Truckee,
Calif., hopes to similarly etch his edges into history.</TE>
<TE>   There are more significant and harrowing races in the eyes of many
ski racers, notably the annual downhill at Kitzbuehel, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, winning the famed Hannenkamm does not exactly play in Peoria.</TE>
<TE>   "Kitzbuehel is the ultimate race to win as a skier," Rahlves said.
"But as an American, to get recognized and get the rewards that come
with being an elite athlete, it has to be done in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Tommy Moe. Everybody knows who Tommy Moe is. He won one
[downhill] race. It was the Olympic downhill. People don't even know
what he did in super-G. He got second, that was incredible too. But I
bet you if he just got silver in super-G, he wouldn't be as well
known.</TE>
<TE>   "Picabo [Street] won the overall downhill title [twice], which is
pretty big. Still, the reason she's known is for the Olympic gold."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves knows this is his shot and, oddly, the odds of pulling off
an upset are not that long.</TE>
<TE>   After posting a string of ho-hum World Cup results this season,
Rahlves finished third in Friday's training run.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves managed only a 16th-place finish in Saturday's final
practice run, though he said he was experimenting a bit with his line
and technique.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll stick to the tactics I had the first day," he said
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzly course, designed by 1972 Olympic downhill champion
Bernhard Russi, isn't as hard-gulp frightening as Kitzbuehel, or as
long as the 2.7-mile Lauberhorn in Wengen, Switzerland, yet this
Olympic course is being hailed as a world-class track.</TE>
<TE>   At 1.9 miles, it lacks the flats that tends to award "gliders."
Rather, it is a course that requires and rewards thought, bravery and
technique.</TE>
<TE>   At few points during the race will skiers not be leaning into
their edges and fighting g-forces, a battle of physics that tends to
favor a world-class super-G skier such as Rahlves.</TE>
<TE>   The drop out of the start gate off Ephraim's Face is Stephen King
scary, with racers reaching speeds of 75 mph in less than 10 seconds.
From there, it's a ragged ride on right edges on John Paul Traverse,
over Flintock Jump, a clean land at Bear Trap, a left turn at
Trappers Loop, a setup at Slingshot to Buffalo Jump and then a drop
down Rendezvous Face near the end, where speeds could exceed 85 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Then, finally, a ferocious hockey stop once through the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves is not, nor should he be, the race favorite.</TE>
<TE>   To pull off this upset, he'll have to outrace Austrian speed
skiers Stephan Eberharter and Fritz Strobl. Also not to be overlooked
is all-around star Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, who has a record 15
Olympic and world championship medals.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt professed not to be a contender after finishing 19th in
Saturday's training run, but no one really believed him.</TE>
<TE>   Austria is the ski team to beat, and not even a rash of injuries
has slowed them.</TE>
<TE>   Team Austria lost the Olympic services of Maier, the World Cup
overall champion and winner of two gold medals in Nagano, to a
motorcycle accident Aug. 24 in Radstadt, Austria. There were rumors
late into the fall that Maier might make a Willis Reed-like
appearance at Salt Lake, but Maier has not recovered sufficiently
from the broken leg he suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Maier on the Austrian disabled list are Josef Strobl, a
seven-time World Cup winner, Werner Franz, Rainer Salzgeber and Heinz
Schilcheggar and slalom champion Mario Matt.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Austrians have simply pushed the next bumper crop to the
fore.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the injuries, Austrians occupy eight of the top 12 spots
in the World Cup downhill rankings and eight of the top 20 in the
overall standings.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the Olympic field is that each country gets only
four Olympic berths per discipline, meaning several Austrians will be
asked to grab some chair lift bench while skiers without a snowball's
chance of winning--nothing personal, Angel Pumpalov of Bulgaria--get
to lock boots into bindings at the start gate.</TE>
<TE>   With Maier out, the Austrians are leaning heavily on Eberharter,
32.</TE>
<TE>   Lost for years in the shadow of Maier, Eberharter has emerged as
the sport's premiere Alpine artist. He has already clinched the World
Cup downhill title and is a cinch to supplant Maier as the overall
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter will also be a medal contender in super-G and giant
slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Much was expected from Eberharter when, at age 21 in 1991, he won
world titles in super-G and combined. Eberharter was Austria's rising
young star before he fell into slump that led to his demotion in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   He worked his way back onto the Austrian "A" team, only to find
Maier had become the star. Many remember that Maier, after his
horrendous downhill crash, rebounded to win the super-G and giant
slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Few remember that Eberharter took the silver in GS.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he finished second to Maier in the World Cup downhill
and overall rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone expects me to win the gold, but I know life can go a
different way," Eberharter said after Friday's downhill training run.
"Life goes on if I don't win the gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do enjoy the expectations. I don't feel any pressure. If
I don't win, I have two more chances [in super-G and giant slalom]."</TE>

<HD>Italy's Belmondo Pole Vaults to Gold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Not only did the women's 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country race at
Soldier Hollow provide the first medal winners of the 2002 Olympic
Games, it provided the first dramatic comeback, the first exciting
finish and the first heartwarming story.</LD>
<LD>   Stefania Belmondo of Italy overcame a broken pole that dropped her
into 10th place two-thirds of the way into the race to come back and
overtake Russia's Larissa Lazutina on the final stretch for the gold
medal with a winning time of 39 minutes 54.4 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   That's getting a replacement the hard way.</LD>
<TE>   Belmondo, a four-time Olympian, had won seven previous medals,
including a gold in the 30-kilometer race in 1992. She was asked to
take that gold to a ceremony in the Italian Alps in October. The cold
weather, the altitude, or a combination of both caused her medal to
crumble into pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I've got to get another one,'" she said through a
translator.</TE>
<TE>   She was off to a clean beginning with the leaders in the mass
start. It's the first time the Olympics have used this format, which
sends all of the racers off at the same time, lined up in rows
according to their World Cup rankings. Previously, racers left in
timed intervals and competed strictly against the clock.</TE>
<TE>   In the mass start, "There's a lot of pushing and shoving, a lot of
physical contact out there," said 30th-place finisher Nina Kemppel of
Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the small leader pack that broke ahead, there was a lot of
bumping and banging. Someone hit Belmondo's pole, and it broke around
the 10.5-kilometer mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the race was over," Belmondo said.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried from the bottom of my heart."</TE>
<TE>   A French spectator offered her one of his poles, but that didn't
work because the pole was too tall for the 5-foot-3 Belmondo. She
pushed along with one pole for 600 or 700 meters and fell 8.8 seconds
behind Lazutina at the 11.6-kilometer interval.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, 'Oh my, the race is over. It's over for sure,'"
Belmondo said. "I felt exhausted."</TE>
<TE>   Then her trainer gave her a pole and she began to catch up. By the
13.7-kilometer mark she was only three-tenths of a second behind. As
they headed down the final hill, she was just behind Lazutina. They
were even as they came around the turn, then she sprinted down the
stretch to the finish line ahead of Lazutina.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I just can't come in second this time,'" Belmondo said.
"It has to be gold."</TE>
<TE>   She beat Lazutina, who has won five cross-country gold medals, by
1.8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Katerina Neumannova of the Czech Republic won the bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   The men's 30-kilometer freestyle cross-country race featured a
blowout victory for Spain, courtesy of a German, an exciting duel
between two Austrians and disappointment for Sweden and Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Johann Muehlegg was born in Germany and competed for his native
country through 1998, including the 1998 Olympics in Nagano. But he
clashed with the German ski federation and decided to apply for
Spanish citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Like a college transfer, he sat out a year of international
competition until he became a naturalized Spaniard in November 1999
and he has competed for them ever since.</TE>
<TE>   He surged ahead of everyone at the mass start and had a 16-second
lead after 7.5 kilometers and led by almost 90 seconds halfway
through the race. His final time of 1:09:28.9 beat the closest
competitors by more than two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The battle for silver was much closer, as Austrian Christian
Hoffmann and countryman Mikhail Botvinov fought each other until the
final yards before Hoffmann crossed the finish line at 1:11:31, 1.3
seconds before Botvinov.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden Per Elofsson, the reigning World Cup champion and a gold
medal favorite, dropped out of the race after two laps, saying he
couldn't generate any energy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going well in the first lap, then my body froze," Elofsson
said. "There's nothing you can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The top finisher for Norway, which usually dominates cross-country
skiing, was Kristen Skjeldal, who finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The best American finisher was Andrew Johnson of Greensboro, Vt.,
in 22nd place.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>While working at the University of Utah on a genetics research
project, Zhang Kai from Beijing is volunteering at the Winter
Olympics. He was confused during the opening ceremony Friday night
when members of the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team emerged from the wings
to light the caldron.</LD>
<LD>   "Why would they pick those men?" he asked a friend of mine.</LD>
<LD>   I could have told him. That team of miracle workers is legendary
in the United States, a group of college boys who melded at the right
time to beat the highly favored professionals from the Soviet Union
in 1980 at Lake Placid, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   Not only that, they did it at a time when American spirits were
about as low as they could go. The Cold War raged. The Soviets were
thumbing their noses at us in Afghanistan. Iran held U.S. hostages.
The economy was stalled. Lines at the gas pumps were long. When the
hockey team beat the Soviets, then went on to win the gold medal, it
gave us a lift.</TE>
<TE>   For an American, there could hardly be a more fitting choice to
play the starring role in the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   But Zhang's question made me wonder. What must the rest of the
world think of a country still celebrating an ice hockey game played
22 years ago?</TE>
<TE>   A geneticist such as Zhang might conclude that we haven't evolved
much since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   I mean, the Cold War ended long ago.</TE>
<TE>   We won.</TE>
<TE>   Having been in Moscow last summer, I can report that fact without
equivocation. There are more Marriott hotels in downtown Moscow than
there are in downtown Salt Lake City, which is where the corporate
headquarters are located. There is a McDonald's on every corner. I
didn't see a Starbucks, but there are plenty of coffee houses where
you can overpay for a latte just the way you can in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The Evil Empire, which is different from the Evil Axis, is no
more.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe it is time for us to move on.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed as if we had done that last week, when we were wrapping
not only ourselves but every country participating here in the World
Trade Center flag as a symbol of a world unified against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The opening ceremony hit all the right notes.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance of the torn and tattered flag that had flown at the
WTC on Sept. 11 into the stadium, carried by an honor guard of eight
U.S. athletes and two policemen from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, was as moving as anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   But an even more meaningful moment for me came when the Olympic
flag entered the stadium, accompanied by an international cast of
dignitaries: astronaut and Sen. John Glenn from the Americas, former
Polish President Lech Walesa from Europe, Archbishop Desmond Tutu
from Africa, Japanese ski jumper Kazuyoshi Funaki from Asia and
Australian track star Cathy Freeman from Oceania. Along with them,
representing the Olympic pillars of sport, art and environment, were
French skier Jean-Claude Killy, director Steven Spielberg and
Jean-Michael Cousteau.</TE>
<TE>   "Your nation is overcoming a horrific tragedy, a tragedy that
affected the whole world," International Olympic Committee President
Jacques Rogge said. "We stand united with you in the promotion of our
common ideals, in a hope for world peace."</TE>
<TE>   One world, united.</TE>
<TE>   Then out came the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team, wearing replica USA
jerseys, no less, reminding everyone of when the world was divided.</TE>
<TE>   Was that too much of an American moment?</TE>
<TE>   For the answer, I went Saturday to the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone might have been offended by the choice, it would have
been them.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't.</TE>
<TE>   "We were glad to play such a major role in the ceremony," joked
Igor Rabiner, a journalist for Sport Express in Moscow. "It took two
teams to play that game. Your team and our team."</TE>
<TE>   Also, he pointed out, subsequent history was kinder to Soviet
hockey players. They won gold medals in 1984, '88 and '92.</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, so much has happened in the Soviet Union since then,
including that there is no longer a Soviet Union, that the people
there don't dwell much on hockey games from 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Soloviev, a Russian television personality, confirmed
that.</TE>
<TE>   He was much more interested in talking Saturday about the clothing
that the Russian team wore for the opening ceremony. He rated it the
best.</TE>
<TE>   "From the Evil Empire to the Fashion Empire," he boasted.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing him on the hockey game, he said, "It's part of history.
We lost. But we're very happy for the United States, really proud of
their team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a team of amateurs and students and they beat the best
team in the world. Everyone can learn from that, your children and
ours."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, when the Olympics next come to Russia, the hosts
are planning to have the torch lit by the 1972 gold-medal basketball
team.</TE>

<DH>Palffy Plays for Slovakia, Against NHL Team's Wishes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE and JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The mere act of participation, supposedly the very essence of the
Olympic Games, became a source of controversy Saturday when Ziggy
Palffy of the Kings played against his NHL team's wishes in
Slovakia's 3-0 loss to Germany in a men's hockey qualifying-round
game on the first day of competition.</LD>
<LD>   The NHL's 12-day Olympic break begins Thursday, but Slovakia is
one of the eight countries that must play in a round-robin tournament
during the first five days of the Games to earn a berth in the final
round. None of those countries depend on NHL talent as heavily as
Slovakia, which spent months persuading individual teams to release
players while the league's regular season continued.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings played Carolina at home Thursday and were at Phoenix on
Friday; they face Dallas at Staples Center on Monday. They did not
want Palffy to play on five consecutive days, so General Manager Dave
Taylor agreed to let him join the Slovakian team with the
understanding that Palffy would sit out the Germany game and play
today against Latvia. King defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky was cleared
to play for Slovakia in both games, but only on the power play
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray wasn't watching the Olympics on television
Saturday and learned that Palffy was playing when a Times reporter
called him on his cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding," Murray said. "I'm going to call Dave right now
and we're going to have to call up there and tell them he can't play
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Murray broke the news to Taylor. Said Taylor: "Our obligation is
to put the best possible team on the ice Monday against Dallas. With
that in mind, we've asked Slovakia not to dress Ziggy [today]."</TE>
<TE>   In the Kings' 6-5 overtime loss at Phoenix on Friday, Palffy had a
hat trick while playing 22 minutes and 53 seconds--his second-longest
stint since returning to the lineup Jan. 2 after sitting out 14 games
because of a broken rib.</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky did not play for the Kings on Friday because of a
charley horse. Murray said he could have played, but they didn't want
to use two defensemen who were not completely sound. Jaroslav Modry
played despite a strained hip.</TE>
<TE>   After much pleading by the Slovaks, the Kings decided after the
Friday game to allow Visnovsky to play in Slovakia's game against
Germany on a limited basis. Palffy said he awoke at 6 a.m. and left
for his flight to Salt Lake City, where he arrived around 10:30.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy was in uniform but did not play for the first period and
half of the second.</TE>
<TE>   After Germany scored on goals by Jurgen Rumrich and Jan Benda in
the second period, Coach Jan Filc could not continue to let one of
the NHL's top scorers sit idly. "It was my decision, because we were
behind," Filc said. "We wanted to use everybody to bring some new
idea to the game. We hoped that Ziggy's ability to score would change
the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the game, we [said] that he's not going to play as far as
his risk for the game tomorrow, and that he should be just part of
the team, on the bench," Filc said. "The game was going the wrong
way, so we decided to let him play."</TE>
<TE>   Said Taylor: "I didn't like the fact that he was dressed and
sitting on the bench. That's just too great a temptation."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy was coy about whether he asked to go in or was sent in. "No
comment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you guys are not going to tell Dave Taylor I played, he's not
going to know," Palffy said.</TE>
<TE>   He did sound genuinely torn about his commitments to the Kings and
Slovakia. "I have to think about the Kings also," he said in regard
to his participation today. "This is not just Slovakia. I have to
think about both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's important for me," he added later. "It's my country,
I have to play for them. That's how I am. And I want to play for the
Kings. That's how everybody is supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   He certainly didn't sound as if he would not play again if asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That was only a period and a half," he said. "That wasn't that
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia's situation, however, just turned desperate. It can't
afford another loss. After the Latvia game today, Slovakia plays the
fourth member of Group A, Austria, on Tuesday. Teams are awarded two
points for a win and one point for a tie; the team with the most
points will advance to the final round.</TE>
<TE>   If it could ever get its entire roster together, Slovakia would
have a potent team. But it has been a mess trying to fit the Olympics
around the NHL schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Miroslav Satan, for instance, took the Buffalo Sabre owner's jet
after they played Ottawa on Friday night. Because the airspace over
Salt Lake City was declared a no-fly zone for the opening ceremony,
the plane landed in Logan, Utah, at 3 a.m. Satan didn't get to bed
until 5. He left after the game to rejoin the Sabres for today's game
at New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Filc said NHL players Jozef Stumpel of Boston, Zdeno Chara of
Ottawa, Pavol Demitra of St. Louis and Marian Hossa of Ottawa will
play for Slovakia today. And, perhaps, Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tough," Palffy said. "If you have to play
back-to-back games and play five games in five nights, it's no easy
job."</TE>
<TE>   In other preliminary games Saturday, Grigori Panteleev scored the
go-ahead goal as Latvia's first Olympic hockey appearance in 66 years
got off to a strong start with a 4-2 win over Austria at Provo,
Utah.... Sergei Shabanov stopped 17 shots, and Oleg Mikulchik scored
during a two-man advantage as Belarus beat Ukraine, 1-0, at Provo....
Maurice Rozenthal had two goals as France tied Switzerland, 3-3, at
West Valley, Utah.</TE>

<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>You imagine trying to secure the Olympic downhill is like trying to
eat soup with a fork. Locking down a domed stadium or an athletic
village is difficult enough, but think of the colossal task involved
in cordoning off a mountain.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, that is the task officials take on starting today with the
men's downhill at Snowbasin Ski Area, followed Monday by the women's
downhill and other Alpine events.</LD>
<LD>   "Quite frankly, I'm always paranoid at big events about my
security," two-time Olympic medal winner Picabo Street said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a woman, first, and an American second. And I am
semi-vulnerable being that my environment is outside. Those concerns
were already on board."</TE>
<TE>   The downhill is one of the Winter Games' premier events, and
officials have gone to great lengths to make the ski venue safe. A
crowd of nearly 25,000 is expected for the men's downhill.</TE>
<TE>   First, no one without a lift ticket, credential or event pass will
be allowed within three miles of the venue at Snowbasin. Most
spectators will have to park their vehicles several miles from the
event and ride buses.</TE>
<TE>   There is a car check station one mile from the base of Snowbasin,
and at the venue perimeter, all persons will have to go through a
metal detector and have their bags checked. This is called the "mag
and bag."</TE>
<TE>   Also, unusual for an Olympic downhill, very few spectators will be
allowed to line the course to watch the race. And, rest assured, the
slopes will be teeming with Secret Service agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primary objective is keeping bad things out of the venues,"
David Tubbs, executive director of the Utah Olympic Public Safety
Command, said.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators will not be allowed to bring in bottles, cans or
Thermoses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people don't want to have to taste all those Thermoses,"
Tubbs said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, common sense prevails. Initially, jars of baby food
were not going to be permitted on site, but Tubbs said baby food is
now OK.</TE>
<TE>   "On other items I think the public has to be sensible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line on spectator rules?</TE>
<TE>   "Try to keep it simple," Tubbs said.</TE>
<TE>   Tubbs said every effort has been made to make Olympic venues safe
but that there is no such thing as a 100% guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put together the best plan we possibly could," he said.</TE>

<HD>Beijing Costs Rise</HD>
<DH>2008 Games: City improvements will come with a $30-billion
price tag, more than doubling first estimate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Chinese authorities plan to spend $30 billion readying Beijing for
the 2008 Summer Olympics, a senior official with the Beijing
organizing committee said Saturday, more than double the amount
estimated before last summer's International Olympic Committee vote
awarding the Games to the Chinese capital.</LD>
<LD>   Liu Jingmin, executive vice president for the Beijing 2008
organizing committee, said in an interview with The Times that the
Chinese government figures it will spend $4billion on Games-specific
construction and another $26 billion on general infrastructure, such
as roadways and rail lines, and on environmental protection.</LD>
<LD>   Such costs were estimated at $14.2 billion in advance of the vote
last July at which the IOC awarded the 2008 Olympics to Beijing.</LD>
<TE>   The revised--yet still preliminary--estimate dramatically
illuminates the Chinese government's commitment to modernizing
Beijing by 2008. "The most important thing for us is to give Beijing
a new look, a new face," Liu said.</TE>
<TE>   The figures also, however, underscore the challenge facing the
IOC, in particular Jacques Rogge, the Belgian elected its president
last July, who has said repeatedly that he wants to reduce the size
and scope of the Games so that it will be more affordable for cities
that have never staged the Games--particularly in Africa and South
America, which have never played host to the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   A special IOC commission is due to study the issue in the coming
months. The IOC intends to take up the commission's recommendations,
if any, at a general assembly due to be held this November in Mexico
City.</TE>
<TE>   What remains unclear is whether the Chinese experience will amount
to a one-time aberration, or whether Beijing 2008 serves as a
financial model for cities and nations requiring a radical
infrastructure upgrade to be ready for an Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   For comparison purposes, the Greek government only three weeks ago
announced that it calculates it will spend $3.5 billion in advance of
the Summer Games in Athens in 2004. A government spokesman said about
two-thirds of the budget would be used for Olympic works, the
remainder to improve infrastructure throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of the Salt Lake Games, $1.1 billion in government
funds were allocated to road and rail construction in Utah, but there
is sharp dispute about whether that sum ought to be included in
Olympic-related accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The money would have been spent regardless of the Games, but some
spending was accelerated to ensure that projects were completed in
time for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Direct federal, state and local government spending on the Salt
Lake Olympics amounts to a separate budget category and totals $622
million.</TE>
<TE>   In all, direct costs for the Salt Lake Games total $1.9 billion;
$1.3billion comes from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Operating costs for the Summer Games tend to run higher than the
Winter Olympics. The preliminary estimate for Beijing 2008's
operating budget is $1.6 billion, Liu said. That is roughly in line
with the Athens 2004 and Sydney 2000 Summer Games operating budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Adding Beijing's operating and capital budgets together yields a
total climbing toward $32 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Liu made it plain that the Chinese view the 2008 Games as nothing
less than catalyst for an extensive modernization of Beijing, with a
particular focus on upgrading environmental controls.</TE>
<TE>   The onset of the Games "will of course bring some tremendous
changes in Beijing's development," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to enjoy some very exciting moments over the next
seven years."</TE>
<TE>   He also went on record as saying that Chinese officials intend to
run bidding and construction processes free from corruption, saying
that to "adopt international practice is quite essential to us."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he said that Beijing 2008 officials are even now
"undergoing a study about how to make coverage of the Olympic Games
more transparent," meaning open, particularly to press from the
United States and other western nations, adding, "One of the
principles of the Olympic Games is to be open to the outside."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Scientists can call off their search for the missing link.</LD>
<LD>   He has been found.</LD>
<LD>   It's Eric Heiden.</LD>
<TE>   Recall, if you will, the American athletes and former athletes
involved in the final minutes of the Olympic torch's journey Friday
night at the opening ceremony of these Salt Lake City Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the flame into the stadium were figure skating champions
Dorothy Hamill and Dick Button. They passed the torch to figure
skating champions Peggy Fleming and Scott Hamilton, who handed off to
champion skiers Bill Johnson and Phil Mahre.</TE>
<TE>   Around the stadium they went before giving the fire to champion
speedskaters Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen. Taking the flame from them
were the Sheas, father Jim, a former Olympian in Nordic combined, and
son Jim Jr., competing here in skeleton. The original Olympian in the
family, Jack Shea, a speedskating champion at Lake Placid in 1932,
was to have been with them for a three-generational celebration but
was killed last month in a traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   From the Sheas, the torch went to two still-competing gold
medalists, hockey player Cammi Granato and skier Picabo Street, who
ran it up the stadium to Mike Eruzione and other members of the 1980
"Miracle on Ice" hockey team, who together applied the flame to the
Olympic caldron, where it will burn throughout the Games.</TE>
<TE>   It was wonderful and heartwarming and all that, but it was also as
obvious as a whiskey nose that something was wrong here. Someone was
missing. Where, in that chain of America's most productive Olympic
athletes, was Eric Heiden? Possibly the most productive of them all.</TE>
<TE>   What Heiden achieved at the 1980 Lake Placid Games was one of the
remarkable athletic accomplishments of any era. He won all five men's
speedskating races--setting Olympic records in his first four, a
world record in his fifth--events ranging from 500 to 10,000 meters.
He won the sprints, the middle-distance events and the long-distance
races. He obliterated the competition.</TE>
<TE>   His feat was akin to winning a decathlon--not against decathletes
but against the finest athletes in their sports. If King Gustav of
Sweden, who in 1912 complimented Jim Thorpe on being the world's
greatest athlete, had seen Heiden, he would have had strong second
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   People who watched on TV remember the Lake Placid Games for the
hockey team. People who were there remember it every bit as much for
Heiden.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, how absolutely fitting it would have been for Granato and
Street to have passed the torch to him, so he could in turn have
handed it to the hockey players he'd professed such admiration for at
Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   So where was he Friday night? Certainly he had to have been asked.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he was. Turns out, he said no thanks.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on Sporting News Radio, Heiden said he had been invited
to be "one of the last guys" in the chain of athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I wanted to be the last guy," he said, obviously
meaning he wanted to be the one lighting the caldron. "They said they
couldn't do that and I said, 'Well, then, I have other things to
do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Classy, huh?</TE>
<TE>   But not altogether surprising to those who had caught Heiden's act
at Lake Placid, whose Games he referred to as "the great whoopee!"</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years ago, the world wanted to love Eric Heiden, not
merely admire his feats. He made sure that didn't happen by
presenting himself as a smirking smart-aleck--a highly skilled,
superbly trained, sensationally successful smart-aleck but a
smart-aleck just the same. He responded to serious questions with pat
answers, to less serious ones with retorts. He told the country that
he was much more appreciated in Europe and was skating for himself,
because it was something he liked to do.</TE>
<TE>   Aloof to the point of arrogance, he lifted himself above it all,
simply couldn't be bothered.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think a fine education--he's now an orthopedic surgeon and
doctor for the U.S. team here--and 22 years of living in the real
world might have made him see things from a different perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently not.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Heiden was a self-centered smart-aleck but he could be at
least partially excused because he was a young self-centered

<HD>Bahrke Is All Silver</HD>
<DH>Women's moguls: She wins first medal of Games for U.S.
Norway's Traa wins gold.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The color of the glitter decorating Shannon Bahrke's cheeks and
eyelashes matched the medal she took home from the freestyle moguls
Saturday. Silver.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Bahrke, 21, of Tahoe City, Calif., didn't care much about
color coordinating. She was thrilled to grab any medal.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe I'm on the podium," Bahrke, the first American
medal winner at the 2002 Games, gushed. "To me, it adds something
special after Sept. 11. I think it makes everyone proud."</LD>
<TE>   It was even more special because two years ago she contracted a
life-threatening staph infection and doctors told her she might never
regain top form.</TE>
<TE>   The gold medal went to Norway's Kari Traa, 28, who hopes the win
creates as much of a furor at home as the recent controversial
magazine pictures she posed for.</TE>
<TE>   Traa, who came in as winner in five of six World Cups this winter,
recorded the best score in morning qualifying when the field was
chopped to 16. Ann Battelle, 34, of Steamboat Springs, Colo., a
four-time Olympian, was sitting second, with Hannah Hardaway, 23, of
Moultonborough, N.H., third, and Bahrke fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors zigzag down a steep hill covered by snow bumps called
moguls, and make complicated jumps off ramps in the middle of the
run. The biggest tricks, spinning a full revolution, leaping in the
air in a snow angel position, garner the biggest applause. Racers are
scored on three elements with a maximum point total of 30. Only 25%
of the score is based on time. Jumps count for 25% and turns count
for 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature was 19 degrees and the wind mild, but the sun was
so strong it felt warmer. Bahrke, rooted on by a contingent of family
and friends from California, provoked huge roars from the 13,685 fans
when she completed her run and was awarded a score of 25.06.</TE>
<TE>   Bahrke arrived at the Games as the only athlete to beat Traa in a
World Cup this season, and also won the U.S. Gold Cup on New Year's
Eve here. Her run was spectacular, but Traa bested her with a score
of 25.94. Tae Satoya, 25, of Japan, the 1998 gold medallist in
Nagano, took bronze in 24.85.</TE>
<TE>   Satoya said her father, who was a key helper in her racing, died
since the last Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "This time I said to my father I would do my best and I did my
best," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She jumped past Hardaway, fifth, and Battelle, seventh, in the
final.</TE>
<TE>   Traa became a world-class threat in 1999 when she swore off
chocolate for three months. Between September and Christmas she lost
20 pounds. She nibbles sweets sometimes now, but isn't going back to
her chunkier days.</TE>
<TE>   Traa, who has blonde hair and blue eyes, has arresting looks. She
recently posed for a Norwegian sports magazine and the sauciness of
her looks in scanty attire got more attention than she expected.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to make cool pictures," Traa said. "I did it for my
sport."</TE>
<TE>   Bahrke was a giddy medalist, and said the cheers she heard over
the last 10 bumps will stay with her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most magnificent feeling in the world," she said. "It's
one of the most amazing things ever."</TE>

<HD>Lodwick Could Be Combination Lock for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Nordic combined: He seems poised for the best finish in
American history and possibly a medal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Barring a collapse, the United States will make history in the Nordic
combined today. The question is, what kind of history?</LD>
<LD>   Will Todd Lodwick of Steamboat Springs, Colo., merely record the
best Olympic finish ever by a U.S. athlete in the event, which
combines ski jumping with cross-country skiing, or will he take his
country where it seemed it would never go: the medal podium? The
answers will have to wait until today's 15-kilometer ski race, but
for now they appear to be yes and a strong maybe.</LD>
<LD>   Lodwick put himself in position for a medal Saturday at Utah
Olympic Park when he placed seventh in the 90-meter jumping
competition, one spot ahead of Bill Demong of Vermontville, N.Y. "I'm
feeling it," Lodwick said.</LD>
<TE>   In the cross-country element of Nordic combined, every competitor
gets a head start on anyone who finished behind him in jumping. That
will put Lodwick 2 minutes 15 seconds behind jump winner Jaakko
Tallus of Finland at the cross-country start. But Tallus, a
relatively weak skier, probably won't even win a medal. Germany's
Ronny Ackermann, a splendid skier who placed fifth in jumping, and
Finland's Samppa Lajunen, who placed third, will probably vie for the
gold.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick, an excellent skier who will start 1:07 behind Ackermann,
doesn't believe his deficit is insurmountable. "It's like being down
a couple touchdowns going into the fourth quarter, but you saw the
Super Bowl and the Rams came back and just barely got nipped," he
said, referring to St. Louis' rally from a 17-3 deficit in its 20-17
loss to New England.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick hopes his familiarity with the tough, high-altitude
cross-country course at Soldier Hollow will give him a shot at gold.
That's probably wishful thinking, but he's confident he can win at
least a bronze medal, breaking a U.S. drought that stretches to the
first Winter Games in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   "There's four I know I can catch," he said of the racers who will
precede him Sunday. "It's just a matter of when."</TE>
<TE>   Demong, not as strong a skier as Lodwick, has a shot at a top-10
finish, not bad for a 21-year-old. At least for one more day, the top
U.S. finish ever in Nordic combined was a ninth by Rolf Monsen in
1932 at Lake Placid, N.Y. That helps explain how Lodwick's and
Demong's performances gained a measure of respect for the U.S. Nordic
combined program, which until recently was an international snicker.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick, who was 13th at age 17 in the 1994 Games in Lillehammer,
was a disappointing 20th in 1998 at Nagano, one of several times he
faded in big events.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his career he was a strong jumper and weak skier; in
recent years he has been inconsistent in his jumps while improving
his skiing. Saturday, though, Lodwick could have done even better had
a headwind that aided some opponents not died down before his first
jump.</TE>
<TE>   He went 91.5 meters on that first attempt and 92.5 on his second
jump, which with style points gave him a 240.5 total.</TE>
<TE>   Tallus had the day's best jump at 100.5 meters on his first
attempt and finished with 267.5 points. Austria's Felix Gottwald,
co-favorite with Ackermann, finished 11th, helping put Ackermann in
position to avenge his disappointing 12th-place finish at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team has been pointing toward this weekend almost since
1992, when virtually all of the country's top Nordic combined
athletes moved to Steamboat Springs to train together. Dozens of the
16,784 spectators Saturday were Steamboat Springs residents cheering
on native son Lodwick, who believes the United States is the perfect
place to prove the U.S. can jump and race with the big boys.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can happen tomorrow," he said. "To be the first to win a
medal in Nordic combined would be great not only for me but for
Nordic combined in the United States."</TE>

<HD>NBC Scores Big With Opening Ceremony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era of declining television ratings, NBC incredibly got a
record 25.5 rating for its coverage of the opening ceremony Friday
night. No Olympic opening ceremony, Summer or Winter, has gotten a
rating that high.</LD>
<LD>   The previous record was a 24.2 for CBS' coverage of the opening
ceremony for the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, back when the
TV universe consisted of three networks.</LD>
<LD>   The share for Friday night's opening ceremony coverage was a 42
share, meaning that of the households where television was being
watched, 42% were tuned into NBC. The rating pertains to all
television households.</LD>
<TE>   The 25.5 is 57% better than the 16.2 NBC got for the opening
ceremony of the 2000 Summer Games at Sydney, Australia, and 49%
better than the 17.1 CBS got for the opening ceremony of the 1998
Winter Olympics at Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as incredible as NBC's getting a record rating was the fact
that three of the seven highest-rated markets are located in the
Pacific time zone, where NBC's coverage is delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City generated the highest local market rating with a
65.5 and an 84 share, and Portland, Ore., was next with a 37.0/58.
Seattle came in fifth with a 34.8/55, and Sacramento was seventh with
a 32.2/50.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles numbers--25.8/40--beat the national averages.</TE>
<TE>   New York drew a 30.3/45 and Chicago a 25.4/39.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Picabo Street said it wasn't a statement, but what else would you
call it?</TE>
<TE>   On her first downhill training run, two days before her final
Olympic race, Street bolted from the 30th start position Saturday to
scorch the Wildflower course and the competition with a leading time
of 1 minute 42.16 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, it was a statement, for Street and her American teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline LaLive finished second in the training run, Jonna Mendes
was fifth and Kirsten Clark eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The women have another training run today to prepare for Monday's
downhill.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can bet on the Americans, I really do," Street said.
"Like I told you guys all week. You ask me who my biggest competition
is. I'm going to reiterate. It's coming right off my team. Straight
up."</TE>
<TE>   Training runs are more often games of cat and mouse, with the
favorites not wanting to tip their hands.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, for example, might have won Saturday's practice race had
she not purposely stood up in her skis near the end, costing her
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I put on the brakes a bit, to have something in reserve," Clark
said. "For me, in the first training run, I don't necessarily want to
be sitting on top."</TE>
<TE>   Not the case for the 30-year-old Street, who obviously wanted to
send a message to teammates and the rest of the world: she plans to
go out skis blazing.</TE>
<TE>   Street, trying to regain top form after devastating injuries
suffered in a 1998 crash cost her two years on the race circuit,
ranks only 15th in the World Cup downhill rankings and really hasn't
popped a good run since finishing fifth at Lake Louise, Canada, on
Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   She popped one Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bode Miller's chance to win a medal in combined on Tuesday took a
big turn forward when he turned in a very fast (for him) time of
1:41.72 in Saturday's training run. Miller, who does not normally
race downhill, finished only 1.42 seconds behind the training run
leader, France's Pierre-Emmanuel Dalcin.</TE>
<TE>   "All around, it was no complaints, it was great," Miller said of
his run.</TE>
<TE>   This was a big improvement from Thursday's first go, when Miller
finished 3.21 seconds behind Austria's Stephan Eberharter.</TE>
<TE>   The combined event involves adding the times of a shortened
downhill and two runs of slalom, all raced the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Miller will be a gold-medal contender in the slalom and giant
slalom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Russian figure skaters have won the last three men's
Olympic gold medals and the last four world championships, no member
of the three-man U.S. delegation is prepared to concede.</TE>
<TE>   Evgeny Plushenko, the reigning world champion, and Alexei Yagudin,
who won the three previous titles, are favored to prevail in the
men's event, which begins Tuesday with the short program. However,
U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, runner-up Tim Goebel and third-ranked
Michael Weiss believe nothing is sure until the last quadruple toe
loop is looped.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, said he's not concerned with the
Russians. "I just want to go and skate well and not really worry
about what anybody else can or can't do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, Goebel's coach, disputed the perception that
Russian skaters are superior to the U.S. men.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians run out of gas at the end of their programs,"
Carroll said. "They're not great marathon skaters. Personally, I'm
not crazy about some of the stops and bumps and grinds [in their
programs]. Often we're faced with a panel of judges that has been
trained in the Soviet system and maybe they look at it differently
than if they'd been trained in the North American system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's psychology, but Eldredge said he's not chasing a gold
medal here.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at a medal anymore," he said. "I just look at having
a great experience. I haven't had that, outside of the opening
ceremony.... I don't look at a medal here as defining my career or
defining my life by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, however, said he is focused on winning the gold because to
shoot any lower would give him an excuse if he doesn't win.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel said he has the lightest burden of the trio.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no expectations. I've never medaled at worlds and I've
never medaled at the Olympics," he said. "I have no pressure here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A dispute over a drug test by a member of the U.S. Olympic track
team at the 2000 Sydney Games could be resolved this spring under a
compromise that withholds the athlete's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Lamine Diack, president of track's world federation, the IAAF,
said the issue would be submitted to a ruling council meeting in
April.</TE>
<TE>   USA Track &amp; Field can submit evidence it says supports its
argument that rules in effect at the time of the 1999 test forbid it
from identifying the athlete, who tested positive but was cleared on
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds at Olympic hockey games will not have their faces scanned
to see if they match known terrorists or criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The facial recognition surveillance system at the main Olympic
hockey arena was scrapped because of concerns it wouldn't work as
advertised.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The flag of Great Britain flew at half-staff in the Olympic
village Saturday in tribute to Princess Margaret, who died late
Friday. The flag will be lowered again Friday for her funeral.</TE>

<HD>Canadians Don't Fall Too Short</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Sale and Pelletier, in second place behind
Russian pair, provide humor by slipping in final pose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The pressure on Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada to follow
their world championship with an Olympic gold medal is sometimes too
onerous for them to bear.</LD>
<LD>   "It's heavy," Pelletier said of the expectations they face after
winning nine consecutive competitions. "The only place I feel
comfortable is on the ice. Since I've been here, I love practicing
and I love skating."</LD>
<LD>   They were able to release some of that pressure Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Unintentionally adding a humorous ending to their "Jalousie" short
program, they slipped out of their languid, graceful final pose and
fell sideways to the ice, surprising themselves as much as the 16,089
fans at the Salt Lake Ice Center. But since the fall didn't occur on
one of the eight required elements, they weren't penalized by the
judges, who placed them second behind Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China were third with a powerful
routine to "Kismet" that included a well-executed throw triple loop
and excellent double twist. Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin of
Russia were fourth, one place ahead of U.S. pair champions Kyoko Ina
and John Zimmerman. The second U.S. entry, Tiffany Scott and Philip
Dulebohn, stood 11th. The pairs competition will end Monday with the
long program, worth two-thirds of the final score.</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, skating with excellent unison, got an
array of 5.7s and 5.8s (out of 6.0) for their required elements and
eight 5.8s and one 5.9 for their presentation, putting them first on
seven of nine judges' scorecards. The Nagano silver medalists'
practices earlier last week had been rocky because Berezhnaya got a
sunburn at a tanning salon and was too sore for her partner to hold
or throw her, but they had no problems Saturday and are in position
to continue a Russian pairs winning streak dating to 1964.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great," Berezhnaya said. "I think everybody skate so well.
It was nice to watch. We did our job and I'm glad we skate well
here."</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier was merely glad to get the short program over with. The
2-minute, 40-second routine is fraught with tension because
deductions are mandatory for each botched element. But the couple got
the other two first-place votes.</TE>
<TE>   "The short program, you've got everything to do," he said. "If you
do a mistake, you're done."</TE>
<TE>   They're still in fine position, which enabled Sale to smile about
their fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even sure what happened," said Sale, who was kissed by
Pelletier after they fell and teamed with him to pull off the final
pose the right way. "It was the weirdest thing. It was funny."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pelletier: "I knew my job was done. I looked at Jamie and
said, 'I can't believe I'm at the Olympics and this happens.' But
sometimes it's good not to follow a script."</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman, however, were less than amused at the judges'
reaction to their Pink Floyd routine. Their marks for required
elements included one 5.3 from U.S. judge Lucy Brennan and their
presentation marks ranged from 5.5 to 5.7.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have liked them to have been a bit higher," said
Zimmerman, who bobbled the landing of their side-by-side triple toe
loops and was out of unison with Ina on their side-by-side spins.</TE>
<TE>   "For our first time out in the Olympics as a team, I think we
handled this well, and hopefully we learned from that."</TE>
<TE>   Ina, who teamed with Jason Dungjen to finish ninth at the 1994
Lillehammer Games and fourth at the 1998 Nagano Games, praised the
crowd for its support. American flags were everywhere, waving on
sticks and stitched onto sweaters, jackets and headbands, but the
patriotic fans gave warm ovations to skaters from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so exciting to be out there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd was incredible. We didn't know what to expect. It's the
Olympic Games.... It's a little overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Scott and Dulebohn, making their Olympic debut, were plagued by
nerves. Scott fell on the landing of their throw triple salchow and
swung her leg too far in landing their side-by-side triple toe loops.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go out and do it again right now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there are no do-overs in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here and we're proud to be here," Dulebohn said.</TE>

<KH>THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>Ziggy in Slovakia's Secret Service</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Outside, the international media were growing surly, tired of waiting
an hour in 20-degree weather to clear security at the moguls venue,
fed up with having been shaken down by security guards at the E
Center hockey arena.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney and
International Olympic Committee Director Francois Carrard were
patting each other on the back for a most excellent opening ceremony
and a most excellent first day of competition.</LD>
<LD>   Long lines, what long lines?</LD>
<TE>   By sundown Saturday, the mob made it to the mountaintop. Romney
and Carrard were easing toward the end of their joint news conference
when an angry British reporter wanted to know what could be done to
improve conditions at the E Center, where 25 writers trying to cover
hockey were made to wait an hour while security guards asked to see
credit cards, pulled caps off pens, confiscated packages of
dangerous-looking chewing gum.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, replied Romney, who seemed rather pleased to deliver the
bad news.</TE>
<TE>   An Australian reporter wanted to know who planned the Salt Lake
security program and why that plan hadn't adequately factored in the
amount of time it's taking for guards to inspect photography
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Romney suggested, more or less, that she take it up with the
Secret Service and the U.S. National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   So what's stopping Ziggy Palffy, the Kings' winger who landed on
Salt Lake City ice a good 24 hours before the Kings figured he would?</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, as we have seen, not a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy zipped by security, zoomed into the E Center and played for
Slovakia in a qualification game faster than the Kings had ever
figured. Or wanted. Reluctantly, the Kings had granted Palffy
permission to join his national team at the Olympics--provided he sat
out Saturday's game against Germany and made it back to Los Angeles
for the Kings' game Monday against Dallas before the NHL's 12-day
Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   But Ziggy played Saturday. This was news to King Coach Andy
Murray, who learned of Palffy's participation in Slovakia's 3-0 loss
to Germany only because of a phone call placed by a Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Murray wasn't happy. King General Manager Dave Taylor wasn't
happy. What's going on over there, they demanded to know.</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia was getting pounded and its coach was too desperate to
keep a gentleman's agreement, that's what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Filc, the Slovakia coach, was asked why he reneged on the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that Ziggy's ability to score would change the game
[because] the game was going the wrong way," Filc replied. "We let
him play. The situation was very tough.</TE>
<TE>   "Ziggy was released [to play] one game, and it was supposed to be
[today, against Latvia]. But we thought there might be a case where
we could change [the momentum] and use him in this game. This was the
reason I asked Ziggy to stay on the bench with the team."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Olympic Ideal students: When the going gets tough,
deals are made to be broken.</TE>
<TE>   Another lesson driven home fairly forcefully Saturday: At the
Olympics, the home field/ice/hill advantage can be a bear.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, which has never won a medal in Nordic combined,
which has never placed a skier higher than ninth in Nordic combined,
emerged from the ski-jump portion of the two-day event with two
competitors, Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong, ranked seventh and eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Parra, a diminutive 1,500-meter speedskating specialist,
entered Saturday's 5,000-meter event to "get my feet wet" against the
powerful Dutch--and briefly wound up holding a world record en route
to a silver medal. Parra, who grew up in San Bernardino, became the
first Mexican American to win a Winter Olympic medal by skating 6
minutes 17.98 seconds--a new record that stood for about 20 minutes,
before Jochem Uytdehaage of the Netherlands could complete his 5,000
meters in 6:14.66.</TE>
<TE>   And Shannon Bahrke, her face splashed with glitter, accessorized
with silver by finishing second to Norway's Kari Traa in women's
moguls skiing.</TE>
<TE>   That's two U.S. medals on the first day of competition, a running
leap toward the U.S. Olympic Committee's Salt Lake City objective of
20.</TE>
<TE>   Could there be a third today in the longtime American no-hope
sport of Nordic combined?</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick thinks there's a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being down a couple touchdowns going into the fourth
quarter, but you saw the Super Bowl," Lodwick told the assembled
Nordic combined beat writers. "The Rams came back and just barely got
nipped.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible. Tomorrow is another day. It's a great
possibility for us [as a team] to produce the best results for U.S.
Nordic combined."</TE>
<TE>   Anything is possible, true, provided you don't leave enough time
on the clock for the second-year quarterback to mount a winning
field-goal drive against a prevent defense locked into backpedal
mode. But then, any Nordic combined ski writer from Norway can tell
you that.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>These brave, sophisticated Winter Olympics held the first medal
ceremony Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Somehow managing to squeeze it in between giant plastic puck
tosses and a joke about a monkey scratching its rear.</LD>
<LD>   After a day of inspirational competition, precious hardware was
draped around the necks of, among others, Americans Derek Parra and
Shannon Bahrke.</LD>
<TE>   But only after everyone had grown weary of Mambo Jumbo and Heart 2
Heart.</TE>
<TE>   It is a recent Winter Olympics tradition to bring the winners down
from the mountain and embrace them later that evening in the city
square.</TE>
<TE>   But do we first have to dance the Macarena?</TE>
<TE>   Just before watching the world's finest athletes step to the
podium, do we have to sit in 15-degree temperatures listening to a
certain comedian sing a song filled with Olympic-related double
entendres while attempting a Swedish accent?</TE>
<TE>   The thrill of victory. The agony of Bob Saget.</TE>
<TE>   "What the hell is this?" asked one foreign visitor in a real
German accent. "This is not funny. This is cold."</TE>
<TE>   So it went Saturday inside what was supposed to be a unique
winners' circle for the Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Transformed, instead, into another American rock concert.</TE>
<TE>   And the medal winners weren't even the stars.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, they were only one of several warmup acts for the
Dave Matthews Band.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't hard to figure whom the 20,000 folks who crowded the
makeshift downtown outdoor arena came to see.</TE>
<TE>   Hint: It wasn't Jochem Uytdehaage.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, when the big screens showed 5,000-meter speedskating
silver medalist Parra crying, the crowd's roars drowned out the final
refrains of winner Uytdehaage's Dutch national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   I spoke with families, young single adults, buddies from college,
and all sounded just like stockbroker Tom Murray from Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "The medals are cool, but we're here to see Dave Matthews," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It is nice idea, corraling the energy of the Games every evening
into a security-tight venue with bleachers and a stage.</TE>
<TE>   It is an even nicer idea giving away all free tickets to the
events, one of the demands by the Mormon church when it donated the
land.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concept was to create one place where this community can
experience the Games and celebrate the heroes," said Scott Givens,
creative director for the organizing committee.</TE>
<TE>   And for four hours Saturday, the Olympic Medals Plaza was
overtaken with singing, swaying and clapping.</TE>
<TE>   It was indeed a place for celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   But considering none of that involved the athletes, it was not a
place for medals.</TE>
<TE>   From the modern interpretive dance that accompanied the podium's
entrance, to the glitzy announcement that welcomed the next act,
there was something too choreographed about what is supposed to be an
affair of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere was this more evident than after the ceremony involving
the three medalists in the men's 30-kilometer cross-country skiing.</TE>
<TE>   After coming together on the top of the podium, they draped their
arms around each other and basked in the twinkling of flashbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   Until a little girl dressed like a snowball tugged the arm of
bronze medalist Mikhail Botvinov of Austria. And another little girl
tugged the arm of silver medalist Christian Hoffmann.</TE>
<TE>   Time's up. Another act is waiting. Off the stage. Now.</TE>
<TE>   I guess they were lucky organizers didn't yank them away with a
big hook.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, after the final ceremony involving the 5,000-meter
speedskaters, the stage lights were turned off on Uytdehaage as he
preened at the front of the stage, throwing flowers into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   He had to leave, and quick.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the Dave Matthews Band was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   One cannot imagine this happening if the medals were awarded at
the individual venues, as occurs in the Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes spend their lives working toward these medals. Is it
too much to ask that we give them the entire stage when they win
them?</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, three women owned the slopes at Soldier Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   Yet later that evening, they had to share their glory with
somebody shouting, "C'mon folks, the more you twist, the warmer
you'll get!"</TE>
<TE>   After its tasteful and inspirational opening ceremonies, the Salt
Lake organizers are now batting .500.</TE>
<TE>   I knew something was odd when I walked into the Medals Plaza and
found an old football buddy sweeping trash. Guy by the name of Steve
Young.</TE>
<TE>   "I do everything," he said with a grin, and this is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   But then he jumped on stage and introduced the venue's host for
the first four days, well-worn comedian Saget.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Those church members who donated this land were surely flinching
at several questionable jokes, while everyone flinched at all the bad
ones.</TE>
<TE>   He was just part of a pre-medals act that included a salsa band,
an oldies group, and several "games" that were played with the
cheerleaders and the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   That those games used giant blowup pucks and balls gave Saget even
more fodder for comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, nearly three hours after it opened, the crowd cold and
restless and waiting for Matthews, the medalists arrived.</TE>
<TE>   In coming days, the crowd will be waiting for such big acts as
Barenaked Ladies, Smash Mouth and Goo Goo Dolls.</TE>
<TE>   It only figured Saturday that after the first presentation, the
U.S. flag got stuck on one of the flagpoles. It remained for the rest
of the ceremonies while workers below desperately tried to lower it
with grace.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Just a Second</HD>
<DH>Parra's Record Lasts Only Minutes, but His Stunning Silver
Stands</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>The wrong Dutchman won the men's 5,000-meter speedskating race here
Saturday at the Winter Olympics, but that wasn't half as surprising
as who finished second.</LD>
<LD>   That was Derek Parra up on the podium, a silver medal dangling
from his neck. Derek Parra, the Mexican American kid from San
Bernardino--well, he's not a kid anymore, he's a month shy of 32 and
is growing a nice little tonsure--who turned to ice skating only
because he realized seven years ago that inline roller skating would
not be an Olympic sport in his competitive lifetime. And, darn, he
wanted a medal.</LD>
<LD>   Now he has one. A Latino from sunny Southern California has a
Winter Games medal, same as Jochem Uytdehaage, the winning skater
from the Netherlands, and Jens Boden of Germany, who took the bronze.
And in an afternoon of upsets, those guys were as surprised with
their finishes as Parra was with his.</LD>
<TE>   It took a world-record time of 6 minutes 14.66 seconds by
Uytdehaage to knock Parra, who had himself skated a world-record
time, out of the gold medal. And although Parra had seriously planned
to win a medal, this was not the race he figured to get it.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided my best race would be the 1,500 [Feb. 19], so my wife
Tiffany stayed home [at her mother's house in Orlando, Fla.] with our
[baby] daughter Mia," Parra said, ruefully. "When I called her, she
said she'd been watching on television and was jumping up and down on
the couch. She said she jumped a little higher every lap. That must
have been funny."</TE>
<TE>   Went right along with the rest of the race, a funny one if every
there was one.</TE>
<TE>   Dutch skaters have dominated the distance races since before the
last Winter Games at Nagano, where Hollanders Gianni Romme and Rintje
Ritsma finished 1-2 in the 5,000, ahead of expatriate Dutchman Bart
Veldkamp, skating for Belgium. There were plenty predicting a Dutch
sweep here.</TE>
<TE>   Then Romme, the defending Olympic champion and last season's World
Cup champion, failed to qualify for the 5,000, finishing fifth in the
Dutch trials. That still left Carl Verheijen and Bob de Jong, veteran
skaters and winners, not to mention Uytdehaage, whom almost no one
did. Everyone was quite sure that on the fast ice of the Utah Olympic
Oval, the Dutch would clean up, with records falling right and left.</TE>
<TE>   Then the racing began, and everything changed. Nobody went very
fast. American KC Boutiette, skating in the second pair,
surprisingly, set a U.S. record, but it was well off the Olympic and
world records. When Boden, skating against Veldkamp in the fifth
pair, came out of nowhere with a 6:21.73, that went up as an Olympic
record, although it was about three seconds shy of the world mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I was incredibly happy," the young German said, "and very
surprised. But I was sure my Dutch colleagues would come in before
me."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly an hour, though, Boden's name stayed first on the
leaderboard--until Parra, skating on newly resurfaced ice in the
first pair of the supposedly fast group, knocked him off with a world
mark of 6:17.98, more than 15 seconds faster than his previous best.
Had he imagined such a time?</TE>
<TE>   "Not by me," he quipped. "By four or five other skaters. And I'm
sure when Jochem saw my time, he said, 'I can beat that. I beat him
all the time.' I have to say, though, that was the best 5k of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   And in posting his fast time, Parra blew by his skating partner,
Canadian Dustin Molicki, a legitimate medal threat. And then, the
others stepped up, fired and missed. Verheijen skated a mediocre
6:24.71. Russian Vadim Sayutin and Norwegian Stian Bjorge fared
poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, only two pairs stood between Parra and a gold medal. In
one of them, though, was Uytdehaage, who quickly settled that matter.
It was obvious at the halfway mark of his race that, unless he fell,
he would beat Parra's time. He didn't fall, and he beat Parra by more
than three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Which brought up De Jong, but he and pair partner Toshihiko
Itokawa of Japan skated poorly, leaving a tearful Uytdehaage clasping
his hands and gazing skyward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit emotional," he said. "It overcomes you....
It's amazing I'm up here. It's amazing that it's the three of us on
the podium."</TE>
<TE>   No less amazing to Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "Total surprise," he said. "Like Jochem said, the three of us up
here when there were so many good skaters in this race. I was shocked

smash my time.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty inspired by KC, and then seeing the other times, I
just got more confident, thinking, 'I can do that. I can do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   And so he did it, a Latino winning Winter gold.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great thing to help Hispanics reach for their goals,"
he said. "I'm going back to my elementary school with my medal and
telling the kids, 'Reach high!'"</TE>

<LD>While Americans gave the Winter Olympic opening ceremony Friday red,
white and blue raves, some members of the foreign press were critical
of the festivities' patriotic overtones.</LD>
<LD>   Most of their criticism was about the tie-ins to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, especially the procession of the flag recovered
from the rubble of the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "This is wrong," Hafez Dahi, sportswriter for Kuwait's Al-Siyassah
daily newspaper, said as he watched part of the ceremony with friends
at home. "This is supposed to be just sports."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. athletes and police officers carried the flag into the
stadium and the Mormon Tabernacle choir sang the national anthem at
the beginning of the ceremony, which also featured a New York City
police officer singing "God Bless America" and the gold medal-winning
1980 U.S. hockey team lighting the Olympic caldron.</TE>
<TE>   In an article written before the ceremony, the Russian newspaper
Kommersant said: "It is annoying that they are bringing the Ground
Zero flag.... It doesn't have anything to do with the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet ran a half-page picture of
spectators holding American flags, then criticized such a patriotic
display in the accompanying article.</TE>
<TE>   Paris' Le Monde praised organizers for providing "a quite sober
and well-done spectacle, alternating lightness and gravity, never
grandiloquent or vulgar."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese newspapers were full of kudos. Yomiuri Shimbun, the
largest national paper, wrote that the "first major global event
since the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States ... also
became the center stage for America's declaration against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emotional Gamut</TE>
<TE>   U.S. women's downhill skier Picabo Street was crushed and cried
openly after not being picked by her peers to carry the American flag
in Friday's opening ceremony, her father, Ron, said.</TE>
<TE>   "She set herself up and took a fall," he said. "She went through
so much change. Yeah, she wanted to carry the flag."</TE>
<TE>   Picabo's disappointment turned to joy when she learned Friday that
she was going to have a major role in the torch-carrying ceremony
that climaxed the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night was really amazing," she said Saturday. "You know, I
really wanted to carry the flag, for my team, but last night was
more. Last night was the entire Olympics, the whole world watching,
and I was a part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I really had a hard time bringing my feet back to
the ground today in order to concentrate on what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm All Shook Up</TE>
<TE>   U.S. women's hockey team captain Cammi Granato, who ran the final
leg of the Olympic torch relay Friday night with Street before
passing the flame to Mike Eruzione for the caldron lighting, said she
was stunned to be chosen for such a prominent role.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out the night before," she said. "I had known I was going
to run the torch but I didn't know I'd be with Picabo Street. I was
trying to get out of the building pretty fast before they changed
their mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The opening ceremony always has that magical feel. It's something
I'll never forget."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Memory</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grimmette was part of U.S. Olympic history in Nagano, when he
teamed with Brian Martin to win a bronze medal in luge doubles,
marking the first time in 34 years that Americans had stood on a luge
medal stand.</TE>
<TE>   The irony was that, on the rung above him and Martin were Gordy
Sheer and Chris Thorpe, also American. When it rains, it pours, in
U.S. luge.</TE>
<TE>   Grimmette had been fourth in Lillehammer four years earlier, and
had been part of the U.S. luge program for 12 years. Now, not only
has that hard work paid off in an Olympic medal, but also in a
lifetime memory at Friday night's opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Grimmette was selected as one of eight to carry in the tattered
flag from the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed when I walked in," said Grimmette, a Muskegon,
Mich., native who now lives in Lake Placid, N.Y. "I expected lots of
noise, but it was so quiet we could hear the sounds of our own
footsteps. It was a powerful moment, one that I'll never forget."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Something New</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe will run with Clay Ives this time and then retire. He is
recently married and expecting a child, so he called the Salt Lake
Games his "last vacation" for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he will encourage his child to become an athlete, he said
he would, indeed. Because his wife is Kriste Porter, nine-time U.S.
national champion freestyle skier, he was asked if he will push for
skiing or sliding.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf or tennis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Give Me a Break</TE>
<TE>   A Russian cross-country skier blasted the tight security and
searches for every entrant to Olympic venues Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my fourth Olympic Games and no one has ever thrashed my
personal belongings they way they've done it this time," Larissa
Lazutina, the silver medal winner in the women's 15-kilometer
freestyle race, said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in line as inspectors collect loose pocket items, examine
bags and check electronic equipment has become a daily part of life
at the Salt Lake City Games. Lazutina finds it insulting and resents
the insinuation that the competitors could be part of an attack plot.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here to compete," she said. "We have nothing else in our
minds but competing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just this morning. Every day. They screen us and they
take our belongings."</TE>
<TE>   She said that others would agree with her. However, the bronze and
gold medal winners in her event did not take her side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not very pleasant for everybody, but the safety is
important," said Katerina Neumannova of the Czech Republic, who
finished third. "For me, it's not a problem."</TE>
<TE>   "I do understand what the point of the security is," gold-medal
winner Stefania Belmondo of Italy said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "They do their job. It is for our own security, our own safety. I
don't resent what they do to us. I understand. Good job, guys!"</TE>

<HD>Stenmark Found Fame, Not Solitude</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alpine skier Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden was never much for public
life.</LD>
<LD>   Stenmark took up skiing, he once said, because, "It was a thing I
could do alone."</LD>
<LD>   According to David Wallechinsky in his "The Complete Book of the
Winter Olympics," Stenmark wrote a school essay when he was 10 on
"How I See My Future." In the essay, Stenmark said he wanted to be a
ski racer. His teacher told him his dream was unrealistic.</LD>
<TE>   Because Stenmark retired in 1989 as the greatest technical skier
in history, apparently that teacher was wrong. He won 86 World Cup
races; only one other skier won half that many.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, despite having suffered a major
concussion only five months earlier on a downhill practice run,
Stenmark was a double gold medalist. He won the slalom and giant
slalom in the same way--coming from behind on the second run. His
concession to the concussion was to skip the downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Stenmark, who turns 46 next month, has lived a quiet life since
his retirement. He splits time between Sweden and Monte Carlo.
According to Stig Strand, an analyst for Swedish television, Stenmark
works for a Japanese clothing company and "skis for fun a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   According to Strand, Stenmark, unmarried, has an 18-year-old
daughter, Natalie, who has spent time in Florida taking tennis
lessons. Along with tennis legend Bjorn Borg, Stenmark is the most
popular athlete in Sweden, according to Strand.</TE>
<TE>   Stenmark has also taken an interest in 19-year-old Anja Paerson,
the 2001 World Cup women's slalom champion, because she comes from
his home town of Tarnaby, 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle.</TE>
<TE>   After she won her World Cup race, Paerson was quoted as saying
that Stenmark talked to her before the final runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the race, I didn't think I could win because I was too
nervous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am lucky to know Stenmark. I have big ears whenever he
speaks to me. I try and remember whatever he says to me, even if it
is just 'Hi, Anja.'"</TE>
<TE>   During the 1978-79 season, Stenmark won 13 World Cup races and had
what is considered to be the best season in the history of ski
racing.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1980 Games, Stenmark, as he always did, skated cautiously
on the first run of the giant slalom and was in third place. In the
second run, Stenmark was more than a second faster than anyone else.
In the slalom, Stenmark was fourth after the first run.</TE>
<TE>   The leader was American Phil Mahre.</TE>
<TE>   But, as he had done in the giant slalom, Stenmark burned the
course, beating everyone else.</TE>

<LD>One day after his brakemen Pavle Jovanovic was suspended from
competition for two years after testing positive for the use of a
banned substance, bobsled driver Todd Hays fired back at
international doping officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I know in my heart that Pavle was guilty of nothing," said Hays,
who had a good chance to win the first U.S. bobsledding medal in 46
years with Jovanovic. "My concern now is the adversity he will face
for the rest of his life."</LD>
<LD>   Before a news conference scheduled to discuss the men's bobsled
chances, Jovanovic passed out a statement by the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency that warned athletes about the unmarked presence of banned
substances in dietary supplements.</LD>
<TE>   Jovanovic then dumped several energy bars and an energy-drink can
on the table in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is available at every corner of the village, all free
of charge, and I find that quite ironic," he said. "These people
[USADA] stand on a soap box and preach integrity, but if somebody
will give them a few dollars, they'll put the stuff on a street
corner."</TE>
<TE>   There is no proof that any of the energy bars displayed by Hays
contain banned substances. But his point is that, because of faulty
labeling, athletes often don't know exactly what is contained in any
of their energy supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "And the IOC and USADA has failed to educate us on this," he said,
fighting back tears. "They said that 25% of all supplements contain
banned substances. But then, they won't tell us what those
supplements are."</TE>
<TE>   While it is uncertain what Jovanovic was ingesting that caused him
to test positive for the banned substance known as
19-norandrosterone, he has acknowledged taking 31 different
supplements in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Hays said that athletes need clearer guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we're safe from," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's it going to stop? I drink water and eat chicken breasts
and salad with no dressing, and that's it. That's all I can eat.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even go to Starbucks anymore because you will test for
too much caffeine."</TE>

<LD>Ervin Leaves Artesia's Girls' Basketball Team</LD>
<LD>   Lauren Ervin, a 6-foot-3 center at Lakewood Artesia, has quit the
girls' basketball team to focus on her academic studies, according to
her mother.</LD>
<LD>   Ervin is one of the top players in the area and one of the top
juniors in the country. Artesia (19-5) ) is ranked fifth in The
Times' top 25.</LD>
<TE>   Artesia Coach Scott Roczey said the parting was mutual, but
indicated academics wasn't the sole reason for Ervin's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Ervin had been disciplined on several occasions, Roczey said,
adding that most of the friction between Ervin and her teammates
centered on class truancy and teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   Her absence from games last week came at the request of Ervin's
mother, Kim, to allow Lauren to concentrate on her studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Her dad and I decided that she's going to concentrate on
academics, take another SAT class and focus on the rest of the year
to get ready for her senior year," Kim Ervin said. "We took her off
the team for her grades and nothing more. If we wanted her to play,
she would be eligible to play right now."</TE>
<TE>   Ervin began her high school career at Torrance Bishop Montgomery,
where she helped the Knights to a Division III state title.</TE>
<TE>   She transferred to Artesia for her sophomore season and the
Pioneers won the Southern Section Division II-A championship.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Ervin said her daughter will attend Artesia for her senior
season and play basketball.</TE>

<TE>   Marquis Reinstated as Keppel's Coach</TE>
<TE>   Richard Marquis, put on leave nearly a month ago while the
Alhambra School District conducted its investigation, has been
reinstated as coach of the Alhambra Keppel girls' basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   "His presence speaks for itself," said Lois Nash, assistant
superintendent of human resources for the school district. "The
investigation is concluded and he's back, and we can't say anything
further."</TE>

<HD>Temecula Valley Rolls, but Coach Isn't Happy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Temecula Valley ripped through the Southern Section Division I dual
meet championships Saturday at Santa Ana College, dominating its four
matches for a 240-33 combined score.</LD>
<LD>   Then Coach Arnold Alpert ripped into opposing coaches who sent
junior varsity teams in order to save varsity wrestlers for
individual championships.</LD>
<LD>   Temecula Valley, which defeated Santa Ana, 40-16, in the
championship match for its first section title since 1999, wrestled
two junior varsity teams in the tournament, winning, 73-0, over
Anaheim Katella in the first round and 76-0 over Covina Northview in
the second round.</LD>
<TE>   It made a mockery of the first two rounds, Alpert said, and
deprived his team a chance at quality competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows a lack of integrity by some coaches sending their JV
teams to a [Southern Section] championship meet," Alpert said. "We
came here ready to win. A team like Northview, they were ready to
lose, that's why they didn't come. They didn't think they could win."</TE>
<TE>   Alpert was upset because a Division I dual meet championship was
supposed to carry more weight this year after section realignment
placed the strongest teams in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Temecula Valley, ranked No. 1 in the Southland by The
Times, didn't square off with the varsity from No. 2 Northview, the
Golden Bears made a statement against full-strength teams from Santa
Ana Calvary Chapel and Santa Ana in the semifinals and finals.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Mendoza provided the spark in the semifinals against
two-time defending state champion Calvary Chapel, winning the first
bout of the match, 13-7, over Mario Estrada, ranked No. 7 in the
state at 119 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Temecula Valley's Morgan Atkinson followed with a 5-2 win over
Patrick Aleksanyan at 125 pounds and the Golden Bears rolled to a
55-17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was important to set the tone," said Mendoza, who had
not previously wrestled against Estrada. "It's important to get the
momentum early, especially against a team like that."</TE>
<TE>   In the final, Temecula Valley won the first six matches and took a
22-0 lead before Fernando Jaimes got Santa Ana on the board with a
7-5 overtime win. Temecula Valley clinched the title after taking a
31-6 lead with four weight classes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert said winning the title wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to practice and prepare day in and day out for these
kind of results," said Alpert. "We happened to get on a roll here,
but it wasn't easy."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Zach Lieberman has solved a 21-year-old mystery while providing
insights into what lengths a particular high school athlete took to
fulfill his aspiration of receiving a college scholarship.</LD>
<LD>   The tale begins in the fall of 1981, when two 6-foot-10 basketball
players suddenly showed up on the Granada Hills Kennedy campus.</LD>
<LD>   They wanted to join a program that had just sent Darren Daye and
Stuart Gray to UCLA and was among the best in the City Section.</LD>
<TE>   Scrutiny was being focused on Lieberman, a flamboyant 5-foot-3
point guard who had transferred to Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   All he cared about was basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never into school at all," he said. "My entire life was
basketball. From the time I was born, I was playing day and night."</TE>
<TE>   As a freshman, Lieberman played at Van Nuys Montclair Prep, then
transferred to Woodland Hills Taft after concluding college scouts
wouldn't come to see him at Montclair Prep.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Jerry, sold their Encino condo and moved to another
condo in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But Lieberman lasted only one year at Taft after disagreements
with Coach John Furlong.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where my career really went down," he said. "Me and
Furlong didn't get along. I was flashy and he didn't want it. I
remember sitting on the bench in summer league and thinking of giving
up playing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm walking out of summer league, and Al Lewis walked up to me.
He said, 'You are the second-best point guard in Los Angeles behind
Ralph Jackson [of Inglewood] and I want to take over your career. The
first thing we have to do is get you out of Taft. You're rotting
there.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, an actor who played the role of Grandpa in the 1960s
television series "The Munsters," was a well-connected basketball
enthusiast. Lieberman said Lewis recommended transferring to Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I needed to go where there's exposure. Even if I sit on
the bench at Kennedy, the scouts will see the back of my head," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who now lives in New York and has run for mayor of the
city, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's father leased a condo in Mission Hills so his son
could transfer to Kennedy, his third school in three years. He played
with the 7-foot Gray, made all-league but wasn't receiving any
scholarship offers.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis got Lieberman an invitation to a prestigious summer camp in
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an unbelievable showing," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   That led to Lieberman signing a letter of intent with the
University of North Carolina Charlotte before his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for someone with a 1.7 grade-point average who admitted
cheating on his first Scholastic Assessment Test by copying the exam
of a student sitting next to him. He flunked the test because he
didn't realize it was not the same test.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the greatest time of my life," he said. "When you're a
high school ballplayer and not much into education and basketball is
your life, you don't think about anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said Lewis approached his father about taking in the two
6-10 players.</TE>
<TE>   "Al says to my dad that he knows [one of the players] got kicked
out of his home and is living in his car with his girlfriend. Do you
want to put him up and have him transfer? My dad said, 'Fine.'</TE>
<TE>   "While we're in Georgia, the Pontiac, Michigan, school district
disbanded sports. [The other player] wanted to pursue playing. Al
said, 'Do you want to have this guy move in?' My dad said, 'Yes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Investigations by the City Section and the school were begun to
determine the eligibility of the Kennedy players.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lieberman, who said at first he didn't deny the players
were living with his family, suddenly changed his story when he
learned the section might rule the players ineligible for not living
with their legal guardians.</TE>
<TE>   But Zach knew the truth, and so did members of the rival Granada
Hills High team.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad got us this huge Cadillac to drive everyone around in,"
Lieberman said. "This Cadillac stalled every time you had to make a
left turn and it was always in front of Granada Hills High. The
basketball players were walking by and they laughed at us. They
knew."</TE>
<TE>   The player from Michigan got homesick and left. The City Section
eventually approved the other player's eligibility after weeks of
discussion and appeals. He received a scholarship to Nevada Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman never made it to Charlotte. He ended up playing at U.S.
International University in San Diego and never graduated. He's 38,
lives in San Diego with his wife and two children and runs a travel
business.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never stolen anything," he said. "I've never been arrested,
never tried coke, never tried a puff of smoke. I don't drink. If the
worst thing I did in my life was get bad grades, what's the big deal?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody wanted to become a basketball player more
than I did. After I stopped playing, it took me about 10 years to go
into a gym because it hurt too much. The smell of it would get me
depressed."</TE>
<TE>   What happened in '81 wasn't an aberration in high school
basketball. It was a peek into the future.</TE>
<TE>   Club coaches have taken over the role of placing athletes at
big-name programs. Manipulating rules, in the name of winning and
getting players college scholarships, is more prevalent than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The all-out pursuit of a college scholarship is used to entice
players to switch schools even though relatively few ever gain the
scholarship they desire.</TE>
<TE>   As for Lieberman, who now volunteers once a week at a homeless
shelter, he said he was only trying to help two high school
basketball players in difficult situations, but he now understands it
wasn't right.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should have did what we did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bending the rules will never totally disappear, but it would be
inspiring to find a championship high school basketball team that
truly plays by them.</TE>

<LD>Pepperdine shares the nation's longest winning streak in Division I
after defeating St. Mary's, 68-57, in a West Coast Conference game
Saturday before 2,916 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (17-6, 10-0 in the WCC) and Western Kentucky have each
won 12 in a row. Xavier had a winning streak ended at 12 games
Saturday in an 80-79 loss to St. Bonaventure, coached by Jan van
Breda Kolff, who resigned as Pepperdine's coach after last season.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Westphal, in his first year as coach of the Waves, is happy
to acknowledge the streak.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to keep it up, but at the same time we're getting some
national attention," Westphal said. "They're talking about us being
somebody who is going to be in the NCAA tournament. When you win 12
in a row and beat the teams we've beaten, you should get that talk."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Boomer Brazzle led Pepperdine with 21 points and eight
rebounds, but it was guard Gary Colbert who came off the bench and
sparked the Waves against St. Mary's (7-16, 2-8), which ended a
22-game WCC losing streak against San Diego last week and defeated
Loyola Marymount on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Colbert scored eight of his 10 points during a nine-minute run in
the first half as Pepperdine turned a 13-7 deficit into a 28-19 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine extended a 31-23 halftime lead to as many as 15 points
in the second half. St. Mary's twice cut the deficit to seven, the
last time with 5:37 to play on two free throws by Anthony Woodards.</TE>

<TE>   San Francisco 80, Loyola Marymount 67--The Lions suffered their

<TE>   Loyola (9-15, 2-8) trailed, 74-47, with six minutes to play before
going on a 17-2 run to cut its deficit to 76-64 with 2:17 remaining.
Andy Osborn led the Lions with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco (12-11, 7-3) lost starting point guard LyRyan

<HD>Memories Recovered From WTC Site</HD>
<DH>Salvage: Jewelry and other personal effects survived the 9/11
attacks. The problem is getting the items to relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARA KUGLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Amid the concrete and steel scooped from the World Trade Center
ruins are bracelets and lockets, watches and wallets, key rings and cell
phones.</LD>
<LD>   Police are beginning the monumental task of returning thousands of
personal items to the grieving families and those who got out alive.</LD>
<LD>   "If we can somehow help to alleviate someone's pain and give them back
a fond memory, we'd love to," said Deputy Inspector Jack Trabitz,
commanding officer of the Police Department's Property Clerk Division.</LD>
<TE>   For four months, the department has been storing and cataloging the
ash-covered belongings. Recently it began returning items that clearly
show a name, such as driver's licenses, credit cards, date books and
jewelry with an inscription.</TE>
<TE>   But the department is still trying to determine the proper way to
return other, less easily identifiable items.</TE>
<TE>   Victims groups say one idea under consideration is a book, similar to
a catalog, that would show photographs of found items. Another
possibility is a showroom where families could look through bins of
personal effects.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to explore everything, whether it's show viewing, whether
it's anything. Those decisions haven't been made yet," Trabitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Salamone, whose husband, John Salamone, worked for the bond
firm Cantor Fitzgerald, said she favors the catalog process because it
seems more organized and less likely to lead to errors and confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Salamone hopes her husband's 18-inch gold chain and crucifix will be
found. She gave it to him 12 years ago, before they married, and he never
took it off.</TE>
<TE>   "For some of us, this is all we have left," said Salamone, whose
husband's body has not been found. "My husband has an empty grave right
now, and he might forever. To get part of his chain back would mean
everything to me."</TE>
<TE>   Officers in the Property Clerk Division will eventually compare items
to the descriptions that families wrote on missing-persons reports.
Personal items with engravings and other identifying markings are most
likely to be traced that way.</TE>
<TE>   Trabitz's division--which usually keeps track of seized drugs, stolen
property, murder weapons and other evidence--recently began sending
letters to families whose identifiable property had been found. The
division has sent about 500 letters; about 100 families have claimed
property.</TE>
<TE>   Personal effects make their way to police in several ways. Some items
are found by authorities at ground zero; others are discovered by FBI
agents sorting through the debris that has been taken to a Staten Island
landfill.</TE>
<TE>   The items are numbered, cataloged and shelved in the basement of
police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Belongings found with remains are sent to the medical examiner, where
they often are used to help identify the victim. Once the victim is
matched and the family is notified, the items are returned.</TE>
<TE>   Detective Ed Galanek, who has worked at the landfill, said the heaps
of personal belongings are constant reminders of all the lives lost.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't dwell on the fact that someone's lost, because you couldn't
do this every day and look at this," Galanek said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the property belongs to people who survived the terrorist
attack but who left behind such things as their wallets and handbags.
They are happy to have their property returned, Trabitz said, but their
reactions cannot compare to those of people whose relatives died.</TE>
<TE>   "That property has even more spectacular and special meaning," he
said, "because it's a link to the past."</TE>

<HD>Scholar: Try Terrorists on Own Terms</HD>
<DH>Religion: He urges an Islamic 'indictment' to show that its tenets
were violated by 'outrageous acts of Sept. 11.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN COOPERMAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Pentagon interns Taliban and Al Qaeda members in Cuba and
the Bush administration considers what to do with them, an eminent
historian of Islam is calling on fellow scholars to help draft an
"Islamic indictment" of those responsible for the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Harvard University professor Roy P. Mottahedeh said he believes that
if Osama bin Laden or other top Al Qaeda members are captured, they
should be prosecuted in an international court for crimes against
humanity. But regardless of whether the trial takes place in an
international forum, a U.S. court or a military tribunal, he said, it
would be wise to present a supplementary legal brief under Islamic law.</LD>
<LD>   Although an Islamic trial is unlikely, Mottahedeh said, "It is very
important to show that the great scholastic tradition of Islamic law, so
carefully elaborated over 14 centuries, was clearly violated in many
specifics by the outrageous acts of Sept. 11."</LD>
<TE>   Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of international law at Harvard who
is backing Mottahedeh's proposal, said they hope the drafting of an
Islamic indictment "will be independently spearheaded by Islamic jurists
and scholars in the United States and abroad" rather than by the U.S.
government.</TE>
<TE>   That way, she said, the indictment will have greater impact on public
opinion, helping to demonstrate to non-Muslims in the United States that
Islam should not be equated with terrorism and to Muslims around the
world that the deliberate targeting of noncombatants is forbidden under
Sharia, or Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   Mottahedeh, a specialist in medieval Islamic history who is not a
Muslim, said he is willing to compile the indictment in collaboration
with Islamic legal experts. "It's not so important who drafts it as who
signs on to it," he said, expressing hope that the document would gain
the imprimatur of leading Islamic jurists around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Several Muslim religious scholars, including the grand mufti of Saudi
Arabia and the sheik of Cairo's Al Azhar mosque, have condemned the Sept.
11 suicide hijackings, which took more than 3,100 lives in New York,
Washington and the Pennsylvania countryside. But "no one has yet pulled
together the particulars" of how the terrorist attacks violated Islamic
law, Mottahedeh said.</TE>
<TE>   Mottahedeh presented the broad outline of such an indictment at a
conference on religion and international conflict recently in Key West,
Fla. Although Sunni and Shiite Muslims may disagree over who has
authority to declare war, there is a centuries-old consensus on the rules
for the conduct of war, Mottahedeh told the conference, sponsored by the
Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center.</TE>
<TE>   The first charge in the indictment, he said, would be that Bin Laden
and his associates violated a prohibition against deliberately harming
innocent civilians. This is based on verse 190 of the second chapter of
the Koran--"Fight in the path of God those who fight you, but do not
transgress limits"--and on various sayings of the prophet Muhammad,
including: "Whenever the Apostle of God sent forth a detachment, he said
to it: 'Do not cheat or commit treachery, nor should you mutilate or kill
children, women or old men.' "</TE>
<TE>   These sayings, or hadith, were interpreted by early Islamic scholars,
including the 8th-century jurist Shaibani and the 11th-century jurist
Sarakhsi, to prohibit unnecessary cruelty and the killing of
noncombatants. Their interpretations are considered highly authoritative
and make clear that "no one fighting in an Islamic cause should ever
directly and intentionally target noncombatants," said John Kelsay, a
professor of religion at Florida State University and the author of a
1993 book, "Islam and War."</TE>
<TE>   Kelsay said he thought Mottahedeh's proposal would be useful,
particularly in educating non-Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The second key charge, he said, might be that Bin Laden exceeded his
authority by issuing religious judgments, including a 1998 fatwa, or
decree, urging Muslims to kill Americans around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Islam, like Judaism and Protestantism, has no central authority
respected by all adherents of the faith. But Bin Laden, who received
little or no formal training in Islamic jurisprudence, has "nowhere near
the degree of learning" expected of those who may issue fatwas, Kelsay
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, because Al Qaeda's excessive and unauthorized use of force
led to U.S. military action in Afghanistan, Kelsay said, a third charge
might say something like: "Through your errors of judgment, you have
brought down the wrath of faraway powers and brought harm on innocent
Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   Khaled Abou el Fadl, a professor of Islamic law at UCLA who also
supports Mottahedeh's proposal, said Bin Laden and his associates could
be charged with violating well-codified provisions of Islamic law
concerning safe passage, or aman in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "When the terrorists entered the United States on visas and when they
got aboard those airplanes, they were asking for aman, and when they
turned around and did harm, they were committing treachery, which is
forbidden," he said.</TE>
<TE>   El Fadl also said there is a crime in Islamic law known as hirabah,
which he defined as "killing by stealth and targeting a defenseless
victim in a way intended to cause terror in society." An important point
for the United States, he noted, is that those who commit hirabah are
considered in the same category as pirates and may be tried in foreign
courts.</TE>
<TE>   A somewhat more speculative charge, Mottahedeh said, would be that Al
Qaeda's leaders violated an injunction against using fire as punishment.
Some contemporary Islamic jurists, he said, have argued that the
prohibition extends to weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsay said Bin Laden's statements indicate that the terrorist leader
is concerned about Islamic legal issues. Among Bin Laden's main
arguments, he said, is that enemies have made such deep inroads into
Muslim lands that a state of emergency exists and normal rules can be
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, Bin Laden argues that enemies are killing Muslim
women and children, justifying similar acts in response.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelsay said he did not think that Islamic jurists would find
either argument very persuasive, because the "state of emergency"
argument quickly leads to anarchy, and the Koran says, "Let not the
hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from
justice"--the Islamic equivalent of "Two wrongs don't make a right."</TE>

<HD>Iowa City Not Home of Anthrax Culture</HD>
<DH>Probe: Confused labeling led to bacteria, which came from Texas,
being called "Ames strain."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOBY WARRICK</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In four months, FBI agents and scientists have unraveled many of
the mysteries surrounding the strain of anthrax used in last fall's
deadly attacks. The "Ames strain" is now known to be highly virulent,
resistant to many vaccines and a perennial favorite of military
researchers and bioterrorists.</LD>
<LD>   But here's one thing the lethal bug is decidedly not: originally from
Ames, Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   New details emerging from the infamous bacterium's murky past suggest
the Ames strain did not come from the Iowa college town of the same name,
or from anywhere else in Iowa. It was a Texas strain, cultured from a
Texas cow, federal officials now say.</LD>
<TE>   How it came to be known internationally as the Ames strain is a story
of confused labeling and mistaken identity in the Defense Department's
two-decade-old quest to find the perfect vaccine to protect troops
against a near-perfect killer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a puzzle," said the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Tom
Bunn, one of several officials of the agency's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service who have been trying to sort out the strain's origins
since it was first linked to the spate of bioterrorism attacks in
Florida, New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Ames strain--one of 89 known genetic varieties of anthrax--was
used in each of the attacks on U.S. Senate offices and Florida and New
York media companies in September and October. To law enforcement
officials, that suggests the attacker had a scientific background and,
quite possibly, access to one of a small group of U.S. military research
labs and contractors known to possess Ames.</TE>
<TE>   The Army acquired the strain in 1981 as part of a national search for
novel types of anthrax to use in testing vaccines. It had no name until
1985, when it was described in a scientific paper by researchers at the
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort
Detrick, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The name "Ames" was chosen because the researchers believed the strain
came from there: The shipping package bore a return address from the
USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, an Ames, Iowa, lab that
diagnoses illnesses in cattle, according to Gregory Knudson, a former
USAMRIID scientist and a co-author of the article that identified the
strain. The label stuck.</TE>
<TE>   But in the weeks after the anthrax attacks, questions emerged about
the strain's origins. The Washington Post filed a request with the USDA
under the Freedom of Information Act asking for details about the
strain's history. After an exhaustive search, USDA officials in Iowa
could find literally nothing: no record of anthrax strains delivered to
the Army, and no reports of anthrax outbreaks among Iowa cattle in the
early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went back and checked, there was no record of a bacterial
culture coming from a cow in Iowa in 1980-81," said Bunn, chief of the
USDA's Diagnostic Bacteriology Laboratory. He added: "If the Army asked
for something we would have given it to them."</TE>
<TE>   A search of long-forgotten Army documents finally resolved the
mystery. The strain, it turns out, had come from Texas, which did
experience anthrax outbreaks around 1980. The bacteria was isolated by
the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostics Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M
University and shipped to USAMRIID in May 1981.</TE>
<TE>   The germs were mailed in a special container, a package identical to
hundreds of others that the USDA supplies to veterinary labs around the
country. The return address on the package: The USDA's Veterinary
Services Center, Ames, Iowa.</TE>

<HD>Artist's Widow Keeps Muse Alive</HD>
<DH>Culture: Soon to be 99, Ben Shahn's wife stays busy putting her own
talents on display.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY WESTFELDT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROOSEVELT, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>In a white shed filled with memories, Bernarda Bryson Shahn is
touching up a painting she started 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "When I finish it, I think I'm going to like it," she says, staring at
the canvas of a woman standing on Rome's Appian Way.</LD>
<LD>   In her spare time, she's doing a little light reading: Hegel's
dialectic, a work she read in college but didn't enjoy. She thought she'd
give it another try.</LD>
<TE>   Shahn, after all, hasn't been to college for nearly 80 years. The
widow of 1930s artist Ben Shahn forged an impressive career of her own:
painting, completing public murals, illustrating books like "Wuthering
Heights."</TE>
<TE>   She turns 99 next month. And after all these years, she's still
curious and active enough to keep creating, even on a canvas she started
decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A retrospective of her work runs through March 8 at the Ben Shahn
Gallery at William Paterson University in Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a sun-filled room surrounded by her work, Shahn offers few
secrets to her longevity.</TE>
<TE>   "I drink wine and eat potatoes," she says with a laugh. She thinks she
has a happy disposition, but "if you think you're going to live a happy
life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Shahn is simply an artist, motivated by the images that pass before
her eyes, and by her imagination. This has been her driving force as long
as she can remember.</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Athens, Ohio, her father would give her colored chalk.
She used it to draw on the walls of her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   At night, she would go to sleep listening to her parents recounting
Homer's "Odyssey." They would recite "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
The exploits she read about were fuel for her drawings.</TE>
<TE>   She tries to explain her passion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that gets hold of you," she says. "If you're not doing
it, you want to be doing it."</TE>
<TE>   After studying painting, printmaking and philosophy at Ohio State
University, Shahn indulged in another passion--writing. She wrote news
articles on the arts for the Ohio State Journal and in the 1940s wrote
and illustrated the children's books "The Zoo of Zeus" and "Gilgamesh."</TE>
<TE>   Her artistry ranged from lithographs portraying the decline of the
American frontier to the sketches illustrating Emily Bronte's "Wuthering
Heights," and portraits of celebrities interviewed in Parade, Fortune and
Scientific American.</TE>
<TE>   She met Ben Shahn in 1932 while interviewing Diego Rivera in New York,
and together they drove across the country. It was during their trip that
he captured images of the Depression and collaborated on two murals, one
of their hometown in Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   The community, named after former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was
one of several New Deal utopias founded by garment workers. It later
became a sort of artists' colony.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed since 1969, Shahn lives today with her granddaughter, Amanda,
also an artist, in the home she and her husband purchased. Their son,
Jonathan, a sculptor, lives next door.</TE>
<TE>   Shahn is completely engaged in the world, eager to talk politics and
art. She spends her days reading and working in the studio behind her
home.</TE>
<TE>   She walks without use of a cane. Little betrays her age, aside from a
hearing aid and an extraordinarily well-lined face.</TE>
<TE>   Her work is still informed mostly by people's day-to-day lives and
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been aware of how people are living," she says, leaning
forward in her chair. "What are people being eaten up by?"</TE>
<TE>   Besides the "unfinished" canvas of the woman in Rome, several drawings
line the walls of her studio: politicians testifying during the Watergate
hearings. Their hands cover their mouths. She plans to add former
President Richard M. Nixon to complete the work.</TE>
<TE>   At least 60 of Shahn's works are on display at William Paterson. The
art spans about 80 years and includes early etchings from the Depression
and illustrations from her books.</TE>
<TE>   Also included is a favorite of Nancy Einreinhofer, director of Shahn
Gallery. "Passage" is a portrait of a female figure cloaked in a sheet,
moving through a landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's somewhat anonymous, but moving forward," Einreinhofer said.</TE>
<TE>   She believes it is Shahn's self-portrait.</TE>

<HD>Will Institution of Marriage Continue? It's Debatable</HD>
<DH>Trends: The viability of the union in the 21st century often
depends on which side of the research aisle you're on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CRARY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the era of "Temptation Island" and "Sex and the City," the
prime-time Valentine's Day offering on PBS seems almost anachronistic: an
earnest documentary examining the status of marriage in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   But for a loose alliance called the Marriage Movement, the program
represents a victory of sorts.</LD>
<LD>   Formed two years ago to bridge the left-right divide over family
issues, the coalition of scholars, clergy, family counselors and others
tries to promote strong marriages and reduce a U.S. divorce rate
estimated at 40%. Step one is getting people to take marriage seriously.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to get a good conversation going with the broader society,"
said Don Browning, a University of Chicago Divinity School professor who
helped found the Marriage Movement and create the PBS documentary
"Marriage--Just a Piece of Paper?"</TE>
<TE>   "Marriage developed in the West as a public institution, nourished by
religious and cultural traditions," he said. "We may be in the process of
dismantling it, and before we do, we ought to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   But what, exactly, should we think? Although polls show most Americans
aspire to a lasting, loving marriage, the topic is often divisive, and
pivotal questions lack simple answers.</TE>
<TE>   Have no-fault laws made divorce too easy? If there is a marriage
crisis, will it correct itself, or are new policies needed? Can
government promote marriage without discriminating against unmarrieds?</TE>
<TE>   Several state legislatures recently have ventured into marriage
policy, testing initiatives that might reduce divorce without triggering
an ideological backlash.</TE>
<TE>   Florida requires marriage education courses in high school. Louisiana,
Arkansas and Arizona approved "covenant marriages" in which couples
voluntarily limit their ability to divorce. Arizona provides state funds
to help couples attend privately run marriage-skills workshops.</TE>
<TE>   Staffan and Jane Berg signed up for one. Both 47, they have been
married for nearly 20 years and run a flower shop in Tempe, Ariz. They
attended three two-hour sessions on marital communication skills offered
by FranklinCovey, a company better-known for workplace training programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been keen on tuning up our marriage," said Staffan Berg.
"I don't think anybody can do something for so long without having some
continuing education. It helps to hear about the experiences of others."</TE>
<TE>   Berg, a native of Sweden, says the flower business gives him insight
into American romance.</TE>
<TE>   "People are keen on sending a lot of flowers before they get married,
and then after marriage they don't send anything," he said. "It's no
wonder marriages don't last if people don't make the same effort
afterward as before."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the Arizona workshops are run by the Lutheran Social
Ministry, which made a pitch at a recent bridal show.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are looking for their wedding dress and their caterer,
it's easy to let relationship work take the back burner," said the
ministry's program director, Traci Gruenberger. "It's amazing that people
come in [to the workshops] and haven't talked about finances or whether
they want to have children."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most ambitious state program is in Oklahoma, where Gov.
Frank Keating wants to use millions of welfare dollars in a multi-pronged
effort to reduce the high divorce rate. David Fournier, a professor of
family science at Oklahoma State University, has doubts about the
initiative's staying power.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have speakers come in and be eloquent and fire people up, but
when they leave, what's left?" Fournier asked. "Where are those resources
going to come from?"</TE>
<TE>   The recent torrent of federal census data has provided ammunition for
almost every viewpoint in the marriage debate.</TE>
<TE>   Those who celebrate a diversity of family structures welcomed the
increases in all major types of nontraditional households--single
parents, nonmarried heterosexual couples, same-sex couples.</TE>
<TE>   For many in this pro-diversity camp, the nuclear family archetype that
dominated post-World War II pop culture was never as wonderful, or
entrenched, as it seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have this false nostalgia for something in the '50s that
just wasn't there," said Andrea Engber of Midland, N.C., founder of the
National Organization of Single Mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Those who believe American society should promote the Mom-Dad-and-kids
nuclear family above other forms also were encouraged--cautiously. They
say the trends that most alarmed them have subsided, and hope the nation
is ready to reembrace the ideals of traditional marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to say we've turned the corner, but there is at least
the possibility," said David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute of
American Values. "For about 30 years, we had a continuing deterioration
of the married-couple, two-parent home, but that deterioration seems to
have stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Compared with 40 years ago, some of the recent census figures on
marriage are striking.</TE>
<TE>   Married couples with children under 18--the classic nuclear
family--now make up 23.5% of all households, compared with 45% in 1960.
The percentage of single-person households nearly doubled to 25.5% during
that span; unmarried-couple households jumped from 0.8% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   But Blankenhorn--whose private, nonpartisan institute promotes "the
renewal of marriage and family life"--is heartened by several trends:
fewer teen pregnancies, a higher percentage of black children living in
two-parent homes, a modest drop in the divorce rate that exploded in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, many people said there was nothing to be done about
the weakening of the family, that we can't roll back the clock to Ozzie
and Harriet," he said. "That thesis has been empirically disproved."</TE>
<TE>   Blankenhorn and others in the Marriage Movement engage in a running
debate with groups like the New York-based Council on Contemporary
Families, which encourages evenhanded support for all family forms.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Coontz, who chairs the council and teaches history at
Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., said the nuclear family--even
by other names--wasn't a preoccupation during most of American history.</TE>
<TE>   "You weren't supposed to spend all your time with your children and
spouse," she said. "This was a new value in the 1950s. It became
publicized by the sitcoms, it was subsidized by the government through
the G.I. Bill, it took over for about 20 years, then it started to fade
and everybody said the traditional family is dying."</TE>
<TE>   Coontz believes the American family is in a period of irreversible
transition, and hopes the result is a national consensus that both old
and new family structures can succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to promote good marriages," she said. "But do you want
to promote marginal marriages?"</TE>
<TE>   The scriptwriter for "Marriage--Just a Piece of Paper?"--Barbara Dafoe
Whitehead--said marriage has had a roller-coaster history and may now be
on the upswing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time in the '70s when many people did think marriage was
bankrupt, but you don't hear that as much now," she said. "Generation
Xers are frightened by the possibility of divorce--they've seen too much
of it, and they want to make marriage work."</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead, co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers
University, favors modest, noncoercive measures to strengthen marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The institution will stay with us, she said, partly because it has an
enduring mystery about it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really know very much about why people choose to marry, or
what the ingredients are in marriages that survive all the usual bumps on
the road," she said. "It can't be reduced to a bundle of skills."</TE>

<HD>Wyoming Seeks Share of Olympic Gold</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Officials say although Utah is hosting the Games, their
own tourist sites are only a hop, skip and jump away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELISABETH A. WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>With the Winter Olympics just next door, businesses in southwestern
Wyoming are working to see that some of the gold and silver spills across
the border.</LD>
<LD>   The state has spent five years planning for the Olympics, which began
Friday and run through Feb. 24. It budgeted $300,000 this year on
promotions during the games and plans to join cities and ski resorts in
hosting information centers for tourists and journalists at Olympic event
sites in Salt Lake City and Park City, 150 miles southwest of here.</LD>
<LD>   In the short term, Evanston is expected to attract the most immediate
tourism attention because it is the last stop in Wyoming for travelers
heading west on Interstate 80 to the Olympics. It is about 50 miles from
Park City.</LD>
<TE>   Evanston has budgeted $250,000 to promote itself, including setting up
an information center in Park City and hosting fireworks displays and
ice- and wood-carving competitions in Evanston. Those in Evanston also
will be able to watch Olympic competition on a big-screen television at
the town square.</TE>
<TE>   City officials are pitching the town as a 70-minute drive from Salt
Lake City with less traffic and lighter crowds. And a week before the
games began, there still was plenty of room in town to stay the
night--about 20% vacancy at the hotels, said Rick Lunsford, the city's
Olympic coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Evanston has developed an image as a haven where people can come to
enjoy outdoor sports, Lunsford said. Evanston has been home to the
Jamaican bobsled team and has hosted several national bike races, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic wrestling champion Rulon Gardner, an Afton native, planned to
be in Evanston to meet the public Saturday, followed by the Jamaican
bobsled team a day later.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Evanston, Linda Hetzel, owner of Main Street Artisans,
said she is not banking on a surge in business. Still, she plans to
extend the hours of her cafe to accommodate anyone who might want an
espresso chocolate-chip muffin and possibly buy some local or regional
art.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't decided what I'm expecting," she said. "Even if nobody
comes I think we'll have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson Hole Mountain Resort hopes to lure business from Utahans who
want to escape the Olympics onslaught. The resort is offering family
vacation packages and has spent thousands of dollars on direct mailings
and advertising in newspapers and radio stations in Utah to promote the
relative tranquillity of Jackson during the games.</TE>
<TE>   The resort also plans to try to attract the attention of some of the
more than 9,000 accredited journalists expected to attend the games. The
resort plans to offer day and overnight trips to Jackson for any
journalist who has time for a side excursion from the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "The Northern Rockies are not very well known internationally. People
have heard of Colorado and California and nothing much in between, so I
think it's going to be very good in terms of recognition," said resort
spokeswoman Anna Olson.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the benefits to the state from the Olympics will probably
be realized five to seven years from now, said Laurie Green, director of
travel and tourism for the Wyoming Business Council. That will be when
people start planning another western vacation--and remember that they
enjoyed Wyoming.</TE>

<HD>At 110, She's Still a Model Citizen</HD>
<DH>Culture: Five years ago, Consuelo Moreno attained naturalized
status in the U.S., and she's only added to her legacy ever since.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONJA BARISIC</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Consuelo Moreno likes her daily routine.</LD>
<LD>   She reads her Bible, plays with Pepe, her daughter's Chihuahua, has an
afternoon nap and takes a nip of Southern Comfort bourbon.</LD>
<LD>   But Jan. 31 was anything but routine for one of the country's oldest
naturalized citizens. It was "Consuelo Moreno Day," as proclaimed by the
mayor the day Moreno turned 110.</LD>
<TE>   She was celebrated with the performance of an 86-year-old flamenco
dancer and surrounded by several generations of family members at a party
in her honor at Sentara Nursing Center-Virginia Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Family is one reason Moreno finally decided to become a U.S. citizen
five years ago. She had immigrated to Virginia from Tangier, Morocco, in
1964. Her two surviving children, two grandchildren, three
great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild were either born here or
had become naturalized Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "She would say, 'Oh, you're American, I want to be American too,' "
said her 79-year-old daughter, Maria Sanchez. "She wanted to be like her
children, you know."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno is one of the oldest people to become a U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rarity. It's definitely very special for her and for us also,"
said Ernestine Fobbs of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno was born to Spanish parents in Tangier in 1892. Her father
drowned when she was 15, and she helped support her family by becoming a
seamstress. She kept sewing, mostly for spending money, after she got
married.</TE>
<TE>   "She always spent the money on us," Sanchez said. "She would buy
things for her children."</TE>
<TE>   Her son moved from Tangier to Washington, D.C., in the late 1950s, and
Moreno and Sanchez left Morocco for Virginia Beach soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno lived with Sanchez until 1994, when she moved into the nursing
center. Sanchez visits every day, and is sure to bring Pepe along. "It
makes her smile and makes her happy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno was widowed at 52 and has outlived five of her seven children,
including a daughter who died three months after birth and a 10-year-old
son who died from typhoid fever.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very good mother," Sanchez said. "When somebody a long time
ago asked her why she didn't get [remarried], she said, 'Why should I? I
have my children.' "</TE>

<HD>Putting a New Face on Deformities</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A surgeon's pioneering technique of bone grafting means a
more normal life for thousands born with cranial disfigurements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURAN NEERGAARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>To cure a severe birth defect that left Alyssa Parente with a
sunken nose and hugely bulging eyes, Dr. John Polley sliced apart all the
bones of her face--but didn't rejoin them before sewing her up.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, 10-year-old Alyssa got a promising alternative to grueling
bone grafts: Polley attached a pulley-like contraption to her facial
bones that her parents tightened each day with a screwdriver, slowly
pulling out the sunken bones so they could grow into the right position.</LD>
<LD>   Two months later, Alyssa had a normal face.</LD>
<TE>   "We're letting the body do its own bone-grafting," explains Polley,
who pioneered the technique with a colleague at Chicago's Rush
Craniofacial Center.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,000 children a year are born with severe craniofacial defects
such as Apert's syndrome, which struck Alyssa, and similar disorders.
Their bones fuse together abnormally so the head and face can't grow,
leaving sunken faces and misaligned jaws. It's not just a problem of
appearance. Often, the malformed head disrupts eating, breathing, hearing
and vision.</TE>
<TE>   Standard reconstruction involves multiple surgeries to cut apart most
of the facial bones, move them up, down or forward, and then hold them in
the new spot with grafts from hip or rib bones. Some children have such
little bone to work with that they can't complete such surgery until
they're teenagers. And if the graft is poorly placed, it can't be moved.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Polley's alternative. It sounds traumatic. After all, Alyssa ran
around for weeks last summer with all the bones in her face broken.</TE>
<TE>   "It freaks you out to think we are moving her face," her mother,
Eileen Parente of Frankfort, Ill., said of learning to tighten the
screws. "But it was something we shouldn't have even worried about. She
didn't flinch."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Polley's experience with a few dozen patients suggests this
so-called "rigid external distraction" can be easier than standard
surgery, is done at younger ages, and lets the doctor gently push and
pull until the child's face looks just right.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure is still experimental, cautions Dr. Harold Slavkin of
USC, the National Institutes of Health's former chief of dental and
craniofacial research. But it has "enormous promise," he says--so much
that some scientists are studying how to pair this grow-your-own-new-bone
method with genetically engineered drugs to make that bone grow faster.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons have long lengthened leg bones by breaking them, pulling them
apart and letting the body grow new bone--just as it would if you'd
naturally broken your leg. Several years ago, a New York physician
adapted that technique, called distraction osteogenesis, to fix malformed
jaws.</TE>
<TE>   If it worked on single bones, Polley reasoned, why not for children's
entire faces?</TE>
<TE>   First, Polley operates to cut all the stunted, sunken facial bones,
but he doesn't move them. Instead, he attaches wires to the skull or
certain other bones. Those wires screw into to a halo-like device,
designed with Rush dentist Alvaro Figueroa, worn in front of the face.</TE>
<TE>   With a turn of a screwdriver twice a day, parents tighten the wires.
That tightening moves the pieces of bone forward a millimeter a day. As
that happens, the body manufactures new bone to fill the gap. Over six
weeks, facial bones can be extended as much as the length of a paper
clip.</TE>
<TE>   Is this new bone as strong as traditional grafting? Polley doesn't
have long-term data yet proving the children will never need additional
surgery. But the technique already is widely used for easier cleft palate
repair, and Polley says only 5% of those patients relapse, fewer than
with traditional surgical cleft repair.</TE>
<TE>   For Alyssa, who had undergone numerous surgeries since birth to fix
her deformed skull, Polley's method made the final steps far easier, her
mother says.</TE>
<TE>   She knew it was a success when a friend with Apert's looked at Alyssa
and exclaimed: "How did you get to look like everybody else?"</TE>

<HD>Wolves at Cattle Ranchers' Door</HD>
<DH>Oregon: Conservation efforts in other states have sent pack
populations soaring--and spreading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMALIE YOUNG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>La GRANDE, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Four generations of Sharon Beck's family have braved the bitter
winds in this valley ringed by the Blue Mountains, driving out coyotes
and bears, and making the range safe for their livestock.</LD>
<LD>   Now Beck sees a new threat to her land--one she and other ranchers
thought was wiped out in the 1930s: wild wolves.</LD>
<LD>   It's only a matter of time before the gray wolves stray into Oregon
from the wilderness of central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, where
they have flourished since the federal government reintroduced them in
the mid-1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Their likely migration into Oregon has ignited an emotional debate
between those who welcome the return of the endangered wolves and those
who fear it will destroy their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   "Environmentalists say, 'What's a calf or two? You can spare that!' "
Beck said. "We're not raising beef for wolves. We're raising it for
profit."</TE>
<TE>   The root of the problem, both sides agree, is return of the wolves
would open a long-simmering dispute over ranchers' use of public lands to
graze their livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers want the right to kill wolves that may prey on livestock
feeding on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   But conservationists say cattle already damage fish and wildlife
habitat, and public lands should be reassessed to determine which areas
are more suitable to wolves than cattle. "Fifty to 60% of Oregon's land
is prime wolf habitat," said Brooks Fahy, executive director of the
Eugene-based Predator Defense Institute. "Unfortunately, it's a very
delicate ecosystem that has essentially been trampled. . . . The West is
being treated like it was a giant feedlot."</TE>
<TE>   Beck is collecting ammunition of her own as she prepares to defend her
land and livestock.</TE>
<TE>   The conservationists' agenda, she says, has little to do with
protecting wildlands and wildlife. She says they are trying to kick
ranchers off public land and passively reintroduce wolves into Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolves and livestock can't coexist--period," said Beck, a past
president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Assn. "Their agenda is to get us off
the public lands."</TE>
<TE>   Fahy doesn't deny that.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not see any gray areas," he said. "We want livestock off of
public lands."</TE>
<TE>   Beck won't say how many head of cattle her family runs or how many
acres--private or public--they use. That's considered a rude question in
cattle country.</TE>
<TE>   "We have enough land and livestock to keep us busy and make a living
for our families," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The conservation group Defenders of Wildlife compensates ranchers for
lost livestock to wolves, and has paid out more than $206,000 to 180
ranchers since 1987. None of that money has gone to Oregon ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the day there will be some wolf claims in Oregon," said
Suzanne Laverty, northwest regional representative for the group. "That
will mean there are wolves in Oregon . . . and they belong there."</TE>
<TE>   But Beck argues it is difficult if not impossible to collect on the
indemnities offered by conservationists for livestock killed by wolves
because carcasses and other evidence is required. Wolves can devour
smaller animals, such as sheep, leaving few remains that may not be found
for weeks after a kill, she said.</TE>
<TE>   And once the wolves begin to thrive in Oregon, she argues, the
conservationists' offers of money will disappear. "They'll compensate you
until they get the wolves established--then the heck with that," she
predicts.</TE>
<TE>   Laverty acknowledged that Defenders of Wildlife has only committed to
offering compensations as long as the wolves are under federal
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The gray wolf has been protected as an endangered species since 1973,
meaning they can't be killed except under special circumstances. Killing
one is a federal crime carrying a maximum penalty of $100,000 and one
year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only three wild wolves are known to have wandered into Oregon.
In October, a wild wolf was found illegally shot in the Blue Mountains.
It did not wear a radio collar, and an examination of its stomach
contents showed it had not devoured any livestock.</TE>
<TE>   It was shot in the same area where two collared wolves were found the
previous summer. One was killed by a car; the other was captured and
returned to Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 unconfirmed wolf sightings were reported to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service in Bend, Ore., last year. Nearly a quarter are
considered valid sightings, agency biologist Jerry Cordova said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year that goes by, the chances of having animals in Oregon
increases because the packs in Idaho are increasing," he said. "Idaho is
basically taken--it's fully occupied by wolves."</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Department has asked federal wildlife
officials to deport any wolves that come into Oregon. The federal agency
removed the collared wolf, known as "B-45," but said it has no plans to
capture other wolves discovered in Oregon unless they attack wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Maturing wolves naturally break off from their packs to find new
territories. The central Idaho wolves have found a travel corridor that
could make Oregon the first state they colonize outside their designated
recovery zones in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Wild wolves could follow the scent trail left by those early
explorers, head for the forests and high deserts of eastern Oregon, and
move into the Cascade Range.</TE>
<TE>   If given the chance, they would thrive in the Eagle Cap Wilderness,
the John Day Wilderness or the Umatilla National Forest and other
unclaimed territory, filling a long-vacant predator gap in those
ecosystems, conservationists say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cascade Range is prime deer and elk territory--and therefore
prime wolf territory," Fahy said. "When these predators are back within
the system, the prey species are more robust, more genetically diverse."</TE>
<TE>   In Yellowstone, coyote populations ballooned after wolves were removed
but have been quickly returned to a balance since the federal
reintroduction program began, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists contend the cattle industry isn't really at risk
because wolves naturally hunt deer and elk, not cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Wolves are native to Oregon. Early ranchers and farmers put a bounty
on them and poisoned, shot and trapped them until they were mostly
exterminated by the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   In Idaho, where the animals are listed as an experimental population,
federal officials can issue permits to ranchers to kill wolves that stray
onto their property--if the animals have been preying on their livestock.
Ranchers have the right to shoot any wolf caught in the act of attacking
livestock on private land.</TE>
<TE>   Once the wolves wander into Oregon, where they are regarded as
endangered, ranchers complain they can't protect their livestock against
them. "It's like turning the terrorists loose from a prison in Idaho,"
said Mack Birkmaier, 71, a rancher. "If he swims the river into Oregon,
he's free to attack us."</TE>
<TE>   The answer, ranchers say, is to down-list wild wolves--moving them
from endangered to threatened--so they could be shot if seen attacking
livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife may decide this spring to give states such as Oregon
and Washington, which neighbor growing wolf populations in Idaho and
Canada, the authority to allow wolves to be shot.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the agency is moving toward down-listing the wolves
completely.</TE>
<TE>   The agency found 30 breeding pairs in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in
2000 and 35 pairs last year, when the total population was up to 570. If
there are 30 breeding pairs again this year, the agency will begin
removing the wolf from the Endangered Species List in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Even if federal protection is dropped, Oregon can keep its own, or
could allow ranchers to hunt them out of the state, Cordova said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a wolf problem now, but as time goes on, we will," he
said. "We need to be proactive now."</TE>
<TE>   Down-listing or de-listing wolves in Oregon isn't a black-and-white
issue and should be carefully discussed, said Bill Marlett of the
Bend-based Oregon Natural Desert Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not transplanting wolves but accommodating their expansion as
it occurs over time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beck is convinced there is more to the story. "There is conflict and
we don't even have them here," she wrote in the Portland Oregonian. "The
conflict comes from our complete understanding of their transparent
agenda to transplant endangered wolves into Oregon and our understanding
that [the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] will be doing absolutely
nothing about it except celebrating."</TE>

<HD>Wolf Watchers Pack Park at Yellowstone</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Gray wolves have made a remarkable comeback thanks to a
reintroduction program. Some visitors come just to see them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>Cliff Browne huddles against the cold air, his camera pointed
toward two distant dots on a hazy horizon. Daylight has broken, and the
gray wolves are showing themselves.</LD>
<LD>   His voice fills with excitement as he begins counting them, but rises
to little more than a whisper as he angles his head for a better view. "I
love it!" he says. "I love it!"</LD>
<LD>   Several wolves run across the snowy landscape before disappearing into
the trees. Another takes it slow, plopping down in the powder. One howls.</LD>
<TE>   On the northeast corner of the nation's first national park, patient
wildlife enthusiasts such as Browne have a front-row seat to watch the
gray wolves' sometimes controversial return to Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf watchers spend hours to catch a glimpse of the animals. Some,
like Browne, are here almost every day during winter, when their luck is
generally good. Some wolves are black, helping them stand out against the
snow. Elk fill the river bottom land near the road, providing at least
the hope of a meal for wolf packs.</TE>
<TE>   Some days are better than others, said Browne, of Cooke City, Mont.,
who has made a living selling the images of wolves he captures on film.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to put hours in. And sometimes, you might be here all day
long and never see anything," he said. "Sometimes, you think, 'What a
wasted day.' But that's part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   People come to Yellowstone expecting to see wildlife. But only in
recent years has the public had any real chance of seeing gray wolves in
their natural setting.</TE>
<TE>   Once eradicated from the park, the wolves were brought back under a
contentious reintroduction program that began in 1995. They now number
more than 130 within the park, and more than 570 in Montana, Wyoming and
Idaho. Nearly 90%--including those in the park--can be traced directly to
the reintroduction program.</TE>
<TE>   But their return has not been without critics. Ranchers blame wolves
for livestock losses and occasional attacks on domestic pets.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of Wildlife, which compensates ranchers for livestock lost
to wolves, has paid out more than $206,000 to 180 ranchers since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Smith, who heads the park's wolf project, said those who care
about the wolves see something special in the animals, something worth
braving cold mountain winters to witness.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolves are considered now to be the symbol of wildness," he said.
"There's kind of magic in their eyes. There's some kind of mysteriousness
that people find alluring and worthy of protection."</TE>
<TE>   Researcher Rick McIntyre is so taken with the wolves that he spends
days off from his seasonal work with Yellowstone's wolf program to watch
them.</TE>
<TE>   He notes such things as their interactions and movements, and speaks
of observed playfulness or a recent elk kill. He sometimes uses a
hand-held radio to communicate with other wolf watchers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much fascinating behavior you can see here," McIntyre
said. "In the rest of the world, it's very, very difficult to see a wolf.
Here, there are times when they're visible almost all day long."</TE>
<TE>   The Lamar Valley region is home to several wolf packs, said Ed Bangs,
wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Their movements can be unpredictable. One of the Yellowstone packs,
known as the Nez Perce pack, left the park last year and traveled as far
as eastern Idaho. It killed a dog and got into a fight with another wolf
pack before returning to Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   For many, wolf-watching is a matter of chance. For others, it's a
family hobby. Sally and Larry Miller of Great Falls, Mont., try to come
to the park a few times each year.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," Sally Miller said, "[wolves] bring back the balance of nature
that's been missing for so long from the park."</TE>

<HD>Jaguar Spotted Laying Tracks in Southern Arizona's Desert</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Big cat is caught on camera near the Mexico border,
raising hopes the breed can flourish in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>A jaguar was photographed by a motion-activated camera set out in
southern Arizona to monitor potential jaguar corridors near the
U.S.-Mexico border.</LD>
<LD>   The photo, which was shot in early December, gave state game officials
new evidence that jaguars, the biggest cats in the Western Hemisphere,
visit the southern part of the state and may even live there.</LD>
<LD>   "It is great to know that jaguars are roaming our borderlands, at
least occasionally," said Brad Van Pelt of the Arizona Game and Fish
Department. "We will continue to monitor the area to see if the animal is
a transient or attempting to establish a territory."</LD>
<TE>   Jaguars were last documented in Arizona in 1996 in the Baboquivari
Mountains west of Tucson and in the Peloncillo Mountains along the New
Mexico state line near San Simon, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists believe the two 1996 photos and the one shot in December
captured three separate cats.</TE>
<TE>   The game department isn't revealing the location of the latest
sighting to protect the big cat, which is a young male weighing around
175 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   A team of biologists hopes more photos will help pinpoint the jaguar's
location. Officials would like to capture one, attach a collar with a
radio transmitter, then return it to the wild and monitor its movements.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona is believed to be at the northern end of the jaguar's historic
range, which once covered nearly all of Latin America. The closest known
population to Arizona now is 135 miles south of Tucson, deep in the
Sierra Madre of Mexico, according to game officials.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups that want to see the jaguar repopulate the U.S.
Southwest were delighted by the new photographic evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that jaguars are still making it as individuals back to
their old habitat means there's hope for eventual recovery," said Michael
Robinson of the Center for Biological Diversity's office in Silver City,
N.M.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said his group's first priority is to stabilize the remaining
jaguar populations in Mexico--which are threatened by habitat loss--and
assess what land on both sides of the border is suitable for jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not pushing reintroduction at this time," Robinson said, "but
everything should be on the table."</TE>

<HD>Results Positive for Science Unit</HD>
<DH>Education: Free program for S.F. grade-school students is serving
as a prototype for other U.S. cities.</DH>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Bertha Medina was determined to make her fan work. First she
checked the motor. Then she spotted the problem. After a quick snip of a
flower pasted too close to the blades, she smiled as fresh air blew on
her face.</LD>
<LD>   Her science project was up and running.</LD>
<LD>   The 9-year-old is one of many students who gather after school in San
Francisco's largely Latino Mission District to experiment with physics,
chemistry, biology and engineering. The free program started 10 years ago
in a San Francisco garage and will soon go nationwide thanks to a
$3-million grant from the National Science Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   "It broadens their worlds," said founder Dan Sudran, 57. "I always
tell them, 'Whether you end up working in science or not, it just makes
you see life in a bigger picture.' "</TE>
<TE>Simplifying Tools of the Trade</TE>
<TE>   The students at the lab don't wear goggles, aprons or gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Their projects include modeling bones out of clay and caring for
reptiles and fish. Finished and unfinished projects litter the space,
while motors and batteries decorate the walls.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend told me she came here and she told me it was great, so I
decided to come and see if I liked it, and I do," said Xiomara Beltran,
10.</TE>
<TE>   With help from San Francisco State University, the programs now
operate at 10 sites in Los Angeles, Fresno, Oakland, San Jose and
Watsonville.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Paul Fonteyn, vice president of the university's Office of
Research and Sponsored Programs, helped the program grab the interest of
the Smithsonian Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Fonteyn later co-authored a grant request, and is looking forward to
the program expanding to 15 sites nationwide, including Miami, Houston,
New Orleans, Detroit, Seattle and New York.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., Mario Castellanos of the Smithsonian will use the
San Francisco model to begin a workshop at the Latin America Youth
Center. Castellanos said the best part of the program is that it allows
students to get their hands on projects without having to memorize
theories first.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Department of Education survey in 1998, the most recent
figures available, about 15% of minority students--blacks, Latinos and
American Indians--received scientific degrees.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco State biology professor Leticia Marquez-Magana said she
hopes such after-school programs will encourage more women, who
traditionally have shied away from science, to be drawn to science-and
engineering-related careers.</TE>
<TE>Setting a Good Example</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing is that they provide appropriate role models since the
founders are minority scientists themselves," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But science aside, just ask anyone at the after-school program in the
Mission District, and they'll tell you it's fun.</TE>
<TE>   Xiomara's favorite project was a Halloween mask. It included
partnering up and smearing petroleum jelly all over each other's faces.
Strips of wet bandages were then added.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to sit still for a couple of minutes, and you feel it harden
on your face," she said. "The best part was that you got to paint it."</TE>

<HD>Utah Gun Packers Don't Leave Home Without It</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>When Vice President Dick Cheney came to town last summer, a lot of
people didn't see any reason to leave their guns at home. If something
happened, wouldn't the vice president be better off with a roomful of
law-abiding armed Utahans there to help?</LD>
<LD>   The Secret Service had another view--no guns, no exceptions--and state
Atty. Gen. Mark Shurtleff ended the argument by putting locked storage
boxes outside the convention hall where Cheney was speaking. That way,
holders of concealed-gun permits could leave the room when Cheney
arrived, stow their guns and fetch them when the vice president departed.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the Olympics here, many gun owners tried to argue that
similar "safe storage" facilities should be provided at the venues. In a
state where permit holders can legally take their guns into state
offices, bars, elementary schools, day-care centers, the state Capitol
and churches, many see no reason not to provide gun owners with a place
to stow their weapons while attending Olympic events.</LD>
<TE>   State gun organizations lost that fight too, but are moving toward a
showdown at the University of Utah, where President J. Bernard Machen has
defied a recent state attorney general opinion that would allow teachers
and students to carry guns on campus for the first time in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Utah Senate's state and local affairs committee held
hearings on a bill that would allow the Legislature to withhold half the
salaries of officials who violate state laws--a pointed, if indirect,
reference to Machen and other college administrators believed to be
defying the Legislature's will on gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "Classrooms, libraries, dormitories and cafeterias are no place for
lethal weapons," Machen told a legislative committee in January. "Their
very presence would interfere with the essential functions of a
university."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other state colleges, along with Brigham Young University,
run by the Mormon church, also prohibit guns on campus, but Machen has
gone out front in the debate, declaring he's willing to go to court to
keep guns out of the university. The university's gun ban applies to
students and teachers, but not to visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "I hold out some hope that we could be found to be not in defiance of
the law," Machen said in an interview at his office near the Olympic
Village, where thousands of athletes and coaches are residing during the
Games. "But our view is that having guns around would challenge the very
nature of dialogue on campus, where the passionate defense of ideas is
sort of the hallmark of what we're all about."</TE>
<TE>   Those arguing in favor of upholding the law, which lets holders of
concealed-weapon permits carry guns nearly anywhere, say university
leaders miss the point when they frame the issue around free academic
debate.</TE>
<TE>   What they should be considering is the safety of teachers and students
who often walk to their cars late at night, who feel safer with a gun to
defend themselves, said Janalee Tobias, president of Women Against Gun
Control.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, with the Olympics, there's chain-link fences up everywhere
and helicopters hovering overhead and soldiers running around with guns.
I think you're pretty safe right now," Tobias said. "But what about
later? They actually think they can wave this magic wand and crime will
just magically disappear. I have a question for Bernie Machen: Why are
there so many emergency phone booths up there if the University of Utah
is such a safe place?"</TE>
<TE>   Utah ranks 12th lowest in the nation in violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Boyden, a third-year law student who helped organize the College
of Law Gun Rights Advocates, said students long felt the university's ban
on guns was illegal under Utah law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a two-edged sword. From his [the university president]
perspective, he thinks if professors or students knew there were students
who were concealing firearms, they might not be at liberty to speak
freely. But the Catch-22 is, those students who carry may feel like they
can't speak freely if you take away the power to defend themselves,"
Boyden said.</TE>
<TE>   Until the mid-1990s, Utah had fewer than 1,000 citizens with
concealed-weapon permits. Then, like many other states, Utah changed its
laws in 1995 to qualify most law-abiding citizens for a permit. Now,
about 42,000 state residents, or 3% of the adult population, are licensed
to carry concealed firearms. They cannot carry guns in secured areas such
as airports, courthouses and jails.</TE>
<TE>   They are subject to background checks, fingerprinting, training
requirements and regular law enforcement checks. Permits are declined for
those who have been convicted of drunken driving, domestic abuse, sexual
abuse, felonies or violent misdemeanors, as well as those who have been
judged mentally incompetent.</TE>
<TE>   With all those protections, gun advocates say, it's up to the state to
come up with a reason why citizens with permits should not be allowed to
carry their guns, whether it be on a university campus or to an Olympic
skiing event.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature passed a law in 1999 specifically declaring all
Olympic venues off limits for guns and mandating metal detectors to
enforce the ban. Many gun rights advocates said they could live with a
ban that was enforced on everyone--criminals and law-abiding citizens as
well. But they pushed strongly--and ultimately unsuccessfully--to store
weapons in lockboxes at venues. They rejected Olympic officials'
suggestion that they leave their guns at home or in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Leaving your weapon at home makes you defenseless during the many
hours that you will spend traveling to and from each Olympic event.
Leaving it in your parked car is impractical, potentially unsafe and
possibly illegal," the Gun Owners of Utah argued in a position paper.</TE>
<TE>   "The people responsible for this decision don't seem to understand
that legally armed American citizens are an asset to public safety, not a
liability."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have advocated limits on guns questioned the need for
lockboxes. "I can say, as someone who lives in downtown Salt Lake City,
that the concept that I would have to leave my home carrying a gun and
[lock it up when I] go into a secured area and immediately need my gun to
go home again is silly," said Maura Carabello, director of Utah's Gun
Violence Prevention Center, which is attempting to qualify an initiative
for the November ballot to keep guns out of schools and churches.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Clark Aposhian, legislative liaison for Gun Owners of Utah,
had secured funding for Olympic lockboxes through the National Rifle
Assn. But he said he broke ranks with some of his colleagues and decided
not to press the issue when federal security officials appeared adamant.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Service said, flat out, no," Aposhian said. "If I wanted
to get on the Secret Service bad list, I'd push it. But frankly, I
don't."</TE>
<TE>   No one, however, is backing down on the guns-on-campus fight.</TE>
<TE>   Aposhian, who carries a .40-caliber "Baby" Glock stuffed into the back
of his waistband whenever he leaves the house, says many teachers and
principals have taken his concealed-weapon training courses.</TE>
<TE>   Dining at a Salt Lake City restaurant one recent evening with the
Glock wedged between him and the back of the chair, Aposhian said he has
rarely had to pull his gun from the holster. But that doesn't make it any
less useful, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone comes in here with a gun and tries to hold the place up,
one of the things he has to consider is, this is Utah. There may be
return fire. That's one of the fringe benefits of this law."</TE>
<TE>   For years, many state agencies, along with the university, have
prohibited workers from carrying guns to work. But most of those
regulations were turned on their head last fall when the attorney general
looked at an ordinance passed a little over a year ago in the southern
Utah town of Virgin. There, city leaders had taken an affirmative stand
on the 2nd Amendment by requiring all heads of households to own a gun.
(Most of the town's 394 residents already did.)</TE>
<TE>   Shurtleff believed Virgin was possibly in violation of a state law,
which placed gun policy solely within the purview of the Legislature.
Then again, he concluded in a November opinion, so were state regulations
that attempted to prohibit state employees from carrying firearms in
state facilities, in state cars or on state business in places outside
designated secure areas.</TE>
<TE>   In hearings in late December before the state personnel board, some
state workers said they felt safer carrying a gun to work. "The
concealed-weapon permit holders I know are responsible people who are not
trying to save the world, they're trying to protect us," state employee
Rodney Smith testified. "They're going to be pointing guns the other way.
Not at us."</TE>
<TE>   But Lorna Brown, a mother of young children, said allowing guns in
state buildings would make it twice as hard to protect her children. If
someone goes on a shooting spree and the employees are unarmed, she said,
"The only thing I have to worry about is shots coming from one direction,
not two."</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the Safe to Learn, Safe to Worship initiative--ranging from
the PTA to the Utah Education Assn. and the Utah Medical Assn.--say
schools and churches are regarded as gun-free zones in most states and
ought to be in Utah as well.</TE>
<TE>   In January, when the Capitol Preservation Board met to consider gun
regulations inside the state Capitol, Atty. Gen. Shurtleff brought a
silhouette target of a human being from a recent trip he made to the
shooting range, proudly displaying 148 out of 150 possible shots
clustered in the so-called kill zone--to the delight of most of the
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Shurtleff still hopes to negotiate a resolution to the university
issue, his spokesman Paul Murphy said. "We are hoping we can get
together, reason with each other and that it can be settled without going
to court."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders in Virgin were happy to compromise. Last fall, they amended
the law that said households had to have a gun and required citizens
instead to have "arms."</TE>
<TE>   "We are not allowed to say 'firearms,' " Mayor Jay Lee said then. "We
changed it to say arms, which can mean anything from a pitchfork to a
banana."</TE>

<HD>Military Fuses Old, New to Create a Lethal Force</HD>
<DH>War: The services have adapted to unforeseen conditions and learned
a transforming lesson.</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is the eighth in an occasional series
exploring the effects of the Sept. 11 attacks on various aspects of our
society.
</SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Here was the U.S. military in Afghanistan: a bearded soldier riding
horseback in a storm of desert sand, looking like something out of
"Lawrence of Arabia." But instead of a dagger, he carried a global
positioning system, a sophisticated radio transmitter and a laser for
marking targets.</LD>
<LD>   Flying 35,000 feet above him was a Vietnam-era bomber that had seemed
headed for the scrap heap--until the Pentagon loaded it with smart bombs
and linked its pilot with the guy on horseback.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, the United States has harnessed the most outlandishly
modern of its capabilities to the seemingly obsolete, creating a new kind
of fighting force capable of finding and demolishing a new kind of enemy.</LD>
<TE>   Its success at combining old and new has been a transforming lesson
for America's military. For years, believers in the ultimate power of
high-tech have wrestled for defense dollars with traditionalists who say
you can't win a war without boots on the ground. The Pentagon has learned
from Afghanistan that it needs both--although Congress now must decide
whether the country can afford both.</TE>
<TE>   "We had these guys on horseback, literally, making the difference in
these airstrikes. We had, in some cases, 50-year-old bombers flying above
them," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said in an interview.
"But we took a 50-year-old bomber and combined it with horse cavalry and
turned it into a 21st century" fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   From training academies to military bases, from laboratories to
shipyards, a new doctrine is emerging. It says that in a world where
threats can come from anywhere, America's military must train and equip
itself to be nimble and mighty at the same time--and, above all, to
expect the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Marines at a training center in rural Maryland have been getting
a crash course in how to outfox terrorists holding hostages. Air Force
fighter pilots are flying jets loaded with live missiles over the Capitol
as part of a new mission to defend the U.S. homeland. This semester, West
Point cadets, the leaders of tomorrow's Army, can elect to study
terrorism in addition to Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   In the military's graduate schools and think tanks, strategists and
students are coming to terms with this new world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's how we're using the things that we have that's different," said
Army Col. Dan Bolger, director of strategy and analysis for the Joint
Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. "It's rarely the case where you completely
junk the old arsenal and use the new stuff. You learn that it's about how
we can use the new stuff along with or to carry the old."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, it seemed every move proved the point.</TE>
<TE>   Kits called "joint direct attack munitions" made dumb bombs smart by
adding tail fins and global positioning systems, allowing them to strike
Taliban troops and trucks with deadly precision.</TE>
<TE>   State-of-the-art Navy fighter planes roared into the air off
30-year-old aircraft carriers--ships built to attack the Soviet Union
from the northern seas and until recently considered white elephants by
some in the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Pilotless reconnaissance planes called Predator and Global Hawk guided
AC-130 gunships first used in Vietnam. The spy planes found Taliban and
Al Qaeda fighters and the heavily armed AC-130 aircraft, newly outfitted
with navigational computers, mowed them down.</TE>
<TE>A New War Paradigm</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the Cold War ended, and with it the reason for arming and
training a military to wage World War III in Europe, the Pentagon has
been searching for a new model of how to fight.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism in general, and the war in Afghanistan in
particular, provided the outline of a new approach. It is already having
far-reaching effects on the way the military does business, as well as on
the lives of the people in it.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent hazy morning on the banks of Mattawoman Creek in Indian
Head, Md., Marine infantrymen who have spent their careers training to
kill enemy soldiers on a battlefield crawled blindfolded through a
collapsed building. In October, they had received orders to join a new
2,400-person anti-terrorist brigade. Their job now is to learn how to
rescue hostages and save lives after a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country at Ft. Lewis, Wash., an Army base 30 miles south of
Seattle, a combat squad moved stealthily through a simulated cityscape.
The soldiers, trained until now to fight in non-urban battlefields,
darted down alleys and into buildings in search of imaginary terrorists.
Unlike the Marines at Indian Head, these Army soldiers are training to
fight terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I were starting out all over again," said Lt. Jim Cashwell,
commander of the squad. "My training 18 years ago was for World War III:
very heavy equipment, very linear, line up and shoot. Today it's more
like soccer, with the field 360 degrees around you. It's an ever-changing
problem that has to be figured out."</TE>
<TE>   The lessons of Afghanistan are also starting to change the way the
military thinks of future wars, tactics and adversaries. For a decade or
so at places such as the National War College at Ft. McNair in
Washington, D.C., where rising stars of the military are trained in
foreign policy and diplomacy, the prevailing view has been that the
significant wars of the future could be predicted.</TE>
<TE>   They would come, the thinking went, in known hot spots, when a
nation-state such as China or North Korea challenged the vital interests
of the United States. And they would be fought with familiar tactics and
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Also taught was "asymmetric warfare," with a small power attacking a
big one at its weak points. But it wasn't considered a threat that could
shake the U.S. to its core, as the Sept. 11 attacks have.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been planning in too focused a way for wars on the Korean
peninsula or reruns of Desert Storm, and it's fortunate that in spite of
that, we had the capability to do this thing that was very different,"
Wolfowitz said of the Afghanistan campaign. "You have to be prepared for
a broad range of things."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Col. Paula G. Thornhill, dean of the faculty at the National
War College, says Sept. 11 has driven that point home. "Now we're moving
from the predictable to the unexpected," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Newport, R.I., where John Paul Jones founded the U.S. Navy,
tacticians at the Naval War College have been gaming out wars since 1887.
They once moved pieces around a board in a grown-up version of the game
Battleship.</TE>
<TE>   Now they use a $28-million war simulation center with a cavernous room
of computer-driven displays. The Space Age technology allows commanders
simulating wars to view vast amounts of information from satellites,
reconnaissance drones and military intelligence from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the games they play have changed. Now, they include
how to respond to a chemical or biological attack. Others simulate a war
on terrorist bases, equipment and financial networks around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a place that is usually about the theoretical," said Lt.
Cmdr. Richard LaBranche, a Navy fighter pilot studying in Newport for a
master's degree. "Now we have something alive and breathing. We have a
war going on. It's given me something to think about--real world, real
time."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines were among the first in the military to begin arming
themselves in a serious way for a conflict such as the one in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But even at the Indian Head training center in Maryland, the current
conflict has challenged old assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Cpl. Matthew Lecorgne has been a Marine for more than two years,
but on a recent, warm December day he was doing something new: learning
to rescue civilians held hostage by a terrorist in a smoke- and
chemical-filled high-rise. Crawling blind through a three-dimensional
maze of tight spaces and sudden drops and turns, he said he felt at times
utterly panicked and frighteningly alone.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a totally different concept for us," Lecorgne said. "We're
used to life-taking, and this is life-saving. It's like the idea of
helplessness. At least we know on the battlefield, we're confident of our
skills and abilities. Here you don't know how stable the building is,
whether there are any casualties. The only thing you have is the guy
hanging off your ankles, and he's just as scared as you."</TE>
<TE>Funds Wane as Needs Increase</TE>
<TE>   Today's 1.4-million-member military and its $329-billion budget were
already at a crossroads before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Weaponry bought during the Reagan administration buildup of the 1980s
had been wearing out, jacking up maintenance costs just as spending on
the latest technologies picked up. Challenges to the American homeland
were also on the rise--not only from the possibility of terrorist strikes
but from short- and long-range missiles and cyber attacks against
computer networks serving key sectors of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   George W. Bush entered office promising to devote just 1% of the
then-projected budget surplus to the military--not nearly enough to
retain current forces while buying all the advanced weaponry the military
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks, the surplus has become a deficit. The
Pentagon's clout on Capitol Hill has grown, but so has its shopping list.</TE>
<TE>   It says it needs more military intelligence agents and special forces;
those trained in the history and cultures of Central Asia proved
invaluable in Afghanistan, but they numbered in the dozens.</TE>
<TE>   The new unmanned aircraft have been critical for spotting targets in
Afghanistan. But with fewer than 60 Predators and about 50 Global Hawks,
the Pentagon had to pull several out of service in other parts of the
globe to fly Afghan skies. Since the Afghanistan campaign began, four
Predators and one Global Hawk have crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force and Navy used so many precision munitions in Afghanistan
that they seriously depleted the relatively small stockpile, senior
Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about shortages of the kits that add global positioning
equipment and tail fins to old bombs are particularly acute. The Navy has
had to borrow thousands of the kits from the Air Force to meet its needs
in Afghanistan. More have been ordered from Boeing, the manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   When Pentagon officials are asked whether they want to lavish their
resources on the old ways of fighting wars or the new, they typically
respond: both. Mike Brown, director of the national security studies
program at Georgetown University, says the nation can't afford that
answer.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does he think it's the right answer. Noting that the military
spends billions on the heavy tanks and artillery designed to fight a
major land war, he advocates jettisoning the "huge amounts of resources .
. . that are contributing very close to zero to deal with the problems of
the post-Cold War world."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, no one knows which of America's aging weapon systems
might prove useful in the next war. One example: Before Afghanistan, the
Defense Department, under Donald H. Rumsfeld, had been trying to cut
funding for the long-range B-1 bomber by about one-third. The supersonic
bombers, first produced in 1985 and now carrying a price tag of $200
million each, have had a history of design problems, cost overruns and
crashes.</TE>
<TE>   But B-1s, operating from Missouri, dropped more bombs on Afghanistan
than any other aircraft and have been receiving recognition as a critical
workhorse of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force fighter fleet, by contrast, was grounded in this war
because it had no bases close enough to Afghanistan (Navy aircraft flying
from carriers have primarily waged the air war). But that didn't stop the
Pentagon from tapping Lockheed Martin in October to build 3,000 new Air
Force jet fighters. The projected cost of $200 billion made this the
biggest military contract ever.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Rubik's Cube notion," a senior Army officer said. "You get a
different type of makeup every time you look at a different [foe]. What
that means to us is, you've got to have a force that is not so
specifically tailored that it has limitations left and right. You can
never have a force that can do everything, but you've got to have a force
that can do most things."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon has been compelled since Sept. 11 to think of
what planners call the "away game" in a new way, it is also being forced
to contemplate a new and costly role in the "home game."</TE>
<TE>   Along with Air Force jets flying over Washington, the National Guard
is patrolling the nation's airports. Reserve pilots are on alert to
defend U.S. skies. The Coast Guard is using Navy ships to patrol the
coasts.</TE>
<TE>   The use of the Reserve and National Guard at home on a grand scale
threatens to hamper the military's performance abroad. The military has
relied increasingly on those forces over the last decade to help with
everything from food service to public relations in such far-flung places
as Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative--deploying active-duty military units for missions on
U.S. soil--has met with deep opposition from top military leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people have not bought the Navy, in my belief, to defend
our coasts," said Rear Adm. Rodney P. Rempt, president of the Naval War
College. "What we want to do is to eliminate the terrorists at the
source."</TE>
<TE>   The military isn't even sure how much authority it has to operate at
home. It has directed a team of military lawyers at the Joint Forces
Command in Norfolk, which is in charge of guarding the homeland, to
determine the reach of the Posse Comitatus Act.</TE>
<TE>   That law, enacted after the government used the military to enforce
Reconstruction-era laws after the Civil War, forbids the federal
government to use American soldiers to enforce the law on U.S. soil. (The
law permits state and municipal officials to call up the Reserve and the
Guard for this purpose.)</TE>
<TE>   "We have to figure out here what the military might actually do in the
event of an attack against the U.S., and when you do that, you bump right
up against Posse Comitatus and its limitations. All of this has obviously
become urgent," said Capt. Dan Donovan, the command's legal advisor.</TE>
<TE>Terrorism Course Added to Curriculum</TE>
<TE>   At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., where patriots
strung a 150-ton iron chain across the Hudson River two centuries ago to
protect the fledgling republic from British warships, military scholars
are mulling how to engage in the contemporary defense of the U.S.
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:40 a.m. Sept. 11, the first plane destined for the World Trade
Center flew over the campus on its way from Boston. Ever since, the
reality of the war on terrorism has kept intruding on the stately
academy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shock, it was outrage from the cadets," said Brig. Gen. Daniel
Kaufman, dean of the academy's academic board.</TE>
<TE>   "Their world had changed. They had grown up in the era of the greatest
economic expansion in U.S. history. That was the only world they knew.
Suddenly they had questions to ask themselves about the nature of their
world and the requirements of being a commissioned officer."</TE>
<TE>   The school quickly added an elective course on terrorism to its
liberal arts curriculum, which includes a seminar on lessons learned from
the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about Afghanistan as much as we talk about anything else
these days," said Anne McClain, 23, from Spokane, Wash., a cadet in her
final year. "Suddenly, it seems critical to know.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us are about to graduate. We have a greater sense of purpose
that, on Sept. 11, became defined. We have to keep an eye on what's out
there, because one day it is going to be up to us."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Team Targets Hussein</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Voices of caution fall silent as U.S. plans new campaign that
could include military force. Diplomacy, sanctions also may play a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After a year of internal divisions and military diversions, serious
planning is underway within the Bush administration for a campaign
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The administration expects to complete a long-delayed Iraq policy
review by the time Vice President Dick Cheney makes his nine-nation
Mideast tour next month, so that he can outline American plans to Arab
leaders, according to senior U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   Any denouement in Iraq is still a long way off, the officials insist.
But the broad outlines of favored options have begun to emerge.</LD>
<TE>   At the heart of administration policy are two strategic decisions,
according to the officials, who do not want to be identified while the
policy review is underway.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Iraq problem has to be solved, not simply managed as it was
during the previous two U.S. administrations. The philosophy of so-called
containment, or limiting the damage Hussein could do either to the region
or at home, is no longer considered enough.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts, including former Clinton administration officials, now
argue that it may even be dangerous to simply contain Iraq, because the
regime has enough wiggle room to quietly work on weaponry that would
allow it to pull off devastating surprises down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Washington is prepared to push beyond the limitations imposed
by international sentiment, Arab public opinion and even the original
U.N. resolutions that opened the way for Operation Desert Storm 11 years
ago to force Iraq out of tiny oil-rich Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Having survived short-lived opposition to the campaign in Afghanistan,
U.S. officials express a new confidence about going up against what is
still a strong tide of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The debate continues, however, about what to do next. But the
administration's mind-set and the progress of the war in Afghanistan,
especially compared with the decade-long Soviet struggle there in the
1980s, have opened the way for new thinking about what might work.</TE>
<TE>   As policymakers deliberate the options, three basic scenarios are
emerging:</TE>
<TE>   * The diplomatic route, working through the United Nations to pass new
"smart sanctions" and press Hussein's regime to allow the return of
inspectors who would look for and dismantle any chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   * A military campaign, probably relying heavily on air power and
potential defections within the Iraqi military.</TE>
<TE>   * A tightening of the political noose around Hussein's government with
more coercive actions by neighboring states and the international
community.</TE>
<TE>   The policy may well end up with some mix of these approaches. But the
common denominator behind each is the threat of some kind of military
action should Iraq not change its ways. Despite opposition from allies, a
major U.S. military effort is no longer out of the question, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an evolving consensus that a sizable U.S. military activity
will be required," a well-placed source said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, long the most cautious voice
among the principals crafting policy on Iraq, is on board. At two
congressional hearings last week, he put the world on notice that
President Bush is exploring "the most serious set of options that one
might imagine" that will leave "no stone unturned."</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate goal: a change of regimes--and sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   "After the president, Powell now looks like the hardest-line person in
the administration," mused a senior State Department official Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The policy review is exploring the possibility of new anti-Hussein
opposition inside and outside Iraq, U.S. officials say. Consensus is
growing on broadening the makeup of the U.S.-funded Iraqi National
Congress, or INC, and encouraging the coalition to find new leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "The INC could still be a useful umbrella to bring other political
forces together, but not as it is currently constituted. We need an INC
that is more representative of all the forces in Iraq," a senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   INC chief Ahmad Chalabi still has support from some quarters, notably
at the Pentagon, but "that is not where policy is currently headed," the
official added.</TE>
<TE>   Since last year, Pentagon political appointees have advocated using
the INC in the same way the American military used Afghan opposition
forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces troops, to battle the Taliban. But
key officials at the State Department and in the Joint Chiefs of Staff
remain skeptical about the INC's military capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The INC, and the CIA station that supported it, was forced out of
northern Iraq by Hussein's troops in 1996. Since then, the INC has been
headquartered in London and unable to make any serious challenges at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see us drawing up operations with the INC as it would take
too long to build it up as a fighting force," said the well-placed
source.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. suspended key INC funding because the group
failed to account for tens of millions of dollars in aid. After lengthy
talks, Washington has restored full funding for three months, during
which it will monitor INC accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the INC is reconstituted, however, the administration is still
exploring other fronts. One idea gaining currency in Washington is
turning to the Iraqi military as allies, according to U.S. officials. The
new thinking argues that a U.S. offensive would lead to thousands of
defections by Iraqi troops, as happened during Desert Storm. Defectors
might then be converted into an anti-Hussein force.</TE>
<TE>   The former Bush and Clinton administrations believed that Hussein's
downfall depended on senior officers in his inner circle who might be
disillusioned enough to turn on their boss. But a decade of waiting for
the generals to act has produced nothing significant.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, key U.S. officials now argue, the rank and file in the
military might easily fold under serious military pressure--and defect to
the U.S. side.</TE>
<TE>   "As we learned in Afghanistan, some regimes are not as solid as they
pretend to be. The trick is finding the pressure points that can break
the structure," the senior State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three scenarios, the diplomatic route is gaining speed the
fastest, although key U.S. officials are skeptical that it will produce a
change of Iraqi regimes. But Washington must be seen to exhaust those
possibilities to win allied support for--or at least tolerance of--more
aggressive options, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   After months of negotiations, Washington is close to winning agreement
at the United Nations on streamlining the world's toughest economic
embargo, U.S. officials say. Russia, which has a veto, has been the last
holdout.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. agreement, which could be voted on in May when the embargo is due
to be renewed, would open the way for a change in the sanctions that
would allow more goods for Iraq's struggling population while limiting
Hussein's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations is also pressing harder for return to Iraq of its
weapons inspectors, who have been barred since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The threatening language from Washington, including Bush's description
of Iraq as part of an "axis of evil," and the U.N. moves have Hussein on
the defensive, U.S. officials claim. Last week he offered to resume "a
dialogue" with the world body, although he is resisting any talk of the
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   But the diplomatic route is vulnerable to failure, U.S. officials
note. To enforce smart sanctions, the U.N. will have to rely on
inspections on the borders of Syria, Iran, Turkey and Jordan, all of
which allow Iraq to smuggle oil out in violation of U.N. sanctions in
exchange for payoffs or deep discounts on the resource.</TE>
<TE>   Persuading Iraq to allow in the weapons inspectors also may not
produce a quick and decisive climax. Just getting the operations going
could take months. And then, as his regime did for eight years, Hussein
could carry out "cheat and retreat" schemes to prolong the process.</TE>
<TE>   The second scenario, involving a tighter squeeze on Iraq outside the
framework of the United Nations, also would try to cut off the regime in
high-profile ways. One idea making the rounds in Washington is getting
Iraq's neighboring states together to discuss a viable post-Hussein
government--similar to the talks in Germany on post-Taliban rule.</TE>
<TE>   But some of these options depend on the cooperation of front-line
neighbors and the Arab world, which have been reluctant to sign on to
previous proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Cheney may find that he has his work cut out for him on his
most ambitious diplomatic mission. Arab allies remain deeply concerned
about some of the new U.S. ideas. "Our problem is that we see much of it
as wishful thinking or a leap of faith--particularly relying on
defections. This doesn't have the feel of a workable plan," said an Arab
official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs are particularly worried about the post-Hussein government.
"None of us are defending Saddam Hussein," the envoy added. "But we want
to make sure that everyone is better off the day after he's gone, and
that means a lot more planning than is going on now."</TE>

<HD>Director's Mission: Hyping 'Moulin Rouge' Oscar Hopes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his quest to spread the gospel of "Moulin Rouge," there has been
almost no promotional gimmick too outlandish for Baz Luhrmann, the film's
director.</LD>
<LD>   In Dallas, the 39-year-old Australian allowed himself to be crowned
with a cowboy hat and hoisted on an elephant at midnight. In Bombay,
fireworks were shot off in the theater during a screening.</LD>
<LD>   He has staged live cancan extravaganzas from Cannes to Sydney,
lectured to students from Oxford to Yale, and spent countless nights
trolling through nightclubs across Asia, bestowing special awards on the
joint that best re-created the anything-goes spirit of the original
Parisian nightclub Moulin Rouge.</LD>
<TE>   Lately, his journey has centered on the rarefied watering holes of
members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences--the folks who
vote for the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   For Luhrmann, a best picture Oscar, or even a nomination, would not
only boost the box office but help in what he sees as his larger mission
to resuscitate the musical to its former stature in the Hollywood canon.</TE>
<TE>   By relentlessly promoting "Moulin Rouge" around the world, Luhrmann
aims to establish his film as an international phenomenon--the kind of
film that academy voters see as best picture material.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit of Academy Awards has become increasingly fierce in recent
years. But "Moulin Rouge" may have the first truly global Oscar campaign,
and it surely won't be the last, as America becomes a smaller portion of
the international box office and as the industry incorporates elements of
other cinemas, from the spread of kung fu kicks into Hollywood action
films to the awarding of the best actor Oscar to Roberto Benigni for his
performance--in Italian--in "Life Is Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   It's perfectly conceivable that when the Academy Award nominations are
announced Tuesday morning, Ron Howard will be the only American director
nominated for an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   The best picture award is the most coveted--the industry's one
enduring badge of artistic respectability. A best picture endorsement can
add $30 million or more to a film's coffers, and these days, studios are
spending close to half of that just to get into the derby. Estimates are
that spending on Academy Award advertisements is running 20% ahead of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   For Twentieth Century Fox, which released "Moulin Rouge," the stakes
are particularly high: The studio hasn't won a best picture award for
almost 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   So Fox sent the articulate, personable Luhrmann on the road like a
presidential candidate on a primary run. The bouncy, affable Australian
would certainly win the Bill Clinton award for sheer indefatigability,
having spent more than six months crisscrossing the globe. Where other
studios used TV spots and newspaper advertisements to push their Oscar
hopes, Fox relied heavily on Luhrmann and his cast to get its message
across.</TE>
<TE>   When "Moulin Rouge" was released in May, its Oscar chances seemed dim.
Set in the gaudy, decadent underworld of a turn-of-the-20th-century
Parisian nightclub, the film is a brash, colorful, tragicomic musical,
with its stars (Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor) warbling a pastiche of
pop songs--everything from the "Sound of Music" to Nat King Cole, the
Beatles, Madonna and Sting.</TE>
<TE>   It's an extravagant jukebox of a film borne full-out from Luhrmann's
head; the film has been dubbed everything from divine to demonic, or as
Luhrmann ruefully paraphrases his critics, "anti-cinema."</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour film, which was released on DVD in December, definitely
polarizes critics and audiences. Recently, one Time critic anointed it
the second-best film of the year (after the Afghan drama "Kandahar"),
while another labeled it the year's worst, a film that critic Richard
Schickel said "made my tortured viscera beg for mercy."</TE>
<TE>   Before its debut, the film was considered so risky from a marketing
point of view that Fox initially tried to obscure the fact that the
$50-million film was in fact . . . a musical.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we weren't allowed to use the 'M' word, let alone the 'O'
word, opera," said Luhrmann, who has recently spoken at the headquarters
of the writers, directors and screen actors guilds as well as the
American Cinematheque, at events that lure Oscar voters. "Now, with the
campaigning in the awards season and the re-release, it's all about
'We've reinvented the musical!' "</TE>
<TE>   In its latest ads, Fox trots out endorsements from such musical
legends as Stanley Donen, who directed "Singing in the Rain," and Robert
Wise, who directed "The Sound of Music," names that might be unfamiliar
to younger audiences but which resonate with the traditionally older
academy crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The studio has certainly bought its share of trade and newspaper ads,
but it's stressing the personal approach. The film's most effective
spokesman and agitator remains Luhrmann. Almost never has an art film
director so thoroughly embraced the promotional machine.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider marketing and promotion as our responsibility," said
Luhrmann, whose design team (led by his wife, Catherine Martin, the
film's production and co-costume designer) generated most of the images
used in the advertising campaign, and who personally produced the
best-selling soundtrack, which introduced the film to the MTV generation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like the circus. We travel around, and then collapse on the
jet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Baz won't give up until he dies of consumption. He must be living a
life of jet lag. I don't think he knows which way is up anymore," said
McGregor, who traipsed around Europe with Luhrmann.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the director, who recently exchanged his silver-maned Mozart
coiffure for a sprightly post-Beatles bob, is philosophical about how
much one can do to influence the academy. "You can't change people's
mind. The only thing you can do is put light on your film and try to
encourage them to actually put it in the DVD player."</TE>
<TE>   If Luhrmann is leading the charge, he's been backed up by a studio
with something to prove. Although Fox initiated and co-financed the 1997
Oscar juggernaut "Titanic," a good portion of the film's bragging rights
ended up with Paramount, which was the domestic distributor. Indeed, the
last time the studio won best picture solo was in 1972 for "The French
Connection." Moreover, in recent years, it's been criticized in the
industry for bungling Oscar campaigns for such films as last year's "Cast
Away."</TE>
<TE>   Fox appears to have approached the phenomenon with a long-range game
plan, allowing the film to stay in theaters for weeks all summer,
building on its word-of-mouth. In the fall, Fox decided to re-release the
film in key cities, complete with a chic soiree at co-chairman Tom
Rothman's house, to which some academy members happened to be invited.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the odds remain long. Once the mainstay of Hollywood
filmmaking, no musical has won best picture since "Oliver" in 1968.
Moreover, the academy has a firm tradition of opting for the safe,
conventional choice over the daring, perhaps more memorable film. In
1980, the academy bestowed best picture on "Ordinary People" instead of
"Raging Bull." In 1965, "My Fair Lady" won over "Dr. Strangelove Or How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb." In recent times, Hollywood
has tended to favor costume drama, preferably with an epic bent, honoring
such films as "Titanic" and "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   By either of these standards, the award for best picture should go to
"A Beautiful Mind," with its familiar tropes of triumph over adversity,
or the super-sized "Lord of the Rings." Yet, Luhrmann keeps plugging.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm praying for is the day that it's done, and I know that we
have done everything we can do, so basically I feel that I've paid back
all those who believed," he said from his bed in New York, where he had
finally collapsed with a cold.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Oscar is supposed to reward artistic merit, in truth, no
film ever wins one without at least some box office appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann had a proven commercial track record with risky fare, most
notably his 1996 pumped-up rendition of "William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp;
Juliet," but there was plenty of trepidation that "Moulin Rouge" might
die on opening weekend.</TE>
<TE>   According to the studio, the early test screenings indicated that the
audience reaction would be sharply divided, and that the film's natural
constituents were the young and the artsy--two components of the
moviegoing public that don't often overlap.</TE>
<TE>   The $50-million film has so far earned $57 million in America, a
respectable enough number, bolstered not so much by its critical
reaction, but by the endorsements of taste-makers from other fields, such
as Oprah Winfrey and MTV, which featured Christina Aguilera and Lil' Kim
singing "Lady Marmalade" on the awards show.</TE>
<TE>   More significant was its embrace by the rest of the globe, where the
film doubled its domestic box office.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see people are thinking what's the conspiracy about how this
film that wasn't loved when it was given birth to has become embraced,"
said Luhrmann, ever one to see the meta-implications of any phenomenon.
"It's been an individual passion by certain individuals . . . not to see
this one chance of the musical being put back in its rightful place in
the terms of cinematic language and form be destroyed. I wouldn't say we
never got a break, but it's never been easy."</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Displeasure With Parks Brewed for Years</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Deep differences dogged their relationship, culminating in
mayor's refusal to back the chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year was 1997, and then-City Atty. James K. Hahn was sitting in
the sixth-floor office of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, trying to
persuade the chief to change his mind.</LD>
<LD>   Parks had just decided to disband the popular senior lead program and
reassign the officers who served as community contacts back to patrol
duty.</LD>
<LD>   Can't you reconsider? the city attorney asked the chief.</LD>
<TE>   But Parks wouldn't budge. He wanted all officers to engage in
community policing, he said, not just senior leads.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember saying, 'Chief, I've heard the old saw that if you make
something everyone's job, then nobody does it,' " said Hahn, recalling
the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn's announcement last week that he could not support a second
term for Parks came as an abrupt and stunning decision to many in the
city, but the seeds of Hahn's dissatisfaction with Parks had been planted
over the years in encounters the two men had as they traveled their
respective career paths, according to Hahn and others who know both men.</TE>
<TE>   A look at some of their conflicts helps explain why, seven months into
his administration, the mayor is already convinced he cannot work with
the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Never close, Parks and Hahn embraced distinct philosophies about the
structure and the priorities of the Los Angeles Police Department. In
particular, they tangled over civilian oversight of the department and
police reform.</TE>
<TE>   Their differences only occasionally surfaced in public. Rather, the
relationship was marked by a back-room tug of war between a strong-willed
police chief and a persistent city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Mike Feuer said Hahn may have asked himself if
Parks would ever see things his way. "That answer, I think, was provided
by his previous experience" with the chief, Feuer said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their conflicts, however, Hahn held his tongue during last
year's mayoral campaign--a race in which he depended on African American
support to defeat Antonio Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was the only candidate who did not say he was inclined to oppose
the chief's reappointment. While he stopped short of endorsing the chief
for a second term, Hahn said at the time that he thought the chief could
reform the department if he was properly focused on the task.</TE>
<TE>   That fact now upsets some African American leaders who campaigned for
Hahn and feel misled because Hahn never told them of his reservations
about Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have made a difference," said Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray of
the First AME Church. "Given what we know at this particular time, I
don't think the mayor would have received the support of the black
community."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn insists that he had not made up his mind to oppose the chief's
reappointment when he was running for office.</TE>
<TE>   "The miscalculation that I made earlier is that I had thought that the
chief's resistance to things . . . was because he was in sync with the
person that got him appointed, Mayor [Richard] Riordan, and that I'd have
the opportunity to work with him and have him share my vision and that he
would be as enthusiastic and as supportive as of the previous mayor,"
Hahn said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, after seven months here, I realize he was being absolutely true
to himself."</TE>
<TE>Chief Says He Was Surprised</TE>
<TE>   In public comments since the mayor's announcement, Parks has said he
was surprised to hear of the mayor's dissatisfaction, saying he believes
they have had a "very positive relationship." He also said he has fully
supported the mayor's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where these issues are coming from," he said at a news
conference Friday outside Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including Hahn, said there has been a long history of
disputes between the two men. During the 4 1/2 years that Parks has been
chief, the two have been at odds over a wide range of issues, including
the Rampart corruption scandal and the federal consent decree that lays
out steps the LAPD must take to reform its practices.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and the chief have styles that did not endear them to one
another. A proud and confident man, Parks has a tendency to lecture those
he thinks don't understand an issue. Such encounters irritated Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to communicate with someone in that mode," the mayor
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to make up his mind and then be unwilling to change it,"
Hahn added. "Even if everybody on the planet said, 'You ought to change
this,' if he believes he is right, he'll stick to it."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Parks says a good chief of police should voice his
dissent when he believes a policy is misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it would be helpful in this city if I accept
responsibility for something I think is wrong and not tell someone," he
said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the distance between the two men was widened by their
philosophical differences and attempts to curtail each other's scope of
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after becoming police chief in 1997, Parks proposed a plan to
appoint a deputy city attorney or in-house counsel to work full time at
Parker Center exclusively on police matters.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parks was careful to avoid publicly criticizing Hahn, the
implication was clear: He thought the city attorney's office was botching
civil suits against LAPD officers. The chief, backed by Riordan and some
council members, complained that Hahn was too willing to negotiate costly
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   As a compromise, Hahn set up a special team of lawyers and
investigators to work toward reducing the multimillion-dollar costs of
police cases.</TE>
<TE>   In the years that followed, Hahn proceeded to hand down opinions that
pushed Parks to open up the department to more scrutiny. When the LAPD
inspector general complained in 1999 that he wasn't getting enough
information from the chief, Hahn issued a 17-page opinion affirming that
the Police Commission could force Parks to cooperate with the inspector
general on all matters, including handing over confidential documents.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, Hahn announced that he favored the creation of an
independent commission to investigate the Rampart corruption scandal, a
step Parks opposed. Later, he sided with then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti
and ordered Parks to turn over all relevant information on rogue cops to
county prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also ruled in June 2000 that the council had the authority to
force Parks to reinstate the senior lead officer program. Ultimately,
Riordan pushed Parks to put the program back into place.</TE>
<TE>Consent Decree Was Biggest Conflict</TE>
<TE>   The biggest gulf between the two men came over negotiations with the
U.S. Department of Justice over the federal consent decree mandating
reform of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Parks adamantly opposed the decree, objecting to the intrusion of the
federal government into local police affairs. He also balked at some of
the specific provisions in the document, such as the collection of data
to track racial profiling, information he said would be difficult to
analyze.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who was gearing up his bid for mayor, took the lead in the
negotiations with the federal government, convinced that without the
decree, the Justice Department would sue the city and win a more
stringent set of reforms in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The differences between the two men came into stark relief during the
six months of negotiations in 2000 that took place in a 32nd-floor office
of a downtown law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and Parks weren't present, but their representatives were: Tim
McOsker, Hahn's chief of staff, and LAPD Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, who
is now retired. Also present was Riordan's representative, Deputy Mayor
Kelly Martin, who also fought on behalf of Parks. The two sides were
often at odds, according to people who participated in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   On some days, after hours of wrestling over issues, the city's
negotiating team would finally reach a resolution, only to reopen debate
the next day when Pomeroy arrived with a new list of concerns.</TE>
<TE>   McOsker would not discuss the specifics of the meetings but said the
LAPD's objections to aspects of the decree impeded the group's progress.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said Friday that even though he originally opposed the idea of
the consent decree, he and his department fully cooperated with the
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the city decided to have a consent decree, we put our
differences aside and decided to move forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the consent decree negotiations ended in November 2000, the
mayoral campaign was just starting to heat up. At that point, Hahn said
he was inclined to reappoint the chief if he had to decide that day.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had my differences of opinion with him, but he's doing the job,"
Hahn said during an interview in November.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks before the April 10 election, Hahn praised the chief's
discipline of officers and said he thought Parks could reform the
department effectively if he refocused his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's opinion about Parks seemed especially favorable when compared
with that of the other mayoral candidates, who all expressed some
misgivings about his leadership.</TE>
<TE>'We Trusted Him,' One Leader Says</TE>
<TE>   Some African American leaders say Hahn's careful stance during the
campaign and his dramatic swing less than a year later contributed to
their surprise and hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Frederick Murph of the Brookins Community AME Church said
even though Hahn never promised to endorse the chief, many people assumed
he was leaning in that direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of ourselves into him, and we trusted him as a friend,
as a brother," Murph said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the mayor said he made clear during the race that he
would judge Parks on the same issues that he voices dissatisfaction with
now: the implementation of the consent decree, community policing and
morale.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not intending to mislead people," he said. "I think I made it
clear I would hold the chief accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "I had assumed that we'd hit it off a lot better than we did," Hahn
added.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said last week that he has done everything Hahn asked of him,
and disputes the mayor's contention that the city is out of compliance
with the consent decree or has failed to implement the senior lead
program fully.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn worried that he would never be able to influence his chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I have enormous respect for Parks," he said. "I like him, he's a good
man and had a great career. But I think in any situation, you realize at
some point in time, this isn't somebody who shares how you look at
things."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Attack Casts Pall Over Exotic-Bird Keeper</HD>
<DH>Terror: The trainer and her delicate creatures narrowly escaped the
collapse of the adjacent World Trade Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Sometimes she dreams things are back to normal, that she's lying in
bed, sunlight streaming off the steel tower that soared above her window,
the birds--African greys and yellow-fronted Amazons--screeching up a
racket in the next room.</LD>
<LD>   For an instant she is back in her loft at 125 Cedar Street, safe and
snug among the old familiar din in the old familiar world.</LD>
<LD>   And then police allow her into the shambles that is her home. And she
shudders as she climbs the 12 floors to her apartment, still cloaked in
ash and dust, debris still littering the floors. In the living room a
giant empty bird cage sits shrouded in dust, a ghostly reminder of a
previous life. Under the desk lies a chunk of mangled steel.</LD>
<TE>   She imagines the building starting to shake all over again. She
imagines being back in the darkness, hearing the terrible roar. She
remembers the silence of the birds.</TE>
<TE>   And she wonders: Will anything ever be right again? Will she ever be
able to return?</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 began as a glorious morning for bird-trainer Gail Langsner,
as she strolled through the downtown farmers market buying corn and nuts
for the birds and fresh basil for late-summer pesto with her boyfriend,
Nat Priest.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers the plane flying awfully low. She remembers the thud.
And then she was running, flying down Cedar Street, bursting in the door
of the tiny red-brick building in the shadow of the World Trade center,
where she has lived for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   Debris was already bouncing onto the roof, ricocheting off the fire
escape, tiny pieces of paper fluttering like confetti from the sky.
Breathlessly she flew past neighbors clustered in the hallways and into
her apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Nat bounded in from the rooftop as the second plane hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The birds," Gail cried. "We have to get them out of here."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't need to explain. Even her musician-technician boyfriend
knows that the enormous tropical birds, with their glorious plumes and
razor-sharp bills, are fragile creatures. They have highly complex
respiratory and nervous systems. Dust can kill them instantly. So can
shock.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bundled the eight birds into small travel cages: Aristotle
and Peter, the African greys; Jonquil, the red colored Amazon; Josie, the
blue and gold macaw; Max, the blue-fronted Amazon; Caesar, the hahn's
macaw; Echo, the Senegal, and Fez, the half-moon conure.</TE>
<TE>   Feathers were flying. Bits of concrete were tumbling in through the
windows. The phone was ringing off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic-bird trainers are rare in lower Manhattan: Even more rare are
trainers who board at home. Owners who bring their pets to Gail know she
lives just 350 feet from the south tower, so close it seemed she could
reach out and touch it.</TE>
<TE>   Clutching the cages, the couple scrambled down to the third floor
apartment of their friends, Susan Scanga and her husband, David Feeney.
As the others clustered around the television in the kitchen, Gail
settled the birds in a back room, covering their cages with sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "Good birds, good birds," she said softly. "Everything will be OK."</TE>
<TE>   But the birds were quiet, sensing her fear.</TE>
<TE>   Tall and dark with a serene smile, 42-year-old Gail Langsner doesn't
easily get unnerved. She began her career as a lion-tamer in San
Francisco before heading back home to New York and setting up her
business with birds. She understands the power of calm in the face of
danger. Even the largest, most temperamental macaws--birds that can weigh
up to three pounds and bite with great hooked beaks--turn docile when
Gail approaches them.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the tenants in the 22 apartments at 125 Cedar Street,
Gail had lived through the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. She
knew there was a good chance the towers would be targeted again.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing had prepared her for the otherworldly roar as the south
tower groaned and her neighborhood crashed all around her.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it comes," yelled David, racing from the kitchen, dragging his
two dogs with him. "Into the back room! Into the back room!"</TE>
<TE>   Crouched in a corner, they clung to each other, four adults, eight
birds and two dogs and listened to the sickening thud, thud, thud of the
tower's implosion. The world turned black.</TE>
<TE>   It was, Nat says, as if death washed over us.</TE>
<TE>   Gail had no doubt that this was their last moment together, no doubt
that this wonderful, quirky life they had carved out on a slip of a
street among the skyscrapers, was over.</TE>
<TE>   Whispering a prayer, she gripped a bird cage and clung to Nat and
prepared for God.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't believe it when the lights flickered back on. She
couldn't believe the sight in the kitchen, a massive aluminum rod--part
of the outer sheathing of the south tower--had crashed across the table
where they had been sitting moments before.</TE>
<TE>   And she couldn't believe it when, half an hour later, she heard that
terrible roar again.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the worst," said Gail, of the second tower's collapse. "It
just seemed impossible that we could survive a second time."</TE>
<TE>   Again they huddled in the back room. Again they waited for death.</TE>
<TE>   And when it was over, when it seemed like everything that could fall
had fallen and the world turned dark and silent once more, they didn't
say a word. They just picked themselves up and prepared to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Small fires were springing up in their building and on the street
outside. The dust was suffocating. The birds were shaking, their feathers
matted. But, amazingly, they were still alive.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nat's idea to tie the cages of the bigger birds to a broom, to
cover them with pillow cases, and hoist them over his shoulder. Gail
placed the two smaller birds in duffel bags. Susan and David carried
their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Wet towels wrapped around their faces, they made their way outside.</TE>
<TE>   The streets were unrecognizable, a ghastly wasteland of ash, debris
and flames, people moving as though in a trance, caked in dust and blood.
A nauseating acrid smell filled their lungs. Cinders burned their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The birds can't make it through this, Gail cried, as they stumbled
past the old Trinity Church at the head of Wall Street, its red-brick
walls turned ashen.</TE>
<TE>   Nat nodded. Arms locked around the broom, cages dangling on each end,
head bent against the dust, he led the group into the lobby of an office
building. The lights were on, the windows hadn't been blown out, the air
was relatively clear. Best of all, there was plenty of water.</TE>
<TE>   Gail set up the cages on tables and pulled off the sheets, and tried
to coax the birds to drink. Someone found peanuts and plantain chips. But
the birds refused to eat, refused to move. They clung to their perches,
frozen with fright.</TE>
<TE>   Silently Gail prayed that they would survive.</TE>
<TE>   Using Susan's cell phone, they managed to reach family members and
tell them they were safe. Friends on Canal Street, nearly a mile away,
urged them to come right away. But they couldn't move without walking
through the giant black plume of smoke that blanketed lower Manhattan.
And that could kill the birds.</TE>
<TE>   For hours they waited, listening to the radio, trying to figure out a
safe route. Finally they decided they could wait no more. They had to
leave before dark.</TE>
<TE>   Again Nat slung the broom and the cages over his shoulder. Again they
began a trek through the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, they would hear a muffled, plaintive "hello" from Peter,
the Amazon gray that Gail has owned for 23 years. And Gail's heart would
leap and she would say, "It's OK. Good bird, good bird."</TE>
<TE>   At least he was still breathing. The other birds hadn't made a sound.</TE>
<TE>   The two couples split up, Gail and Nat heading west, toward the Hudson
River, away from the plume drifting east across the Brooklyn Bridge. But
entire streets were impassable, blocked by giant pieces of twisted metal
and rubble. They had no choice. They would have to turn back and walk
through the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Up the East River they tramped, picking their way through the rubble,
past the South Street Seaport and the Fulton Fish Market, past St. James
Place, through Chinatown, where finally streets began to look normal.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think about being alive or dead," Gail said. "It was just
moment-to-moment survival."</TE>
<TE>   It was late evening when they collapsed into their friends' apartment
on Canal Street. Gail had only one thought.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled the cages off Nat. She tore off the sheets. And, for the
first time that day, she wept.</TE>
<TE>   All the birds were alive.</TE>
<TE>   There have been many tears since then, many troubles too. The couple
have turned to the Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
other agencies for help. They have searched for a place to live--they are
temporarily renting an apartment on Pearl Street, about 10 blocks from
their old home.</TE>
<TE>   They worry about their health and that of the birds. They worry about
contaminants in their building, which could still take months to clean.
They struggle to comprehend their changed neighborhood--and to understand
their own survival.</TE>
<TE>   At first Gail couldn't imagine ever returning to Cedar Street.
Absolutely not, she said. She would rather take her birds and Nat and her
life and move far, far away.</TE>
<TE>   And then, gradually, as she read about the people who died, as they
became real to her, she began to feel that the least she could do in
their memory was go home.</TE>
<TE>   And so, five months later, she stands on her roof, and listens to the
incessant whine of machinery doing its grim recovery work in the pit
below.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it will work," she says tearfully. "Maybe we'll
always be haunted."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe they will heal, as Nat has believed from the start, when he
crept past the barricades in the early hours of Sept. 12 and into his
building. From the roof, he watched the first sunrise over ground zero.
And he felt sure. That the pain of their neighborhood will become a wound
that is part of their life. That they will do things to heal the wound,
like make a tapestry of feathers from the birds that escaped. They will
salvage their home. And, eventually, they will savor once again the sweet
daily rituals of life--Gail with her birds, he with his music--in their
bright, airy apartment at 125 Cedar Street.</TE>

<HD>Slavery Museum Plans Cause Flap in Virginia</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Some say putting it amid a commercial mall trivializes a
painful chapter in history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN G. BREED</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FREDERICKSBURG, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Just beyond the Shoney's billboard, where the rumble of Interstate
95 meets the roar of the Rappahannock River, the canopy of poplar, oak
and birch trees opens into a teardrop-shaped clearing.</LD>
<LD>   With wild turkeys and the occasional deer foraging in the winter
wheat, it's a 35-acre sylvan oasis in a concrete-and-asphalt desert.</LD>
<LD>   "To me," says Chris Hornung, an engineer with the developer, Silver
Companies, "it's a very dignified spot."</LD>
<TE>   But is it dignified enough for a museum about one of the longest,
darkest chapters in American history?</TE>
<TE>   The developer donated the $18-million parcel for the National Slavery
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In a few years, the museum will occupy a corner of Celebrate Virginia,
a planned 2,100-acre complex of offices, restaurants, hotels and shops.
Across the river, possibly connected by a cable car, would be three
championship golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   Some people here say the plans put an unseemly emphasis on tourism
over historical reverence, and they're worried the slavery museum will
end up being nothing more than the complex's "anchor tenant."</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, what they're doing is pimping black people," says Brenda
Sloan, a black woman and special collections curator at Mary Washington
College in town. "I mean, slavery was about taking advantage of black
people--white people taking advantage of black people for their own
financial gain.</TE>
<TE>   "And it seems like to me we have forgotten the history. We're getting
ready to repeat this."</TE>
<TE>   People have been pushing for a national museum that would address
slavery for decades, with no results. Now, all of a sudden, there may be
three.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Congress agreed to fund a presidential committee to plan
for a black heritage museum in Washington. And Charleston, S.C., the port
through which nearly half of the black slaves entered the country, is
well on its way to realizing plans for its Museum of the Passage.</TE>
<TE>   Former Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, the grandson of slaves, has led
efforts to build a slavery museum for nearly a decade, looking at sites
in Richmond, Hampton and even Jamestown, where the first African slaves
landed in North America. He backs the Fredericksburg plan.</TE>
<TE>   Fredericksburg, a growing city of about 21,000 between Richmond and
Washington, positively oozes with history. Home to George Washington's
mother, the city boasts more "original" 18th- and 19th-century buildings
than any other Virginia city.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place where druggists aren't druggists, but apothecaries, and
where it's not unusual to dig up a Civil War Minie ball along with your
crocus bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   A granite block at the corner William and Charles Streets, in front of
the old Planter's Hotel, doubled as a place for patrons to disembark
their carriages--and to auction their slaves.</TE>
<TE>   But some have suggested the city, while historic, lacks an
overwhelming connection to slavery that would make it a worthy site for
the estimated $200-million slavery museum.</TE>
<TE>   Carter Hudgins, a Mary Washington history professor who worked on the
Charleston museum project, says there's no place in the country that has
not been shaped in some way by slavery. So the notion of one place being
more deserving than another is irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, deserving has little to do with it, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's pro football teams or, in this case, a museum, it's who
raises their hands first and is most aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   But some of the loudest critics are those who might be expected to be
the biggest cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   Fredericksburg Mayor Bill Beck sits by a wood fire in his antique
shop, which occupies an 1831 row building a couple of doors from the
downtown visitor's center. On the wall above his cash register is a
poster showing George Washington with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears and the
caption: "All attempts to modernize our historic attractions have,
thankfully, failed."</TE>
<TE>   It's a reference to Walt Disney's ill-fated attempts a decade or so
ago to build a historical theme park amid the region's hallowed Civil War
battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   Beck, who is white, points to the neon-encrusted Central Park mall
that the Silver Companies developed along I-95 and has little confidence
the slavery museum's surroundings will look much different.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most difficult issue in American history," says Beck. "And
it needs to be handled in the best possible way we can."</TE>
<TE>   Some around town have taken to calling the museum "the interchange,"
implying that Silver thought including slavery in the development mix
would help its case for a new $500-million I-95 cloverleaf to serve
Celebrate Virginia. Silver officials deny that and say showcasing the
area's culture is an important goal of the development.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder dismisses opponents as a vocal minority who are against any
development--especially when it isn't downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't any controversy," he says. "The overwhelming majority of
the people in Fredericksburg want it."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Neiditch, chief consultant on the museum and a former
executive with the Holocaust Museum in Washington, says he is acutely
aware of the peril of appearing to turn slavery into a commodity.</TE>
<TE>   The museum board has already decided that it will not "create a
market" for slave items by purchasing artifacts to display. "Don't expect
us to go to EBay to buy something," Neiditch says.</TE>
<TE>   Silver has increased the size of its land donation to provide a larger
buffer zone around the museum. Neiditch has been assured that visitors
will not see the commercial development that surrounds them.</TE>
<TE>   "We've thought a great deal about the visitor family who will leave
the museum and the possibility of their desire to talk about what they've
just seen, to be somewhere in a space where they can think through what
they've just experienced," Neiditch says.</TE>
<TE>   But Sloan, at Mary Washington, wonders whether any number of trees or
shrubs would be enough to insulate the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds good," she says. "But we're still talking about the fact
that the slavery museum is going to be in a commercial amusement complex.
. . . There was nothing amusing about slavery."</TE>
<TE>   Having the museum in Fredericksburg could be an economic boon to the
area. Silver estimates Celebrate Virginia will generate an estimated
$22.6 million annually in state tax revenues and $171.3 million in annual
wages.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder has said he expects as many as 2 million people to visit the
museum annually.</TE>
<TE>   In Charleston too tourist dollars are one consideration in planning.</TE>
<TE>   "The Museum of the Passage extends the duration of family visits to
Charleston," a proposal reads. "If such a thing can be quantified, the
visitors' enjoyment of the city is multiplied by the impact of the
museum."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Chandler, director of the Avery Institute for African American
History at the College of Charleston, says any museum about slavery is "a
very interesting marketing challenge."</TE>
<TE>   "These days you have to think about a market," Chandler says from her
office in a restored Freedman's school. "You'd be foolish not to. . . .
At the same time, I think it represents an opportunity to have people who
would normally come just to have fun have the possibility of being
educated at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Davies, a former Fredericksburg mayor and supporter of
Wilder's effort, says the museum would make the city a destination for
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "History is a part of what this area's all about," says Davies, who is
black and a minister.</TE>
<TE>   But not all history is equivalent, especially when linked to
entertainment and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   When Disney asked Howard University's Russell Adams for advice on
whether its proposed history park should include a slavery component, he
concluded it would be "too close to the hamburgers."</TE>
<TE>   Adams, chairman of the university's African American Studies
department, says, "You don't have somebody eating cotton candy, watch an
auction, have a Coke and then watch another auction or whipping."</TE>
<TE>   Fath Davis Ruffins, a Smithsonian Institution historian who is

Museum, says people are extra sensitive when it comes to remembering
slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in these days of uncertain government support, Ruffins says
anyone who believes a museum about slavery or anything else can be opened
and maintained without corporate involvement is deluded.</TE>

<DH>Games: California pair just miss the gold as the first full day of
events goes without a hitch.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The host city of the 2002 Winter Olympics put a spectacular opening
ceremony in its rearview mirror Saturday and shifted into the high gear
of competition, with two American silver medals and a dramatic
performance by an Italian cross-country skier.</LD>
<LD>   On a clear, crisp day with temperatures in the mid-30s and none of the
feared traffic snarls and security delays, American speedskater Derek
Parra and skier Shannon Bahrke came close to taking gold medals before
being overtaken late in their competitions.</LD>
<LD>   Parra's effort was perhaps the most impressive because it was the
least expected and had perhaps the best story line. The speedskater, who
grew up in San Bernardino, won the silver in the 5,000 meters but had the
gold and a world record for about half an hour, before Jochem Uytdehaage
of the Netherlands, skating in the second-to-last group, outdid Parra by
more than three seconds. Parra's time of 6 minutes, 17.98 seconds had
topped the world record of 6:18.72, but Uytdehaage obliterated that in
6:14.66. The German bronze medalist, Jens Boden, was more than seven
seconds out of first.</LD>
<TE>   Parra, 33, is 5 feet 4 and 140 pounds, and unusually stocky in a sport
that favors taller competitors. His best race is not the 5,000 but the
1,500. Because he had little expectation of doing well in the 5,000, his
wife, Tiffany, was home in Orlando, Fla., with the couple's newborn
daughter and planned to come to Salt Lake for his Feb. 19 race in the
1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Parra had given up an inline skating career that brought him
international stature but didn't offer the opportunity to compete in the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "An Olympic medal, that's why I'm in speedskating," Parra said
recently. "It's the only reason."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Olympic Committee officials said Parra's medal is the first for a
Latino competing for the United States in a Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Bahrke, a 22-year-old from Tahoe City, Calif., competing in her first
Olympics, took the lead late in the women's freestyle moguls and held it
until Kari Traa of Norway turned in a score of 25.94, topping Bahrke's
25.06. Competitors are judged on air time and artistic excellence in a
series of jumps. Bahrke is a student at the University of Utah, majoring
in pharmacy. Tae Satoya of Japan finished third for the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   The first medal of the Games went to Italian Stefania Belmondo, who
was competing in her fourth Olympics and won the 15-kilometer freestyle
cross-country after breaking one of her poles and thinking she had no
chance. A spectator offered his, but it was the wrong size for the
5-foot-3 Belmondo. With less than 4 kilometers left, she trailed Russian
Larissa Lazutina by nearly nine seconds. But Belmondo's trainer got her a
new pole and she rallied to pass Lazutina and win by 1.8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "When I lost my pole," Belmondo said, "I thought for sure the race was
over for me."</TE>
<TE>   She won a gold medal in Albertville in 1992, but took the medal to a
ceremony in the Italian Alps a few months ago and it cracked. "I knew I
had to get another one," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two U.S. men did well in the Nordic combined event, setting up the
possibility of some history today. U.S. men have never won a medal in the
event, which features 90-meter ski jumping one day and a 15-kilometer
cross-country ski race the next. Todd Lodwick of Steamboat Springs,
Colo., was seventh Saturday after the jumping, and Bill Demong of
Vermontville, N.Y., was eighth. Lodwick said he felt he could pass up at
least three or four of the competitors in front of him. The highest
finish by an American in the event was Rolf Monsen's ninth in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City's opening ceremony, which drew the largest TV audience
for an Olympic opener with more than 72 million Americans tuning in to
NBC (57% more viewers than the Summer Olympics ceremony in Sydney two
years ago), was a hard act to follow. But the mild weather and
smooth-running transportation system helped keep spirits high.</TE>
<TE>   A bus driver from Alaska working for the Olympic committee said he had
been here two weeks, driving a bus he brought from Alaska. He said
traffic was running smoothly because the organizing committee had given
each driver one route and had them driving it for two weeks, at all hours
of the day and night, with empty buses. Another bus driver compared Salt
Lake City favorably against Atlanta, which suffered a transportation
nightmare when it hosted the 1996 Summer Games. There, the driver said,
organizers just handed him a map and never said another word to him. Both
drivers said the organizers asked them not to be quoted by name.</TE>
<TE>   Security went smoothly in most places, especially the speedskating
venue, where there was a sellout crowd of 5,000 for the afternoon session
and the wait in security lines was never more than 15 minutes. One
complaint came from Russian silver medalist Lazutina, who said that
"nobody has ever thrashed my personal belongings the way they've done it
this time. Each time we have to go through a checkpoint, it is a major
put-down for the athletes."</TE>
<TE>   But the winner of the cross-country race, Belmondo, said, "They do
their jobs. I understand. Good job, guys."</TE>
<TE>   Not receiving the same plaudits was NBC, which was criticized widely
in Sydney for delaying its telecast so events could be packaged for
dramatic airing. According to Associated Press, NBC ran a feature
Saturday about mogul skier Hannah Hardaway, setting up the later
prime-time telecast of her event, even though the event had ended an hour
before and she had already finished fifth. Another NBC announcer told the
viewers to tune in to a 3 p.m. telecast to "see the first medal of the
Games decided," even though that medal had been decided three hours
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Much as in Los Angeles in 1984, local residents had been asked to use
the buses and avoid driving, and all visitors were advised to avoid
bringing backpacks and coolers to the venues. The effort seemed to be
working. One spectator said she left everything at home because "I was
told to."</TE>
<TE>   That same spirit of cooperation was evident at Utah Olympic Park, the
venue for sledding and some ski jumping about 25 miles east of Salt Lake.
Venue chief Richard Perelman of Los Angeles said a crowd of about 17,000
showed up Saturday morning for the ski jumping portion of the Nordic
combined event. As part of a promotion, fans were told they could be
taken by van one mile up the hill to the viewing area or they could walk
up and receive a "gold medal mile" pin. Perelman said he had estimated
that two-thirds of the people would opt for the van. Instead, two-thirds
walked it, including a man on crutches.</TE>

<HD>Algerian Security Forces Kill Islamic Radical in Gun Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>Algerian security forces have killed Algeria's most wanted man, an
elusive Islamic radical who led a six-year terror campaign that caused
the slaughter of thousands of civilians, authorities announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Antar Zouabri, the alleged chieftain of the Armed Islamic Group, or
GIA, died Friday in a 2 1/2-hour gun battle with pursuing troops in his
hometown, Boufarik, about 15 miles south of Algiers, according to a
statement by the government.</LD>
<LD>   At a rare news conference, the Algerian military displayed the corpse
of Zouabri, who had been falsely reported dead in the past, along with
the bodies of two other alleged GIA combatants.</LD>
<TE>   "The identity of Antar Zouabri was confirmed by his fingerprints,"
said a regional army commander, Gen. Fodil Cherif Brahim, according to
wire service reports.</TE>
<TE>   Troops cornered Zouabri in a house near a stadium in Boufarik and
killed him after an exchange of gunfire and grenades, Brahim said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to playing a central role in an Algerian civil war that
has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1992, the GIA waged a campaign
of terrorist bombings in France in the mid-1990s. GIA terrorists also
hijacked an Air France jet in 1994 with the intent to crash it into the
Eiffel Tower--a plot that was foiled when a French SWAT team stormed the
plane on the ground in Marseille, killing four terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   And in the late 1990s, members of the GIA and its offshoot factions
became an important component of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network,
seeing combat in Afghanistan and Russia's separatist republic of Chechnya
and deploying in terrorist cells in Europe, North America and elsewhere.
Algerian terrorists aligned with Al Qaeda and based in Canada were behind
a failed attempt to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Zouabri, whose age is apparently unknown, became the emir, or leader,
of the GIA in 1996 after its former leader, Djamel Zitouni, was killed in
an internal feud. The GIA's stated goal is the imposition of
fundamentalist Islamic rule in Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   Under Zouabri's ruthless reign, the GIA engaged in indiscriminate
massacres of civilians, descending on villages and cutting victims'
throats by the hundreds, according to Algerian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The GIA's increasingly bloody methods hastened its split with a
dissident faction known as the Salafist Group for Call and Combat. Though
also ruthless and accused of killing civilians, that Islamic extremist
group has an announced policy of going after primarily military and
official targets.</TE>
<TE>   Zouabri's death is a major blow to the GIA, which had already been in
decline and now numbers only a few hundred fighters, according to press
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The Algerian security forces will now probably focus their crackdown
on the leader of the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, Hassan Hattab.
His followers also have been active in Al Qaeda terrorist cells
dismantled in recent months in Italy, Spain, France and other European
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The military-backed government of Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika has made considerable progress against Islamic fundamentalist
rebels since 1999 with a combination of force and pacification.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of former terrorists have accepted an amnesty offer from the
government. Scores of others have fallen in a fierce and murky war with
the security and intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   The Algerian civil conflict began in 1992, when the government
declared a state of emergency and blocked the election victory of Islamic
militants.</TE>

<DH>S. Africa: A Compton native provides funds to help give needy
students an education and a brighter future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOWETO, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, Keneilwe Mampe would walk the seven miles to and
from school because her single mother couldn't afford the bus fare: less
than 5 cents a day. With little money for lunch, the teen frequently
studied on an empty stomach. Her tuition often was paid late--or not at
all.</LD>
<LD>   There were doubts that Keneilwe, 15, an academic award winner at Dr.
Beyers Naude Secondary School in this sprawling black township outside
Johannesburg, would be able to enroll this year.</LD>
<LD>   And then along came Compton native Jose Bright, offering to pay for
Keneilwe's tuition, books, school supplies and uniform.</LD>
<TE>   "This is great," Keneilwe said last month after returning to school
from Christmas break. "I won't be struggling any more."</TE>
<TE>   She has become one of "Jose's kids"--20 students from impoverished
backgrounds unofficially "adopted" by Bright, who has lived in
Johannesburg for the last seven years. He covers the costs of their
education, with help from his family and friends in the United States.
His goal is to give the youngsters hope and a jump-start toward success.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives the youth a positive outlook on life and the resources to
make their dreams come true," he said. "I've seen dramatic changes."</TE>
<TE>   Bright, a 41-year-old graduate of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles,
worked as a legislative aide for a Washington city councilwoman and an
assistant to the U.S. capital's former mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, before
moving to South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a friend suggested Beyers Naude to Bright as a school
where worthy students were in need of help.</TE>
<TE>   Although annual fees are less than $100 at Beyers Naude, Bright said
about $500 a year is needed to adequately cover the cost of educating a
student, including tuition, transportation, uniforms, bags, books,
stationery and some food.</TE>
<TE>   His philanthropy has been invaluable in a country where the official
minimum wage is about $200 monthly and where many laborers earn far less.</TE>
<TE>   Aid recipients must be from households with monthly incomes of $50 or
less. But the most important prerequisite is scholastic prowess.</TE>
<TE>   "The learner has to be academically strong and have the capacity to
learn and help his community," Bright said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the recipients attend St. Matthews, a prestigious private Roman
Catholic school in Soweto.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is Bokang Shopane, 15. "I used to come to school without a
uniform and without food," said Bokang, who used to walk 45 minutes each
way when he attended Beyers Naude. "Sometimes when I came home, I found
that there was also no food, and I would go to sleep hungry. Then I used
to come to school very early so as not to think about breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   Bokang was sent to live with an aunt because his unemployed, single
mother could not afford to look after all four of her children. One of
his sisters left school so that Bokang could continue his studies.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bokang's life has greatly changed thanks to Bright, whom he
considers to be nothing less than a guardian angel.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know that if I have any kind of problem, I can always call Mr.
Bright and he will make a plan," said Bokang, who wants to study
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Bright first visited this country in 1994 at the invitation of a South
African delegation he had met in Washington. Captivated by the country's
transformation from apartheid to democratic rule, he decided to
immigrate. He works as a consultant for public and private sectors,
helping to coordinate investment projects, diversity training and
conflict-management strategies.</TE>
<TE>   It was never Bright's plan to "adopt" 20 poverty-stricken kids. But
fate said otherwise, he said. It started when American friends came to
visit and wanted to tour Soweto. Bright obliged.</TE>
<TE>   Schools were on break, and many kids were hanging around. Bright
chatted with some of them about their lives. They took him to see the
corrugated iron and clapboard hovels they called home.</TE>
<TE>   "That evening when I went home, I could not sleep because I have a
huge house and they live in these shacks," recalled Bright, who lives in
a Johannesburg suburb.</TE>
<TE>   He decided that he would try to help just one child. But when he
calculated the costs, he found that he could afford to finance the
education of five students at a total cost of about $2,500 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Beyers Naude chose 10 students to meet with Bright. Their
stories were so heart-wrenching, and each showed such unique promise,
that he was determined to help all of them. He turned to friends and
family. With donations, 10 recipients became 20.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the pupils are being helped by the Washington-based African
American Literary Society, to which Bright once belonged. More money
comes out of Bright's pocket each year to sponsor excursions.</TE>
<TE>   Bright meets with all 20 youths each Tuesday afternoon and gives them
a pep talk. They also attend frequent workshops to review learning skills
and exam techniques with a tutor.</TE>
<TE>   Bright is confident that most of his South African students are
university-bound. Keen to assist more children, he is setting up an
educational trust, named for the late Jabulani Vilakazi, a Soweto
philanthropist.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud because that was my husband's wish, to help
schoolchildren," Jackie Vilakazi said. "To get a person like [Bright]
filling his boots was really a dream come true. My hope is to see [the
students] become doctors, professional people and even presidents of
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Bright's wards have no doubts about where they are headed.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to say, ' I'm not going to be a doctor, I don't have the money
to study, my mum and dad are dead,' " said Mbali Rena, 14, who lives with
her grandmother and three siblings. "I now say I can do anything I want
to do, and I can also be like Mr. Bright and help others."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Bright points to the students and their determination to get
an education and says it would almost be a crime not to help.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that I am making a difference and that these children now have
a better future ahead of them," he said.</TE>

<HD>Finest Turkish Carpets Come With a Story to Tell</HD>
<DH>Culture: The handiwork of the craftspeople often includes
fascinating details of their lives woven into the pattern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HARMONIE TOROS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>Sip your tea and listen.</LD>
<LD>   "You are looking at a handmade, natural-dyed kilim from eastern
Anatolia," says Suleyman Ozcan, letting the thin, flat-woven rug slowly
drop to the floor revealing a design of intense burgundy, indigo and dark
green. "But most of all, you are looking at the work and dreams of a
young girl."</LD>
<LD>   The girl wove two eagle heads--the balance between power and
fertility, man and woman. She wove an hourglass--the symbol of eternal
love.</LD>
<TE>   And that's just one dream, one rug.</TE>
<TE>   In the vaulted lanes of Istanbul's centuries-old Grand Bazaar,
listening to carpet tales will take you from Bulgaria to China, from the
15th century to today. Carpet-shopping, a key part of most tourists'
visits to Istanbul, becomes a voyage of discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many human stories that are part of the ritual of buying
a carpet--our stories, the stories of the dealers, the stories of the
makers," says Gary Dunning, the manager of the Big Apple Circus in New
York. Sitting amid piles of carpets, kilims, sumaks and cicims, Dunning
has bought three hand-woven kilims.</TE>
<TE>   The ritual begins with its most unpleasant part: the hassling, as
salesmen call to tourists and try to entice them into one of Istanbul's
hundreds of carpet shops inside or outside the bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary. You feel you are in a game where you are going to be the
loser," says Jacqueline Billiard, a tourist from Rouen, France.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the doorstep of a stall looking skeptically at a merchant
showing her some newly made floral rugs, she adds: "You feel that if you
accept that cup of tea, you then have to buy something."</TE>
<TE>   Alice Kornhauser, an Internet consultant from New York visiting the
bazaar, says most tourists are anxious about being cajoled to check a
shop because they don't realize what awaits inside.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing that happens is that you are invited in, as if someone
is inviting you into their living room to see their holiday pictures. It
becomes very intimate," she says.</TE>
<TE>   First comes the tea--the strong Turkish tea served in a small glass,
or apple tea, a sweet mix invented for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   With the drink comes a lesson in rugs: the difference between a
carpet, knotted wool or silk rug with pile, and a kilim, a flat weave
without pile. There are also bright-colored sumaks--embroidered rugs,
often in silk with representations of animals--and cicims (pronounced
ji-jims), flat-woven kilims with small symbols embroidered on them.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the question of quality: Is the wool hand-spun or machine
spun, the carpet hand-knotted or machine-made? Are the dyes chemical or
natural--extracted, for example, from eggplants? In rugs at least 100
years old, there can be dyes from ladybugs, which give an intense blood
red nearly impossible to find in commercial chemical-dyed rugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to educate people, inform them," says Feti Tekes, joint owner
of two stores in the bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, dealers are mainly there to sell, and they acknowledge that
most foreigners who enter their dusty shops are more interested in buying
a carpet the right color and size for their living room or bedroom, and
at a price that fits their budget.</TE>
<TE>   But it's while sifting through the hundreds of types, qualities and
styles that the stories emerge.</TE>
<TE>   Designs can tell stories. The tree of life--an often long, thin trunk
with short symmetrical branches--is thought by some to be a shamanic or
totemic design, while others say it symbolizes the link between the
paradise above and the world down below.</TE>
<TE>   Rugs also tell the tale of the weaver, often a woman. Mothers looking
for wives for their sons in rural Turkey always asked to see the
handicraft of potential brides. Good weaving meant a woman was meticulous
and would probably make a good wife.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the history of a region or a people. Kilims made by Kurds
are often "double-winged," with two symmetrical halves sewn together,
because the Kurds are nomads and large looms are too heavy to carry. The
two halves are never identical.</TE>
<TE>   Dunning remembers buying a carpet and in the excitement forgetting to
ask where it was made. "If I knew what village or what family made it, it
would be so much more meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   As the value of the rugs increase, the stories that accompany each
piece become more and more important.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be prepared to answer any questions that the customer
might have," says Erol Kazanci, who mainly sells to collectors and
international dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Kazanci pulls out an 1870s Moghan carpet from Azerbaijan, its pile so
soft it feels like fur. Not only can he tell you everything you would
ever want to know about the carpet itself, he can also recount the
migration of the family that owned it--a family from Azerbaijan that
moved to the Turkish city of Trabzon on the Black Sea in 1891.</TE>
<TE>   He says he had been after the piece for years and finally persuaded
the family to sell it to him for $9,000 last March.</TE>
<TE>   At Kazanci's level, sellers know little more than the shoppers, many
of them collectors.</TE>
<TE>   Franco Ragazzi, an engineer who represents the Italian truck company
Iveco in Turkey, has spent just about every Saturday morning in the
bazaar over the past 13 years sifting through piles of carpets.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first days in the bazaar, Ragazzi says a piece he was
interested in jumped from $4,000 to $9,000 as dealers learned of his
interest and traded it among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Since, he has made an art of carpet buying, first building a
collection and then selling it to be able to start again.</TE>
<TE>   "You forget the outside world, the worries, and relax and accept a
tea. Then, the real adventure begins."</TE>

<HD>Ins and Outs of Rug Buying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some basic information on shopping for carpets:</LD>
<LD>   Rug types:</LD>
<LD>   * Carpets: Knotted wool or silk rugs with pile. Design can be
geometric, floral or nomadic. Prayer carpets have mihrab, a prayer arch,
on one end only.</LD>
<TE>   * Kilims: Flat woven rugs with no pile. More nomadic in design, often
bearing tribal symbols. Also used as spreads to eat on (sofra) or sacks
to carry goods (cuval).</TE>
<TE>   * Sumaks: Embroidered, flat weaves, mainly made of silk but also wool
and cotton. Elaborate designs, many bearing animals; often very vivid
colors.</TE>
<TE>   * Cicims: Kilims with small symbols embroidered on them.</TE>
<TE>   Quality:</TE>
<TE>   * Weaving: Sharp contrast between handmade and machine-made. Latter
often made of synthetic thread, with rough designs and poor color
combinations.</TE>
<TE>   * Thread: Synthetic considered poorest quality. Wool best when
hand-spun rather than machine-spun. Increasingly difficult to find
100%-pure silk rugs.</TE>
<TE>   * Dying: Natural dyes from vegetables or animals considered better
quality. Chemical dyes in use since late 19th century and few new carpets
made with natural dyes. Natural dyes fade over time. Chemical dyes can
run.</TE>
<TE>   Age:</TE>
<TE>   * New: Usually produced in last 20 years. Most of poor quality, using
synthetic materials and dyes. New rugs of hand-spun wool or natural dyes
tend to be pricey, particularly in Turkey where price of labor is rising.</TE>
<TE>   * Semi-Old: 50-100 years old. Colors often a mix of chemical and
natural dyes; wool usually hand-spun. Silk rugs usually have chemical
dyes. Most bargains are found in semi-old carpets that dealers pick up
cheaply in rural villages.</TE>
<TE>   * Old: More than 100 years old. Some chemical colors found, but most
materials of high quality and hand-spun.</TE>
<TE>   Buying tips:</TE>
<TE>   * Looking: Take time to see numerous pieces, preferably in different
shops. Ask questions. Never feel forced to buy.</TE>
<TE>   * Bargaining: Always bargain; prices can drop dramatically. Many
buyers consider bargaining half the fun.</TE>
<TE>   * Shipping: Most shops ship carpets for extra fee anywhere in world.</TE>

<HD>China Frees Supplier of Bibles</HD>
<DH>Religion: Businessman convicted of bringing holy books to mainland
returns to Hong Kong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>A Hong Kong businessman convicted of smuggling Bibles into China
returned to the territory Saturday after he was released from a Chinese
prison.</LD>
<LD>   A Hong Kong Security Bureau statement said officials have been in
touch with Li Guangqiang's family since his return. It gave no other
details.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush, who is to visit China this month, had expressed
concern about Li's case and asked the State Department to look into it.
Li, a member of the Hong Kong branch of the Anaheim-based Local Church,
was sentenced last month for bringing thousands of Bibles to a banned
Chinese Christian group in May.</LD>
<TE>   A fellow member of the church in China, Lin Junhua, said he was
delighted about Li's release.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank the Lord for his release--this is the work of the Lord," Lin
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Lin said the church will continue to pray for the release of
mainlanders Lin Xifu and Yu Zhudi, who were convicted along with Li last
month and were given three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Also speaking from China, Lin Xifu's wife, Lin Huajing, said that she
saw her husband early Saturday and that she was worried about his heart
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's official New China News Agency said earlier that Li would be
released from prison but placed under surveillance to receive treatment
for hepatitis B.</TE>
<TE>   A court in the city of Fuqing ruled Saturday that Li can serve part of
his sentence outside prison because of his health, the news agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Li, 38, was convicted of illegally selling foreign publications inside
China, although he was initially charged with "using a cult to undermine
enforcement of the law."</TE>

<HD>East Timor OKs Draft of Charter</HD>
<DH>Asia: The constitution will take effect in May, when full
independence will be achieved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DILI, East Timor
</DL>
<LD>East Timor's constituent assembly Saturday approved a draft of a
new constitution, which provides for a legislature, a judiciary and a
president whose role is mostly symbolic.</LD>
<LD>   The final document is expected to be officially adopted in early March
and to take effect in May.</LD>
<LD>   Later this month, officials are scheduled to tour the country
collecting suggestions for changes. After the five-day consultation, the
assembly will consider amendments before approving the national charter.</LD>
<TE>   "The system we have chosen is loosely based on the Portuguese system.
It is mostly parliamentary with a weak presidency," said Arlindo Marcal,
the assembly's deputy speaker.</TE>
<TE>   The head of state will be dependent on the support of the political
parties.</TE>
<TE>   The 88-member assembly voted 65-0 to approve the draft. Thirteen
lawmakers abstained, and 10 were absent.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor was a Portuguese colony for 350 years before being invaded
by Indonesia in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   It has been under U.N. administration since 1999, after widespread
fighting that followed a vote by a majority of its 700,000 people for
independence from Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The territory, which occupies half of Timor island, is scheduled to
achieve full independence May 20. A president will be elected April 14.
Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao, East Timor's charismatic independence
leader, is widely expected to win.</TE>

<HD>Rats Invade Menus of Taiwan Eateries</HD>
<DH>Food: Diners can't get enough of the rodents, now prized for their
dark-meat delectability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNIE HUANG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHIAYI, Taiwan
</DL>
<LD>Having rats in the kitchen would scare away most diners. But at the
Peaceful Happiness Restaurant, customers love the critters--stir-fried,
stewed or mixed with noodles.</LD>
<LD>   The small, no-frills restaurant is one of several in this southern
Taiwan city that are serving the rodents, whose flesh has a rubbery,
chewy texture and tastes like dark turkey meat with a bit of a gamy
flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Many Taiwanese are adventurous eaters who have no qualms about
munching on deep-fried hornets, crickets, sea slugs, snakes and dogs.
Some are inspired by curiosity or the quest for novelty, while others
believe unusual food has medicinal properties.</LD>
<TE>   Although business was brisk during a recent lunch hour at Peaceful
Happiness, cook Hung Hung-wen acknowledged that some people--especially
women--draw the line when it comes to eating rats.</TE>
<TE>   "The meat is tender and clean. It's a pity that women are usually too
frightened to try it," said Hung, whose business card shows a rodent with
a red bow tied to its long tail.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a chef's white jacket, Hung arranged ingredients for a stir
fry on a stainless steel counter in his spotless kitchen: red peppers,
ginger, garlic and two large rats on a plate--their fur and whiskers
cleanly shaved off with a razor and their ears removed. A thick tongue
stuck out of one rat's open mouth that revealed a big yellow buck tooth.</TE>
<TE>   As in other small-town restaurants in Taiwan, Hung's kitchen is at the
front of the restaurant, allowing customers to watch him as he chopped
rat carcasses into chunks and threw them into a small pot with other
ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   He said his rats are especially tasty because they're caught in farm
fields. "Unlike house rats, these field rats exercise a lot and have
strong muscles."</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby table, customer Lee Tien-hua gave a thumbs-up sign after
putting a piece of rat meat into his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good," said Lee, a Chiayi County government official.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's party of eight drank beer and joked as they feasted on rat stew
in a clay pot, fried shrimp and braised pork.</TE>
<TE>   Many farmers moonlight as rat catchers in Chiayi's sugar cane fields.
A pound of rat meat fetches a little over $4, five times that of chicken
meat and more than double that of pork.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the rat meat served at Peaceful Happiness and other
restaurants is supplied by a man known locally as the "Rat catcher
King"--Cheng Chiu-nan, a 46-year-old melon farmer with a dark, leathery
face and a passion for stalking vermin.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say Cheng holds the national rat-catching record of 600 in one
night.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers use nets to catch rats, which start scurrying when they
hear the roar of tractors and threshers. Others use dogs to track the
rodents when they squeeze down holes.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng dismisses such rat catchers as amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   "They even catch skinny rats," he scoffed. "Rats are nocturnal
animals. One should do the job at night."</TE>
<TE>   Cheng's favorite rat-hunting tool is the ankle-busting steel spring
trap. His wife helps him harvest the trapped critters, which get thrown
into a sack he carries over his back. For a visitor, he grabbed about
seven wiggling, grayish brown rats by the tails and held them up like a
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing the bags into the back of his pickup truck, Cheng takes them
back to his garage. The rats are kept in steel mesh cages, where they
squeal and crawl over each other as they wait to be butchered and shaved
with a barber's razor by Cheng's wife, who handles the rats with pink
dishwashing gloves.</TE>
<TE>   As the oldest of six sons, Cheng subsidized his father's meager farm
income by fishing in drainage ditches and rivers. But when the water
became polluted and the fish disappeared, he switched to catching snakes
used for soup.</TE>
<TE>   He got out of the snake business when the government began levying
heavy fines on those who catch rare or endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   He finally found his niche with rats.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be a millionaire if I did not squander my money on gambling and
womanizing when I was younger," he said.</TE>

<HD>Embattled Arafat Vows to Continue His Struggle</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Interviewed at his besieged home, the leader reaffirms his
mission to promote the Palestinian cause.</DH>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>About the time Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon began his fourth
White House powwow in a year, Yasser Arafat was tucking into a bowl of
vegetable soup at his headquarters in this besieged city, where he has
been confined for two months.</LD>
<LD>   As Sharon huddled with President Bush last week, the Palestinian
Authority president supped with his own aides beneath a photograph of
Jerusalem, the holy city that seems farther from his reach than ever.
With Israeli tanks outside his front door and army checkpoints encircling
Ramallah, Arafat looked like a man running out of options.</LD>
<LD>   Then Sharon's meeting ended. Bush said that Arafat must crack down on
terrorism, by which he meant the suicide attacks that have characterized
the Palestinians' 16-month uprising. But the president refused the prime
minister's request to sever diplomatic ties with Arafat. Bush made it
clear that the United States will remain engaged with the Palestinian
Authority.</LD>
<TE>   "Not to forget," Arafat said in an interview early Friday. "I have
sent my delegation there. We are in permanent contact with the American
administration. [There are] letters between me and President Bush and
also contacts with his foreign minister, Colin Powell. . . . I am not
afraid."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leader is down but not yet out.</TE>
<TE>   At 72, Arafat is nothing if not a survivor. He has outflanked many
enemies during his incarnations as nationalist guerrilla, Nobel
peacemaker, Palestinian statesman and--in Sharon's words--terrorist
leader. The question now is whether Arafat can survive Sharon, his old
nemesis from Israel's war in Lebanon in the early 1980s. Is Arafat the
lion in winter fading into history, or is he a phoenix ready to rise
again?</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is not me," Arafat told two English-speaking
journalists. "It is my people, the cause of the Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   To promote his cause, Arafat is speaking to the international press.
He knows the value of propaganda. In 1949, a year after the founding of
Israel, he published his first magazine, the Voice of Palestine, in which
he vowed to fight "the Zionist entity" and "agent of imperialism" in the
Middle East. He has published and proselytized ever since.</TE>
<TE>   But an interview with Arafat has never been an easy proposition. He
works late at night and without any discernible regard for appointments.
He often ignores questions in order to deliver statements. And now there
is the added difficulty of the siege.</TE>
<TE>   Getting into Ramallah these days is nearly as difficult as getting
out. Several lanes of traffic converge into one at an Israeli army
checkpoint where drivers blow their horns and jockey with one another to
get through an obstacle course of concrete roadblocks. Pedestrians weave
their way among cars, trucks, mud, dust and exhaust fumes to a fenced
gangway that has become a marketplace. On the way into
Palestinian-controlled territory, there are bananas, toy bunnies and
water pipes for sale, but it seems few people have the money to buy or
the desire to remain a second longer than necessary in a place that looks
like Tijuana-meets-the-Berlin Wall.</TE>
<TE>A Long Wait at Ramallah Hotel</TE>
<TE>   The walkway empties into a knot of yellow taxis with green
Palestinian-issue license plates parked every which way and waiting with
open doors to take pedestrians into downtown Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   The orders are to go to the Grand Park Hotel in Ramallah, check into a
room and wait. Wait it is. The first appointment is preempted by a
Revolutionary Council meeting. A second is delayed when a Palestinian
gunman kills an Israeli woman, her 11-year-old daughter and a reserve
soldier in a Jordan Valley settlement and Israel launches retaliatory
airstrikes in the West Bank city of Nablus. The third try will succeed if
no major violence intervenes.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Arafat spoke to about 3,000 supporters who had
gathered inside his compound to show their solidarity ahead of Sharon's
meeting with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "To Jerusalem we will go, martyrs in the millions!" they chanted.</TE>
<TE>   For Palestinians, a suicide bomber is a shahid, or martyr. Rather than
condemn the practice, Arafat is defiant.</TE>
<TE>   "The tanks Sharon has sent here are the same he had in Beirut," he
said, referring to Sharon's role as defense minister in the 1982 invasion
of Lebanon and siege of Beirut, which forced Arafat to flee his
stronghold there. "Bring me the tanks not only to the gate of the
headquarters but to the bedroom door. Their tanks and airplanes do not
frighten us."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat emerges from a four-hour meeting with officials of his Fatah
movement that has clearly left him exhausted. His lower lip trembles, as
do his alabaster hands. Dressed in his trademark uniform and kaffiyeh, he
leads his guests to a dining room table laid with white cloth, a
centerpiece of chrysanthemums and daisies, and place settings for about
20 people. Among the diners are his deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, who met with
Sharon earlier this month, and Marwan Barghouti, the streetwise leader of
Fatah in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is an abundance of food, Arafat's diet is austere. He
barely speaks during his meal of soup, hard-boiled egg whites, bread
dipped in honey and black poppy seeds, and sliced fruit. But he is a
concerned host.</TE>
<TE>   "Try this, it is healthy," he says of his favorite dip. Like a Jewish
mother, he puts food from his own plate onto those of his guests, urging
them to eat more.</TE>
<TE>   He points to the photograph of Jerusalem on the wall in front of him
and indicates the area of the Old City where his uncle's house was--and
where Arafat lived as boy for four years. He says Israel demolished the
neighborhood after occupying Jerusalem in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the meal is over. Everyone rises at once, and Arafat heads
into his office, where there are enlarged photographs of Jerusalem's
golden Dome of the Rock and several paperweights of Mecca's central
shrine. He dons oversized black glasses and, for several minutes, signs
official papers with an aide by his side in what is obviously meant to be
a demonstration of his authority: The president who signed the 1993 Oslo
peace agreement with Israel and returned to rule the West Bank and Gaza
Strip is still in charge. He is still doing business.</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat's realm is clearly reduced, and the 3 million Palestinians
in his jurisdiction are living in such a bad way that even Bush and
Sharon acknowledged their plight. More than 830 Palestinians and 250
Israelis have died in the violence of the last 16 months, and tens of
thousands of people have been wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The violence, together with a punishing blockade of Palestinian towns
and cities and Israeli military strikes, cost the Palestinian economy
$3.2 billion in the first year of the uprising, according to United
Nations estimates. Israel has destroyed Arafat's three helicopters, his
airport, seaport and small ships amassed under the Oslo accord. The
Israeli army has razed hundreds of homes and thousands of acres of crops
either in retaliatory strikes or to prevent the sites from being used by
Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>Past Agreements, Meetings Are Recalled</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is a growing lawlessness in the
Palestinian-controlled areas as Israel destroys Arafat's vestiges of
power, his police stations and security buildings.</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat has a plan for stopping the violence and ending the
stalemate, he does not say so in an interview that finally begins after
midnight. He speaks more about the past, about the peace agreement he
signed with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his frequent visits
to the White House during President Clinton's years, than he does about
the future.</TE>
<TE>   He makes lists of meetings he held and agreements he signed. At first,
this seems the ramblings of an old man, but then a theme emerges.</TE>
<TE>   "I have signed the agreement of the peace of the brave with the
Israelis. Not to forget, we started at the Madrid conference [in 1991],
which was started by President Bush the father and which we hope will be
completed by President Bush the son."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Arafat routinely puts the blame for the current
violence on Israel--just as the Israeli government blames him alone. He
does not take responsibility for any of it. The uprising, he says, began
because Sharon visited the plaza outside Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque to
demonstrate Israeli sovereignty, with then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leader presents himself as the one who tried to
prevent the fateful visit with a direct appeal to Barak, and not, as the
Israeli government believes, as the one who capitalized on it afterward
to unleash a wave of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat does not want to talk about the gunmen and suicide bombers who
have killed themselves and scores of Israelis. He talks about the
violence inflicted on Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Why have they bombed some of our schools? Why have they bombed some
of our hospitals, some of our holy sacred places, Christian and Muslim?
Why are they making this siege and preventing us even to send food to
many of our cities and towns? In some villages, they have even destroyed
some of our water wells. We are obliged to smuggle water into some of
these villages. Can you imagine it?"</TE>
<TE>   His anger is genuine, but like his Israeli counterparts, he is unable
or unwilling to confront the anger of the other side.</TE>
<TE>   How, he is asked, can he condemn suicide attacks when the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, members of a clandestine wing of his Fatah movement,
claim responsibility for some of them?</TE>
<TE>   "What? They are not Fatah. They are near to some Fatah leaders, but
they are not Fatah," he says, cutting off the discussion with a withering
look.</TE>
<TE>   He does not say whether he can rein in these militant forces.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat does, however, seek to clarify his position on the so-called
right of return of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from Israel
after the founding of the state in 1948. Seeking to assuage Israelis'
fears that he wants the millions of Palestinians and their descendants
resettled inside Israel, he says that his primary concern is the
approximately 200,000 refugees "in a very difficult situation" in
Lebanon, whom he said he would like returned over three to five years.</TE>
<TE>   Even that figure would be seen as unacceptable to the Sharon
government.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said in a recent interview that he regretted not having killed
Arafat 20 years ago in Lebanon, when he had the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat will not be drawn into their old feud. He says he is ready to
make peace with Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the choice of the Israeli people. I deal with any person
elected by Israel," he says. "I am ready. I am ready at any time to
continue this important peace."</TE>
<TE>   He rises at the end of the interview and opens a cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this," he says, pulling out a Christmas card. "You see, it is
from President Bush."</TE>
<TE>   There is a message here too. Arafat may not be in the White House, but
he is still on the presidential Christmas card list.</TE>

<HD>Big Business Is Pulsing Through Carnaval in Rio</HD>
<DH>Brazil: The celebration, which began in the slums as a contest
among samba schools, has become a vast industry with corporate
sponsorship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO
</DL>
<LD>The people who turned this city's Carnaval parade into a
multimillion-dollar enterprise of feather headpieces, fanciful floats and
gyrating dancers in expensive costumes have even bigger plans afoot.</LD>
<LD>   Hiram Araujo, the event's cultural advisor, envisions a "spectacle"
with the glitz and commercial appeal of a major Broadway hit or an NBA
basketball game.</LD>
<LD>   "Carnaval isn't yet what it could be," Araujo said. "We are still
learning how to administer the product."</LD>
<TE>   With each year, Carnaval in Rio grows more exclusive and
business-driven, more distant from its roots in the favelas, or slums,
that are home to the samba schools that put together the annual parade.</TE>
<TE>   In the favelas, Carnaval was molded into a cultural rite synonymous
with "Brazilianness" and the spontaneous expression of joy. The poor
people of the favelas marched into the center of Rio in extravagant but
homemade costumes, singing improvised songs in a bacchanal celebration
that any onlooker was welcome to join.</TE>
<TE>Samba Schools Attract Big-Money Backers</TE>
<TE>   Today the neighborhoods' sambistas, or dancers, are still a part of
the celebration, but now they are at the center of a vast and complex
industry that employs untold numbers of seamstresses, marketing
specialists and even a fair number of plastic surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   This year, for the first time, 10 of the 14 schools that will compete
for prizes in the two-day parade beginning today will have corporate
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are a business, we have partnerships," said Zelia Lima
Coutinho, a 74-year-old member of the old guard in the Mangueira favela,
home of one of the oldest and most beloved of the samba schools. "I miss
those times, and have saudade for them," she added, using a word that
means, all at once, nostalgia, feeling and friendship.</TE>
<TE>   The first big-money backers of the modern parade were the men who run
the illegal street lottery called jogo do bicho. In the beginning, they
were in it for nothing more than a bit of neighborhood prestige, hoping
to back the winner in the competition for best samba school. But then
Carnaval started to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Today the parade is a cash machine producing wealth for Rio's tourist
industry. This week, an estimated 370,000 visitors to Rio will spend
about $130 million, according to the local tourist board. Many will pay
steeply inflated prices for hotel rooms, meals and child care.</TE>
<TE>   Putting on the show is a year-round "factory without smokestacks,"
said Ricardo Pavao, one of the Carnaval designers who oversee small
armies of singers, construction workers and the sculptors who help
decorate the floats.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket receipts from the 60,000-seat "Sambadrome," where the parade is
held, have financed more costly competition among samba schools. There
are more dancers, with more elaborate costumes. The floats are more
audacious--last year, one entry paid a stuntman to levitate above its
dancers with a NASA-built rocket pack.</TE>
<TE>   The Globo television network paid $4 million to the League of
Independent Samba Schools, the parade organizer, for the exclusive rights
to broadcast the event to an estimated 20 million Brazilian viewers. Such
a big audience is irresistible to advertisers--even though corporate
symbols are prohibited in the parade. "We Brazilians always find a way
around these problems," Araujo said.</TE>
<TE>   A company can, for example, dictate the story, or enredo, that a given
samba school tells with its floats, costumes and songs. This year, the
Salgueiro school will dedicate its floats to the history of Brazilian
aviation, with the founder of the Brazilian airline TAM portrayed as a
mannequin the size of a whale. TAM is sponsoring Salgueiro to the tune of
$500,000.</TE>
<TE>   TAM's biggest rival, Varig, is sponsoring the Beija Flor school.
"We're going to put billboards across Rio to give visibility to our
partnership," Isabel Werneck, promotions director for Varig, told the
daily O Globo.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to the parade cost between $9 and $260. The most exclusive
box, with six seats, goes for more than $1,500. Organizers erected wooden
barriers on the streets around the Sambadrome to keep out gate-crashers.</TE>
<TE>   "No one from a favela can afford to see the Carnaval parade," said
Fabio Gondim Palazzo, a naval engineer and samba devotee who organizes
one of the small, independent parades that grow each year, thanks in part
to disaffection with the official parade. "The price of just one ticket
is what people in a favela make in a month."</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, well within memory of some participants of this
year's parade, when people in Rio could enjoy the main Carnaval parade
for free from the sidewalks of the city center. They brought fruit crates
and benches from home to stand on. Samba dancers with torches provided
the lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "We would dance for four days," said the Mangueira school's Coutinho,
known to her friends as Tia Zelia. First, they would march for about two
hours in the Carnaval parade, then they would take the parade to other
favelas. "Now we get 80 minutes in the Sambadrome, and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   The samba league's Araujo sees the changes as a mark of progress. "We
march in a Sambadrome, and let's not forget that dromo means speed in
Greek. What you have now is a parade with velocity, a virtual experience
where you don't see the dancer so much."</TE>
<TE>Schools Had Humble Beginnings in Slums</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, samba schools were neighborhood institutions.
Mangueira, in northern Rio, was founded in 1928. In the early part of the
20th century, Rio celebrations marking the start of Lent were prim and
proper affairs, costume balls attended by the elite. The favelas' poor
residents paraded through the streets to African-influenced rhythms. The
fusion of those European and African traditions created the modern
Carnaval parade and the music called samba.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Mangueira's dresses were sewn by the women who danced in
them, many of whom worked by candlelight at home. The costumes were made
in variations of the samba school's colors: pink (symbolic of love, one
veteran says) and green (for hope). The people who composed, performed
and sang the school's song lived in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, a growing number of dancers are upper- and middle-class Rio
residents, or foreigners who pay a hefty price to buy a costume and join
a "wing" of performers. A model or actress looking for television
exposure might pay thousands of dollars for the dress and a spot riding
atop a float or dancing in front of a samba school's corps of drummers.</TE>
<TE>   Some Rio plastic surgeons say their business goes up by as much as 70%
in the months before Carnaval. Fabiana Andrade, a 24-year-old model,
recently said she will have had 13 "fat-removal" sessions by the time she
dances today with the Imperio Serrano samba school.</TE>
<TE>   To attract well-off sambistas, some schools hold tryouts in the
fashionable southern neighborhoods of Rio. Even an inexpensive costume
can cost $200, double the monthly minimum wage here.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people dancing for Mangueira who are from Japan, from
France, from Germany," said Ari "Arizinho" Jorge da Silva, a member of
Mangueira's old guard.</TE>
<TE>   How well do they samba?</TE>
<TE>   Da Silva frowned. "These people come to play samba," he said. "For us,
Mangueira is something we carry in our hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologist Maria Laura Viveiros, who wrote a book on the annual
event, sees the parade as a cultural institution that has begun to lose
its edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until the 1980s, the samba schools of Rio were important symbols
of Brazilian national identity," Viveiros said. "Now I don't think that's
true."</TE>
<TE>   Among certain Carnaval connoisseurs, Rio's celebration takes a back
seat to the somewhat less commercialized parade in the northeastern
Brazilian city of Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Viveiros and other Carnavalologists say the parade began to change
dramatically--for better or worse--with the 1984 construction of the
Sambadrome, officially known as the Passarela do Samba, or Samba Walkway.
The concrete stadium, designed by Marxist architect Oscar Niemayer and
built along several blocks of a central Rio street, made Carnaval a
profitable enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   The underworld's continued support of samba schools has given it a
chance to present a respectable face to Rio society. At the same time,
the schools have gained stature as community institutions.</TE>
<TE>   And Viveiros sees something positive in the growing corporate
sponsorship of the schools. "It might be possible for the schools to
break free of the control of the bicheros," Viveiros said, referring to
the men who control the lottery game.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the changing nature of Carnaval, the samba schools remain a
source of pride in the favelas that created them. "I don't think Carnaval
has lost its popular character yet," Viveiros said. "When it starts to
lose its popular character, it will be finished."</TE>
<TE>   For the members of Mangueira's old guard, the day they march in
Carnaval--this year it will be Monday, beginning at 10 p.m.--is still the
highlight of their year.</TE>
<TE>   "When we step into the Sambadrome and we hear those people cheering,
we still cry," said Da Silva, 69. "And then we do the best we can do
defend the flag and the honor of the school."</TE>

country, members of the unofficial delegation said.</LD>
<LD>   The trip had been arranged at North Korea's invitation as a way to
expand informal dialogue between the two countries.</LD>
<LD>   Bush last month accused North Korea, Iraq and Iran of threatening

</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Argentines took to the streets early Saturday, banging
pots and pans in the latest peaceful protest against a government unable
to end a chaotic recession in its fourth year.</LD>
<LD>   President Eduardo Duhalde on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to scale
back government spending. But thousands of angry protesters responded
with a march on the presidential palace, yelling insults at the
beleaguered president.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd that gathered around the Casa Rosada, numbering more than
3,000, also blamed Supreme Court judges and Argentine politicians for the
country's deep economic crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds more protested outside Duhalde's residence, snarling traffic
and holding up signs calling for banks to return their partially frozen
bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us back our money!" read some signs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Duhalde announced moves to reduce Argentina's government by
25% to achieve a $500-million spending cut. The International Monetary
Fund has demanded deep cuts in exchange for badly needed aid.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for scaling back the number of seats in national,
provincial and municipal governments, along with cuts in the number of
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde is also proposing to eliminate midterm congressional
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan's savings will be used for social programs," Duhalde said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The government of former President Fernando de la Rua imposed the
banking freeze Dec. 1 to halt a single-day, $2-billion run on banks.</TE>

<HD>Tajik Blamed in Killings Is Nabbed, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Asia: Warlord suspected in 1998 deaths of U.N. workers is
reportedly caught in Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUSHANBE, Tajikistan
</DL>
<LD>A Tajik warlord believed to have ordered the 1998 killings of four
U.N. workers has been captured in Afghanistan, an official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Mullo Abdullo, a rebel warlord in Tajikistan's 1992-1997 civil war,
was captured last fall near Kandahar and is being held in a prison in the
northern Afghan city of Taloqan, a high-ranking Tajik Security Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Tajik officials say Abdullo was behind the killings of three U.N.
military observers and their Tajik translator in July 1998. Three men
were sentenced to death for the killings in 1999, but officials said the
men had acted on Abdullo's orders.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. workers were among 70 observers stationed in Tajikistan to
monitor a peace deal that gave the opposition some government positions,
bringing to a halt most of the bloodshed that had plagued the country
since its independence from the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullo, one of the most influential rebel commanders, did not accept
the 1997 truce. He continued to wield de facto control over an eastern
region of Tajikistan until 2000, when he agreed to give up arms in
exchange for the government's promise not to prosecute him for past
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   He was fighting on the side of Afghanistan's Taliban militia when he
was captured, the Security Ministry official said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Islamic rebels from the former Soviet republics in Central Asia
are believed to have fought with the Taliban. The leader of the Islamic
Movement of Uzbekistan, Juma Namangani, was killed during the U.S.-led
campaign in Afghanistan that ousted the Taliban from power, U.S. and
Central Asian officials have said.</TE>

<HD>Gangster With Terror Links Is Jailed in India</HD>
<DH>Probe: Authorities say Aftab Ansari may have transferred funds to
Al Qaeda via the suspect in a Pakistan kidnapping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>An Indian underworld boss suspected of transferring money to Al
Qaeda terrorists was behind bars here Saturday night after he was
arrested in Dubai, while traveling on a Pakistani passport, and deported.</LD>
<LD>   Aftab Ansari was arrested at Dubai airport, in the Persian Gulf, when
he was trying to catch a flight to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. He
was carrying a Pakistani passport in the name of one of his several
aliases, Indian police said.</LD>
<LD>   Indian intelligence and police sources said in interviews last week
that intercepted e-mails suggested that Ansari was a key middleman in the
transfer of $100,000 last August to suspected members of Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<TE>   Ansari, a journalism and law graduate, forged an alliance with Islamic
terrorists in the late 1990s while he was a prisoner in New Delhi's Tihar
jail, the Indian investigators claim. That's where he befriended Ahmad
Omar Saeed Sheikh, now the chief suspect in the Jan. 23 kidnapping in
Pakistan of American journalist Daniel Pearl, Indian police and
intelligence officers charge.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police also accuse Ansari of masterminding a Jan. 22 drive-by
shooting in Calcutta in which five Indian police guards were killed. They
say he even called a senior police commander from Dubai to gloat about
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Dubai's decision to send Ansari back to India on Saturday renews
pressure on Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to hand over 20 alleged
gangsters and terrorists for trial in India. New Delhi insists that the
suspects must be delivered before several hundred thousand Indian troops
can be pulled back from the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of international cooperation is the only answer to the
growing menace of terrorism," said P. C. Sharma, director of the Central
Bureau of Investigation, India's equivalent of the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The capture of Ansari also raises the threat of revenge attacks or
kidnappings by gang members, or perhaps their more dangerous terrorist
allies, who have used hijackings and abductions to press for the release
of their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police refused to say publicly when Ansari was arrested in
Dubai, but an Indian government source said he had been held for four
days before being transferred Saturday to New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>Dubai, 'Sin City' of the Arab World</TE>
<TE>   The Central Bureau of Investigation has been working more closely with
the FBI since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But Sharma refused to say
what role, if any, the FBI played in Ansari's capture.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever it was necessary to interact with the FBI, we did it," said
Sharma, who met with FBI Director Robert Mueller during the latter's
visit here last month.</TE>
<TE>   Ansari glared defiantly as Indian police paraded him in handcuffs and
chains before a bank of cameras. He was wearing a stylish, cream-colored
suit and an open-necked shirt--the sort of attire favored by the high
rollers and underworld figures who frequent Dubai, the "sin city" of the
Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to Central Bureau of Investigation headquarters for
interrogation, which began Saturday night. Ansari, an Indian citizen, was
carrying a passport in the name of Safeer Muhammad Rana, said Neeraj
Kumar, Sharma's second in command.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities issued the passport Feb. 12, 2001, in the
Pakistani city of Lahore, Kumar said. It is valid until 2006, he added,
holding up a photocopy of the document.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Bureau of Investigation said Ansari has a large house in
Rawalpindi, a suburb of Pakistan's capital, and Sharma held up a floor
plan of the building for reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly try to find out his role in all the crimes that are
on record in India committed by him," Sharma told a news conference. "We
should also focus on finding out his linkages both in India and outside."</TE>
<TE>   Calling Ansari "a really good catch," Sharma mentioned last month's
attack on the American Center in Calcutta, weapons smuggling and
kidnapping as examples of what a police statement called "anti-national,
terrorist and heinous crimes" dating back to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews last week, senior Indian police and intelligence
sources named Ansari as a central figure in a kidnapping operation that
investigators believe was a source of funds for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 8, Ansari sent an e-mail to his top lieutenant in India, Asif
Reza Khan, asking "whether he agrees to part with $100,000 for a 'noble
cause' as requested by [Sheikh]," a senior police investigator in
Calcutta said.</TE>
<TE>   Khan agreed the next day in an e-mail, and Aug. 11, Ansari replied
that "the amount mentioned has been sent to [Sheikh]," the investigator
added.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, Sheikh wrote Ansari an e-mail saying, "The money
that was sent has been passed on," the police official said.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether any of the money was
used to support the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The same sources, who discussed details of the continuing
investigation on condition they not be named, said the money isn't easily
traced. It was moved, they say, through the hawala system, an informal
network that allows people to transfer large sums of money around the
world without records.</TE>
<TE>   Money deposited with a hawala trader in one country is paid out by an
associate in another when the recipient shows up with the matching half
of a torn bank note, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, who has also been based in Dubai and Pakistan, is a British
citizen who admitted in a prison diary that he received training in
Afghanistan in 1994 from a Pakistan-based group fighting Indian rule in
the disputed state of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>Sheikh Jailed in 1994 Kidnappings</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was jailed for the October 1994 kidnapping of Californian
tourist Bela Josef Nuss and three British backpackers. He and his
accomplices had demanded the release of jailed terrorist Maulana Masood
Azhar, but Sheikh ended up in prison himself.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh and Azhar were freed in December 1999 in return for the release
of passengers on an Indian Airlines flight that had been hijacked to
Kandahar, Afghanistan. The men later ended up in Pakistan, and Indian
investigators claim that they were assisted by Pakistan's military
intelligence agency, known as Inter-Services Intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Bureau of Investigation says it intercepted a truck full
of military weapons, explosives and ammunition destined for Ansari as the
vehicle was traveling in Gujarat state, near the border with Pakistan, on
the night of Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The arms haul included two AK-56 assault rifles, pistols and more than
30 pounds of RDX plastic explosive. Police arrested four suspects, and
the investigation established that Ansari had sent the weapons from
Pakistan, according to a statement issued Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The ordnance was for "anti-national and jihadi activities," the
statement added, using the local term for Muslim extremists whose
guerrilla war against Indian rule in Kashmir has included frequent
terrorist attacks on civilians in that state and elsewhere in India.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was used to seek Ansari's return from Dubai, the
statement added.</TE>
<TE>   Ansari's arrest turns a spotlight on what Indian police say is a much
bigger fish, Dawood Ibrahim, a Bombay gangster whom a senior Indian
intelligence called "a mentor" of Pakistan's military intelligence
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Underworld crime and terrorist connections have made Dawood so
powerful, and wealthy, that he is a force unto himself capable of
revealing many dark secrets if he was ever interrogated, according to the
Indian intelligence officer.</TE>
<TE>   The gangster even lent about $1 million to Pakistan's national bank
when the country was just days away from bankruptcy, the source claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Dawood is another of the 20 suspects New Delhi wants Pakistan to send
back to India for trial. He is accused of masterminding a string of
terrorist bomb attacks on March 12, 1993, that killed 257 people in
Bombay.</TE>
<TE>   An alleged accomplice, Tiger Memon, is also on India's wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has already said he will never turn any Pakistani citizens
over to India, but New Delhi insists that 14 of the men are Indians,
including Dawood and Memon.</TE>

unveiled his 2003 budget, including $379 billion for the Pentagon--the
largest increase since Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   But another set of numbers was not unveiled, even though it lies at
the heart of far-reaching decisions that are being made about the future
of U.S. military power. Far from being given to the public, these numbers
are considered so sensitive that most senior military officers are not
privy to them.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers, compiled by the Combined Air Operations Center, or CAOC,
in Saudi Arabia and obtained by The Times, set out in graphic detail
exactly who did what in the air war in Afghanistan. More important, they
reveal which weapons systems were most effective and efficient and which
were not.</LD>
<TE>   In an age when information is power, these numbers are potential
"daisy cutters" in the struggle over slices of the defense budget pie.
They are also ammunition for battles the Pentagon would prefer to fight
in private.</TE>
<TE>   According to CAOC statistics, in the 76 days of bombing between Oct.
7, when Operation Enduring Freedom began, and Dec. 23, when sustained
bombing tapered off, the United States flew about 6,500 strike missions
over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It dropped about 17,500 munitions on more than 120 fixed target
complexes and more than 400 vehicles and artillery guns. Fifty-seven
percent of the weapons delivered were "smart"--that is, guided by
satellites or lasers.</TE>
<TE>   But within those gross numbers, what do the breakdowns show about the
performance of particular kinds of airplanes and munitions? The U.S. Navy
and the Air Force vied for dominance in the air war, and Afghanistan was
a real-world testing ground for competing strategies and weapons systems.</TE>
<TE>   In blunt terms, who won?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is not simple, but it does suggest that military planners
may need to reassess some present assumptions about what kinds of
airplanes the United States will need in the future. It also suggests
that the CAOC numbers are being guarded primarily for reasons of Pentagon
politics, not national security.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the data cannot stand alone as gospel truth. The CAOC did
not have an easy software system to track missions and weapons despite
the fact that such a program was developed for the Yugoslavia conflict.
And even inside the Air Force, there are discrepancies and disagreements
over some statistics, some of them not trivial.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after making due allowance for the limitations on the data,
some startling patterns stand out:</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy's carrier-based planes flew 4,900 of the 6,500 strikes,
or 75% of the total. But the Air Force, though flying only 25% of the
missions, delivered 12,900 weapons--more than 70% of the total dropped in
the whole conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean the Air Force emerges wearing the white hat and
deserves to get what it asks for in the defense budget? Not exactly.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that what delivered the goods for the Air Force in
Afghanistan was not its hottest new thoroughbreds but a pair of draft
horses left over from the Cold War: the largely unheralded B-1 and B-52
heavy bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Together, those aging air warriors flew just 10% of the strike
missions, but they delivered 11,500 of the 17,500 total munitions dropped
in the air war. That's more than 65% of the total, and a whopping 89% of
all weapons delivered by Air Force planes.</TE>
<TE>   Box scores like this are already being used in struggles over who gets
what in the military of the future, including the age-old inter-service
dispute over whether carrier-based planes are more valuable than
land-based planes when access to overseas land bases is tenuous.</TE>
<TE>Bombers Versus Fighter Planes</TE>
<TE>   Yet the most pointed questions raised by the CAOC numbers go to a
struggle inside the Air Force itself, between advocates of bombers and
advocates of fighter planes. Among the so-called fighter mafia, anything
that might detract from buying new fighter planes is dangerous, given the
current plan to buy two completely new short-range fighters--the F-22
Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.</TE>
<TE>   And despite the results in Afghanistan--and Kosovo before it--there is
no comparable, next-generation long-range bomber under development in the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Air Force is committed to short-range at a time that the
strategic logic goes long-range," says a defense industry analyst who
believes that the lesson to be learned from Afghanistan is that heavy
bombers are and should be recognized as the workhorses of modern air
warfare.</TE>
<TE>   The day-in and day-out use of the B-2 stealth bomber was the most
militarily significant development of the 1999 air war in Kosovo. Firing
satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, these
intercontinental bombers flew from the United States in all kinds of
weather to target the most sensitive and protected targets. The $18,000
JDAM includes a special tail kit that uses global positioning satellite
coordinates to steer a 2,000-pound bomb to within 14 yards of a target.</TE>
<TE>   The B-2 was valuable partly because it could deliver precision weapons
and evade radar. There was another, less widely understood factor: When
it comes to overseas bases, which short-range planes depend on, host
countries can and do impose restrictions on where U.S. planes can fly and
what weapons they can carry.</TE>
<TE>   After Kosovo, the B-2 was highly touted by the Air Force. After all,
it represented what was new. But in Afghanistan, B-2s have flown just six
strike missions. Taliban air defenses were so limited that "stealth" was
not demanded. Instead, B-1 and B-52 bombers flying from Diego Garcia in
the Indian Ocean shouldered the load.</TE>
<TE>   And, although these bombers delivered the vast majority of the
old-fashioned dumb bombs (about 6,300 500-pound bombs in enormous loads
of more than 20 bombs per attack), they were also responsible for
delivering almost half the guided weapons, including the low-cost,
all-weather Joint Direct Attack Munitions.</TE>
<TE>   JDAM is one of the few stars of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's
new budget. Testifying last week before Congress in support of the
$379-billion request, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said JDAM had "become the preferred munition" in Afghanistan,
with almost 3,000 being used per month. The Pentagon request includes
$502 million for 22,700 JDAMs at increased production rates.</TE>
<TE>B-1 Called 'Not Viable in a Conflict Today'</TE>
<TE>   The B-1 and B-52 get no such boost.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, early last summer the Pentagon announced plans to cut
the B-1 force from 93 to 60 airplanes and use the savings to modernize
the remaining aircraft. Rumsfeld said the plane was "not viable in a
conflict today" and was "headed toward expensive obsolescence."</TE>
<TE>   The B-1, built for low-altitude nuclear duty, was not used in
conventional combat until December 1998, against Iraq. It then
participated in Yugoslavia, generally with good reports. Despite the
B-1's dominance in Afghanistan, Air Force insiders argue that it was able
to make such a contribution only because there was no threat from
surface-to-air missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Further, proponents of new fighters say the Air Force recently
determined that it had enough bombers and that the current force would
last well into the future.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the secretary of the Air Force did direct a new study of
long-range bombers, updating a 1999 white paper. That paper called for
the bomber force to be reduced by 51 in 2002, to stabilize at 157 B-1,
B-2 and B-52 bombers. The new study acknowledges the lessons of
Yugoslavia and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's bomber force is just as likely to strike point targets--or
support ground troops--as is any fighter plane, especially in poor
weather," it says. The report calls for a variety of hardware and
software improvements to keep the existing force capable and survivable.</TE>
<TE>   But it concludes that "all three bombers should be structurally sound
for the next four or five decades."</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address, Bush made a point of saying America
needs to "replace aging aircraft." Apparently long-range bombers were not
included.</TE>
<TE>   And it's probably a safe bet that no one at the Pentagon is hurrying
over to the White House to share those CAOC numbers with him.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds of Taliban Fighters Are Freed</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: In a reconciliatory gesture, the interim government
sends the men home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The interim Afghan government released hundreds of captured Taliban
fighters Saturday, a gesture of reconciliation as the new administration
focuses on rebuilding a country shattered by decades of war.</LD>
<LD>   Associated Press said that 320 soldiers were released, while the
Reuters news agency reported a figure of about 270.</LD>
<LD>   In a brief speech before shivering prisoners lined up in the bitter
cold outside the presidential palace, interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai
told the men to go back to their homes.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead of using guns, work and earn money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the men were in civilian clothing. Most appeared desperately
poor and wore sandals or cheap plastic shoes. One wore plastic bags on
his feet instead of socks.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said the men were "innocent conscripts," but he gave no details
about when or where the men were captured. Most of the men appeared to be
speaking Pashto with accents from the area of Kandahar, the Taliban
spiritual heartland.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask you to serve your country," Karzai said. "Go, go. Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai did not say how many Taliban members are still being held but
vowed that captured soldiers who were not in command positions would be
released.</TE>
<TE>   One of the prisoners demanded to know when the other fighters would be
freed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our other friends are in prison," he called out to Karzai. "What will
you do with them?"</TE>
<TE>   "We will release all the prisoners," Karzai replied.</TE>
<TE>   Each freed soldier was given about $15, or about two weeks' salary for
a civil servant.</TE>
<TE>   In January, 300 Taliban members also were freed, some of whom had been
held for as long as five years by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Muhammed El-Nasleh wrote it off as a stupid joke when a few
co-workers at McDonald's started asking him why his "cousins" bombed the
World Trade Center. But when his boss picked up on the banter, the Inland
Empire teenager was flush with anger.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey Muhammed, we're going to have to check you for bombs," El-Nasleh
said the manager told him--both behind closed doors and in front of other
workers. "I felt like I was being targeted. It was humiliating. Some
things just aren't funny."</LD>
<LD>   Things got worse. Days later, El-Nasleh said, he was fired after he
accidentally threw away a paper cup that the manager was using.
McDonald's management, unable to corroborate his account, says he was let
go for "performance deficiencies." The Fontana high school senior
suspects it was because he is a Muslim.</LD>
<TE>   Whether misunderstandings or outright discrimination, such episodes
are happening more frequently in a trend that is worrying human rights
advocates and law enforcement officials. Five months after the Sept. 11
attacks, an initial spasm of random violence against Arab Americans has
dropped off dramatically, but allegations of subtler and more pervasive
forms of discrimination are spiking sharply, records and interviews show.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of violence and hate crimes "have dwindled to almost none" in
the last few months, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Ralph F. Boyd Jr., the
nation's chief civil rights enforcer, said in an interview. But in
schools, workplaces, housing complexes and airports, Arab Americans
around the country are reporting harassment and discrimination in record
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has received 260 claims of
discrimination in the workplace from Muslims since Sept. 11, an increase
of 168% over the same period a year earlier. Other government agencies in
Washington and California also report sharp increases, and the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, one of several advocacy groups that is
tracking the Sept. 11 "backlash," says it has received more than 1,700
reports of public harassment, school confrontations, ethnic slurs, job
bias, hate mail, threats and other claims of discrimination. California
led the way with 315 complaints.</TE>
<TE>   A phalanx of public and private interests has mobilized to determine
the extent of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   California has created a hotline to take complaints. Communities
around the state have held interfaith worship services, and corporations
have held training seminars to highlight the dangers. Islamic advocacy
groups have been tracking bias complaints and meeting with government
officials to pass on their findings. The Justice Department has created a
task force to track the backlash. And the EEOC has even created a special
classification, Code Z, to designate complaints tied to Sept. 11 and
begin investigating them.</TE>
<TE>   But as aggressively as many agencies are working, some civil rights
experts suspect that the actual instances of bias may be much higher than
the numbers suggest. Many Arab Americans, experts say, are reluctant to
bring formal complaints because of cultural and language barriers--and
the fear of getting swept up in the FBI's terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a perception in the community that if you report a hate
crime, you're treated as a perpetrator, a suspect, and you're opening
yourself up to questioning," said Ghada Saliba-Malouf, chairwoman of San
Francisco's Human Rights Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Arab Americans both prominent and obscure have complained recently of
harassment based on their religion or ethnicity, with many of those
incidents involving claims of bias that may be difficult if not
impossible to prove.</TE>
<TE>   * An Arab American Secret Service agent assigned to President Bush's
security detail is removed from a flight after the pilot questions his
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   * A congressman of Lebanese descent, Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista),
is denied a seat on a flight to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   * A Pakistani neurologist in Fresno is thrown out of a
barbershop--with his hair half cut--after he tells his stylist that he
doesn't want to talk about Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   * A California employee is allegedly fired without explanation after
her boss tells her not to reveal to anyone that her husband is
Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   * A New York City nurse is ordered to take some time off and given a
lesser position "for her own safety" after she reports that a co-worker
threatened to "kill Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes what we're seeing is an out-and-out hostility, an attitude
that 'we don't need any Arabs here,' " said Hodan Hassan, civil rights
coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's also an awful lot of understandable anxiety out
there--the 'terrorists among us' theme. People want to be the eyes and
ears of the government, to focus on possible threats, and a lot of people
are much quicker these days to [suspect] a Muslim," Hassan said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Persily, executive director of the California Assn. of Human
Relations Organizations, said: "We're hearing a lot about episodes in the
workplace, [Arab Americans] who say they can't get jobs, can't get
promotions. . . . What's real clear is that before [Sept. 11] incidents
against Islamics were so few and far between as to be off the radar
screen altogether. Now they're surpassing those of most other groups
except gays and lesbians."</TE>
<TE>   Typical are workplace complaints from Muslims and non-Arabs, such as
Sikhs, who say they have been encouraged, or even ordered, not to speak
Arabic around the workplace and to avoid wearing turbans and other
traditional Muslim articles of faith.</TE>
<TE>   Some Arab American workers charge that they have been fired for
refusing to do so, while others say they have shaved their beards and
changed the way they dress just to keep their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   David Grinberg, a spokesman for the EEOC, said employers may have a
lawful and legitimate reason for refusing to allow an employee to wear a
turban or a beard--such as the danger that it could become caught in
factory machinery and pose a hazard.</TE>
<TE>   But generally speaking, he said, "employers are required to make
reasonable accommodations for the religious beliefs of employees, as long
as those accommodations don't pose an undue hardship on business
operations. . . . You can't just say, 'You have to shave your beard or
else we're going to fire you.' Otherwise it's discriminatory."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates say that the most
severe and lethal outbursts of Arab-bashing have waned considerably since
September and October.</TE>
<TE>   In those first weeks, as the nation prepared to go to war, reports of
violence against Muslims or those perceived to be Arab Americans captured
headlines around the country. Arab American groups suspect that as many
as a dozen killings may have been hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In the most clearly linked killing, an Indian immigrant gas station
owner in Phoenix was shot to death days after the Sept. 11 attacks "for
no other apparent reason than that he was dark-skinned and wore a
turban," authorities said. The shooter allegedly told police after his
arrest: "I'm an American. Arrest me. Let those terrorists run wild."</TE>
<TE>   But most cases have not been so clear cut. 'Stores get robbed and
owners get murdered, unfortunately, on a regular basis," said Bob Jordan,
head of the FBI's civil rights section, and determining whether the
killer acted out of hatred can be a difficult task.</TE>
<TE>   In the September shooting death in San Gabriel of an Egyptian at the
mom-and-pop store he owned, for instance, the FBI began probing a
possible hate-crime motive only after an initial round of publicity. That
case is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   And in the December beating of an Orange County security guard who was
left in a coma for five days, authorities have brought attempted murder
charges against two suspects but have not established any anti-Muslim
motive.</TE>
<TE>   The beating victim, Mohamed Slam, was punched and kicked unconscious
while guarding an apartment complex in Costa Mesa but does not remember
the attack. However, he and his family are convinced it was a hate crime.
"I'm 100% sure it was hate. He had credit cards, a gold bracelet, a
watch, and they didn't touch anything," said Slam's wife, Nuha Jaludi.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have opened more than 300 hate-crime
investigations related to the Sept. 11 attacks, bringing charges in about
60. But Islamic activists credit the government's strong public stance
against bias as a key factor in stemming the early wave of violence.</TE>
<TE>   From President Bush on down, senior officials in the administration
have visited mosques, met with Arab Americans and spoken out forcefully
about the need for the nation to show tolerance and respect toward Arab
Americans and not engage in Arab-bashing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to have the president get out front and say, 'Hey,
these folks are us,' " said Boyd of the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   But the irony, some Arab American leaders maintain, is that the
federal government's fierce investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks may
have fueled the more recent outbreak of bias and discrimination.
Activists say law-abiding Muslims are hurt because the government has
moved so aggressively against Arab suspects--detaining more than 1,200
people, mostly Arabs with no connection to the attacks; requesting
interviews with 5,000 more; and moving to deport 1,000 people from the
Middle East and other nations with an active Al Qaeda presence.</TE>
<TE>   Many in law enforcement and the public at large say that the
extraordinary events of Sept. 11 demand some sacrifice of civil
liberties. But Ra'id Saraj, spokesman for the Southern California chapter
of the American-Islamic council, said, "The concern is that, in the
process of going after those suspects, we don't want to see innocent
members of the community have their civil rights violated."</TE>

<HD>Fate of Rare Species Hinges on Pair of Lovebirds</HD>
<DH>Nature: Only one male and two female po'ouli live on the planet. A
mating mission seeks to avert their extinction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN ESSOYAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>In a tangled Maui rain forest, a team of biologists is stalking the
last male po'ouli left on the planet, in hopes of making a match for the
stocky little bird with the "lone ranger" black mask.</LD>
<LD>   The shy Hawaiian honeycreeper has been living a bachelor's life on the
rugged northeast slope of Haleakala, dining on tree snails, unaware that
the last two female po'ouli live not far away. Their home ranges don't
overlap, and the soft-spoken species will die out if the birds don't find
each other.</LD>
<LD>   "Without some sort of intervention, extinction is pretty much
guaranteed," said Eric VanderWerf, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
biologist, who is taking part in the matchmaking mission by the state's
Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project. "It may well be the rarest bird on
Earth."</LD>
<TE>   The crew plans to outfit the male po'ouli with a tiny radio
transmitter to help track him, then capture and carry a female into his
terrain, releasing her near enough that they meet. The effort to get a
pair of po'ouli to breed in the wild is considered a longshot. It's tough
just finding the black-faced, beige-and-brown birds, each weighing just
an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a needle in a haystack," said Jim Groombridge,
project coordinator. "The po'ouli (po-oh-oo-lee) is a very, very elusive,
secretive bird that lives mainly in the lower canopy. It's not a loud,
gregarious, top-of-the-tree type with crazy-colored plumage you can spot
from a distance."</TE>
<TE>   But in a state that has been called the endangered species capital of
the country--where more than 40 native bird species have already gone
extinct and 30 more are endangered--people aren't willing to let this one
go without a fight. The crew spent a year preparing for the translocation
effort, practicing with a model species, the Maui creeper, in the same
forest.</TE>
<TE>   The po'ouli inhabit one of the more inaccessible spots in the islands:
the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, a steep mountainside above Hana that is
sliced by deep gulches and drenched by 300 inches of rain a year. Moss
overhangs ohia and olapa trees; ferns and dense foliage impede hikers.</TE>
<TE>   Field workers use helicopters to get to Hanawi, then drape large "mist
nets" of fine, soft nylon between trees in hopes that the birds fly into
them. On their first expedition, the crew located the male, but he
avoided their nets. More than 200 other birds were caught, banded and
released.</TE>
<TE>   Even if naturalists manage to capture two po'ouli and introduce them,
there are no guarantees that the matchmaking will succeed. Ultimately,
it's up to the birds.</TE>
<TE>   "After being moved, the female may immediately fly back to her home
range or may decide she doesn't like the male at all--or maybe he won't
like her," Groombridge said. "There is no denying the fact that this is
going to be very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The scientists considered bringing two po'ouli into captivity for
breeding but decided that working with them in the wild "involves less
risk to the birds and probably has just as big a chance of success,"
VanderWerf said. If the pair mates, the crew will protect the nest and
could eventually collect eggs for a captive-breeding program.</TE>
<TE>   Captive breeding has helped replenish the population of other
endangered Hawaiian birds, including a Kauai thrush known as the puaiohi
and the Hawaiian crow, or alala, but there have been setbacks. Many alala
raised in captivity have died when released.</TE>
<TE>   Although some observers argue that it's too late to save the po'ouli,
Groombridge points to other birds that have been pulled back from the
brink.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mauritius kestrel went down to four in 1974," he said, "and today
there are between 500 and 600 birds. New Zealand's Chatham Island black
robin recovered from a single pair."</TE>
<TE>   The po'ouli is so rare it was not even discovered until 1973, the year
the Endangered Species Act was signed into law. A group of University of
Hawaii students ventured to that remote section of Haleakala and
discovered one of the most intact native ecosystems left in the state,
with indigenous bird and plant species found nowhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The po'ouli was so unusual that a new genus was created for it within
the Hawaiian honeycreeper family, which is already renowned for its
diversity. It is the only native forest bird to eat tree snails, and its
stout prominent bill and black mask also set it apart.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like it anywhere," said Betsy H. Gagne, who was the
first to spot the "mystery bird" as a college student and today is
executive secretary of the Natural Area Reserves System Commission. "Are
we going to just let these birds go quietly into the night, when we
ourselves are the ones who've pushed them along?"</TE>
<TE>   Much of Hawaii's native forest has succumbed over the years to
clearing for ranching, agriculture and urban development. The wild areas
that are left remain vulnerable because Hawaiian plants and animals
evolved in isolation and never developed natural defenses against foreign
predators and disease. Hawaii accounts for less than 0.2% of the land
mass of the United States, but it holds a quarter of the nation's
threatened and endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   The 7,500-acre Hanawi rain forest was set aside as a reserve in 1986
in hopes of protecting the entire ecosystem--not just the birds but also
the plants, insects and organisms interwoven in its network of life. In
the last decade, the state has overseen aggressive efforts to remove
alien threats, including the wild pigs that tear up the forest
understory, tree-climbing rats that eat eggs and birds, and invasive
plants that crowd out native species.</TE>
<TE>   "Habitat management is hugely important," Groombridge said. "If you
save a forest, you save the birds."</TE>
<TE>   It seems to have made a difference for the endangered Maui parrotbill,
so-called for its heavy, hooked beak, which has made a comeback in Hanawi
over the last decade. The po'ouli population, however, has continued to
drop. Its numbers were projected at roughly 150 in 1981, but many
consider that an overestimate. By 1996, only six black-faced
honeycreepers were sighted, and that number dwindled to three a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not be able to save the po'ouli, but we're going to give it
our best shot," Gagne said. "In any case, we'll learn from the work we
do, and other species will benefit."</TE>

<DH>Travel: George W. Bush is a president on the go, often with an eye
toward running for reelection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>For a stay-at-home kind of guy, President Bush isn't spending a lot
of time at home.</LD>
<LD>   Since leaving the White House at sunrise Friday, he has spoken to
cattle ranchers in Denver, sat among U.S. athletes at the opening
ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City and then settled
in for a 36-hour stay in the Grand Teton mountains.</LD>
<LD>   He returns to Washington late this afternoon only to turn around
Monday morning and fly to Wisconsin. And at week's end, he'll be back
aboard Air Force One for a one-week trip to Japan, South Korea and China.</LD>
<TE>   Bush was famous during the 2000 presidential campaign for his
insistence that he return home to sleep in his own bed in Austin, Texas,
at every opportunity. Now that he lives at the White House, he is
spending little time there. He has been on the road, or at Camp David or
his ranch in Crawford, Texas, for all or part of 29 days this year. In
fact, during the first 39 days of the year, he had touched down in 20
states. Last year, he was almost as peripatetic, reaching 37 states.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the travel this year has been work-related, and much of that
has been tied to the budget. He has embarked on an aggressive campaign to
highlight elements of his spending plan. On Tuesday, for example, he went
to a medical center in Pittsburgh to dramatize his request for a more
than 300% increase in spending to combat bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the states he has visited went to Al Gore in the 2000
election, but their vote tallies were close enough to put them up for
grabs in 2004. Likewise, many others favored with a presidential visit
were states that went for Bush, but by such a close margin that the White
House is not taking any chances.</TE>
<TE>   Swing states traditionally attract presidential attention, and Bush is
no exception, already visiting Pennsylvania (Gore won with 51%) and Ohio
(Bush won with barely 50%). Bush, who lost California by nearly 12%,
virtually ignored the state in his 2001 travels, but it was the first
state he visited on a post-New Year's Day trip from his ranch--perhaps a
sign that political aides think he has a chance there in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Famous Florida? He already has been there twice this year. Ditto West
Virginia, a state most political analysts thought Gore should have won
but which gave 52% of its votes to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Where hasn't the president gone? Just a year in office, he has missed
only nine states, and only one of them, Washington, is usually up for
grabs in a presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting a weekend visit in July to his parents' summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush had not, until this weekend, spent any time at
what others might consider a vacation resort.</TE>
<TE>   (He appears to consider his ranch in Central Texas just that. It does,
after all, afford him the bragging rights to daily jogs in temperatures
topping 100 degrees. But Crawford has yet to make it into standard travel
guides as a resort destination.)</TE>
<TE>   He and Laura Bush arrived here at 11 p.m. Friday, past the president's
preferred bedtime.</TE>
<TE>   "A little late for us," he said grumpily as he walked down the steps
of the Boeing 757 that served as Air Force One for a storm-tossed flight
over the mountains and into a small airport in Grand Teton National Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes stayed at a home about 150 feet off a two-lane road, built
in a pine forest in a subdivision of five-acre lots. His host was Roland
Betts, a fraternity brother at Yale University. Bush was the frat
president, a party animal of the first degree, by his own accounts, and
Betts was the rush chairman. Since then, Betts, a New Yorker, has been at
Bush's side--or perhaps more accurately, a step ahead--helping him buy a
managing partnership in the Texas Rangers major league baseball team and
planting financial seeds for Bush's political undertakings.</TE>
<TE>   The president is not a skier; indeed, he is not known for savoring any
winter sports.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides considered arranging a photo session of the
president venturing out on snowshoes Saturday but scrapped the idea after
consulting him. He remained out of sight for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Just the decision-making on that small matter suggested the pace Bush
was following here. The question was not broached with him until after
his daily national security briefing. In Washington, that occurs around 7
a.m. On Saturday, it apparently did not take place until around 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The president's choice of a weekend in Jackson Hole seemed peculiar
for him. To be sure, it is spectacular, and even for a man from the
flatlands of Texas, it would not be hard to feel a Heidi-like
appreciation of the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Tetons frame the town, and a fresh drop Friday added about 5
inches to snow that is already waist-deep along some roads. The region
attracts the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney, a Wyomingite who has a
house here (but was not here this weekend), and former Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, whose hunting camp is nearby--perhaps 90 miles away,
but not far by local standards.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature was 25 degrees when the president arrived--a break
from the minus 11 registered earlier in the week. The high was 24 degrees
Saturday afternoon, and even with eye-squinting sunshine reflecting off
the snow, the Chamber of Commerce would call it brisk.</TE>
<TE>   The president makes no bones about not caring for the winter weather.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he is so averse to it that he fended off Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin's invitation in November to visit Moscow and St.
Petersburg in the heart of the winter. But he replied that he would love
to visit.</TE>
<TE>   That would put him on the road again. Perhaps in May.</TE>

<HD>For Utahans, a Mission to Help at Games</HD>
<DH>Labor: More than 23,000 volunteers will donate 3 million hours to
the Olympics. Thousands more were turned away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>About 67,000 people tried out for the team, and only a third were
needed. They outnumber the athletes 10 to 1, and their performance this
month may be the enduring legacy of these Olympics, speaking volumes
about what kind of place this is.</LD>
<LD>   They include students such as Katie Barton, a clean-scrubbed
20-year-old whose breath hangs like a wispy cloud in the frigid morning
air, offering directions to frustrated pedestrians confronting closed
streets in downtown Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   And financial planner Mary Lou Arveseth, who saved her vacation time
so she could stand in the mountain cold of Soldier Hollow east of here to
help with the presentation of flowers to the biathlon winners. Her
primary job: to make sure the podium is properly placed and supported so
it doesn't wobble.</LD>
<TE>   And Leslie Marsh, a registered nurse who giggles that she'll be able
to get under the athletes' skin. When the winning skiers cross the finish
line, she'll keep an eagle's eye on them and, within an hour of victory,
draw a sample of their blood to make sure they are drug-free.</TE>
<TE>   These three women are among the nearly 23,500 people who were selected
as Olympic volunteers, agreeing to work 10-hour shifts with no more
compensation than their distinctive black and violet ski jacket, gloves,
hip pack, a ticket to watch the dress rehearsal of the opening
ceremonies--and the satisfaction of having helped this town host the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   They might not watch a single event.</TE>
<TE>   The ease with which the Salt Lake Organizing Committee was able to
attract 3 million hours of free labor--valued at $61 million--stunned
officials and reflects, they say, the ethic and altruism of Salt Lake
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The response to our call for help--to get 67,000 applications for
volunteer work a year before the start of the Games--was extraordinary.
We were absolutely amazed," said Mitt Romney, president of the organizing
committee. "Sydney [which hosted the 2000 Summer Games] was still
recruiting volunteers the week before the Games began.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the American West is a place where people are used to
helping their neighbor, whether it's a barn-raising a century ago or
helping to host the world today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers are serving in such roles as translators, ticket
takers, ushers and guides at bus stops.</TE>
<TE>   They calm anxious parents who can't find their children and redirect
temperamental spectators who got on the wrong bus and ended up miles from
their intended venue.</TE>
<TE>   They not only work side-by-side with the paid Olympic staff, they
outnumber them 7 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Romney said he hopes they outperform their counterparts in Sydney, who
were hugely popular for their outlandish humor and chirpy and reassuring
response to any tourist in need: "No worries!"</TE>
<TE>   Long before being trained for specific tasks and familiarizing
themselves with their assigned venues, the volunteers underwent six hours
of instruction on the basics--and nuances--of international public
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Don't offer to shake a spectator's hand unless that person reaches out
first. Don't be insulted if a person refuses to make eye contact. Don't
use certain hand gestures because they may be offensive to some cultures.
Be careful not to move in too closely to spectators seeking
assistance--but be prepared for them to stand nose-to-nose with you.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's that matter of religion, here in a city where nearly
half of the residents are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.</TE>
<TE>   The training book instructs the official Olympic volunteers to avoid
"such controversial subjects as politics and religion."</TE>
<TE>   The church, whose strategy is to convert people through one-on-one
contacts, also has promised not to capitalize on the influx of an
estimated 60,000 daily visitors to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,000 Mormons have volunteered for tasks such as providing
security and guiding visitors at Temple Square, the church's world
headquarters and Salt Lake City's most popular tourist attraction. Those
volunteers have been admonished not to proselytize during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to assertively preach to people who think they're coming
for an Olympic experience, it would not only be a negative experience for
them, but we would justifiably be criticized by our friends and neighbors
who are not of our faith," said church spokesman Mike Otterson. "We're
anxious for a legacy of goodwill."</TE>
<TE>   Mormon volunteers say they'll have little problem containing
themselves at the Games, adding that their politeness is too often
misconstrued as a guise to recruit.</TE>
<TE>   "Being gracious and hospitable doesn't mean we're foisting the church
on anybody," said JoAnn Christensen, 70, who volunteers regularly for the
church. "We want to show our good face to the world and let them know
we're good hosts."</TE>
<TE>   She said, for instance, that she will happily direct tourists to the
nearest bar, if they ask, even if the church discourages the consumption
of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Mormons who are serving as Olympic volunteers say they too will hold
themselves in check. "If I'm asked something about my religion, I'll
answer it, but I don't see it even coming up," said Barton, helping
direct traffic last week during a shift that began at 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing this because I love meeting people from all over the world.
I like being involved like this. It feels good, to be out here helping
people."</TE>

<HD>2 Enron Executives Plan to Leave Firm</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Their lawyer says they are expected to respond to
criticisms against them at a closed board meeting Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Two top Enron Corp. executives criticized for failing to oversee
the energy giant's complex partnerships are negotiating their exit from
the company and are expected to respond to the allegations against them
at a closed board meeting Tuesday, their lawyer said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The two executives, Chief Accounting Officer Richard A. Causey and
Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy, remain under contract to the fallen
energy-trading company. But they are interested in departing to prepare
for a raft of lawsuits, said the lawyer, J. C. Nickens. In addition,
Enron's new management has essentially eliminated their jobs, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not their desire to leave the company on some sort of favored
basis," Nickens said. The pair "would like to be covered for their
obligations under the contracts." Nickens declined to elaborate, citing
the confidentiality of their contracts.</LD>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the two executives would be entitled to bonuses
awarded to several senior executives as Enron collapsed last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Buy and Causey signed off on Enron's creation of a network of
partnerships headed by other Enron officers and approved several
transactions with these entities. The deals, according to a report by a
special committee of Enron's board released last week, allowed Enron to
conceal debt and investment losses while enriching the Enron officers who
had invested in the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Nickens said he plans to file a letter refuting the allegations
against Buy and Causey at a meeting of Enron's board Tuesday. The
executives declined to testify under oath last week at a House committee
hearing on Enron's demise.</TE>
<TE>   Causey, a former accountant with Enron's auditor, Andersen, has had
responsibility for ensuring that Enron filed accurate financial
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Buy's job has
been to analyze and control risks in Enron's investments and trading
operations.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron's internal report suggested that Causey and Buy failed to
perform their responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the report said Vincent Kaminski, chief of Enron's
internal research division, warned Buy that a 1999 deal to shield Enron
from potential losses associated with its investment in online firm
Rhythms NetConnections exposed Enron to serious problems. Under the terms
of the deal, Enron would essentially shield itself from Rhythms' losses
by selling contracts to a partnership backed by Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   The contract provided that the partnership, LJM Cayman, would cover
any losses Enron suffered from the Rhythms investment.</TE>
<TE>   Kaminski told investigators he recommended that Buy halt the deal
because of the "obvious" conflict of interest associated with negotiating
such a deal with LJM Cayman, a partnership headed by Enron's chief
financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. Kaminski said he also warned Buy
that the terms of the deal were too favorable to Fastow's partnership and
that the partnership's credit was shaky because it was backed by Enron's
own shares.</TE>
<TE>   Buy told investigators he did not recall such conversations with
Kaminski, the report said. At some point, he told investigators, his
division analyzed the deal and recommended changes in the structure to
shore up the partnership's credit.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether his changes were implemented. But in April
2000, the report said, Enron unwound the deal in a complicated
transaction in which the company received shares worth about $70 million
less than a cash-and-options package given LJM Cayman. Causey OKd the
deal, the report said. The report also suggests that the transaction did
not truly transfer risk from Enron because the LJM Cayman partnership was
propped up with Enron's own shares.</TE>
<TE>   Without disclosing the contents of his letter to the board, Nickens
said Buy "basically disagrees" with the contention that such deals "did
not have economic substance." As for Causey, Nickens said he largely
acted on the advice of Andersen.</TE>

<LD>Seven airline pilots and two airport ramp workers were charged with
immigration-related offenses, prosecutors said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Four pilots and two ramp workers were charged with possession of fake
immigration documents, U.S. Atty. Guy Lewis said in a news release. One
of the four and an additional pilot also were charged with making false
statements to obtain a Social Security card, Lewis said.</LD>
<LD>   An additional pilot was detained in Dallas and another in Miami on
unspecified immigration charges, Lewis said. The charges were not
connected to the Sept. 11 attacks, he said.</LD>

<HD>HIV Case in Texas Is Linked to Donated Blood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO
</DL>
<LD>A Texas ranch hand undergoing surgery was infected with HIV in what
is believed to be the first U.S. case of the virus being transmitted
through donated blood since rigorous new screening technology was
implemented three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center said only
one patient received the tainted blood.</LD>
<LD>   David Autrey, 51, of Chilton was infected with human immunodeficiency
virus through a blood transfusion he received during emergency heart
bypass surgery in August 2000 at Scott &amp; White Hospital in Temple,
officials at the San Antonio blood bank said.</LD>
<TE>   Autrey said that he is taking drugs to combat the HIV but that his
life is devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no cure for this stuff, and this [HIV drug] cocktail is no
fun," Autrey told the San Antonio Express-News in Saturday's editions. "I
was looking forward to seeing all the grandkids grow up, but you know how
it goes."</TE>
<TE>   Blood bank spokeswoman Shelley Valdez said the blood bank had located
all the tainted blood. "We are certain that only Mr. Autrey received the
blood."</TE>
<TE>   There are no other known cases of HIV being transmitted through
donated blood since blood banks added new testing technology, said Dr.
Michael Busch, a professor at UC San Francisco and an executive at Blood
Centers of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   However, while the testing process is highly sophisticated, it still
is considered experimental and can fail to detect the virus in blood from
donors who give blood soon after being exposed to HIV, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tainted blood came from a man who was a regular donor at the blood
bank and who donated four times during 2000, said Dr. Norman Kalmin,
president and chief executive of the San Antonio blood bank.</TE>
<TE>   When the man donated in December 2000, his blood tested positive for
HIV. Blood bank workers went through five years of previous donations.</TE>
<TE>   Valdez said the procedure calls for the blood bank to contact
hospitals that received the blood. The hospitals then contact the
recipients and test them for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "The explanation is that the [donor] was recently exposed," Kalmin
said. "It hadn't had the opportunity to multiply to levels that were
detectable" in the automated testing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, blood banks began nucleic amplification testing, which closes
the window period of detecting tainted blood. For example, if a donor
gave blood today, the test would show if the person was infected seven to
10 days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the chance of getting HIV from donated blood is 1 in 2
million to 3 million transfusions, and they stress that the nation's
blood supply is very safe.</TE>

<HD>New Path to Nuclear Policy</HD>
<DH>Security: Bush wants to keep U.S. options open, including
stockpiling warheads, at the expense of treaties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Since he began his 2000 campaign, President Bush has sought to win
recognition as the leader who cut the American and Russian nuclear
arsenal by two-thirds, to "leave the Cold War behind."</LD>
<LD>   Yet in the first year of his term, the Bush administration has
overhauled the nation's nuclear arms policy in ways that reach far beyond
the count of offensive warheads.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush team has effectively set aside a 30-year-old tradition of
arms control and asserted the need for a "flexibility" that will allow
the United States to rebuild its arsenal on short notice. It has ordered
construction of long-prohibited defensive weapons and is even considering
new nuclear arms, which could mean resuming nuclear testing that has been
halted for a decade.</LD>
<TE>   The approach aims to reduce the number of deployed nuclear weapons,
yet it leaves the nuclear arsenal as the core ingredient of U.S.
security. Its framework was sketched out a year ago in a report by an
obscure Virginia think tank, the National Institute for Public Policy,
that amounted to a blueprint for the administration's nuclear arms
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is the steady implementation of a new conservative
strategic vision," said Joseph Cirincione, an arms expert at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, a nonprofit group aimed at fostering
world peace. "There's no question about it: There's been a plan to do
this, and we're seeing it laid out, step by step."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the administration has again and again demonstrated
its willingness to shake up the status quo: It has announced a withdrawal
from the landmark Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, distanced itself from a
handful of other arms treaties and asserted its prerogatives to rebuild
the nuclear arsenal at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials believe that radical changes in the nature of
the threat to the United States make it necessary to adopt a new approach
to national security.</TE>
<TE>Threats Arising From Many Nations</TE>
<TE>   For half a century, the greatest threat came from the Soviet Union, an
adversary with well-known capabilities. Now, with the Soviet empire
crumbled, threats are emerging from the dozens of countries that are
trying to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Since it's not clear which of these countries may pose the greatest
danger and how soon their capabilities will develop, the United States
needs a flexibility that isn't possible under restrictive treaties,
officials believe.</TE>
<TE>   Iran, Iraq and North Korea--Bush's "axis of evil"--pose the most
obvious threats. But officials worry about others as well and say they
can't exclude the possibility that Russia and China could be led by
hostile regimes.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the new approach, including administration officials who
helped write the think tank paper, contend that the United States must
break free of the arduous Cold War arms negotiations that sought ceilings
on arsenals. Such negotiations were not the path to peace but "just a
tool to manage enmity," said former ambassador David Smith, who was chief
arms control negotiator during the administration of Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   Now the U.S. and Russia need to build a friendly relationship based on
openness and consultation, not on binding treaties, advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the approach contend that abandoning the treaties and
insisting on U.S. "flexibility" will encourage other countries to
maintain or increase their nuclear arsenals. They charge that the
administration's moves are a sign of its "unilateralist" outlook and
contend that nuclear arms remain as important as ever, and perhaps even
more so, given the declining role of treaties.</TE>
<TE>   "Nuclear weapons remain a core of our security strategy," said Ivo H.
Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan
think tank based in Washington. "The message to other countries is: If
you want to be truly secure, having nuclear weapons, and maintaining them
in large numbers, is a good idea."</TE>
<TE>Treaties Are Seen as Obstacles to U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's view, say analysts, grows from a belief that arms
control treaties have often held back the United States from safeguarding
its interests while giving less scrupulous nations an opportunity to
cheat.</TE>
<TE>   This wariness was apparent last year as the White House backed away
from a proposed treaty to curb illegal small-arms traffic and from a
proposal to create an enforcement mechanism for the 30-year-old
Biological Weapons Convention. Administration officials have signaled
that they will oppose the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and will not press ahead with the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty II with Russia, which never fully took effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Arms control treaties are not for friends," Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld declared last year.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's most momentous departure from the old order came
Dec. 13, when Bush announced that the United States would withdraw in six
months from the 1972 ABM Treaty with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The ABM Treaty was drawn to avoid a spiraling arms race that the
governments feared would ensue as the two countries built more and more
missiles to try to overwhelm the other's antimissile defenses. But the
Bush administration believed that the treaty kept the United States from
developing a system to protect the entire country from ballistic
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the administration further fleshed out its view with the
release of a major report on the role of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   A publicly released summary of the classified report quoted Rumsfeld
as saying that the administration wanted to "put Cold War practices
behind us." It intended to reduce reliance on offensive nuclear arms by
increasing reliance on defensive hardware, such as the proposed national
missile defense system, and, for some missions, nonnuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change described in the report was in the nuclear arms
cuts, already announced by Bush, that would slice the offensive arsenal
from what is now 7,000 deployed warheads to as few as 1,700. Bush's
unilateral proposal gave new life to stalled arms-reduction talks, and,
by raising hopes that so many weapons could no longer be fired in
minutes, won praise for the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the document clearly embodied a conservative approach to
nuclear issues.</TE>
<TE>   The decommissioned warheads would not all be destroyed, officials
said. Some would remain in the stockpile, ready to be redeployed, a step
that could be accomplished in weeks or months if circumstances required,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear cuts would take place over 10 years, longer than some had
hoped. Because of a change in the way warheads are counted, the
reductions were really no greater than those envisioned by the Clinton
administration, some analysts argued.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also stressed that the cuts would take place only if no new
threat materialized. While the administration hopes world events will
permit continuing reductions, "we may decide that we have to increase our
forces," J. D. Crouch, an assistant Defense secretary, acknowledged at a
briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch stressed that the United States intended to keep the arsenal
big enough that no other country would be tempted to challenge it. "We
will maintain sufficient forces to put us beyond their reach . . . as a
peer competitor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration said that, while it has no plans to take the
controversial step of developing new nuclear weapons, as some aides have
hinted, it wants to be ready to resume testing relatively quickly if such
a decision is made. A resumption of testing, which was suspended by
Bush's father in 1992, would likely be met with strong opposition abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say their policy has begun a move away from
"mutually assured destruction," the Cold War doctrine that sought to
guarantee nuclear stability by ensuring that both countries would be
destroyed if one attacked. They hope that in the future, improved
antimissile defenses will make nuclear forces less and less important.</TE>
<TE>   Yet administration officials acknowledge that they will have a large
nuclear deterrent force for the indefinite future and intend that the
U.S. will be fully prepared if an unfriendly regime emerges in Russia,
China or any other nuclear power.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear arms are "still the ultimate insurance policy," said Tom Z.
Collina of the pro-arms control Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   A key question now is whether the Russians will further reduce their
arsenal when the Bush administration is keeping a large stockpile and
trying to avoid signing an agreement that would limit U.S. options.
Russian officials, worried that the Americans are trying to widen their
arms advantage, complain that the U.S. plan to stockpile, rather than
destroy, warheads undermines the current round of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials would like to have an informal agreement to set out the
two countries' unilateral arms reductions for Bush and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin to sign when Bush visits Russia this summer.</TE>
<TE>   And U.S. officials have reason to feel they have the upper hand, given
the unexpected ease with which they carried out the sweeping policy
shifts of the last year, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Their bold moves to abrogate the ABM Treaty and other agreements have
brought only muted reaction from the Russians and Chinese, who are
determined to maintain good relations with the American superpower.
Likewise at home, few politicians in Congress or elsewhere have
challenged the new approach, given Bush's soaring popularity and his
standing as the leader of the war effort.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is [administration officials] will go on their way, doing
what they want to do," said Collina. "And if the Russians don't like it,
that's their problem."</TE>

her lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, 24, a daughter of Gov. Jeb Bush and niece of President Bush,
will spend whatever time is needed in the treatment program before

<HD>Bush Pledges to Spend More on Black Colleges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush marked Black History Month Saturday with a promise
to deliver big funding increases to black colleges "even in a time of
recession and war."</LD>
<LD>   Bush, who won less than 10% of the black vote in the 2000 election but
has seen his popularity soar since the Sept. 11 attacks, used his weekly
radio address to urge Americans to "reflect on the contributions of
African Americans."</LD>
<LD>   Bush sought to assure black leaders he would not renege on a promise
to increase funding for historically black colleges and Latino-serving
institutions by 30% by 2005.</LD>
<TE>   He also touted the education reforms enacted last month to help narrow
the achievement gap between low-income students and their wealthier
counterparts. "We have come far, and we have a way yet to go," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we are fighting for freedom in a new way and on new
battlefields. And we continue to press for equal opportunity for every
American here at home. We want every American to be educated up to his or
her full potential," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   According to some polls, Bush's support from blacks more than doubled
after the Sept. 11 attacks. Eager to hold on to these gains, the White
House has stepped up its outreach to black leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has come under fire from Democrats, including prominent black
lawmakers, for proposing deep cuts in job training and other domestic
programs in his fiscal 2003 budget in order to fund more tax cuts and the
biggest military buildup in two decades. The 2003 fiscal year begins Oct.
1.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), in the
Democrats' weekly radio address, said Congress will "stand shoulder to
shoulder" with Bush to fight terrorism, but he blasted Bush's proposed
budget for bringing back deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of national security is economic security," Conrad said. "The
problem with the president's budget is that his plan will return us to
deficit spending--not just today, but for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   Comparing Bush's budget to collapsed energy giant Enron Corp., Conrad
accused Bush of making "the Enron mistake: underestimating our debt and
endangering retirement benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats charge that the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut Bush
pushed through Congress last year was too costly, imperiling the Social
Security retirement program and the Medicare health care program for the
elderly as the baby boom generation nears retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration defended its proposed cutbacks as part of an
effort to shift federal resources away from what the White House deemed
wasteful programs.</TE>

<HD>Forum Focuses on N. Korea's Rights Abuses</HD>
<DH>Asia: Defectors describe horrors of prison camps. Activists say aid
isn't reaching the needy. They seek a tougher stance by the West toward
regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>North Korean defectors and human rights advocates called on Western
countries Saturday to take a tougher line against North Korea, saying the
Communist regime is misdirecting humanitarian aid and keeping political
malcontents in nightmarish labor camps.</LD>
<LD>   On the opening day of a two-day conference here, the participants said
they hoped that President Bush's inclusion of North Korea in his "axis of
evil" formulation will generate more global attention to the country and
its abuse of human rights.</LD>
<LD>   "The human rights situation in North Korea is the worst in the world,"
declared Haruhisa Ogawa, a representative of an organization in Tokyo
that helps North Korean defectors.</LD>
<TE>   The first day of the International Conference on North Korean Human
Rights and Refugees focused on testimony by North Koreans who have
escaped across the porous border with China.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Young Kuk, who served in the personal guard of North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il, described a labor camp known as Yodok political prison No.
15, to which he was sent after failing in a previous attempt to escape to
China. Lee said that prisoners were beaten daily as punishment and that
some were tortured and killed for trivial offenses, such as carrying food
in their pockets. Lee said he witnessed one man being buried alive and
another dragged to his death by a military car.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners were fed one small bowl of corn soup a day, and those
who survived ate snakes, rats and grass and sometimes picked undigested
kernels of corn from their own feces, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and other conference participants said that some prison camps hold
entire families, including children, because one family member committed
a political offense.</TE>
<TE>   "There is increasing public discontent, but if somebody says a word,
the whole family will be taken away to political prison camp," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   In some women's camps, particularly those for women who tried to
escape to China, pregnant prisoners are subjected to abuse designed to
induce abortions, conference participants said. Newborns reportedly are
killed as a matter of routine. Willy Fautre, president of the Belgian
organization Human Rights Without Frontiers, read testimony from former
female prisoners who said they saw other prisoners forced to smother
newborns.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the alleged abuses at the labor camps, delegates said
North Korea's worst human rights violation is the widespread food
shortages caused by a regime unwilling to reform its shattered economy or
to distribute humanitarian aid fairly. It is believed that more than 1
million North Koreans--and possibly as many as 2 million--out of a
population of 24 million have died of starvation and hunger-related
illnesses since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "This catastrophe is not the result of an act of God. It is the
appalling product of a cynical act of man. It is a tragedy made possible
only by totalitarian repression unparalleled in the world today," said
Marcus Noland, a Korea specialist at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights advocates at the conference said that much of the
humanitarian aid donated by the West does not reach the people most in
need but instead is reserved for the North Korean military and the
leadership. They said that after aid is distributed, often in the
presence of international monitors, officials return to collect it,
saying it should be donated to the military in the form of "patriotic
contributions."</TE>
<TE>   "Food only enriches the leadership. Even food distributed under the
auspices of the U.N. was sent to a kindergarten and then taken away,"
said Lee Jae Kung, 63, who escaped North Korea in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, a former South Korean fisherman who lived for nearly 30 years in
the North after his boat was captured by a North Korean patrol, said: "It
is almost impossible to believe what is going on in North Korea. If you
go to Pyongyang [the capital], everything appears orderly, but when you
get into the villages, the conditions of life are beyond what anybody can
imagine."</TE>
<TE>   The conference was organized by a conservative South Korean newspaper
and the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonpartisan U.S.-backed
organization that promotes democracy. Although the participants were
united in their criticism of the North Korean government, they disagreed
about how to approach the problem.</TE>
<TE>Varied Responses Urged</TE>
<TE>   Some defectors said that humanitarian aid is counterproductive--that
it only prolongs the existence of the regime--while others said enough
food aid is getting through to people in need to make it worthwhile. A
few participants said South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine
policy" of dialogue with the North will eventually help, while others
argued that such policies are no better than were attempts to appease
Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who keep silent about what is happening in North Korea are
guilty too. Maybe that is the real axis of evil," said Norbert
Vollertsen, a German physician and aid worker.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that there was any consensus Saturday, the delegates
recommended that Western aid organizations make sure that distribution of
food in North Korea is closely monitored. There also was widespread
agreement that the international community should do more to help the
more than 100,000 North Korean refugees living in China. Defectors and
aid organizations said the female refugees are often subjected to abuse,
sold by human traffickers into prostitution or forced into unwanted
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, North Koreans who are illegally in China live in constant
fear of being arrested and returned to the North, where they would
probably be sent to prison camps. Human rights advocates are lobbying for
the creation of refugee camps along the Chinese-North Korean border that
would provide shelter for the defectors until they can be resettled in
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Fautre, the Belgian human rights expert, said he and others hope that
Bush's branding of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil," along with
Iran and Iraq, will mean a greater focus on the regime in Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe the sunshine policy is working anymore. I think we
need to do something more subversive to topple this government but in a
nonviolent way. Maybe smuggling in radios to the people. I think with the
'axis of evil' speech, others are beginning to see it in the same way,"
Fautre said.</TE>
<TE>   Fautre's dream and that of others lobbying for camps along the border
is that an outflow of defectors would eventually weaken the regime.</TE>

<DH>Ventura County: Judges consider new selection process after court
ruled present one 'defective.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County judges are considering whether to adopt new
procedures for selecting grand jurors in the wake of a court ruling that
found the existing process is too male-dominated and does not reflect the
county's population.</LD>
<LD>   Presiding Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark and Court Executive
Officer Michael Planet plan to meet with the district attorney and the
county's chief administrator to discuss possible changes.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys say an overhaul of the grand jury system is overdue.</LD>
<TE>   "The system has been growing progressively worse--not better," said
Deputy Public Defender Brian Vogel, whose motion to dismiss the
indictment in a death-penalty murder case led to the recent ruling.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Frank J. Ochoa
threw out the indictment of Michael Schultz after finding that the
2000-01 grand jury was selected from a male-dominated jury pool and did
not represent a fair cross-section of the community as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   Although the exclusion was not deliberate, the judge wrote, it was the
result of a "defective" jury-selection process that relies on volunteers
rather than jurors selected at random.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, which prosecutors decided not to appeal, is expected to
trigger additional legal challenges and could give some convicted
criminals an issue on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, residents apply to serve on the grand jury and are
selected by the county's judges for a one-year term to investigate local
government and return criminal indictments.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of applicants has dwindled in recent years, leading to
smaller and les diverse jury pools.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, only 40 residents applied to serve on the grand jury. Of
those, 36 were white and 28 were men. In the year prior, 49 people
applied to serve on the 19-member panel. Of those, 38 were white and 36
were men.</TE>
<TE>   State law directs that a proportionate number of applicants from each
supervisorial district be represented in a list of potential grand
jurors.</TE>
<TE>   But for the past two years, the court was unable to comply with that
rule because there were only two applicants from the 5th District, which
includes Oxnard and contains the largest Latino population in Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling just recognizes what has been obvious for years," Vogel
said. When it comes to the grand jury "there are not many Hispanics,
there are not many women."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and defense attorneys are awaiting a second ruling from
Ochoa on a similar motion challenging the murder and rape indictment
against Vincent Sanchez. That motion attacks the racial make-up of the
2001-02 grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Oscar Gonzalez, a member of La Raza Lawyers of
California, said he has long been concerned about the grand jury's
make-up. He wonders whether minorities have been able to get a fair
hearing before a body that has been predominantly old, white and male.</TE>
<TE>   And he worries that the selection process is at the root of the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fatal flaw in the process," said Gonzalez, a community
activist who has long criticized Ventura County's courts as lacking
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Something must be amiss if you are getting a pool which, looking at
the demographics, is not reflective of the community," he said. "The
greatest asset a grand juror has is his or her own life experience, and
the broader the base of experience you bring into that room, the
healthier it is for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   By law, all counties must impanel at least one grand jury every year.
But the California Penal Code also allows the use of a second grand jury
to solely consider criminal indictments.</TE>
<TE>   That grand jury is selected at random,. much like a trial jury, and
may serve for a shorter term.</TE>
<TE>   Most California courts have gone to this system, according to legal
experts. But Ventura County is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are still using a grand jury system from years ago,"
said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson, a former federal
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they thought they were a smaller jurisdiction and could use a
small-town approach."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, two months after a suspect in a murder case unsuccessfully
challenged the Ventura County grand jury's racial make-up, Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury wrote a letter to the county Board of Supervisors
urging court and county leaders to adopt a criminal grand jury system.</TE>
<TE>   "First, it makes good legal sense," Bradbury wrote. "Because the
criminal grand jury would be drawn from our pool of potential trial
jurors, it would automatically be representative of a cross-section of
our community."</TE>
<TE>   Using such a procedure would allow the regular grand jury to
concentrate on its role as a watchdog of local government, Bradbury
argued, and reduce the amount of time court staff typically spends trying
to recruit applicants,</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Ochoa noted the district attorney's request for a
criminal grand jury and stated that the Ventura County Superior Court
"has apparently refused."</TE>
<TE>   Planet, who took over as the court's executive officer seven months
ago, said he didn't know whether the court refused or not. "The Superior
Court is in the process of exploring the various alternatives to the way
we select grand jurors on criminal cases," Planet said.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the first time we've thought about it or talked about it,
but when the issue is raised in a couple of cases, it gets us thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Logistical issues, such as cost and the length of service that would
be required of criminal grand jurors, must be examined, he said. "We are
collecting information from other California courts just to find out
exactly what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Planet emphasized the hard work put in by grand jurors, who give up a
year of time for a meager stipend of $20 a day, plus 36 cents a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "The grand jurors in Ventura County provide an important service," he
said. "They spend countless hours in what is practically a full-time
job-with very little pay or acknowledgment."</TE>
<TE>   Representation of Women Disparate</TE>
<TE>   While Ventura County court officials begin to examine the selection
process, prosecutors and defense lawyers are turning their attention to
possible repercussions of Ochoa's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found that while women constituted 51.1% of the county's
jury-eligible population, they represented only 26.5% of the 2000-01
grand jury pool and only 22.2% of the 1999-2000 pool.</TE>
<TE>   "The disparate representation of women," he wrote, "was consistent
throughout a five-year period. From 1995 through 2000, there were a total
of 333 grand jury pool members in Ventura. Only 99 of 333 were women."</TE>
<TE>   Based on those findings, attorneys representing some of the 37
defendants indicted by the 2000-01 grand jury are already working on
motions to quash the indictments.</TE>
<TE>   "It will get the lawyers to take a second look, but it is not an
automatic reversal or dismissal of the charges," said Loyola's Levenson.
This could just be a bump in the procedural road."</TE>
<TE>   It could be a big bump in the case pending against Hells Angels leader
George Christie Jr., who along with several members of the motorcycle
club, is accused of peddling prescription drugs to teenagers on middle
and high school campuses in Ventura and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   It took eight months for prosecutors to present the case to the grand
jury, which in February 2001 charged 22 suspects on 132 criminal counts
in eight separate indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Several of those defendants have pleaded guilty. But Ochoa's decision
could force prosecutors to present the case against Christie and nine
others during a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for murder charges pending against two skin-head gang
members, David Ziesmer and Michael Bridgeford, and their friend, Bridget
Callahan, who were indicted by the 2001 grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's finding that the grand jury has underrepresented women since
1995 could also give some convicted criminals a new issue on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, state lawmakers crafting the statute authorizing criminal
grand juries noted that an indictment issued by an unrepresentative grand
jury could undermine a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the Senate Judiciary Committee reads: "The composition of
the grand jury bringing an indictment may be challengeable upon appeal as
to due process, failing to constitute a panel of 'peers.' To permit the
creation of 'criminal' grand juries may afford the court an opportunity
to fashion a panel more representative of the general population,
immunizing it from future challenge and reducing the risk of successful
appeal on a 'technicality.' "</TE>
<TE>   For now, only one case has been directly affected by Ochoa's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz, a 32-year-old former Ventura appliance repairman, is
scheduled to appear this week for a preliminary hearing on murder and
rape charges. He is accused of strangling 44-year-old Cynthia Burger
during a sexual assault and burglary of her Port Hueneme home in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   If a judge finds there is sufficient evidence, Schultz's case will
proceed to trial. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty.</TE>
