<LD>Church bells pealed last week when L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn and
interim LAPD Chief Martin Pomeroy agreed to a yearlong experiment,
teaming police with Boyle Heights residents.</LD>
<LD>   To understand the neighborhood's jubilation and appreciate what's
at stake, look back to a day in March when cheering grade-school
students, flirting teenagers and obliging parents jammed the Aliso
Pico Recreation Center. They had come to watch a basketball game.
Instead they saw suspected gang members blow away a rival in the gym
doorway. The body count there in the Los Angeles Police Department's
Hollenbeck Division stands at 24 already this year.</LD>
<LD>   "You would think we would be used to this," 34-year resident Lupe
Loera told the mayor and the police chief. "We're not."</LD>
<TE>   What is unthinkable is that any neighborhood would be.</TE>
<TE>   This month we wrote about Boyle Heights' efforts to reclaim its
streets after a van full of alleged gang members killed a 10-year-old
girl in her frontyard.</TE>
<TE>   Moms in green T-shirts stand guard on street corners when school
lets out--a thin green line against drive-by shooters. The local
Catholic church had long worked to knock kids out of the gang rut,
teaching neighborhood toughs, for example, to paint, bake bread--and
get jobs. Now residents joined church organizers and successfully
pressed the city to put in speed bumps and install street lights.
They researched community policing programs in other cities. What
they wanted was cops who agreed to stay on the beat for at least a
year, who got out of their patrol cars and got to know the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   In some of these neighborhoods, gangbanging is a family tradition,
passed from dads who take perverse pride in their prison records to
sons who try to top them in tattoos and attitude. The most promising
programs to uproot this intergenerational pathology put police and
residents together to brainstorm. This is what Boyle Heights will do.</TE>
<TE>   In the 22 days since we last wrote about this, police say gangs
have slaughtered rivals or bystanders in every part of the city: a
19-year-old man in the harbor area, a 15-year-old in a car-to-car
shootout in northeast Los Angeles, another 15-year-old in a
car-to-car shooting downtown. On a single night in the San Fernando
Valley, rival gang members killed one young man and left another
critically wounded; suspected gang members killed a third man outside
a party. The month's most notorious homicide was in the Valley too:
3-year-old Alfredo Cardenas Jr., dead in his father's arms after a
gangster shot at someone else and missed.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers of Boyle Heights are battling the murderers among them
as best they can. We commend the mayor for catching their backs--and
urge him to name a leader or task force to work with other
neighborhoods too.</TE>
<TE>   Past promising efforts have faltered when city leaders' attention
span wandered or commitment waned. That can't happen again if Los
Angeles is to head off a return to the nightmare days of a decade ago
when gangs made parts of Southern California unlivable. No one wants
to get used to that.</TE>

<LD>Every law-abiding citizen in America has experienced some disruption
in life since Sept. 11. As society sorts through new security
procedures and relationships--sometimes clumsily--everyone needs a
little patience, sometimes a lot. Many concerns focus on airport
security checkpoints, where old fears intersect with new suspicions.
So it was disappointing recently to see at least two commercial
airline pilots, of all people, arrested after strongly objecting to
searches and not cooperating.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the deal: Everybody--repeat, everybody--goes through the
same security checkpoints. That's how it is and should be in a
thorough, democratic security procedure, at least until someone
figures out a foolproof way to identify "safe" travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the searches can be annoying, even picayune. Removing shoes
and belts, being frisked and "randomly" selected for repeat searches
by sometimes polite functionaries are new experiences for
nonconvicts, which most of us are. True, contrary to hallowed
American legal tradition, everyone seeking to board an airliner is
now suspect until they prove themselves innocent at these
checkpoints. Every pocket is emptied. All carry-ons are X-rayed; many
are hand-searched. Metal detectors for everyone. The key word here is
"every."</LD>
<TE>   "It is insulting," said John Darrah, a pilots union official, "for
pilots to be treated like criminals in full view of the traveling
public." Well, we think it's arrogant for a few pilots to think
they're above the rules that apply to their passengers. Airline crews
should and do have their own, shorter inspection lines. We all
respect pilots, for their hard-earned skills and cool professionalism
and for the awesome responsibility of safely transporting hundreds of
lives in a complex multimillion-dollar machine. Yet one's
profession--even if it calls for wearing a nifty uniform--is no
ticket to special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to let million-mile frequent fliers board the plane
first; think about it, is it really a reward to sit in that cramped
cocoon an extra five minutes? But seeing pilots undergo the same
inspections adds to passenger confidence and security. When it comes
to security checks in a post-9/11 world, thoroughly checking everyone
is just fine.</TE>

<HD>Wilderness as Legacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildness can be a perishable thing, succumbing to the bite of the
chain saw, the ruts of the all-terrain vehicle and the seemingly
inevitable crush of development. As California's population soars
toward 50 million, our remaining wild lands become more precious.</LD>
<LD>   This generation has an obligation to future generations to save
these places before they are overwhelmed by civilization. Congress
can take a great stride this year by passing the proposed California
Wild Heritage Wilderness Act of 2002, introduced Wednesday as S 2535
by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). The measure would add 2.5 million
acres to the state's federally protected wilderness system in 77
areas ranging from the desert of the southeast to the misty forests
of the state's North Coast. The measure also would add 473 miles
along 22 streams to the federal wild and scenic rivers network.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would establish 39 new wilderness areas and add to 34
existing ones. California has 14 million acres of wilderness, much of
it in remote parts of the Sierra Nevada, the Mojave Desert and the
northern forests. The Boxer bill would expand wildernesses in both
the Angeles and Los Padres national forests, including California
condor habitat in Ventura County. Rep. Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte)
will bring a companion measure to the House.</LD>
<TE>   The Wilderness Act of 1964 provides for setting aside areas "where
the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man
himself is a visitor who does not remain." All the land in Boxer's
proposal already is in federal ownership. Wilderness status prohibits
commercial activity such as logging, mining and livestock grazing,
although existing mining and grazing can continue. There can be no
motorized travel. Over the years, the most popular uses of wilderness
areas have been hiking, backpacking and horseback riding. Now, an
increasing number of Americans are visiting the backcountry to ski
and snowshoe, hunt and fish, raft the streams, climb the peaks and
simply enjoy the quiet and solitude.</TE>
<TE>   The passage of wilderness legislation is always contentious. But
Boxer and her environmental supporters have worked for two years to
limit opposition by consulting with local interests, mountain bikers,
off-road vehicle enthusiasts and others.</TE>
<TE>   One congressman says the bill violates the proper balance between
people and the environment. In fact, wilderness allows humans to
enjoy the land with minimal impact, as they should.</TE>
<TE>   Some say there's already enough wilderness. But Henry David
Thoreau had a response that is even more to the point today than when
he wrote it in "Walden" in 1854: "We need the tonic of wildness....
We can never have enough of nature." Passage of the Boxer bill would
be a good tonic for California.</TE>

<HD>Dunphy 'Was the News'</HD>
<DH>TV* Colleagues recall the man they called the dean of
broadcast journalism. A news anchor at KCAL, he died this week at age
80.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For generations of local news viewers, Jerry Dunphy was the familiar
and authoritative newsman who began each newscast with a warm smile
and his trademark greeting, "From the desert to the sea to all of
Southern California."</LD>
<LD>   But for numerous colleagues who worked with him during the last
four decades in his stints at various stations, Dunphy was a
dedicated newsman secure in his standing as the elder statesman of
local TV news. He could be gruff and demanding, they recalled, but
his softer side regularly shone through. He was patient and helpful
with inexperienced journalists seeking his advice. And he had a
teasing, pointed sense of humor.</LD>
<LD>   Dunphy, one of the main anchors at KCAL Channel 9, died Monday
after suffering a heart attack five days before in front of his
Wilshire Boulevard condominium.</LD>
<TE>   He has been remembered as one of the key forces behind some of Los
Angeles' most innovative TV news formats. During the 1960s and for
half of the 1970s, he was the primary anchor for KNXT's "The Big
News," one of the first local newscasts in the country to run for an
hour each night. In 1975, he moved to KABC-TV Channel 7, where he was
an anchor for "Eyewitness News," which combined titillating stories
with friendly banter. He also did two stints at KCAL, separated by a
three-year term beginning in 1994 at KCBS Channel 2 (the former
KNXT).</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy also helped inspire characters such as the blustery Ted
Baxter on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and Kent Brockman, the news
anchor on "The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   Since his death, several co-workers agreed to reminisce about
Dunphy and their personal and professional interactions with him. In
addition, KCAL will repeat its one-hour tribute to Dunphy, which was
broadcast last week, at 9 Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Don Corsini, general manager, KCAL:</TE>
<TE>   The first time I met Jerry was in my first job in television in
1973. I was a sales guy at KNXT, and Jerry was the lead anchor with
"The Big News," the dominant newscast in the market. There was a
technicians' strike that year, and when that happens, [other staff]
pull strike duty. I was assigned to the TelePrompTer.</TE>
<TE>   On a Friday night, I had a dinner party at my house. I was young
and lived about four blocks from the station. I remember I had about
four glasses of wine, was feeling pretty good, then I remembered that
I had to hurry up and get back to work. I rushed back and started
pasting copy into the TelePrompTer. When it got near the top of the
hour, the TelePrompTer jammed with my copy and started tearing. I
tried to jigger with it, but I had a machine with very little copy.</TE>
<TE>   The show started, and Jerry came on with "From the desert to the
sea to all of Southern....'' Then he stopped. He managed to go on,
but at the commercial break, he pitched a fit like you wouldn't
believe. Our stage manager told him I was not our normal TelePrompTer
operator, and he said, "I don't care who he is! Get a competent
television operator in here so I can do my show!" From that point on,
he was my hero. We used to laugh about that all the time. He was all
over me that day, and 30 years later, we're still together in work
and in spirit. He's the dean of broadcast journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Harvey, anchor, KCAL:</TE>
<TE>   I was absolutely amazed by Jerry's energy. He could outlast all of
us when it came to good old-fashioned fun. On several occasions, a
group of us would gather at Spago for a late dinner and conversation
after the newscast. He closed the place down! The cleaning crew had
finished, the chairs were placed on top of the tables and the parking
attendants were practically falling asleep waiting for us to collect
our cars and go home. He could also dance circles around everyone on
the floor ... without getting tired.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry was also a man who knew what he liked. He would present
wonderful fragrances as Christmas gifts. Once he had me in tears from
laughing so hard. He said, while we were still wearing microphones on
the set, "Pat, when you have to work with people every day, you want
to make sure it's as pleasant an experience as possible, and I just
don't like the perfume some of our co-workers wear, so I thought I'd
help them out." But he meant it in the best way. His heart was as
legendary as his broadcasting career. I learned a lot from him. I
love him and miss him terribly.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz, anchor, KABC-TV:</TE>
<TE>   When I was a kid, I would watch Jerry on "The Big News." To me,
Jerry was the news. When I began at KABC in 1988, I was a young kid,
new in the market. He was so kind to me. He took time out to help me,
and that was so important. Jerry always had time for me. He always
had a twinkle in his eye, that Irish charm that time and age could
not diminish. I have nothing but admiration for him.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Moyer, anchor, KNBC-TV, who worked with Dunphy at KABC:</TE>
<TE>   Jerry always wanted to let folks know that he was the senior horse
in the corral. One day we were sitting together at KABC and he turned
to me and said, "You know what, Paul?" and I said, "What, Dunph?" and
he said, "I'm going to do this till I'm 80." I said, "Yeah, right."
And he absolutely did. He wanted to let the younger anchors know he
was going to be around for a while. He was a very funny guy; he loved
to tease people.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Franklin, former KABC and KCBS movie critic who worked with
Dunphy at Channel 7 from 1985 to 1989:</TE>
<TE>   He was exactly what they needed and wanted. He was Ted Baxter....
Women loved him. He wasn't a reporter, he was a [news] reader, but he
was as good a reader as anyone in the business.... I felt comfortable
with him anchoring. He was always a gentleman, an old-school kind of
guy.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Burns, one of the executive producers of "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show," on the kinship between Dunphy and the Ted Baxter
character. In researching a TV newsroom, Burns and James L. Brooks
spent time at Channel 2:</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Mary's aunt, Alberta Hackett, was the executive
assistant to Bob Wood, who was then the local manager of Channel 2.
So Bertie Hackett got us access to the newsroom and we hung around
there for a while.... And you look at Jerry, and he was the
quintessential local newsman, wasn't he? So I think a lot of the look
and the voice, the big baritone voice and all that, certainly came
from him.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a little [of the arrogance of longtime TV anchor]
George Putnam. But Jerry, as I said, was the guy with the stentorian
voice and the gray hair with the firm jaw who looked into the camera.
But it ended there, because Jerry wasn't dumb. We needed the comedy
relief of the anchorman who didn't know particularly what he was
saying. [Baxter] was just a reader, not a professional newsman. I
think Jerry was.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Leader's Weekly Radio Address to Be Broadcast in
U.S.</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican President Vicente Fox's weekly radio address is coming to the
United States, courtesy of a national, Spanish-language radio
network.</LD>
<LD>   On June 1, Radio Unica will begin transmitting the address as part
of its Saturday lineup that includes President Bush's radio address
from the Oval Office.</LD>
<LD>   "With the large Mexican population north of the border, and with
his interest in immigration, we made an offer to Fox," said Radio
Unica's chief executive officer, Joaquin F. Blaya.</LD>
<TE>   Last May, Radio Unica broadcast the first Spanish version of a
U.S. president's weekly radio address when Bush, in honor of Cinco de
Mayo, delivered the weekly three- to five-minute talk in English and
then in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Miami-based network, which was founded in 1998,
has continued to provide its listeners with simultaneous Spanish
translations of Bush's weekly radio addresses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local listeners can hear Fox's address on KBLA-AM (1580), or by
logging on to www.radiounica.com.</TE>

<HD>Web-Casters See a Temporary Victory in Delay of Royalties</HD>

<LD>Web-casters rejoiced this week--one saying they received a "stay of
execution"--after the Library of Congress rejected proposed royalty
fees for playing music on the Internet. The music industry, on the
other hand, pledged to keep fighting for what it considers fair
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Web-casters--both Internet-only radio stations and terrestrial
broadcasters simulcasting their music on the Web--said the fees
proposed to the U.S. Copyright Office by a panel of arbitrators would
have been too expensive and would have forced them out of business.
But the Recording Industry Assn. of America and unions representing
singers and musicians said it is unfair for Web-casters to play music
without paying performers or record companies for the privilege.</LD>
<LD>   The arbitration panel in February recommended that Internet-only
Web-casters pay .14 cents per song per listener, that radio stations
simulcasting on the Internet pay half that and that noncommercial
broadcasters pay .02 cents. The minimum annual fee would be $500, but
Web-casters said the royalties, retroactive to 1998, could run into
the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The recording industry said the fees weren't high enough and that
the Web-casters shouldn't be allowed to operate their businesses
without paying to use the music.</TE>
<TE>   After intense lobbying in Congress and at the Copyright Office by
both sides, Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, who oversees
the Copyright Office, rejected the proposed fee schedule and said he
would issue a final decision no later than June 20. He did not give a
reason for his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Because both sides contested the proposed fees, many said they
weren't surprised by the rejection. But wary Web-casters said they
need to keep pressing the issue, lest Billington make only cosmetic
changes to the proposal. They insist that small Web-casters will be
able to stay in business only if the fees are based on a percentage
of their revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. responded to the news saying, "We
look forward to the conclusion of this process on June 20 and to the
day when artists and labels finally get paid for the use of their
music."</TE>
<TE>   SoundExchange, the association's fee-collection arm, said it hopes
the sides can come to an agreement and "find creative solutions to
enable Web-casting to thrive while providing recording artists and
those who invest in sound recordings a fair and equitable royalty in
return."</TE>

<HD>Reggae's Unorthodox Hero</HD>
<DH>Ex-Wailer Elan is no Jamaican, but a Jewish Angeleno
seeking a solo path</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BAZ DREISINGER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only one Orthodox Jew from Los Angeles has had to convince a crowd of
Jamaican music fans that he's not Bob Marley's son.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, only one Jewish vocalist has toured the world as
frontman for the Wailers and been told by everyone from Carlos
Santana to David Crosby that his rich, haunting voice is the living
embodiment of Marley's.</LD>
<LD>   And only one artist is quick to quote Rastas and rabbis in the
same breath or write a reggae track that praises God in Jamaican
patois, Hebrew, Arabic and Spanish.</LD>
<TE>   He is Elan, and at 26 he's eager to embark on the solo-artist
journey he's been eyeing since leaving the Wailers in 1999. Given the
singer-songwriter's resume, you might expect that transition to come
off without a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   He's recorded on two Wailers releases, opened shows for India.
Arie and been written up in Vibe magazine. His version of Neil
Diamond's "Red Red Wine" is featured on two recent reggae
compilations, while his recording of Gregory Isaacs' "Dreams Come
True" is on the "Sex and the City" soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   "All Souls," a roots reggae album inflected with dance hall, rock,
hip-hop and Middle Eastern flavors, features collaborations with the
Neptunes and Sly &amp; Robbie.</TE>
<TE>   But that album, started in 1999 and completed a year ago, hasn't
come out yet, thanks to the vagaries of the record business.</TE>
<TE>   Elan signed to the London-Sire label, but that company folded in
December. So Elan remains in limbo while its parent company, the
Warner Music Group, decides whether to release the artist or assign
him to one of its other labels. Elan's manager, Suzanne Hilleary,
says that the singer will perform a live showcase next week for
executives from Warner Bros. Records, which has shown interest in
signing him.</TE>
<TE>   Elan, meanwhile, has long put his faith in powers higher than
record execs. "God has given me a talent and wants me to share it,"
he declares, eating a bagel in a park near his parents' Beverly Hills
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd wake up every morning and say, 'I can't believe this is
happening,'" Elan recalls of his early days with the Wailers. "It's
every kid's fantasy: You love a band all your life and then you're
its lead singer. I'd think, 'How on earth did I get here?'"</TE>
<TE>   The son of an Israeli father of Moroccan descent and a Jewish
Native American mother, Elan grew up singing Sephardic niggunim
(melodies) in temple. Moving from the Fairfax district to Beverly
Hills after his father "made it in the shmatta [clothing] industry,"
Elan, like so many talented Beverly Hills High School students, began
acting and landed small commercial roles.</TE>
<TE>   But as an adolescent reggae fanatic whose favorite vacation spots
were Israel and Jamaica, he had another agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry at the world because I felt that no one was keeping
Bob Marley's spirit alive," he says. "I wanted to do something about
it."</TE>
<TE>   What the 19-year-old Elan did, at the suggestion of a Virgin
Records exec he met at a nightclub, was produce his own reggae album.
For the project, Elan hired Wailers guitarist Al Anderson, who
happened to live two blocks from Elan's North Hollywood studio.</TE>
<TE>   Elan hand-delivered the 12-song demo to the same encouraging
record exec and was met with a response he's now become accustomed
to.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at my bass player, a black man, and said, 'That's you
singing, right?'" Elan says. "He was expecting some white kid
music--Sublime, Sugar Ray--but I gave him straight-up reggae and
dance hall that sounded like Maxi Priest or Shabba Ranks. I don't
think he knew what to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   At 20, Elan Went  on World Tour</TE>
<TE>   Before anyone could figure it out, Elan was oceans away. Anderson
and original Wailers bassist Aston "Family Man" Barrett had invited a
thrilled 20-year-old Elan to join the Wailers' world tour.</TE>
<TE>   Without experience, rehearsals or even a sound check, Elan was
officially fronting the Wailers, performing before thousands with the
world's most famous reggae band.</TE>
<TE>   If the three-year world tour was, as Elan says, "my college," his
classrooms were in Africa and Asia and South America, and his
professors ranged from Shaggy to Santana to Algerian singer Cheb
Mami, with whom he's shared the stage.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Elan became immersed in Judaism, putting on a
prayer shawl to praise God every morning while his Jamaican bandmates
hailed Selassie I. He invoked Jewish and Arabic influences to write
songs about love and God, then performed them on stage with the
Wailers.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest blessing," he remarks, "was when people would come up
to me after the show and ask when I'd be performing new material. I'd
say, 'Didn't you hear those five new songs I just sang?' and they'd
say, 'Oh, I thought those were just unreleased Bob songs!"</TE>
<TE>   As bracing as the experience was, Elan decided to leave the
Wailers in 1999 to pursue his own musical course.</TE>
<TE>   Elan's voice on the unreleased album evokes Marley on one track,
Shabba Ranks on another, Bono or Sting on yet another, reflecting
tastes ranging from hip-hop to drum-and-bass, rock to salsa.</TE>
<TE>   "Record labels--they see me and think, 'He's a nice American kid,
a Jewish boy from L.A. Let's clean him up and turn him into one of
those boys from 'N Sync,'" Elan says with a laugh. "That's not what
I'm about. I can sell records without becoming pop, without giving up
my edge."</TE>

<HD>State Art Funds at Heart of Conflict</HD>
<DH>Budget* Legislative houses are at odds over how to restore
$7 million in proposed cuts. Allocation to Wiesenthal center is at
issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of deep cuts in the proposed 2002-2003 state arts
spending, Senate and Assembly budget subcommittees are recommending
restoration of more than $7 million to aid program allocations and to
prevent layoffs at the California Arts Council.</LD>
<LD>   The additions would raise the proposed budget figure from $14.5
million to $22 million--still substantially less than last year's $31
million. The cuts are part of sweeping budget trims proposed by Gov.
Gray Davis, who is grappling with a $23.6-billion state deficit.</LD>
<LD>   While the Senate and Assembly subcommittees concur that the arts
council deserves more money, they disagree on whether a controversial
allocation of $2 million to Los Angeles' Simon Wiesenthal Center--by
far the largest award to single organization or program in the
proposed arts budget--should be cut in half, funneling $1 million
back into the general arts program pool.</LD>
<TE>   On May 17, the Senate subcommittee voted 3-0 in favor of the cut;
on Wednesday, the larger Assembly subcommittee voted 3-2 against it.
The matter must be resolved in conference before the Legislature's
budget proposal is presented to the governor. No date for the
conference has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Arts council spokesman Adam Gottlieb said he does not believe that
the difference of opinion on the Wiesenthal allocation will weaken
the commitment on both sides to push for the $7 million restoration.
"Hopefully this won't affect the outcome of what has already been
voted; I think they'll take up that issue only," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The arts council allocation for the Wiesenthal center goes to the
institution's Tools for Tolerance program, which provides training
for educators and criminal justice professionals on diversity and
tolerance issues. The program has received $2 million from the arts
council annually since fiscal year 1998-99. And while the funds are
part of the arts council program budget, the amount is designated by
the governor as a line item--which means that it is not subject to
the council's annual peer review process, as are other allocations
within that budget.</TE>
<TE>   Arts council allocations to other organizations for 2002-2003 have
not been determined yet, but Gottlieb said no other organization is
likely to end up with a sum as large as the Wiesenthal allocation.
The largest council awards last year ranged from $100,000 to
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the California Department of
Finance, defended the governor's decision to earmark funds for the
Wiesenthal center and to maintain the allotment at last year's level.
"It's a very well-respected and broadly supported program, and a lot
of people think it does a great deal of good," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), chair of the Senate
subcommittee overseeing the arts council and a longtime arts
advocate, said that "in the interest of fairness, of having to share
the pain," the center should take a cut similar to the rest of the
arts budget.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Woods, chief consultant for the Assembly budget
subcommittee, said the five-member group decided the governor's $2
million award for the Wiesenthal center's program was justifiable
because the Tools for Tolerance program is "an important service"
with a modest price tag.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cuts in the state arts budget would reduce the
estimated $7 million received by L.A. arts agencies by half, which
has local artists and arts leaders on edge. "It's a frightening idea
to have state arts funding cut so drastically; so many of our local
organizations depend on those dollars," said Margie Johnson Reese,
general manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   They also point out that those dollars are often used to leverage
matching funds from the community. "They challenge arts organizations
and school districts to provide money of their own," said Mark
Slavkin, vice president for education at the Los Angeles Music
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the arts community are also concerned because the
proposed budget cut calls for the elimination of some arts council
programs, including those related to traditional folk arts,
artists-in-residence projects and public art and design. "If they are
eliminated, it would take legislative action to reinstate them, and
that's hard, and time-consuming," said Tomas Benitez, executive
director of the East L.A. art gallery Self-Help Graphics.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the $2 million Wiesenthal allocation has been a thorn
in the side of some less well-endowed Los Angeles' arts organizations
since its inception.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates ill will," said Michael Alexander, executive director
of Grand Performances, which programs outdoor concert series at
downtown's California Plaza. "While we can appreciate the importance
of the program, putting it through the arts council when it is not an
arts museum, and not an arts program, distorts the arts funding
picture in California."</TE>
<TE>   "To install a $2 million line item at the same time [as making
major state budget cuts] is unconscionable," said Benitez, whose
organization operates on an annual budget of between $5 and $6
million and which last year received $100,000 in direct and indirect
support from the arts council.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people you are going to wipe out, whose budgets are less
than that one item--and that includes Latino American groups, Asian
American groups, African American groups--you think we're not going
to question it?" he continued. "It's the small guys that are under
half a million dollars that are in danger of being rubbed off the
face of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Meyer May, executive director of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, said that while the organization feels it deserves to receive
the full $2 million, the center agrees with local arts leaders that
its funding should come from other areas of the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   May said that the Wiesenthal center "does not want to be in
conflict with the arts community," adding that the center has in the
past requested that the governor's office move it's allocation.
California Department of Finance spokesman Harrison said he was not
aware of the request.</TE>
<TE>   May also said that the legislature's proposal to cut the funding
to $1 million would have "severe implications for a programs." But he
added that if the cut is made, the center has no recourse. "We are
not immune to the tough budget decisions."</TE>

<HD>'Cool and Crazy' Celebrates the West Coast Sound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The label "West Coast jazz" always has meant different things to
different observers. Some believe West Coast jazz reached its peak in
the '30s and '40s, during the halcyon years of the Central Avenue
music scene. For others, the music that surfaced in the '50s via the
playing of artists such as Gerry Mulligan, Shorty Rogers, Art Pepper
and Bud Shank (among dozens of others) is the preferred West Coast
jazz of treasured memory.</LD>
<LD>   The latter view is being honored this weekend in a busy three-day
festival, "Cool and Crazy: A West Coast Celebration of Jazz," at the
Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood. The event kicked off
Thursday with a pair of panel discussions featuring Howard Rumsey
(owner of the Southland's classic jazz destination--since 1949--the
Lighthouse Cafe), Herb Geller, Jack Sheldon, Phil Urso and Charlie
Mariano.</LD>
<LD>   Afternoon performance events included "The Unheard Lighthouse,"
featuring a septet playing music performed by the original Lighthouse
All-Stars, but never recorded, and individual sets by the quartets of
Mariano and Bob Brookmeyer. Alto saxophonist Mariano, a legendary
figure who has lived in Europe for decades, was reportedly making his
first Southland appearance in 40 years.</LD>
<TE>   The major event of the opening session was "A Portrait of Shorty,"
a lengthy musical tribute to the late trumpeter-arranger-composer
Shorty Rogers performed by a large ensemble of Los Angeles' current
all-star jazz artists. Festival producer Ken Poston, introducing the
program, identified Rogers' 1952 LP release, "Modern Sounds," as the
album that "signaled the birth of West Coast jazz." Although Rogers
had been prominent before that time as an arranger-trumpeter in Woody
Herman's spectacular late-1940s big bands, it was his (and Gerry
Mulligan's) blending of the sophisticated sounds of the Miles Davis
"Birth of the Cool" ensembles into a kind of laid-back, California
style that quickly established West Coast jazz as the most broadly
popular improvisational music of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Saxophonist Bill Perkins, a close friend and associate of Rogers,
led the big band through a spirited collection of Rogers' numbers.
Fine soloing abounded, especially from saxophonists Perkins, Brian
Scanlon and Tom Peterson, trombonist Andy Martin, trumpeter Ron Stout
and pianist Ross Tompkins. Further enhancing the entertaining
program, Poston added a collection of clips from films in which
Rogers had small acting roles ("The Man With the Golden Arm") or
provided much of the music ("The Wild One").</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Cool and Crazy" continues today at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn,
4222 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood. Panels and concerts, 9 a.m. to
midnight. Various prices for events. (909) 599-2912.</TE>

<HD>John and Adams Meet at Harmonic 'Crossroads'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's only natural to assume that Ryan Adams will benefit more,
career-wise, from his teaming with Elton John on Sunday's 8 p.m.
edition of "CMT Crossroads," the imaginative Country Music Television
series that pairs country and pop-rock artists in an informal musical
setting.</LD>
<LD>   Adams, a young singer-songwriter from North Carolina who led the
country-leaning Whiskeytown band before embarking on a more
rock-oriented solo career in recent years, may be a media darling,
but he's still largely unknown to the general pop audience.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who hears John frequently laud Adams' music (and compare
the writer to Bob Dylan and Neil Young) probably will be moved to
think about buying an Adams album (last year's "Gold" is the one to
get).</LD>
<TE>   But John, too, should benefit, because contemporary pop-rock fans,
who may tune in chiefly to see Adams, may well come away with a new
understanding of John's place in the pop-rock hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Because John's most compelling work with co-writer Bernie Taupin
was in the '70s and '80s, it's easy for young pop fans to think of
him more as a crafty hit-maker than as a major pop figure whose body
of work--as a singer, songwriter and pianist--ranks as one of the
most distinguished of modern pop.</TE>
<TE>   As they go through each other's songs (including John's "Daniel"
and Adams' "Firecracker") and country-rock standards (including the
Jerry Lee Lewis hit "Great Balls of Fire"), the pair live up to the
lofty goals of the "Crossroads" series. It's a rare chance for
artists to perform in an atmosphere that is as joyful as it is
illuminating.</TE>

<LD>Toshi Reagon got lost on her way to the Knitting Factory on Thursday,
and when she got there she found a sparse crowd. Then, after just
three strums of her guitar, a string broke.</LD>
<LD>   But if you think that left Reagon discouraged, you don't know her
history. She's the daughter of two members of the Freedom Singers,
who put up with much worse to perform during the civil rights
struggles of the '60s.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the glitches only seemed to fire Reagon up. A spirited
performer to begin with, she was even more so Thursday, playfully
sparring with her three bandmates and bantering with the fans, who
made up in enthusiasm what they lacked in numbers. She improvised a
few funny verses on the difference between the Hollywood Knitting
Factory and its funkier New York sister, and later she, bassist Fred
Cash and drummer Robert Burke tried a spontaneous run at the Rolling
Stones' "Miss You."</LD>
<TE>   Most important, Brooklyn-based Reagon and her crew energized her
own songs, which at their best take the social consciousness of her
heritage and personalize it through heavy influences of '70s rock (a
little Fleetwood Mac here, a little folk-rocky Rod Stewart there, a
lot of Bob Marley throughout).</TE>
<TE>   "Ballad of the Broken Word," from her new, fourth album, "Toshi,"
most fully showed off her powerful, soulful voice and her band's
strengths. Starting with a spare, Led Zeppelin-esque drum pattern,
the song built steadily into a forceful, blues-informed meditation on
freedom and, finally, into intense rock, powered by lead guitarist
Jen Leigh's fiery playing.</TE>
<TE>   While some of the new songs lack a killer chorus or distinctive
arrangement, the power of her personality and the heat of the
performance reaffirmed Reagon's status as an artist to watch.</TE>

<DH>Film* 'Home Movie' chronicles offbeat digs, from a
treehouse to a converted missile silo.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Smith became interested in the subject matter of his latest
project, "Home Movie," about 10 years ago. "I went to visit an artist
in Georgia named Howard Finster," Smith recalls. "He had a thing
called Paradise Garden, and we went to visit his house and were
completely taken with the world that he had created."</LD>
<LD>   To his wish list of "must-do" films, Smith added "a film about
people that have created universes that they [also] live in." He
admits, though, that it was one of those quirky ideas he "probably
would have never gotten around to" had he not been contacted by
like-minded producers John Shirley, Richard Siegel and Stuart Wolff.</LD>
<LD>   "They had come up with this idea to film people with different
homes," Smith recalls. "I told them how odd it was, because I was
completely fascinated with this world. I think that's a large part of
why they picked me to direct this film."</LD>
<TE>   "Home Movie," which opens today in selected theaters, is Smith's
guided tour into the nooks, crannies and, most important, the
personalities of five spectacular American homes and the flamboyant
proprietors for which each abode is both an extension and a
fundamental mode of expression. Shot on location in five sharply
contrasting settings, the homes include the "all electronic" suburban
Chicago home of inventor Ben Skora, whose rooms change places and
shape and whose toilet and easy chair are jet propelled; the
treehouse of the elderly former Japanese movie idol Linda Beech, set
amid the dreamy, mist-enshrouded arbors of a Hawaiian rain forest;
the lavish underground bunker of a New Age couple, the Pedens, whose
formidable digs are the reclaimed interior of a hollowed-out missile
silo.</TE>
<TE>   The five homes and personalities showcased in "Home Movie" were
selected from nearly 1,000 possibilities. "We had a lot of
information coming in and leads on different homes," Smith says. "We
would look through them and find things that we liked. There was a
videotape generated of about 100 of the homes, and from that we were
able to gauge the people. It was a fairly labor-intensive process."</TE>
<TE>   They selected homes in Louisiana, Illinois, California, Hawaii and
Kansas. "That wasn't on purpose," Smith explains. "We were looking
for anything that worked, and for me it was really important to find
people whose lives were completely integrated with their homes--and
that the two seemed inseparable. If they were all in Arizona, that
would have been fine for me. Ultimately it came down to finding
people who were as interesting as their homes."</TE>
<TE>   Smith took a mere 10 days to shoot the film once he and his
producers settled on the five finalists. "It was intense," Smith
recalls. "Excluding travel, literally, I shot from the minute I
showed up to the minute I left. I shot two days in each home. We had
them wearing the same clothes two days in a row. The first
conversation I had about the film was in March of 2000, and we showed
it at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Smith began his career writing features. "I did a film called
'American Job' that was at Sundance in 1996. Right after that I wrote
a second script that went to the Sundance writing lab in 1997. So for
me, I was headed on the track of trying to make narrative films. It
was purely by chance that I ran into Mark Borchardt, the main
character in 'American Movie,'" his follow-up to "American Job."
"What started out as a small side project turned into a four-year
endeavor."</TE>

<DH>'Last Call' takes a grimly superficial look at F. Scott
Fitzgerald; 'Damaged Care,' though timely, needs a story transfusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Showtime tilts heavily toward docudrama this weekend when airing two
original movies that don't even do justice to the swanky press kits
sent out to promote them.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving tonight is "Last Call," yet another grim postmortem of F.
Scott Fitzgerald, this one with Jeremy Irons a bad fit as the noted
author in a story drawn from Frances Kroll Ring's memoir, "Against
the Current: As I Remember F. Scott Fitzgerald."</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Linda Peeno knows about fighting currents, and she has
emotional scars to prove it. That, at least, surfaces in Sunday
night's "Damaged Care," an account of her agonizing evolution from
guilt-ridden managed-care functionary to outspoken critic of the
entire industry. Even Laura Dern, as Peeno, can't rescue this film.</LD>
<TE>   "Last Call" opens in 1939 with 23-year-old Frances (Neve Campbell)
coming aboard as secretary to Fitzgerald, celebrated author of "The
Great Gatsby" and other novels. He's now on the skids in Hollywood,
where his gin bottles far outnumber his lines of prose and where his
mad wife, Zelda (Sissy Spacek), torments him in boozy delusions as
much as she did when they were together.</TE>
<TE>   But there's hope. A whiff of artistry is in the air as Frances, an
aspiring writer, is hired to take dictation and type the book
Fitzgerald is starting about a young movie mogul named Monroe Stahr.</TE>
<TE>   He won't complete "The Last Tycoon." He'll die at age 44 on Dec.
21, 1940, the day after writing the first episode of Chapter 6.</TE>
<TE>   Few among U.S. literati are as fascinating and complex as
Fitzgerald, who was just 23 when his authorship of "This Side of
Paradise" made him famous and rich. Yet "Last Call" is as aimless as
the moneyed class he so often depicted, and Irons' Fitzgerald as
bogus as Jay Gatsby while padding around in his bathrobe and yielding
to spurts of inspiration between those fantasies with Zelda, dreamed
up by director-writer Henry Bromell.</TE>
<TE>   Irons is a good actor but offers here another of the near-generic
tortured souls he has played so often. There is no reservoir of
strength beneath the sadness, no hint of the writer who, while
battling his usual demons, was able to turn his aborted last novel
into something mature and first-rate as far as it went. Beyond that,
the British Irons is wrong physically for the role and slips
occasionally into a dialect that is faintly Southern (Fitzgerald was
born in St. Paul, Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's Frances provides welcome freshness from the moment she
gets her first look at Fitzgerald, gasp-y and disoriented in bed with
fat pouches under his red eyes. But her own eyes are too wide, and
she mostly reminds you of a young Judy Garland singing "You Made Me
Love You" to a photo of Clark Gable.</TE>
<TE>   After one of his drinking binges, Fitzgerald awakens energized and
ready to write, ordering Frances to "get cracking," a message equally
applicable to this movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Damaged Care," meanwhile, has timing in its favor, arriving just
as Kaiser Permanente is under fire in Northern California for
rewarding call-center clerks who limited doctors' appointments and
spent the least time on the phone with patients. And, of course,
health care remains an ongoing crisis in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   As directed by Harry Winer, however, "Damaged Care" is burdened by
weak storytelling that undermines its strong indictment of at least
some HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   Ilene Chaiken's script has Peeno becoming disillusioned after
putting her medical degree to misuse as a claims evaluator with
Humana Inc. in Louisville, where she finds patient care to be much
less important than profit.</TE>
<TE>   The company's bottom line, it turns out, is the bottom line.
"Let's go out and improve our numbers," the staff is urged.</TE>
<TE>   Peeno keeps guiltily collecting her paycheck while doing a slow
burn, using her "denied" stamp far more than "approved." Then one day
she has to decide whether to give thumbs up to a heart transplant.
"Are there any alternatives?" her boss asks. "Death," she replies.
Peeno's approval is overruled, and she soon quits out of principle,
angering her physician husband (James LeGros).</TE>
<TE>   Her second job in managed care, as director of medical reviews,
ultimately turns out as frustrating when her decisions on behalf of
patients are overridden by the company's witch of a nursing manager
(Michelle Clunie). Many sleepless nights later, her marriage
seemingly in ruins, Peeno exchanges her HMO career for one as an
advocate for patients' rights and goes on to give congressional
testimony and testify in a lawsuit against Humana.</TE>
<TE>   A little subtlety and nuance would work wonders for this story's
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Peeno's heroism aside, nearly all the characters opposing her are
one-dimensionally nasty. They're so easily identifiable as heartless
and coldblooded in all ways that you half expect them to push little
old ladies in front of traffic to avoid paying for their medical
care. As if evil were always as instantly obvious.</TE>
<TE>   The usually accomplished Dern, who has a producing credit here, is
nearly as one-note herself, scrunching up her face repeatedly to show
how upset Peeno is. All right already, the point is made.</TE>
<TE>   But stamp the movie "denied."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Last Call" premieres tonight at 8 on Showtime. The network has
rated it TV-14-VLD (may be unsuitable for children under 14, with
advisories for violence, coarse language and suggestive dialogue).</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Dr. Linda Peeno received an offer from Showtime about producing
a movie chronicling her crusade to change health maintenance
organizations, she didn't return the cable network's call. "I was
really reluctant for a long time," Peeno said.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, however, she realized a film could educate people
about the managed care system and agreed to cooperate on the making
of "Damaged Care," premiering Sunday. Peeno hopes the movie will
provide "a kind of systematic understanding that health care is not
something we are going to fix with patient rights legislation. There
are some fundamental questions we have to deal with and ask."</LD>
<LD>   Laura Dern stars as the doctor who spent several years in Kentucky
raising her children before returning to the health care profession
as a medical reviewer and director of two different managed care
organizations. Not only did she find the work unrewarding, she
bristled under decisions she had to make due to financial
constraints.</LD>
<TE>   Peeno discovered much to her dismay that her employers wanted her
to reject nearly every claim, even if it was for necessary
procedures. She reached the breaking point at one HMO, she said, when
she denied a heart transplant due to fine print in the policy and the
patient later died.</TE>
<TE>   Peeno decided to leave the profession and has since become an
outspoken advocate for patients' rights, lecturing on the health care
industry and testifying in medical court cases.</TE>
<TE>   Dern sees Peeno as a true hero. "There is no greater theme to me
in any movie than the everyman who is conquering the system or
revealing the truth within their own nature or outside," the actress
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Peeno, some aspects of managed care have improved
over the past decade, but others have gotten worse. "The public is
knowledgeable now in contrast to the early '90s when I first started
to speak out," she said. "It's amazing over the past four or five
years the knowledge that people have."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom-line practices of the HMOs, though, have simply become
more subtle, Peeno said, pushing decision-making down to the level of
treating physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as they start spending money on a patient--doing
tests--that starts draining out the money they are getting," Peeno
said. "The sicker and more complicated a patient is, the more costly
that is, so physicians start making decisions they wouldn't make
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, Peeno said, physicians were more outspoken about
these practices, but the economic realities have changed their tune.
"If you are a young physician coming out of medical school with
$150,000 worth of debt, maybe a couple of kids, you can't simply
afford ... to stand up against an entity on which your livelihood is
going to depend," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got to decide what we want medicine to be, how we want to
be treated and how much it is going to cost us to do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Damaged Care" can be seen Sunday night at 8 on Showtime. The
network has rated it TV-PG (maybe unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>The Magic of 'Star Wars': Is It Waning or Waxing?</HD>

<LD>I read Patrick Goldstein's column this week ("Seclusion Has Left
Lucas Out of Touch," May 21) and couldn't wait to reply. After all, I
was one of those "lemmings" who stood in line on the opening weekend
for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." Actually, I stood
in line twice--because within 48 hours of seeing it the first time,
my girlfriend and I were back in the theater savoring the magic once
more.</LD>
<LD>   You see, Patrick, while it may be "passe" to actually enjoy this
25-year-old franchise in your elevated Hollywood circles, there are
those of us out here in the real world who actually had tremendous
fun revisiting that galaxy, far, far away. We don't have to feel
superior in bashing something so "old-fashioned" and "cobwebby"
because we came away from the film with goofy grins and speeded-up
pulse rates.</LD>

<TE>   Goldstein's comments about "Star Wars" hammered the nail squarely
into the heart of the last two pictures, the problem being there was
no real heart in these two films. He reminded me of the emotional
intensity, the universal issues and the cohesive mystery of
storytelling, which both "The Lord of the Rings" and at least the
first two "Star Wars" epics had in abundance.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, I liked "Clones" very much in some ways and thought it
was far better than "Phantom Menace," but when the heart is missing,
all the technical brilliance in the world can't save anything or
anyone.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, but I love the new "Star Wars" films, and I like what Lucas
is doing. It's complex, interesting and experimental. I'd like to
know what Goldstein found intense about Peter Jackson's "Fellowship
of the Ring"--it was dreadfully limp to me. "Spider-Man" is nice but
... come on. "Star Wars" is far more interesting as cinema.</TE>

<TE>   Levittown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure you've had responses to the contrary, but all those
die-hards need to wake up: The franchise is no longer what it once
was. "Attack of the Clones" doesn't even come close to
differentiating itself from the standard effects-driven summer fare
the average moviegoer has grown accustomed to waiting in line for
this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   I almost dread Episode III--talk about a nail in the coffin.</TE>
<TE>   JOEL FREY</TE>
<TE>   Dallas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein writes that Lucas has made the prequels devoid of spark
and emotional intensity. If you are looking for that spark on the
mere surface, of course you will be disappointed. "Star Wars" is a
reference to the sci-fi short serials of the '30s and '40s, such as
"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe." In "Clones" and "Menace," the
dialogue is delivered in stilted fashion intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   To be blunt, Patrick, the spark you are seeking is there. You just
can't perceive it. The true meaning and emotion of the new films are
subtle and designed to be felt, not seen. Do yourself a favor; watch
some of the old serials and then go back and watch "Star Wars." This
time, read between the lines. You won't be disappointed if you rid
yourself of your preconceived notions of what you believe "Star Wars"
should be.</TE>
<TE>   "Star Wars" is complicated. You and others are distracted by its
spectacle. Feel "Star Wars" within.</TE>
<TE>   KELLY DAVIS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First of all, this is a kids' movie. Why is Goldstein being so
hard on Lucas? Was he hard on the people who created "Spy Kids"?
Because that's all "Star Wars" is. I had a great two hours, and I was
glued to the screen.</TE>
<TE>   I don't really understand why there are still critics writing
about American movies anyway. I mean, come on: Just go see it and
relax. You pay the same amount for a cheapo dinner at Burger King or
the Olive Garden--do you go home and write silly articles about the
special sauce or the decor of Sizzler? Chill out, man; it's just a
movie.</TE>

<LD>Thank you so much for the excellent article on Saul Levine and radio
station KMZT-FM ("A Maverick Goes Against the Tide Again," by Steve
Carney, May 17). Almost my entire knowledge of classical music has
been learned from listening to his excellent station. I am so
grateful for the hours of pleasure I've had listening to KMZT at home
and in my car.</LD>
<LD>   Now I find Levine's profits are "extremely modest." So, more than
ever in this day of company owners caring only about profits, my
heartfelt thanks to Levine and his wife, Anita. Would that there were
more leaders like him.</LD>

<HD>Rating Movie Ratings</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was extremely disappointed in the article on movie ratings ("PG
Isn't What It Used to Be," by Lynn Smith, May 22). After reading the
article, one might believe that parents have little recourse but to
rely on the suspect ratings put forth by the MPAA. This ignores the
plethora of family-oriented Web sites that catalog in minute detail
the potentially offensive content in virtually every new theatrical
release.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, www.screenit.com offers parents details on 15
different categories of potentially offensive content. The site even
manages to do so in a secular, unbiased manner. For example, parents
unsure if "Attack of the Clones" is appropriate for their children
should have no doubt after reading the more than nine pages presented
on the film.</LD>
<LD>   Although I wholeheartedly agree that the MPAA rating system
provides little guidance for parents, I find it unlikely to change
anytime soon. Rather, informed parents should already know that more
information than any rating could provide is easily at their
fingertips.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While I agree that there is a ratings creep--not all PG movies are
created equal--when Hollywood tells me that it thinks a movie is
inappropriate for those younger than 13, then it must be really
inappropriate! I don't even let my almost-13-year-old son see just
any PG-13 movie, and my 9-year-old daughters are not allowed to see
them at all.</TE>
<TE>   So what if McDonald's is putting Spider-Man in Happy Meals? Be the
parent! Just say no. Trust me, they get over it.</TE>

<LD>We tell teenagers to act their age, but who is to tell adults to do
likewise? Robert Hilburn has obviously chosen to try to be hip rather
than apply his years as a journalist and chronicler of popular music
in a believable way. He is a middle-aged man pretending to understand
today's youth by--among other inappropriate postures--lauding their
temporary idols, such as singing the praises and acknowledging
alleged talent of Eminem ("Eminem, On and On," May 22).</LD>
<LD>   To compare the controversy around Eminem to the ruckus Elvis
stirred up at the start of his career not only demeans Elvis'
historical and cultural importance, it elevates an illiterate,
homophobic thug to a point of influence that I fervently hope he does
not actually possess.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for Brian Lowry's excellent column on Jay Leno and David
Letterman ("Leno Can't Win for Winning," May 22). He articulated many
of the same things that I feel about these two talented and yet
totally different entertainers.</LD>
<LD>   Each man has an entirely different style. Leno's celebrity
interviews are very soft, and he handles his guests with kid gloves.
Letterman is the total opposite: He is mean and petty and capable of
serving his guest's heart to the audience for dinner if he thought he
could get a laugh. Yet I have to admit that Letterman is very funny
and very clever.</LD>
<LD>   I understand why many people don't like Letterman. What I don't
understand is why people don't like Leno. His public persona is that
of a totally pleasant, positive man.</LD>

<TE>   What's not to understand why critics and viewers alike find Jay
Leno a turnoff and still pine for the good ol' days of Johnny Carson?</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, Leno is a one-joke act--whoever he can beat to
death as a punch line for a year or two! First there was Sen. Ted
Kennedy, then O.J. Simpson. Then there were endless President Clinton
jokes, then Gary Condit bought him some more ratings, and now Robert
Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Are we only looking through rose-colored jokes at what Carson did
for decades? No. What we viewers want is humor without jealousy,
political motivation or monotony. Unfortunately, with Leno, we are
stuck with all three.</TE>

<LD>   Madonna Makes London Stage Bow</LD>
<LD>   Madonna isn't up to much as a theater actress, according to one
reviewer who caught the Material Girl's British stage debut Thursday
night in "Up for Grabs," David Williamson's satire about a greedy art
dealer trying to sell a painting by Jackson Pollock.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Wolf of the Associated Press reported that Madonna (appearing
under her married name, Madonna Ritchie) looked toned and lithe as
the avaricious dealer at London's Wyndham's Theatre but had trouble
with the dialogue. Required by the part to address the audience,
Madonna began her opening-night performance in a thin, small voice
that left even those seated near the front straining to hear, he
said. Her projection improved after intermission, Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, took a "half-full" approach. She was "100% better
than I expected based on the early reviews that she was nervous," one
theatergoer told USA Today. Added Rosie Millard, a cultural reporter
for the BBC: "She's a good performer, but the trouble is you can't
divorce Madonna from the play. She's such a personality that you
can't sort out if she can act."</TE>
<TE>   It has been 14 years since Madonna last performed in a play--a
small role on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Award Fever Spurs Letter Hoax</TE>
<TE>   The fierce competition for Tony Awards this year has triggered
some dirty tricks, it seems. Letters are being sent out in the name
of Gregg Edelman, who is nominated as best featured actor in a
musical for his portrayal of Prince Charming in "Into the Woods."
Though the letters seem to be written on his personal stationery and
are signed "G.E.," the actor vehemently denies writing them.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, at least four prominent Tony voters received notes in
the mail, accusing them of failing to appreciate Edelman's talents
and of bad-mouthing him behind his back, the New York Post reports.</TE>
<TE>   Edelman found out about the smear campaign during a terse phone
call from "Into the Woods" composer Stephen Sondheim--whom the letter
accused of lacking "the courage to confront me face-to-face with your
criticisms."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think of myself as having any enemies, but maybe somebody
has a bone to pick with me," the actor said. "Or maybe this is all
just a statement about the fever in the air during this whole crazy
Tony time."</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Guy, King Honored in Blues Awards</TE>
<TE>   Blues guy of the year is Buddy Guy, who topped the slate of
winners of the annual W.C. Handy Blues Awards announced Thursday
night in Memphis. The singer-songwriter-guitarist picked up honors
for contemporary album, contemporary male artist and instrumentalist
of the year (guitar).</TE>
<TE>   Blues heavyweights dominated the rest of the awards, in which B.B.
King was named entertainer of the year. Still, Southern California's
Rod Piazza &amp; the Mighty Flyers were named band of the year, and San
Diego's Keb' Mo' was chosen acoustic artist of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Musselwhite received awards for song of the year and
instrumentalist of the year (harmonica). Mississippi veteran R.L.
Burnside and Little Milton also were double winners, Burnside for
traditional album and male artist, and Milton for soul blues album
and male artist.</TE>
<TE>   Korn at the El Rey--and on the Big Screen</TE>
<TE>   Multimillion-selling rock band Korn will be playing live in dozens
of small theaters around the country next month, with all tickets
priced at just $10. What's the catch? The theaters will be movie
theaters, with the band playing on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   On June 10, the L.A.-based group will perform a concert in New
York City that will be digitally simulcast live to 40 theaters in 30
major cities--a promotion for its new album "Untouchables," to be
released the following day. In the Southland, it will be shown at the
Bridge Cinema de Lux in Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the quintet will play a small room closer
to home: Los Angeles' El Rey Theatre (capacity 900). The event is a
promotional concert for radio station KROQ-FM (106.7) and tickets are
available only as giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Alabama, one of the top country music bands, says it's calling it
quits next year after a farewell tour.... Barbara Walters donated $1
million to a gallery in a new arts center at her alma mater, New
York's Sarah Lawrence College.... Pianist Van Cliburn will read the
poetry of Lord Byron, Tennyson and others on "The Romantic Hours,"
airing tonight at 10 on KMZT-FM (105.1)....Jamie Foxx is returning to
the WB, which is picking up his "Small Talk," a half-hour unscripted
pilot featuring kids sharing memories from their lives while
carpooling in a minivan.</TE>

<HD>Marketing Effort Hands Girls the Reins to 'Spirit'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming off its phenomenal success with "Shrek," DreamWorks knew its
next animated movie, "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," was a horse
of an altogether different color. The title character narrates the
film but neither he nor any other animals talk in the film, only the
humans do. The movie has plenty of visual gags and fast-paced action,
vividly depicted in wide-screen, but one marketing hurdle remained:
The movie is about a horse, and for whatever reason, girls are much
more interested in horses than boys are.</LD>
<LD>   Fully aware that "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of
the Clones" would be holding onto the coveted young-boy demographic,
executives decided they had to go after another, often overlooked
group--teenage girls.</LD>
<LD>   The studio was "all over this," said Laura Groppe, founder of
Girls Intelligence Agency, a girls marketing research group based in
Venice. Groppe said executives told her to "go for it, make it a girl
movie."</LD>
<TE>   So, she contracted to assist DreamWorks with its "Spirit"
publicity. Using the GIA Internet site, www.planetlala.com, GIA began
spreading the word about "Spirit," which opened nationwide Friday.
The company coordinated screenings and writing contests about horses.
Studio co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg even trekked to several events
organized by GIA to discuss the movie with hundreds of teenage girls
around the nation. "Spirit" marks the first time that GIA partnered
to such an extent with a major studio.</TE>
<TE>   But DreamWorks' strategy of targeting girls was something of a
gamble in an industry where high box office returns are driven
primarily by 14-year-old boys. And it appears the studio itself was
somewhat divided over the decision--with some executives (including
Katzenberg) arguing that the film appeals as much to young boys as
young girls.</TE>
<TE>   Studio marketing executives, however, felt they had little choice
but to offer "Spirit" as counter-programming. The movie, which was
made using both 3-D and 2-D animation, features a wild mustang (the
voice of Matt Damon) narrating the story of the Wild West.</TE>
<TE>   "When the competing product is "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars," a
horse is probably the third choice for a boy. A horse is first choice
for a girl," said DreamWorks marketing chief, Terry Press.</TE>
<TE>   The girl market cannot be dismissed, Press added.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us who were at Disney remember 'The Little Mermaid,'
'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Pocahontas,' and know that you can have
success with girl-driven movies," she said. Press said DreamWorks has
learned from past mistakes in trying to market its movies as all
things to everyone. In addition, other films with romantic plot
lines, such as Paramount's "Save the Last Dance" last year and even
Fox's 1997 mega-hit "Titanic," received big box-office returns thanks
primarily to a strong moviegoing girl audience.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there have been some extraordinary flops, like
last year's "Josie and the Pussycats" from Universal and Warner
Bros.' 1995 "A Little Princess," which never found an audience
despite widespread critical acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   "The trap that you fall into is trying to be all things for
everybody these days," Press said. "This time we decided we are going
to speak to our primary audience because they are underserved."</TE>
<TE>   As the person in charge of DreamWorks' animated movies, Katzenberg
is hesitant to narrow the film's appeal strictly to girls.</TE>
<TE>   "There has always been some kind of a special connection between
horses and girls, so certainly that is something to target," he said.
"But ultimately we are all trying to reach the broadest possible
audience. It is a flat-out action-adventure movie."</TE>
<TE>   Groppe of Girls Intelligence Agency is hoping "Spirit" will
succeed so that studios will make more movies for young girls.
According to Teenage Research Unlimited, a consumer marketing
clearinghouse, girls 8 to 18 spend more than $67 billion annually on
consumer items including entertainment, apparel and cosmetics. Teens
bought 40% of the movie tickets sold last year and more than half
were girls, according to the MPAA. And yet, it is the teenage boy
that the movie industry most often courts.</TE>
<TE>   Girls need to make their presence known to the studios, said
Groppe, who sees her mission as increasing awareness "about girls
being able to affect change in the world by using their voice and
their dollars." In an era of female sports heroes and female-driven
action movies like "Charlie's Angels," it was also important that the
movie not appear to be "soft," said Mireille Soria, co-producer of
the film who also participated in several GIA-sponsored mentoring
sessions with girls.</TE>
<TE>   "The marketing challenge was that if you see an animated movie
about horses, the presumption is that it's soft," Soria said. "But
this was not a soft movie. I mean the model for 'Spirit' was Bruce
Willis in 'Die Hard.'"</TE>
<TE>   But despite their long association with cowboys, horses' biggest
appeal remains that ages-old affinity with girls--a topic that has
been studied at least as far back as Freud.</TE>
<TE>   From Elizabeth Taylor sighing for horses in "National Velvet," to
Tatum O'Neill updating the film in 1978 with "International Velvet,"
to Warner Bros.' 1994 version of "Black Beauty," girls and horses
have been frequent costars. On June 18, Warner Bros. Home Video will
release "The Saddle Club: Adventures at Pine Hollow," based on the
bestselling horse-book series for kids--also starring three young
girls.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Globe, head of DreamWorks consumer merchandizing, said
putting together a campaign focused on girls and horses was a
natural.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on girls could help "Spirit" merchandise at a time when
toy retailers in particular are increasingly reluctant to devote
shelf space to movie products, which have often been riskier and
short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Spirit's" girl-oriented goods, such as tie-dyed dresses, pastel
bedding and giant plush horses, offer an alternative to the action
figures and battle toys from "Star Wars" and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   That was part of the strategy, say executives at DreamWorks, which
is launching its biggest-ever licensing campaign with "Spirit," which
includes promotional tie-ins with Burger King, Baskin-Robbins,
Blockbuster, Ralph's, M&amp;Ms and even Spirit Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The studio has licensed Hasbro, the second-largest toy
manufacturer in the world, to make Spirit and Rain horses with play
sets, and Breyer Toy Co., which makes horse-related toys. Beverly
Hills Teddy Bear Co. will be making a plush Spirit stuffed animal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some toy-industry analysts question DreamWork's ability to
push products based on an animated horse. Unlike "Shrek," a unique
character that was easily identifiable by children, "Spirit" runs the
risk of being too much like other toys that are not associated with
the movie--and don't funnel a portion of sales to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "To some shoppers, a horse is a horse is a horse," said Marty
Brochstein, executive editor of the Licensing Letter. "Generics are
going to eat into the potential sales. If they assume that and plan
that way, it's all well and good, but they have to deal with that
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, knowing that statistics show girls read more than
boys, the studio licensed Penguin Books to publish a series of
stories on the movie--with individual books focusing on Spirit's
mother, Esperanza, and Rain, as well as on Spirit. The studio has
also partnered with libraries around the U.S. where reading five
books gets you a free "Spirit" movie ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Although small in numbers, compared to the general population, the
horseriding community is dominated by women, according to observers
in the recreational horseriding industry. DreamWorks has also
approached companies such as Farnam Co., the nation's largest
horse-products retailer, for its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest horse trade shows are skewed about 80% toward
women, according to Heather Hoff, director of marketing for Farnam.
Whether it's grooming products, horse-decorated jewelry, home decor
or clothing, it is women who make the buying decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very, very high percentage female consumer group," Hoff
said. "People who have horses want to be certain that they are
identified in that way. That is why they buy clothing with a horse
motif, jewelry, leather bags, etc."</TE>
<TE>   Although there are several psychological theories about females'
fascination with horses, others have simpler explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist and horse lover Jane Smiley said horses are not only
majestic animals, but they also allow people to feel a kind of
freedom riding them that no other animal can give.</TE>
<TE>   "A horse is the ultimate Prince Charming," Smiley said. "Not only
can you pet it and love it but also ride it and be galloping around
and be free.... All horse things are marketed to girls. That is the
safest bet."</TE>
<TE>   And Bob Foster, a Boy Scout leader who is involved with riding at
Equestrian Trails in Sylmar, surmises that, in general, boys see
horses as a means to an end, while girls form a relationship with the
animal.</TE>
<TE>   "When I take boys out riding, they take the horse out and when we
are done, we are done. With girls, they will comb its mane out and
talk to it," said the father of two girls and one boy. "In general,
boys see horses as a tool, like a motorcycle, whereas girls see the
horse as a friend."</TE>

<HD>Life Just Happens; Films Take a Little More Effort</HD>
<DH>Movies* Sisters Jill and Karen Sprecher put everything they
had into '13 Conversations.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sister screenwriting team of Jill and Karen Sprecher put their
hearts, souls, experiences and much of their life savings into their
new film, "13 Conversations About One Thing"--a movie whose genesis
was a devastating event in Jill's life.</LD>
<LD>   One character in the film, which opened Friday, suffers a severe
brain injury after she's the victim of a hit-and-run auto accident.
Jill Sprecher nearly died from the same type of head injuries in 1985
when a man threw a bottle at her head at point-blank range one
afternoon while she was on an errand.</LD>
<LD>   "I was mugged twice actually within a three-month period in New
York," relates the Wisconsin native in her still distinctive accent.
"The second time--I'm calling it a mugging because I don't know what
else to call it--a guy just hurled a bottle at my head. He wasn't
after my money or anything. He was one of those violent people in New
York."</LD>
<TE>   After working for little or no money in production jobs in New
York, Jill Sprecher finally had landed a decent gig as a production
coordinator on a movie. Afraid she would lose her job, she returned
to work after the incident. Because she was bleeding and in shock,
everyone in the office suggested she go to the hospital. If Sprecher
hadn't taken their advice, she would have died.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the hospital and never came back to the job," she says.
"When the guy hit my head, it was like a missile launched at my head.
I wasn't bleeding that much on the outside, but on the inside, I had
a blood clot. It was a little like 'The Wizard of Oz.' I checked
myself in and then I don't remember anything. I woke up a day and a
half later and my mom was sitting in my room."</TE>
<TE>   Psychologically, Sprecher thought she bounced back rather quickly,
but then a few months after the incident, depression set in. "Then
this guy walked through the subway car and slapped me right here on
the head and kept going," she says. "It wasn't like it hurt, but it
hurt me psychologically. I was just sitting there in the subway car
and all of a sudden tears stared coming down, but one man sitting
across from me saw me and smiled at me.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great because at the time I was thinking people are so
cold and then I saw that smile. I can honestly say that had a huge
effect on me and from that day on I think my life got a bit better."</TE>
<TE>   Sprecher and her sister re-create that scene of hope in the
movie--in fact, they wrote that scene first and then plotted out the
rest of the film, which interweaves multiple stories focusing on the
life-changing impact people can have on each other.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Clea DuVall plays a cleaning woman who is the
hit-and-run victim struggling to recover from her injuries; Alan
Arkin is a dissatisfied salesman who seeks revenge on his
relentlessly happy co-worker; Matthew McConaughey is an obnoxious
young attorney whose life falls part because of a single act of
recklessness; John Turturro is a middle-aged college professor who
decides to change his unhappy life; and Amy Irving plays a sad woman
who is forced to confront her husband's infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Sprecher says the easiest thing about getting the movie made was
writing the script. "The first story we came up with was the happy
guy and the Alan Arkin story," she says. "And then we came up with
complementary stories on the same theme and we plotted them out on
note cards. We had different color cards for each story and we looked
for a place in each story that would sort of be a natural ending
where we could jump to another character. Sometimes it's easier to
see the big picture if you put them on these little cards."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Sprecher admits that the two waited until the last minute to
actually write the script. "We're not very structured," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There also doesn't seem to be any sibling rivalry between the two
(the sisters decline to give their exact ages; Karen is in her early
30s, and Jill is eight years older). Not only do they live together
in their older brother's house in Los Angeles, they also "hang out" a
lot together. "We're almost the same person," says Karen Sprecher.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters first collaborated to write the independent comedy
"Clockwatchers," which Jill Sprecher also directed. "Clockwatchers,"
which premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, was a modestly
received comedy about a group of temp workers who toil at a faceless,
heartless credit company.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience at Sundance was R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe,
who moonlights as a film producer.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters knew that he enjoyed "Clockwatchers," so after they
finished the script to "13 Conversations," they sent it to him. Stipe
and his business partner Sandy Stern signed on as executive
producers. Stipe also got the script to McConaughey and DuVall.</TE>
<TE>   . . "I was so honored that she chose me to play something so
personal for her," says DuVall ("Girl, Interrupted"). "That just made
it more meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   The Sprechers also called their friend actor-writer-director Bob
Balaban ("Gosford Park") for help. "We knew he knew Alan Arkin and we
said would you mind calling Alan and telling him we're not crazy,"
says Jill Sprecher. "13 Conversations " was shot in New York City in
just 32 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to shoot it all on location and not build sets on a
stage," says Jill Sprecher. "That complicates matters because you
have to set up lights at each location, take them down, pack them up
and then move them to another location. We would have to move once a
day. Our cinematographer Dick Pope ("Naked," "Topsy-Turvy") said I
think maybe we can do this in 40 days. I said how about 35 days? . As
we were shooting, our financing never jelled so we had to cut our
budget by one-third [from $4.5 million to $3 million]. It was very
stressful."</TE>
<TE>   So was scheduling the troupe of actors who were simultaneously
working on other projects. "Clea left in the middle to shoot a movie
in Montana," says Jill Sprecher. "Matthew went to Texas and then came
back. Everyone had these specific dates. When our money didn't show
up, I think the original company that was set to produce it wanted us
to push the start date back and we ran up against that if we didn't
start the next day we were doing to lose John Turturro. We ended up
just deciding to go for it. You don't even want the train to stop."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters are in deep debt because of the financial problems on
"13 Conversations." "We used our credit cards a lot to keep it
going," says Jill Sprecher. "We will not be reimbursed for it. The
movie did sell to Sony Classics, but we gave up our interest in the
film" in order to keep the production going.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the sisters have a better-paying gig---they are writing
a drama pilot for a series they pitched to HBO. "We had never gotten
a writing job before," says Karen Sprecher.</TE>

<HD>Sierra's Sun Shines at Music of Changes Concert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Because I am Puerto Rican," Roberto Sierra has written, "my music is
Puerto Rican. Always."</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, his insinuating dance rhythms and bold use of color
suggest a composer who craves island sunshine. And that sunshine
pervaded the outstanding performances in the Music of Changes concert
Thursday night at the Herbert Zipper Concert Hall of the Colburn
School.</LD>
<LD>   But Sierra seems just as comfortable indoors. His life is not at
the beach but at the academy: He teaches at Cornell. His musical
connections are wide. He has served as composer-in-residence of the
Milwaukee Symphony under a Czech music director, Zdenek Macal, and of
the Philadelphia Orchestra under its German music director, Wolfgang
Sawallisch. His pieces almost always have Spanish titles, but one
source for hearing some of his orchestral work is on a CD by the St.
Christopher Chamber Orchestra Vilnius, recorded in Latvia. Three
years ago, Evelyn Glennie performed his percussion concerto with the
L.A. Philharmonic.</LD>
<TE>   The concerto was outgoing, splashed with color. The same can be
true of the chamber pieces, but they demonstrate an interior side as
well. Indeed, for all the surface spirit of his music, Sierra does
not appear to be a spontaneous composer. He likes to limit his
material, such as pitches or intervals, and then carefully solve the
technical problems he sets for himself. Often in the chamber works,
Sierra distrusts his own flamboyance. But he doesn't always succeed:
When that flamboyance breaks out is when he becomes disarmingly
successful.</TE>
<TE>   On this program, that happened most often in the more modest
works. In a brilliant short piece for solo clarinet--"Ritmorroto"
(Broken Rhythm), stunningly played by Joel Schekman--a performer must
put those broken rhythms back together into sinuous melody.
Meanwhile, in two short pieces for flute and guitar meant to describe
imaginary situations that Columbus might have encountered in the New
World, alluring melody is weirdly fractured by microtones.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra has a flair for arrangement. In "Cancionero Sefardi"
(Sephardic Songbook), for soprano (Julieanne Klein was the expressive
guest singer) and small ensemble, startling textures included a
Cagean prepared piano along with klezmer clarinet. Gestures start to
repeat themselves in some of the works, such as chords bursting at
the seams and a tendency to furiously run up and down the scales. But
invariably a magical new sound or a new way of looking at familiar
material would appear at some point to freshen up the music.</TE>
<TE>   The concert ended with a premiere, "Turner," which Music of
Changes commissioned for its core ensemble of flute, clarinet,
violin, cello and piano. Maybe it had just been a long evening, but
Sierra's reaction here to six paintings by Turner seemed to be his
most conventional work on the program. Turner's pigments shimmer and
so did all this impressionistically sparkling, watery music, expertly
colored though it was.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the performance, led by the group's charismatic music
director, Maxim Eshkanazy, was an exciting one. This was the last
concert in the first season of Music of Changes--which also includes
flutist Ellen Burr, violinist Limor Toren, cellist Jacob Szekely and
pianist Louise Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   There is much this young ensemble (most of the players are recent
USC grads) has to learn about putting on concerts. The program wasn't
ideally balanced and the program book something of a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   But more important, the accomplishment, dedication and spirit of
these players, who devote each concert to the works of a single
composer, proved irresistible. With proper guidance and support, this
could become a major group.</TE>

<HD>A Musical Salute to the Troops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you think of entertaining the troops, what names pop to mind?
Cuba Gooding Jr.? Marc Anthony? Celine Dion?</LD>
<LD>   All of them and more are present tonight at 9 for the CBS special
"Rockin' for the USA: A National Salute to the U.S. Military," taped
aboard the country's newest aircraft carrier, the Harry S. Truman, in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. With Memorial Day weekend taking on special
significance, this variety show indulges in some ol'-fashioned
flag-waving. The only thing missing is Bob Hope.</LD>
<LD>   Comparisons between Gooding and Hope are unavoidable here, even if
they are a bit unfair. So here goes: Gooding can scarcely fill Hope's
golf shoes, offering some introductory remarks and a couple of jokes.
He's not much of a presence, which might be more the fault of the
director and producers than his.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, he doesn't even introduce most of the performers. That
task is given to representatives of the service branches, who parcel
out a few facts about the carrier before making awkward segues.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of skill to sail a 97,000-ton ship," says Seaman
Chris Johnson, "or to bring a beautiful song to life. And when it
comes to music, here's a young lady whose talent is totally in
command. Ladies and gentlemen, Jessica Simpson!"</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic lineup moves swiftly from opening act Marc Anthony
(with cutaways to fawning by the women) to Simpson (drooling by the
men); from comic Jeff Foxworthy ("you might be a redneck" guffaws) to
a new version of the Miami Sound Machine (lots more drooling); from
Clint Black (pure enchantment) to Lonestar (pure emotion, save for
one sailor yawning in the crowd).</TE>
<TE>   Curiously enough, this patriotic show's headliner is Dion, who
sings three songs. The finale is "God Bless America," in which she's
joined by the entire cast and the Band of the U.S. Air Force Reserve.
Of course, Dion is a Canadian citizen. But the sentiment holds just
the same.</TE>

<DH>Retailers burned by teen trends hope to win back
middle-aged shoppers</DH>

<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc., battling to win back customers, is among several apparel
retailers that targeted younger shoppers only to incur the wrath of
one of the world's most powerful consuming groups: female baby
boomers.</LD>
<LD>   Other companies that also swerved to snag younger customers,
losing some core boomer shoppers in the process, include AnnTaylor
Stores Corp., Nordstrom Inc. and Talbots Inc., analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   And it's not always easy to win back these shoppers once they
stray because other retailers--including discounters Target Corp. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and specialty chains such as J. Jill Group Inc.
and Chico's FAS Inc.--have moved quickly to lasso them.</LD>
<TE>   Retailers' inclination to target teens in recent years has baffled
analysts because the nearly 40million women ages 38 to 55 have the
most money to spend.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems odd that there aren't more retailers looking at that
customer," said Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with CIBC World Markets.
"I can make a much longer list of teen concepts than I can of
concepts for baby boomer women."</TE>
<TE>   That could be because the boomer concept just isn't as "sexy" as
the teen concept, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Chico's, for example, is gaining market share by wooing
boomers with comfy clothes, special promotions and personal service.</TE>
<TE>   Most Chico's dressing rooms omit mirrors to encourage shoppers to
step out and have more contact with a salesperson to help "build a
friendship," spokeswoman Lexi Winkles said.</TE>
<TE>   While boomers may be more interested in finding the right clothes
than palling around with salespeople, catering to these consumers
does require skill and delicacy because they are particularly
sensitive about aging, retail experts say. And, while they demand
comfort, they have no intention of parading through middle-age in
dowdy clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Her body isn't what it used to be," said Elizabeth Pierce, an
analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, describing the typical boomer
shopper. "She wants to look trendy and sophisticated, but she doesn't
want to look juvenile."</TE>
<TE>   Kathie Young, an ad agency owner who shopped in Chico's this week,
said she wants comfortable clothes but doesn't want it to look like
that's the reason she bought them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm into self-deception," the Costa Mesa resident said.</TE>
<TE>   Candace Corlett thinks it's wrong-headed not to go after the
well-heeled generation of boomer women.</TE>
<TE>   The partner with WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm in New
York, advises clients to nab boomers by using ads that feature
"ageless" looking women, and never to use bold print that could
remind boomers that they need reading glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Corlett said she wrote a letter about baby boomers to Gap Chief
Executive Millard S. Drexler in 1998 but was told that "the 50-plus
target wasn't right for Gap."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, San Francisco-based Gap has never been geared to senior
citizens. But it is a brand that baby boomers helped build, and some
analysts say the "ageless" styles of much of its original clothing
could easily have followed women into their middle years.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gap weighed in heavily with hip huggers last year, not
the kind of thing to draw Kathi McGraw, 55, a Cypress resident who
said she'd buy more clothes at Gap if they fit her.</TE>
<TE>   "My body doesn't fit their pants anymore," McGraw said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, such mistakes can be costly to retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Appealing to a younger, or trendier, customer forced Gap to
compete more directly with a growing number of companies filling that
niche, including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Wet Seal Inc. But these
younger shoppers didn't have the emotional connection to Gap that
earlier customers did, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Their parents know the Gap," said analyst Kurt Barnard, president
of Barnard's Weekly Retail Marketing Report. "Their parents lived in
the Gap."</TE>
<TE>   Gap's shifting strategy also gave discounters, such as Target and
Wal-Mart, a chance to develop what Barnard calls "Gap-type
departments" with basic apparel at lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Gap lost nearly $8 million in 2001, which Drexler has said was the
company's most difficult year. Gap's stock has lost more than half of
its value over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   It closed Friday at $14.06, up 21 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Drexler--who now admits that Gap did "move a little too young" in
the last year or so--stunned analysts Tuesday by announcing that,
after 19 years with the company, he will leave as soon as a
replacement is found.</TE>
<TE>   Drexler said he believes Gap now is moving in the right direction
with products that helped define the brand, such as white shirts,
boot-legged jeans and khakis.</TE>
<TE>   Pants will have a more "democratic" fit, Gap executives said in a
recent conference call. "In response to demand from our women
customers, we're bringing back stretch in a big way," Drexler said.</TE>
<TE>   When New York-based AnnTaylor got too trendy about a year ago, the
results "couldn't have been uglier if they tried," said analyst
Jennifer Black with Wells Fargo Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "It was orange, it was hot pink, it was ruffled, it was stripes,"
she said. "People hated it." Based on the company's more recent
merchandise, Black said she wrote a report on the company entitled
"Ugly No More."</TE>
<TE>   Hingham, Mass.-based Talbots--known for its classic apparel--also
flirted briefly with younger customers a few years ago and then
returned to more familiar territory, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Nordstrom added younger-looking clothes in
departments where the offerings had been geared to an older customer.
The chain also experimented with brighter colors on walls and
replaced piano players in some stores with jazzier music, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these companies has backtracked, analysts say, with
varying degrees of success.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fort Myers, Fla.-based Chico's sales rose almost 46%
last year and earnings grew almost 49%. Its stock has gained 82% over
the last year and is up 50% in 2002. The stock closed Friday at
$38.51, down $1.08, on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The company's new catalog features models of indefinable ages
wearing crop pants, loose shirts, straight dresses and bold jewelry.
Not a single blouse is tucked in.</TE>
<TE>   J. Jill also has won followers with loose-fitting clothes that
still look stylish.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Martinez, 49, shopped at Chico's for the first time Wednesday,
trying on various tops with red-cropped pants.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Beach homemaker said she knows precisely what she
wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to look like I did at 25, before we boomed," she said.</TE>

<HD>SEC Filing Details Deals by Rigases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rigas family that controlled Adelphia Communications Corp. since
its founding in 1952 used the publicly traded cable company to
finance an assortment of personal businesses, including a
professional hockey team, a film production company, an interior
design firm, landscape and maintenance ventures and a car dealership,
according to a regulatory filing Friday by the company.</LD>
<LD>   John Rigas and his three sons relinquished control of the nation's
sixth-largest cable company Thursday, under pressure from creditors
and outside directors. The company is under investigation for
questionable accounting practices involving $3.1 billion that the
family borrowed, using the public company as a guarantor.</LD>
<LD>   The company, the largest cable provider in Southern California, is
struggling to stave off bankruptcy amid a cash crunch and defaults on
several of its loans.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia's disclosures Friday were the first detailed account of
transactions between the Rigases and the cable company they
controlled through ownership of 60% of the voting shares. In a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a special committee of
outside directors of Adelphia said it was continuing to investigate a
series of transactions between the family and the public company.</TE>
<TE>   For example, since January 2001, the family used corporate funds
to cover $241 million in margin calls, when lenders seek repayment of
loans collateralized by stock that has plunged in value.</TE>
<TE>   According to the SEC filing, Adelphia also lent $150 million to
the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, owned by the Rigas family, and $3.7
million to a production company that financed "Songcatcher," a film
released by John's daughter, Ellen Rigas Venetis, a New York
filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Private companies owned by the Rigases also benefited by providing
services to Adelphia. Two companies owned by the Rigas family
collected $12.8 million from Adelphia in 2001 for furniture and
interior design services. Rigases' Wending Creek Farms collected $2
million the same year for snow removal, landscaping and other
maintenance services.</TE>
<TE>   Under another transaction, Adelphia bought timber rights from a
third party in February 2000 for $26.5 million. In 2020, the rights
revert to the owner of the timber land. About the same time the deal
was struck, the Rigases bought the 3,656 acres for a little more than
$465,000, meaning that they eventually will end up with the timber
rights.</TE>
<TE>   The other transaction involved a world-class golf course being
built by the company. All but 169 acres of the course's 830 acres are
owned by Rigas family partnerships, although there is no record of
lease transactions between the family and the company for the use of
the land.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares resumed trading Thursday after a six-day halt and
plunged 54% to $2.62 on Nasdaq. They have declined nearly 90% since
the March disclosures, but inched up 15 cents Friday to $2.77.</TE>

<HD>Holes Seen in Case Against Andersen</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Prosecution has failed to prove that critical
evidence was destroyed, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A team of Justice Department officials strode into a ninth-floor
federal courtroom here three weeks ago, armed with reams of paper
evidence and a blue-chip witness.</LD>
<LD>   But by Friday, as prosecutors neared the end of their obstruction
of justice case against accounting firm Arthur Andersen, neither the
documents nor star witness David B. Duncan had proved devastating to
the defense, some legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear the government never put forth a silver bullet, and it
never had any one piece of evidence that was overwhelmingly
significant," said Christopher J. Bebel, a Houston attorney and
occasional consultant to the Justice Department on securities cases.</LD>
<TE>   Each time prosecutors introduced an Enron Corp. e-mail or
memorandum purportedly pointing toward Andersen's culpability,
Andersen defense lawyer Rusty Hardin noted that the documents were
preserved, not shredded, and turned over to federal investigators
under subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   And under cross-examination, Duncan, the Andersen partner in
charge of auditing Enron who initiated a shredding frenzy last fall,
was unable to cite any specific documents or facts he intended to
keep away from the Securities and Exchange Commission by destroying
them.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the testimony and evidence may cause jurors to
question whether Andersen had the "corrupt" intent required to
convict under the obstruction statute, said Bebel and other analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue as to [Andersen's] state of mind is very much up in the
air," said Bebel, who has sat in on portions of the trial. "It looks
to be more of a situation where Andersen was fumbling and bumbling,
engaging in negligence perhaps, rather than the sort of egregious
conduct that generally accompanies federal criminal prosecutions."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors still have opportunities to gain an edge, including a
special conference scheduled to begin today in which the two sides
will argue over the instructions U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon
will read to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors hope to persuade Harmon to tell the jury that a
partnership such as Andersen is legally bound by the acts of its
officers and partners. Since Duncan has pleaded guilty to obstruction
of justice, a strict interpretation of the law could mean a
near-automatic conviction of Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   But jurors, notoriously unpredictable, could ignore Harmon,
particularly if they believe the firm has been unjustly accused or
that Duncan pleaded guilty under government pressure, as Hardin has
contended.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking aspect of Duncan's appearance on the witness
stand was the extent to which his testimony appeared to aid equally
the prosecution and the firm that fired him in January.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the Andersen team that audited Enron, Duncan was aware
early on of the energy trader's financial maneuvers that ultimately
led to the company's Dec. 2 bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 23, after learning that the SEC had launched an informal
inquiry into Enron, Duncan testified that he instructed subordinates
to comply with Andersen's document-retention policy, which he knew
would result in the destruction of some files.</TE>
<TE>   But on cross-examination, Duncan said he could not recall any
particular documents or facts he hoped would be hidden from the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan "was unable to pinpoint specific documents he meant to keep
away," said David Berg, a veteran Houston defense attorney who has
tried cases before Harmon. "And [Andersen] has shown the irrelevancy
of the documents that were shredded. That is going to weigh heavily
on the jury's mind."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts disagreed, saying that Duncan's admission of guilt,
coupled with a technical instruction from the judge that destruction
of any files constitutes a crime, could tip the balance in favor of
the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "If I destroy one document with intent ... and leave everything
else, that's still obstruction of justice," said Gerald Treece,
associate dean of the South Texas College of Law, who has watched
some of the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Treece said he expected jury instructions that would favor the
prosecution and added that jurors "don't know who's right or wrong
but under our laws, you presume the lady in the black robe is right.
I'm still thinking the smart money is on the government, but then
again I didn't see any defense when this case started."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also appeared to aid the defense when he testified that he
was not considering his firm's past accounting woes at the time he
ordered the destruction. Prosecutors had suggested that Andersen
executives had a motive to shred Enron-related audit papers because
they feared harsh sanctions that could be levied if the firm violated
a cease-and-desist order it had entered to settle an SEC fraud
lawsuit arising from its audits of Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan not only cast doubt on that idea, but he defended much of
Andersen's Enron-related accounting. That testimony dilutes the
prosecution's claim of corrupt intent and also may weaken potential
prosecutions of Enron executives for accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Other testimony introduced by the prosecution told how Enron's
aggressive accounting sparked disputes inside Andersen about how to
treat complex financial maneuvers, and how anxiety rose at the
Chicago-based accounting firm as Enron, one of its biggest clients,
collapsed amid revelations of insider dealings.</TE>
<TE>   All of that, prosecutors allege, prompted Andersen to at least
tacitly approve widespread destruction of Enron-related documents in
October.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors presented scant evidence that the destruction had
been ordered from top Andersen officials as part of a centrally
coordinated scheme.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, prosecutors called their last witness, an FBI agent, to
show that fears of an SEC inquiry did play a role in the destruction
Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The agent read a transcript of testimony from Andersen partner
Thomas Bauer in a civil case in which Bauer said he didn't "recall
specifically" anyone mentioning the SEC's informal inquiry in
meetings that day. Duncan testified that he did mention the SEC
inquiry when he called the meeting that day. Bauer has invoked his
right against self-incrimination and refused to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also introduced notes from an internal Andersen
report, which found that the deletion of e-mail by the firm's Enron
auditors increased three-fold after the October meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin is expected to begin presenting Andersen's case Monday, and
the jury could begin deliberating by the end of next week. His first
witness is expected to be Richard Corgel, Andersen's U.S. practice
director.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides are under huge pressure," said Berg, the Houston
lawyer. "But remember, the government's burden is 'beyond a
reasonable doubt.' It's not 'maybe.'"</TE>

<HD>Recording Industry Sues Audiogalaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major record companies and music publishers filed suit Friday
against another online music service for copyright infringement, this
time targeting a company that had tried to reduce piracy on its
network.</LD>
<LD>   The defendant is Audiogalaxy of Austin, Texas, a peer-to-peer
network that has been operating for more than three years, and its
owner, Michael Merhej. The network's popularity has surged in recent
months, with more than 3.5million users in March, according to the
most recent study by Jupiter Media Metrix, a research firm.</LD>
<LD>   Like Napster Inc., Kazaa and other peer-to-peer ventures sued for
infringement, Audiogalaxy enables consumers to find and copy songs
from one another's computers through the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America and music publishers held
their fire against Audiogalaxy for more than a year because it agreed
to block their songs from being pirated.</TE>
<TE>   But as the months passed, they grew increasingly skeptical about
the company's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York, alleges
that Audiogalaxy's attempts to filter out copyrighted songs were
"half-hearted" and "ineffectual." Citing a recent ruling by a federal
appeals panel in the Napster case, the lawsuit argues that
Audiogalaxy has a duty to implement "a truly effective filtering
system" once notified of copyright violations.</TE>
<TE>   Said Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal
affairs at the RIAA, "They repeatedly assured us that they would
improve their filtering. They haven't done so. At all."</TE>
<TE>   Merhej could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Audiogalaxy has been a full-service music site, distributing
promotional material for artists and labels, reviewing digital music
gear and providing links to Web sites selling CDs. According to the
lawsuit, the company also operated a peer-to-peer network similar to
Napster's, setting up central computers to guide users to free
downloads.</TE>
<TE>   The network goes beyond Napster's in several respects--it's better
organized and more flexible, enabling people to find songs even on
the computers of users not connected to the Net at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Audiogalaxy also recommends more music to download based on what a
user searches for, a practice that potentially fuels the downloading
of unauthorized files.</TE>
<TE>   Although peer-to-peer services have yet to be ruled illegal by
nature, the federal courts granted a pretrial injunction last year
against Napster's free service. An appeals panel later ruled that
Napster needed to remain shut down until it had done everything
technically feasible to stop piracy.</TE>

<HD>CMS Chief Quits Amid Trading Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Energy: Statements for 2000 and 2001 will be revised in
wake of the disclosure of $5.2billion in bogus trades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMS Energy Corp. said Friday that Chief Executive William T.
McCormick Jr. resigned after the company disclosed $5.2 billion of
sham electricity trades.</LD>
<LD>   CMS financial statements will be revised for 2000 and 2001 to
remove revenue from "round-trip" trades that are being investigated
by regulators, the company said. Board member Kenneth Whipple, a
67-year-old former Ford Motor Co. executive, will replace McCormick,
57, until a permanent successor is hired.</LD>
<LD>   Bogus trades and accounting errors disclosed by CMS, Dynegy Inc.
and Reliant Resources Inc. in recent weeks led to probes by
regulators already reviewing allegations that California's power
market was manipulated. CMS, which had a loss of $545 million last
year, inflated revenue by 28% over two years.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Dearborn, Mich.-based CMS rose 61 cents to $18.31 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 38% from a year ago and
reached a 14-year low of $13.90 last week.</TE>
<TE>   McCormick, after 17 years of running the company, announced his
resignation at the start of Friday's annual meeting, sparking
applause by some shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   At least six lawsuits against the company have been filed since
May17.</TE>
<TE>   In a round-trip trade, a company simultaneously buys and sells
power or natural gas at the same price and quantity. Such
transactions have little use except to boost trading figures.</TE>
<TE>   The head of CMS Energy's trading business, Tamela Pallas, resigned
last week after disclosure of the trades led to a federal
investigation and a plunge in CMS stock. Two Reliant trading
executives also have quit.</TE>
<TE>   "There may not be anything illegal here, but this practice does
not fit with the high standards of this company," Whipple told
investors at the annual meeting. "We're sorry we did it and aren't
going to do it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   CMS said it will restate $4.2 billion of trades for 2001 and an
additional $1 billion for 2000. An estimated $3.3 billion of last
year's revenue was from round-trip electricity trades, and $900
million more was related to an incomplete round-trip trade in gas,
the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The company had reported $9.6billion in revenue in 2001 and
$8.7billion in 2000.</TE>

<HD>GDP Growth Data Downshifted</HD>
<DH>Economy: Revised figure for first quarter signals that pace
of recovery is slower than Wall Street had been anticipating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy bolted ahead at its fastest pace in nearly two years
in the first quarter, but the rise was not quite as rapid as
initially thought, the government said Friday in a report that showed
weaker consumer and business spending than first estimated.</LD>
<LD>   Gross domestic product, a measure of the goods and services
produced within U.S. borders, raced forward at a revised 5.6% annual
rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department
said.</LD>
<LD>   The number reflected an economy climbing smartly out of recession,
although it was a downward revision from the 5.8% gain the department
reported a month ago and came as a surprise on Wall Street, where
economists had expected a revision upward to 6%.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the report's details suggested the economy was
fundamentally weaker than the heady pace of GDP growth would suggest
at first blush. The figures on consumer and business spending were
revised down, and more of the growth reflected a slowdown in the rate
at which businesses reduced inventories.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending advanced at a 3.2% pace in the first
quarter--still solid, but not as strong as the 3.5% increase first
reported. That downward revision mostly reflected weaker spending on
durable goods, such as cars, which fell at a 9.6% rate, the steepest
falloff since a 13.1% plunge 11 years ago. A rush to take advantage
of zero-percent financing for car purchases after the Sept. 11
attacks had pushed spending on durables up sharply near the end of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The first-quarter figure for business investment spending was also
revised lower. The department said business spending on structures,
equipment and software plummeted 8.2% in the first quarter,
considerably weaker than the initially estimated 5.7% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Still, business investment did not drop nearly as sharply as it
had in the fourth quarter. Combined with the pickup in durable goods
orders reported Thursday, that offers hope the steep investment
pullback that tipped the economy into recession was abating.</TE>
<TE>   The largest contributor to first-quarter growth was a big slowdown
in the rate at which businesses reduced inventories. When businesses
rely less heavily on inventories to meet demand they have to step up
production, which raises GDP.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of inventory reduction in the first quarter was less
dramatic than previously thought, giving more of a boost to GDP
growth but not enough to offset other negative factors.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed inflation under wraps, with the price index for
personal consumption expenditures--closely watched by Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan--rising only 0.7%. Economists say a lack of inflation
pressures buys the Fed time to allow the economy to gather steam
before raising rates.</TE>
<TE>   The report contained some good news on businesses struggling to
boost profits. The government's measure of after-tax corporate
profits rose 0.9% in the first quarter of the year, the biggest gain
since the second quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report Friday found that new-home sales rose 1% in
April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 915,000 units, the
fastest sales pace in a year.</TE>

<HD>Gateway to Settle Shareholder Lawsuits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gateway Inc. on Friday said it had agreed to pay $10.25 million to
settle securities lawsuits by shareholders alleging the personal
computer maker had misrepresented financial performance.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway said that it wanted to avoid prolonged litigation and that
the settlement, which must be approved by a court, would not affect
Gateway finances because it would be covered by insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway's latest quarterly filing listed outstanding securities
cases filed in 2000 and 2001 alleging variously that the company, its
board and officers had misrepresented Gateway's financial performance
and wasted assets.</LD>
<TE>   "Although we feel these claims are without merit ... settling this
matter at this time and avoiding further prolonged litigation is in
the best interests of our shareholders," Gateway said.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders at several technology companies whose share prices
have fallen to a fraction of their highs have filed similar suits
alleging that executives misrepresented finances to bolster stock
prices.</TE>
<TE>   The main Gateway suits were on behalf of shareholders who bought
stock from April 14, 2000, to Feb.28, 2001, when shares of the
company traded in a range of $17.20 to more than $70. Gateway shares
closed off 17 cents at $5.68 on Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, before news of the settlement was announced.</TE>

<HD>Windows XP Update Lets Users Conceal Programs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. will let customers hide programs it developed by
revising its newest Windows operating system to comply with an
antitrust settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The Windows XP update will let computer makers and users change
which Internet audio player and Web browser a system automatically
uses, said Jim Cullinan, a Windows product manager. It also will let
users display or hide program links and omit prompts to sign up for
Microsoft's Passport identification service.</LD>
<LD>   The company agreed with the Justice Department and nine states to
allow such changes to ensure that it can't use Windows, which runs
90% of the world's personal computers, to push other Microsoft
programs at the expense of rivals. Many PC makers now may promote
products from Microsoft rivals such as AOL Time Warner Inc. and
RealNetworks Inc. for cash, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Europe, Microsoft is under investigation by the
European Commission over claims that its system to collect personal
information breaks privacy rules. The EU said it has "concerns" about
the legality of Microsoft's Passport product, which stores identity
data on the company's servers.</TE>

<HD>Nintendo President Stepping Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nintendo Co. said Friday that its longtime president, Hiroshi
Yamauchi, would step down next week after 52 years at the world's
second-largest video game company.</LD>
<LD>   His handpicked successor, Satoru Iwata, 42, will take over the
day-to-day operations of the $4-billion firm as it is locked in a
three-way battle with Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. for dominance in
the $27-billion global game business.</LD>
<LD>   The 74-year-old Yamauchi, whose departure had been widely
expected, leaves Nintendo in solid financial shape, with $6 billion
in cash and no debt.</LD>
<TE>   The company, which posted $86.8 million in profit on $3.5 billion
in revenue in its fiscal 2001, expects fiscal 2002 revenue to climb
16% to about $4 billion, driven primarily by the launch of the
GameCube console system and the GameBoy Advance hand-held game
machine. Nintendo will report its financial results Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Iwata, who joined Nintendo two years ago from Hal Laboratories,
which developed games for Nintendo, will have to work hard to
maintain the momentum. Sony leads the gaming pack with nearly 30
million PlayStation 2 game consoles sold worldwide. Nintendo has sold
4.5 million GameCubes, and Microsoft is trailing at about 4 million
Xbox consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sony has declared and Microsoft has hinted at a desire to
use their consoles as gateways for delivering digital music and
movies to living rooms, Iwata has said he does not wish to change
Nintendo's focus on games.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not deviate from our core business," said Nintendo
spokeswoman Perrin Kaplan.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Yamauchi nor Iwata was available for comment. Iwata will
report to Atsushi Asada, a Nintendo vice president who will become
chairman. Yamauchi will stay on as a consultant and advise Iwata.</TE>
<TE>   Yamauchi, who owns 10% of the company and is its biggest
shareholder, is expected to appoint an executive committee that would
include Iwata, Asada and four senior management directors--Yoshihiro
Mori, Genyo Takeda, Shinji Hatano and Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator
of Nintendo's "Mario" and "Zelda" game franchises. Each member would
have an equal vote in all strategic decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Yamauchi, a publicity-shy executive, took over the family business
from his grandfather in 1949 and transformed it from a small
trading-card manufacturer to the world's second-largest video game
company.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he introduced the Nintendo Entertainment System, a
cartridge-based video game console, just as Mattel Inc. and Coleco
exited the market. The NES, however, sold well thanks to a game
called "Super Mario Bros," and that paved the way for the Super NES,
22 million units of which were sold worldwide. In 1996, the company
launched the N64, followed by the GameCube in November.</TE>
<TE>   Today, video game revenue rivals that of the movie and music
businesses.</TE>

<HD>Bail Denied for Stock Trader in Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor brings up Sept. 11, but defense denies
client had advance knowledge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>An Egyptian-born investor charged with inducing two FBI agents to
join a stock scam was ordered held without bail Friday after a court
hearing marked by heated debate over whether he had advance knowledge
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Ken Breen said Amr I. "Anthony" Elgindy, 34,
called his broker Sept. 10 and told him to liquidate a $300,000
account held in trust for Elgindy's children. In that conversation,
according to Breen, Elgindy said the stock market would soon plunge.</LD>
<LD>   "Perhaps Mr. Elgindy had pre-knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks,"
Breen told Magistrate John Houston in arguing against bail. "Instead
of trying to report it, he tried to profit from it."</LD>
<TE>   Elgindy's lawyer, Jeanne Knight, accused the prosecutor of using
racial profiling to smear her client. She said the timing of
Elgindy's call to the broker was coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just like the case of Wen Ho Lee where the government
tried to charge someone with spying just because they are Chinese,"
Knight said, referring to the former scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. "My client was being watched only because he is of Middle
Eastern descent. This is scapegoating."</TE>
<TE>   Houston noted that none of the charges against Elgindy relate to
the Sept. 11 attacks and said he would disregard Breen's assertion.
Houston said he was denying bail because Elgindy, by having
ammunition at his home, violated his parole from an earlier
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, a colorful and controversial figure in the world of
Internet stock trading, is charged with racketeering, fraud,
extortion and obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   According to a federal indictment unveiled in New York on
Wednesday, Elgindy and two associates conspired with two FBI agents
to gain confidential investigative information that they used to
attack the reputations of companies they targeted, hoping to drive
down the stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy disseminated the information on subscription-based and
public Internet sites where he had gained a reputation as an
aggressive and often prescient short seller--a stock-trading strategy
in which the trader profits by betting that stock prices will
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy and fellow traders Derrick W. Cleveland and Troy Peters
also allegedly used FBI material to extort payments from companies.</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI agent Jeffrey A. Royer, who left the agency in December
to join Elgindy's investment firm, and Lynn Wingate, an
Albuquerque-based FBI agent, face a federal court hearing in
Brooklyn, N.Y., on Tuesday on racketeering, fraud and obstruction of
justice charges.</TE>
<TE>   Looking somber, Elgindy did not speak during Friday's hearing. He
was arrested Wednesday at his $2.2-million home in Encinitas, in
northern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   In arguing against bail, prosecutors said Elgindy is a flight
risk. Breen noted that Elgindy wired large sums of money to Egypt and
Lebanon in the days after Sept. 11. The transfers, from accounts in
the U.S. and Canada, included the $300,000 from the children's trust
fund, plus $700,000 wired to Lebanon, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight said the order to liquidate the children's account came
after the market had closed Sept. 10 and was not an "urgent" request
as claimed by prosecutors. She also said the money sent to Lebanon
was for a vacation condominium.</TE>
<TE>   She said Elgindy, a U.S. citizen, had $2 million invested in the
market in short positions at the time of the attacks. But prosecutors
noted Elgindy stood to gain if the market dropped sharply.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Sept. 11, rumors swirled that terrorists may
have profited by shorting insurance and airline stocks, which led the
market's plunge when it reopened after the attacks. Investigators
haven't been able to prove that such a scheme existed, and skeptics
note that the market was falling in early September, providing a
possible legitimate backdrop for short selling.</TE>
<TE>   An extradition hearing was set for June 6. Knight declined to say
whether Elgindy would fight extradition to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy's 14-year career in the securities industry has been
marked by repeated clashes with market regulators and customers,
including his own mother.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago anesthesiologist Laila I. Gomaa brought an arbitration
claim against her son in 1992, accusing him of making unauthorized
trades in the pension account she kept at his securities firm,
according to records from the National Assn. of Securities Dealers,
where the dispute was filed. Gomaa was awarded $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   NASD revoked Elgindy's brokerage license in 1998.</TE>

<HD>New-Home Permits Rise Slightly in April</HD>
<DH>Construction: Increase of less than 1% from year-ago levels
means state's housing needs aren't being met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Planned construction in California barely rose last month from a year
earlier, showing that little progress is being made in addressing the
state's housing needs.</LD>
<LD>   Permits were pulled in April at an annual rate of 163,000 units,
up 5.5% from the previous month but an increase of less than 1% from
a year earlier, according to a state analysis of industry figures.</LD>
<LD>   "It just won't be enough," said Howard Roth, chief economist for
the Department of Finance. "This is a prescription for higher
prices."</LD>
<TE>   Construction at year-ago levels will make little progress against
a widening housing deficit, Roth said. The problem could worsen this
year if economic growth creates a bigger appetite for housing,
putting upward pressure on prices.</TE>
<TE>   At the current rate of production, Roth added, "we will have
affordability problems in good times and bad."</TE>
<TE>   California results were in contrast to the nation. U.S. building
permits, an indicator of future construction, grew 0.3% last month to
an annual pace of 1.63 million units. Although dipping from a record
pace earlier this year, national housing construction is expected to
remain at a relatively high level.</TE>
<TE>   Builders across California are struggling to plan all forms of
housing, especially lower-cost multifamily units that usually face
harsher scrutiny from opponents. In April, permits for apartments,
condominiums and townhomes fell by more than 5% from a year earlier.
Permits for single-family houses rose by more than 3% during the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that builders are producing 55,000 to 100,000
fewer units than what is needed to absorb annual growth. The
shortfall has led to a record-low supply of housing in the state.</TE>
<TE>   That scarcity comes at a time when consumers are drawn to the
market in large part by historically low mortgage rates. Many home
sales have turned into auctions, causing prices to rise statewide.
And occupancy rates for rentals have remained firm in the most
populous counties despite the clamor for homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Development patterns in the Southland varied from county to
county, though most markets were flat or gained little from the same
month last year, according to April figures compiled by the
Construction Industry Research Board, a Burbank research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Permits issued in Los Angeles County totaled 4,779 for the first
four months of the year. The current number, down more than a third
from a year ago, represents the lowest four-month total since 1999.
Development fees imposed in January 2001 helped inflate last year's
figures as builders rushed to get permits before the price increase.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County registered a gain of one-third to 3,461, contrasted
with a weak performance in 2001. Last year's four-month figure was
the smallest since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside and San Bernardino counties have recorded a 14% increase
since January from the same period last year, while San Diego County
has been flat. Ventura County, which produces the smallest base of
new housing in the region, has dropped more than half to 670 units
from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The number of permits issued can vary widely from month to month,
influenced by such factors as weather conditions or an impending
increase in construction fees. Still, market observers say,
production in Southern California remains far less than what's
required to shelter a burgeoning population.</TE>
<TE>   In a period of less than two years ending in January, Southern
California's population expanded by 688,000 people--more than the
city of Baltimore, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing is not roaring ahead," Kyser said. "It is not anywhere
near the level we need."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, meanwhile, are trying to purchase homes while they can
afford them, said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University.
Job growth--considered a leading indicator of housing demand--has
been weak, but consumers are barreling ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying, 'Prices are going up, and I had better buy now
rather than wait until next year,'" Adibi said.</TE>
<TE>   That is a change from several months ago, when the market paused
for several weeks after Sept. 11 as consumers reassessed their
home-buying plans. Builders, meanwhile, became less aggressive in
acquiring new lots.</TE>
<TE>   But builders saw a burst of sales within a few weeks as mortgage
rates fell to a 30-year low. The changing attitude caused builders to
ramp up production.</TE>

<HD>Court Orders Overhaul of Line Sharing</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Local phone companies hail the decision, which
could lead to changes in rules that force them to give network access
to rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. appeals court Friday ordered regulators to overhaul rules that
force dominant local phone companies to give rivals access to parts
of their networks to spur competition.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia instructs the Federal Communications Commission to
reconsider which parts of a phone network must be available for lease
by new local service providers.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the court struck down a provision that required the
dominant phone companies to share copper lines with rivals that sell
high-speed Internet service using digital subscriber line technology,
or DSL.</LD>
<TE>   The decision is a victory for Verizon Communications Inc., SBC
Communications Inc. and other dominant local phone companies and a
blow to competitors such as Covad Communication Group, Z-Tel
Communications Inc. and AT&amp;T Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Those companies have relied on the leasing and line-sharing
requirements to help them get a foothold in markets controlled by the
so-called Baby Bell phone companies for more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   SBC, the nation's second-largest local phone company and the
largest in California, hailed Friday's decision as "a very positive
step forward in developing healthy, sustainable and economically
rational competition."</TE>
<TE>   Covad downplayed the immediate effect of the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks dramatic on the surface ... but it's actually somewhat
of a nonevent," said Jason Oxman, the company's assistant general
counsel. "What the court said today is simply that the FCC has to
once again take a look [at its bundling rules] ... and it's already
doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Oxman acknowledged that the FCC's current review ultimately could
result in key changes in the regulatory landscape, but until the FCC
decides on the revisions, "the status quo is the law of the land."</TE>
<TE>   The regulations at issue in the case are part of the FCC's effort
to bring competition to the local phone market, especially in
residential areas, where it is prohibitively expensive for competing
phone companies to replicate the copper wiring already connected to
most of the nation's more than 100 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Those and other FCC rules represent the underpinnings of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, a sweeping measure that was supposed to spur
rigorous competition in the local phone market, cable service and
other communications industries.</TE>
<TE>   The commission already is reviewing possible changes to many of
its telecommunications regulations, including those addressed by the
Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Local phone companies challenged the network-sharing rules in
court, arguing that the FCC's requirements go too far and don't take
into account growing competition from cable companies, which have
begun selling phone service and high-speed Internet access over their
networks.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals argue that the sharing and leasing rules are necessary to
offset the market advantages enjoyed by local phone companies, whose
networks were built over decades and with considerable help from
ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   In the DSL market, the FCC's line-sharing requirement has allowed
Covad and others to share a phone line, allowing Covad DSL customers
to have two carriers on the same line--one for data and another for
voice.</TE>
<TE>   Customers of SBC Pacific Bell and other local phone companies
routinely have been sold DSL service that shares their existing voice
lines. But until the line-sharing rules took effect, competing DSL
providers had to lease separate phone lines to carry their data--an
expense that didn't apply to the phone companies' DSL providers.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of the few states, if not the only one, where
DSL sales have outstripped cable Internet service sales. About 57% of
Californians who subscribe to high-speed Internet service use DSL,
compared with about 43% using cable modems, said Loretta Lynch,
president of the California Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's decision is the latest in a string of major court rulings
this month that speak to critical elements of the Telecom Act.</TE>
<TE>   The phone companies affected by the Telecom Act have spent
millions of dollars during much of the last six years to challenge
the act's provisions in court and before federal and state regulatory
commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's decision is, like a number of court decisions, simply a
battle in a much longer war," said Blair Levin, a Legg Mason analyst
and former FCC official.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Eckerd to Pay $9 Million in Drug Settlement</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eckerd Corp., a drugstore chain owned by J.C. Penney Co., said it
will pay $9 million to the federal government and 18 states to settle
a 1995 civil case over under-filled prescriptions.</LD>
<LD>   Partially filled prescriptions became an issue for regulators
after it became known that pharmacies sometimes were billing insurers
for full prescriptions, but delivering only part of an order when
inventories were limited.</LD>
<LD>   Some customers never returned to pick up the rest of their
medication, although that form of overcharging represented a small
fraction of all prescriptions filled, Eckerd said.</LD>
<TE>   Eckerd said it was working to install new electronic processing
systems to address the problem. In the meantime, the drugstore chain
is giving customers three-day "starter-kits" for medication and then
billing once the full prescription is available, the company said.</TE>

<LD>Prandium Inc. said Friday that its directors have rejected an
unsolicited bid from privately held Austin Grills Inc. to purchase
the assets of the bankrupt Irvine operator of Chi-Chi's, Koo Koo Roo
and Hamburger Hamlet restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   Prandium said the directors, together with legal and financial
advisors, decided the offer was "inferior" to the reorganization plan
the company has proposed in its Chapter 11 case in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Santa Ana. The company said the majority of its debt holders
also oppose the bid.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked away in a $30-billion anti-terrorism bill is a provision that
US Airways says could doom its only chance to avoid bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, which was passed by the House, would delay until
October any payments under a loan assistance program Congress passed
last year as part of an airline industry bailout.</LD>
<LD>   Airline spokesman David Castelveter said US Airways based its
restructuring plan on last year's legislation, which gave airlines
until June 28 to apply for the loan guarantees and made no
restrictions on when the money would be available.</LD>

prison off the air after protests from a convict rights group over
its alleged jail rape allusions.</LD>
<LD>   The company pulled the 30-second commercial after Stop Prison Rape
said the ad trivialized the "serious physical and psychological
injury" inmates suffer from sexual abuse. It was the first time 7 Up
canceled an ad for objectionable content, a spokeswoman for Dr
Pepper/Seven Up, a unit of British-based Cadbury Schweppes.</LD>
<LD>   The spot titled "Captive Audience," created by ad agency Young &amp;

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., an advisor to Tyco International Ltd.,
withdrew its $5-billion bid for the company's CIT finance unit after
word of the transaction leaked to the media, people familiar with the
deal said.</LD>
<LD>   Lehman, one of 11 firms advising Tyco on an initial public
offering of the unit, had made a cash bid for the conglomerate's
finance arm and was waiting to hear from Tyco. Tyco is trying to sell
CIT to help repay as much as $14.15 billion of debt by the end of
2003, though the company has said there's enough cash to meet
payments through February without a sale.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco estimated last month it would reap $6.5 billion in proceeds
from an initial stock sale of CIT, less than the $9.5 billion it paid
in June.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco, which climbed as much as 6.3% after the bid was
reported, fell 67 cents to $23.70, and shares of Lehman dropped $1.15
to $64.57, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. has settled a lawsuit over a 1998 accident
that killed four people and seriously injured two others.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, reached late Thursday in Little Rock, Ark., came
one day after a U.S. District Court judge sanctioned the tire maker
for burning potentially damaging documents.</LD>
<LD>   A trial of the tire separation case had been set to start Tuesday
in Helena, Ark. The amount of the settlement, which also resolves the
sanctions, was not disclosed.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to the board of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., an influential
proxy advisory firm that had backed insurgent director nominees last
year once again recommended that its clients vote for a slate of
dissident candidates in a shareholder vote Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional Shareholder Services is backing three independent
candidates nominated by Franklin Mutual Advisors and Iridian Asset
Management.</LD>
<LD>   The two investors groups together hold more than 10% of the Costa
Mesa drug maker's stock and are trying to wrest control from Milan
Panic, the chairman and chief executive who founded the company 42
years ago. Three other outside directors elected last year in a
previous proxy battle have pledged to support the new slate on a
nine-member board.</LD>
<TE>   ICN contends that the threatened change of control and the almost
certain departure of Panic would be disruptive, setting back
expansion plans and weighing further on the stock price.</TE>
<TE>   ICN stock lost 38 cents to close at $27.31 a share on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. bankruptcy judge appointed attorney Neal Batson as the
independent examiner authorized to investigate Enron Corp.'s tangled
partnerships and off-balance-sheet deals, a powerful job that could
help determine how much creditors recoup, the U.S. Trustees Office
said.</LD>
<LD>   Batson was nominated Wednesday by after a review of more than 20
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Batson, with Atlanta law firm Alston &amp; Bird, has 30 years of
experience in bankruptcy law and has served as examiner in other
bankruptcy cases.</LD>
<TE>   In another ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez said the
law firm for Enron's creditors' committee will not be disqualified
because of legal work done for the energy company before its December
filing for Chapter 11 protection, the largest bankruptcy case in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez turned aside a request by Enron creditor Exco Resources
Inc. to bar New York-based Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy from
representing the committee.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Comcast Corp., the nation's third-largest cable company, is being
sued in U.S. District Court in Michigan over accusations it violated
a federal privacy law when it recorded the Web browsing activities of
each of its 1 million high-speed Internet subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed by attorney Steven Goren of Bingham Farms, Mich.,
seeks damages of at least $100 a day for every Comcast subscriber
during the period from December 2001 to Feb. 13, 2002, when Comcast
pledged to stop the practice. A Comcast spokesman did not return
phone calls seeking comment.</LD>
<LD>   Comcast previously has denied wrongdoing. It said no more
information was recorded about Comcast customers than is common in
the industry and no more than was needed to optimize its Internet
network.</LD>

<HD>FTC Asks Quest for Data in Unilab Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quest Diagnostics Inc. said its pending acquisition of Tarzana-based
Unilab Corp. will be delayed because the Federal Trade Commission has
asked for more information on the $900-million deal.</LD>
<LD>   Quest, the No. 1 U.S. health testing firm, unveiled the plan to
buy Unilab in early April as part of an effort to increase its reach
in California, the nation's biggest market for laboratory testing.</LD>
<LD>   Teterboro, N.J.-based Quest said the FTC made the request under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Such requests,
while not uncommon, usually signal that regulators reviewing a deal
have more questions about potential anti-competitive implications.</LD>
<TE>   Ahead of the news, issued after the close of trading, Unilab
closed down 7 cents at $27.16 on Nasdaq and Quest closed down a penny
at $84.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Promotional Spending Soars for Cigarettes</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: FTC says firms spent a record $9.57 billion in
2000, when they stemmed a drop in consumption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When cigarette makers agreed to limit advertising as part of their
settlement with the states, they were expected to slash promotional
expenditures for their brands. But tobacco companies are spending
more than ever to pitch their brands, including a record $9.57billion
in 2000, when they managed to stem a historic slide in cigarette
consumption, according to a Federal Trade Commission report Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Promotional spending by the six top manufacturers rose 16% from
the 1999 total of $8.24 billion. That too had represented a huge
increase over expenditures before 1998, when tobacco companies
settled lawsuits filed by state attorneys general.</LD>
<LD>   With cigarettes sales in 2000 of just over 20 billion cigarette
packs, promotional spending came to nearly 50 cents a pack.</LD>
<TE>   "The increase is just unbelievable," said Matthew L. Myers,
president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington-based
anti-smoking group. "What you're seeing here is a very concerted
effort to offset the impact of the marketing restrictions,
[cigarette] price increases and anti-smoking programs."</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette consumption has fallen in nearly each of the last 20
years, but the promotional blitz may have interrupted the decline at
least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   In its marketing report, the FTC said consumption rose by about
one-half of 1% to 413.5 billion cigarettes in 2000. But the agency,
which annually reports on cigarette sales and advertising, also cited
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates showing a 1.1% decline in
cigarettes smoked.</TE>
<TE>   Due to rising population, per capita sales fell about 9%, the FTC
said.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's rising promotional expenditures reflect a trend
away from traditional advertising to point-of-purchase displays in
stores and giveaways to smokers.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette ads have been banned from the airwaves for 30 years. In
their $246-billion settlement with the states, the tobacco companies
accepted a ban on billboard and transit advertising, and restrictions
on sports promotions and giveaways of branded merchandise such as
caps and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FTC report, the biggest spending category since
1994 has been retail promotional allowances--payments to merchants to
install displays and signs and provide shelf space. Cigarette makers
made $3.91 billion in such payments in 2000, an increase of 10.5%
over the 1999 total of $3.54 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In the single biggest increase, the companies spent $3.52 billion
on so-called value-added promotions, such as a "buy one, get one
free," or a free bonus item, such as a lighter, with each two packs
sold. This was a $956.6-million increase, or 37.4%, over 1999, when
value-added promotions cost $2.56 billion. Part of the increase
reflected the higher retail cost for each pack of cigarettes offered
for free.</TE>
<TE>   Magazine advertising fell about 22% to $294.9 million, while
newspaper ad expenditures rose to $51.7 million from $51 million,
according to the report, which did not break out costs for individual
companies. Philip Morris U.S.A., the leading U.S. cigarette maker,
said its expenditures increased mainly because of incentives paid to
retailers. The company said its merchandising agreements offer
special incentives to retailers that place cigarettes behind counters
and take other steps to limit access by underage smokers.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it has exceeded the requirements of the
state settlement in other ways, including ceasing advertising on the
back covers of magazines.</TE>

<LD>Gap Inc., the largest U.S. clothing retailer, on Friday saw its
credit rating outlook cut to negative by Moody's Investors Service.
The company's long-term debt rating was confirmed at Ba3.</LD>
<LD>   The outlook change reflects a concern that Gap will fail to meet
profit expectations for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   There also are uncertainties now that President and Chief
Executive Millard Drexler is retiring. His move comes after 24 months
of declining same-store sales. As part of a turnaround strategy,
stores are returning to traditional styles after experiments with
bright colors and tight fits.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be some time before it is evident whether these
merchandising changes are gaining traction with the customer,"
Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap has $3.4 billion of debt.</TE>

<HD>Grubb &amp; Ellis Calls Off Merger Talks; Stock Tumbles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commercial real estate brokerage Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. on Friday said it
had called off merger negotiations with an unidentified
company--widely believed to be Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis
Inc.--over concerns about employee layoffs and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement sent shares of Grubb &amp; Ellis tumbling on Wall
Street. On the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Grubb &amp; Ellis stock
fell 90cents--or about 23%--to $3 a share.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based real estate services firm said it began merger
discussions after the "unrelated third party" made an unsolicited
merger proposal this month. However, according to Chief Executive
Barry Barovick, Grubb &amp; Ellis terminated the talks after it became
clear that the companies differed on key issues and had "significant
overlaps of personnel and locations, which led us to believe that too
many of our personnel ... would not be retained."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for CB Richard Ellis said it had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Grubb &amp; Ellis said in a government filing that a change
in control could be expected in the wake of a deal with a group
headed by board member C. Michael Kojaian, a Detroit developer. In
return for an investment of $15.2 million, the Kojaian group ended up
with a 20% stake in the company.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Tumble; Downgrade in Tech Hits Nasdaq</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brokerage downgrade of the semiconductor equipment sector capped a
troubled week on Wall Street, sending stocks sharply lower Friday
ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It was the slowest trading day on the New York Stock Exchange this
year, reflecting the start of vacation for many traders as well as
continuing anxiety about possible terrorist attacks. The lack of
activity made prices more susceptible to big swings because low
volume can exaggerate gains and losses.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 111.82 points, or
1.1%, at 10,104.26, after two days of moderate late-session gains.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest losses came in the technology sector, sending the
tech-focused Nasdaq composite index down 36.14 points, or 2.1%, to
1,661.49. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 13.26 points, or 1.2%,
to 1,083.82. Losers led winners by about 7 to 4 on Nasdaq and 5 to 3
on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   It was a losing week for all three indexes, as selling erased much
of the market's gains of the previous week. The Dow dropped 2.4%,
Nasdaq lost 4.6% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have left early for the holiday, so it's
affecting volume," said Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth
Equities. "People are also nervous there might be some terrorist
attack over the holiday weekend, and that's affecting trading."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day.</TE>
<TE>   Chip equipment maker Applied Materials fell $1.77, or about 7%, to
$23.80 after Goldman Sachs cut its stock rating, saying it expected
order rates for new equipment to slow. Rival KLA-Tencor lost $2.66 to
$54.43, and the S&amp;P chip equipment index fell 3.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "On light trading volume like we're seeing today, a downgrade like
this can drive the direction for the market," said Brian Bruce,
director of global investments for PanAgora Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   The selling spread to shares of chip makers such as Intel, which
fell 73 cents to $28.66. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks
slumped 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech shares also slid. Sun Microsystems fell 55 cents to
$6.86 after reaffirming its quarterly financial targets but
indicating that order rates are slow. Microsoft lost $1.56 to $53.26.
Cisco Systems fell 33 cents to $16.57.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the Commerce Department said the economy, as measured
by gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% in the
first three months of 2002, slightly less than the 5.8% rate
estimated a month ago. The figure still represents the strongest
performance in nearly two years but provided little incentive on Wall
Street to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds were little changed. Gold prices fell $2.10 to $320.40 an
ounce in New York trading but remained near two-year highs as
investors sought a safe haven for their money. Oil fell for a fourth
day, slipping 27 cents to $25.88 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders benefited from a Commerce Department report
showing new-home sales rose 1% last month, helped by low mortgage
rates. Pulte Homes gained $2.13 to $55.48, and KB Home rose 77 cents
to $52.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Biogen soared $9.11, or 22.7%, to $49.47 on news that a Food and
Drug Administration advisory panel has recommended approval of the
biotechnology company's psoriasis drug Amevive.</TE>
<TE>   * The yen rose for a fifth week in six against the dollar as
investors poured money into Japanese stocks, prompting the government

<HD>ICN Dissidents Get Proxy Firm Backing</HD>
<DH>Investing: An advisory company supports three candidates
nominated by groups trying to wrest control from Chairman Milan
Panic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to the board of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., an influential
proxy advisory firm that had backed insurgent director nominees last
year once again recommended that its shareholder clients vote
Wednesday for a slate of dissident candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional Shareholder Services is backing three independent
candidates nominated by Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC and Iridian
Asset Management. The two investors groups together hold more than
10% of the Costa Mesa drug maker's stock and are trying to wrest
control from Milan Panic, the chairman and chief executive who
founded the company 42 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Three outside directors elected last year have pledged to support
the new slate on a nine-member board.</LD>
<TE>   Like the dissidents of last year, disgruntled shareholders charge
that the presence of Panic at the helm and what they perceive as
questionable management decisions have punished investors and kept
well-qualified executives from working at ICN. They also charge that
Panic has dragged his feet for several years in splitting the company
into three independent firms to enhance shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   The company last month spun off 20% of Ribapharm Inc., which makes
the anti-viral ribavirin used to help treat hepatitis C liver
disease.</TE>
<TE>   The investor services endorsement could tip the balance toward
dissident board members. The group alleges that the current board has
been overly loyal to Panic and that election of the dissidents "would
be a tremendous step toward clearing the haze of controversy that
appears to be clouding the market's view of ICN's true value."</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, this contest is really about maximization
of shareholder value," the group said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   ICN contends that the threatened change of control and the almost
certain departure of Panic would be disruptive, setting back
expansion plans and weighing further on the stock price. Panic has
said he plans to step down, but he gave no timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "The dissident shareholders, who have held their stock for less
than a year, are, in our view, not interested in what is in the best
interests of ICN shareholders over the long term," ICN spokesman Alan
Charles said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   ICN stock lost 38 cents Friday to close at $27.31 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost 18.5% this year.</TE>

<HD>SEC Is Looking Into Hedge Funds</HD>
<DH>Securities: Agency is checking for fraud. Review could lead
to tighter controls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing whether there is
fraud in the $500-billion hedge-fund industry following several
enforcement cases involving the funds, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are concerned about the implications flowing from the growth
in these private investment funds," Pitt said in a speech to the
Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The review, being overseen by the SEC's investment management
unit, may lead to tighter controls over the largely unregulated
funds, he said. Hedge funds don't have to report their finances to
the government, and SEC information about them "is sketchy," Pitt
said.</LD>
<TE>   As Americans accumulated wealth in the '90s boom, hedge funds
sought to broaden their appeal. The funds, which were designed for
wealthy investors and typically seek more speculative investments,
began trying to attract less wealthy, and perhaps less sophisticated,
investors. This worries regulators because lack of regulation leaves
the funds more exposed to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC action comes as the agency is coping with the accounting
deceptions of Enron Corp. and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and has
opened a broad investigation of possible fraud by Wall Street stock
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC inquiry, in addition to looking for signs of fraud, also
will look at any conflicts of interest involving fund companies that
operate hedge funds and mutual funds, Pitt said. Alliance Capital
Management and American Express Asset Management are among the fund
companies that operate both types of funds.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance and American Express didn't respond to requests for
comment.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nasdaq Stock Market, bowing to pressure from the SEC, proposed
Friday requiring companies to get shareholder approval before
awarding executive stock options.</LD>
<LD>   "Allowing investors to vote on these plans is not only good
corporate governance, but absolutely fair," said Nasdaq Chairman
Hardwick Simmons.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq's recommendations, which also include a requirement that
off-the-books partnerships be approved by company boards, now go to
the SEC.</LD>
<TE>   The federal agency will issue the proposals--and similar plans to
be voted on by the New York Stock Exchange on June 6--for public
comment before deciding whether to give final approval.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, companies can set up option plans for executives
without shareholder approval if awards also are made to a broad group
of employees. Option awards only to executives must be approved by
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq, which lists many of the technology companies that have
been most inclined to award options, has for years been the stumbling
block in SEC attempts to require shareholder approval of options
awards. Technology companies have argued that requirements for
shareholder approval would cramp their ability to attract and keep
personnel.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit Suisse First Boston on Friday pledged to separate stock
analyst pay from investment banking as part of new research reforms,
mimicking a recent settlement by banking rival Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   CSFB, which is a unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group Inc.,
follows the lead of Citigroup Inc. unit Salomon Smith Barney in
adopting the reforms Merrill agreed to in a settlement with New York
State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer announced Tuesday. Spitzer accused
Merrill of misleading investors by tailoring its research to win
lucrative investment banking deals such as stock underwriting.
Merrill also agreed to pay $100 million to settle the charges.</LD>

<HD>Throwing Good Money After Poor Education</HD>
<DH>We should get some answers before giving more to the L.A.
school district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER LEWIS</AU>
<BD>Roger Lewis retired from Lucent Technologies. He lives
in Encino.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Los Angeles Unified School District board publicly agonizing
over how to balance its budget, perhaps this is the time to ask what
some would consider a stupid question: Is more money really needed to
operate quality schools?</LD>
<LD>   What is the money to be spent for anyway? To give Supt. Roy Romer
a job? (I guess Enron's CEO wasn't the first to say he didn't know
what was going on.)</LD>
<LD>   To give principals jobs? So that they can stand out on the campus
with whistles and two-way radios, avoiding the pressing questions
that teaching and office staff may be asking?</LD>
<TE>   To give teachers jobs? Well, here we're getting close to what I
would think is the reason for the schools' existence: to provide an
environment where teachers and their students can interact in a way
that will promote wholesome growth and development of the students.</TE>
<TE>   But just as a company in the business world can lose its focus on
its customers or clients, will the LAUSD escape a similar fate
because the community continues to pour money into a sick enterprise?</TE>
<TE>   How many private schools spend less per student yet are
justifiably proud of what they are accomplishing?</TE>
<TE>   Will the LAUSD continue because the community doesn't have the
will to challenge the effectiveness of the ethno-politico apparatus
whose members seem more interested in building careers in politics?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's time to start with some zero-based budgeting for the
school system. If every line item in both the operating and capital
budgets was subjected to the scrutiny of the question, "How is this
going to assist the ongoing process of learning in the classrooms?"
one might indeed be amazed at the vastness of what could be
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   From Romer on down, it should be asked: What are you doing to
remove obstacles to learning in the classroom? Have you appointed
competent people to look at these situations, to provide specific and
concrete recommendations and to ensure that these are implemented?
Are people being held accountable?</TE>
<TE>   Of principals it could be asked: Did you know that you're not just
running a branch of the DMV?</TE>
<TE>   Being retired from the corporate world, I thought I might be able
to make a useful contribution to society by working part-time as a
substitute teacher.</TE>
<TE>   I went to one school recently where the faculty moved around in a
dream world reminiscent of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Does
the principal have any responsibility for faculty attitudes and
morale?</TE>
<TE>   At another school, the regular teacher had left a video to be
shown to all his classes that day. When I asked some of the students
why they weren't interested in watching the video, I was told that
they had already seen it three times. It was a lesson plan that the
teacher trotted out each time he was going to be gone.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the question we should all be asking ourselves is this: Do
we as a community have the will to make critical changes in the
LAUSD, or do we just need a Dr. Jack Kevorkian to put it out of its
misery?</TE>

<HD>You Can't Be on the Phone and in the Moment</HD>
<DH>Cell users who chatter away in public are like zombies
among the living.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER NYERGES</AU>
<BD>Christopher Nyerges and his wife, Doris Nyerges, are
the directors of the School of Self-reliance in Eagle Rock. Web site:
www.self-reliance. net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was in line at the supermarket behind a man who was talking on a
cell phone. He loudly chattered away, as if everyone wanted to hear
his personal business. He was slow in moving his items from cart to
checkout stand. After all, he was using only one hand.</LD>
<LD>   Those in line briefly commented on his absurdity. Was that
conversation so timely and important that he had to make it at that
particular moment? Was he such an important individual that his
communication to afar was worth being a zombie to the here-and-now
moment?</LD>
<LD>   Using a cell phone while driving is not merely an absurdity; it
has become a road hazard.</LD>
<TE>   You can tell when drivers start to talk on the phone. They slow
down, and there is a slight weave. After all, they are concentrating
on this other conversation, this person somewhere else. They cannot
possibly have their full attention on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Radio-listening is far more passive. Talking on a cell phone
requires a more active part of the mind.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, in the short walk from where my wife and I parked in
Pasadena, we passed three people, all of whom were wholly involved in
animated cell phone conversations. It was like walking by zombies. No
hellos, no eye contact, no courteous greetings.</TE>
<TE>   Few people would argue that the telephone was a bad invention.
Telephones bring people together. Their invention has enabled us to
provide rapid emergency services and to remain in regular contact
with family and friends. These are good things.</TE>
<TE>   Before phones became ubiquitous, it was not unusual for a phone
call to someone far away to be a big event. You would prepare for a
phone call with East Coast family members, and when you talked, you
courteously gave them your undivided attention, as if you were
speaking with them in person. You were communing.</TE>
<TE>   But we seem to have lost the point of communication. In our
attempt to make phone communication easier, we have lost the here and
now.</TE>
<TE>   Today it is not unusual to see two people dining together in a
restaurant and one of them having the audacity to carry on a
telephone conversation with someone far away. His body may be sitting
in the restaurant, but his mind and attention are focused elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Real communication is not about technology. Yet, in our quest to
always be able to communicate with anyone at any time, we have begun
to lose what it was we were trying to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   A wise man once commented that with every technological step
forward, modern man seems to take a moral and intellectual step
backward. There is no better illustration of this than the
now-ubiquitous cell phone.</TE>

<LD>I was impressed by your story of Kristen Schurr, reporting on the
group from the International Solidarity Movement that brought food
into the besieged Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem ("U.S. Backers
of Palestinian Cause Protest Their Treatment by Israel," May 19).
Schurr reported that, although an American citizen, she was assaulted
by Israeli troopers, jailed for a week without charges and forced to
fly home without most of her belongings.</LD>
<LD>   As a U.S. taxpayer supporting the Israeli army to the tune of $3
billion to $4 billion a year, I am directly complicit in that
violation of her human rights, especially in a nation that calls
itself "the only democracy" in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   I was unimpressed by the put-down description of her as a
"33-year-old doctoral student and self-described peace worker" and
"one of a small minority of non-Arab Americans who have embraced the
Palestinian cause." There are far more of us "self-described" peace
workers who have embraced the cause of justice for the Palestinians
than your tendentious and unfair reporting might ever be willing to
admit.</LD>

<TE>   I wonder whether we could get Schurr and her fellow "peace
activists" to go to Iraq, where they'd protest treatment of the
Kurds. Failing that, maybe they could complain about Sudan's genocide
against its own Christian and animist populations for the last 22
years. Not a chance!</TE>

<LD>Re "SUV Surge Driving Out Small Parking Slots," May 21:</LD>
<LD>   Rather than eliminate compact parking spaces, cities, malls and
shopping centers would better serve the driving public if they would
divide the parking lots into two sections: one for cars, regular or
compact--and one for SUVs, mini-vans and trucks; and really enforce
parking in the appropriate section. This would eliminate a lot of
accidents and potential accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever parked a regular-sized car next to other regular
cars but when you are ready to leave you are surrounded by those ugly
behemoths? Just try to see in order to back out safely. It's
impossible, and if the parking lot is busy you have to put yourself
and the cars driving by at risk of an accident because you have to
back out blindly.</LD>
<TE>   Several times, out of desperation, I've asked people walking by if
they would act as spotters and signal me when it was clear. Dividing
parking lots into two sections would make much more sense than
eliminating compact parking spaces.</TE>

<LD>Re "Trouble at Home," Opinion, May 19: Why it is that when a
perceived inequity exists between the motives of the haves and the
have-nots the answer is to punish the haves? David Friedman implies
that using equity gained through property ownership is wrong "when
the housing market is manipulated to support economic extravagance."
His answer: Create new regulatory guidelines that determine what are
the "right motives" to qualify for the tax advantages of borrowing
against real property. Can you say politically correct?</LD>
<LD>   I would suggest that the majority of people refinance for paying
off accumulated debt, sending a child to college, caring for a loved
one or even buying a Ford Escort. Only when we stop living beyond our
means at all economic levels will the need to enter into debt
decrease, thereby reducing or minimizing the effects of a down
economy. This is not a lesson for government to teach; it is for
individuals to recognize their materialism and be content with what
they have.</LD>

<HD>How to Accommodate a Super-Jumbo Jet?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Airports Bracing for Really Jumbo Jet," May 19: How about a "pay
to play" policy for the Airbus A380? Since European governments of
the consortium already subsidize the Airbus, it is not a great leap
to suggest they should also subsidize airport upgrades to accommodate
their own planes.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Galligan</LD>
<LD>   Ventura</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I suggest it will be simplicity itself to accommodate the
super-jumbo jet and its ominous big-budget problem. Some L.A. types
say the necessary upgrades will exceed $700 million. Airbus says they
will cost only $177 million. I say, add 20% to the Airbus figure and
tell the company that you will proceed with the remodeling at once if
Airbus picks up any of the tab that exceeds $213 million. Airbus will
have a showcase for the new plane and the L.A. folks will have a
reasonably priced deal for a change.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jennings</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your report on the issues LAX and other airports will face when
the Airbus A380 arrives provides an excellent perspective on the
impact the super-jumbos will have on LAX structures, runways,
taxiways and logistics.</TE>
<TE>   There is one more item I would like to mention that causes great
pain to travelers who now arrive at LAX on Boeing 747s from overseas:
understaffed INS booths and long lines. Deplaning with a sigh of
relief, these poor creatures believe they finally made it to their
destination following an exhausting, 15-hour-or-so flight, only to be
routed like cattle in long lines past unoccupied INS booths to the
few booths that are occupied by generally friendly but overworked INS
agents.</TE>
<TE>   To give foreign tourists the right impression of how much we
appreciate their visiting us and spending their foreign currency in
California, we line them up in a second line, separate from U.S.
citizens, and make them wait twice as long. More passengers arriving
at the same time on A380s will "enjoy" even longer lines unless the
basic problem of INS staffing can be resolved. We don't need to spend
billions to accomplish this. Perhaps the time to start is now.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Beier</TE>
<TE>   Hacienda Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article about the new Airbus super-jumbo jet mentioned that
LAX may have to spend more than $500 million in runway and facilities
expansion to handle that airplane. Just a thought here: Why not use
the Palmdale regional airport for the super-jumbos? I would imagine
that facilities upgrades there (including a Metrolink station) could
be done for substantially less than that figure. Since most arrivals
would be international, a U.S. Customs station could be included. An
express Metrolink train to Union Station would get travelers easily
into L.A. without anyone having to go into or out of LAX.</TE>

<LD>Re "When Punishment Becomes Child Abuse," Voices, May 18: The
"misconception" to which Daniel Brezenoff refers can be blamed on
King Solomon, who wrote in Proverbs 13:24, "He who spares the rod
hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently."
Brezenoff writes, "Appropriate physical discipline, while in no way
necessary, does not appear to traumatize children."</LD>
<LD>   While burning his son's hand was excessive, at least Wellington
Soto cared enough to deter his son from stealing. How many kids don't
even have a father around to correct them? Ours is now a culture of
"tolerating" undisciplined children. Parents fear that using strong
discipline, the kind that most of us got in my neighborhood when we
were kids, will now be interpreted as "abuse," leading to an
appointment with the district attorney.</LD>

<LD>I've always admired the simple architecture of the Music Center and
was looking forward to being there again to attend "The Full Monty"
at the Ahmanson. However, as our bus left the freeway and went up
Temple Street, I spotted what appeared to be a very unattractive
industrial building. I was soon set straight. It was the "Taj
Mahony"--the new cathedral. I couldn't believe that there could be
any uglier building around.</LD>
<LD>   However, going up Grand Avenue to 1st Street I saw what looked
like a gigantic pile of scrap steel undergoing some kind of
construction or destruction. That, I was told, was the new Walt
Disney Concert Hall. I guess the architects of Los Angeles are vying
to make it the City of Uglies.</LD>

<HD>Hotels, Stadium for Downtown L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your May 20 article concerning a hotel for the L.A. Convention Center
identifies a long-standing problem with that facility. I've been
covering trade shows there as a reporter for various magazines for
more than 10 years, and, yes, it needs a hotel close by. In fact, it
probably needs three hotels.</LD>
<LD>   For years the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau has let
various conventions send out maps of the convention center and
"nearby" hotels, some of which are as far away as Long Beach and
Pasadena. People who come for a convention and end up at one of those
"nearby" hotels sometimes pay $40 for a cab ride or have to rent a
car. If they rent a car, they often find that the parking is full by
the time they get to their event.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Convention Center is simply too small for a big show and
too big for a small show. Since the North Hall was torn down to make
way for Staples Center, this is even more true.</LD>
<TE>   In Anaheim and Long Beach, hotels that are genuinely close by
allow convention organizers and exhibiting firms extraordinary
flexibility because hotel ballrooms and function rooms are also
available to handle the overflow. Building a major hotel or two,
along with more parking and another exhibit hall or two, would allow
L.A. to compete for convention business at more than giveaway prices.
The fact that there are already a lot of hotel rooms in the city is
not relevant. People attending a convention want to walk to the
event, not take long cab or bus rides. And, if they're local, they
want to be able to find reasonable parking.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Grandstanding Mayor Slim Jim Needs New Game Plan for NFL
Stadium," May 19: Steve Lopez has it wrong. Downtown L.A., at the
center of expanding Metro Rail and freeway access, is the perfect
place for a stadium and has handled sold-out Staples events with
barely a blip. This space will not be in a vacuum if integrated with
adjacent retail and entertainment proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's suggestion to place the stadium at the far edge of the
city is an environmental disaster. He brought out the notion of
putting the stadium in the Dodgers' parking lot. Steve, you might
check with the neighborhood about that one. You might find that the
neighbors would be more willing to see baseball come down off the
mountain and into Philip Anschutz's stadium and Chavez Ravine
returned to much-needed housing stock.</TE>

<TE>   Frank del Olmo calls the representatives of the National Football
League "snake-oil salesmen" (Commentary, May 19). Then Del Olmo
states that "a group of successful business leaders is asking City
Hall for tax subsidies." No tax subsidies have been requested,
although a bond issue to be paid back by the business group has been
requested. Who is the snake-oil salesman? By the way, I am firmly
against tax subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, on the other hand, wants more public discussion of the
issues and more guarantees on the bond and interest payments. Lopez
lists other reasons why the stadium should not be downtown. I also
think there should not be a downtown stadium and would like to add a
reason not mentioned. Currently the traffic going downtown to events
at the Ahmanson, Taper, Chandler Pavilion, Staples Center, the
Convention Center and, soon, Disney Hall, as well as for other
reasons, is overwhelming. Major consideration in the public
discussion should be given to resolving increased traffic congestion.</TE>

<LD>"Class-Size Reduction Initiatives Faltering" (May 18) quoted many
so-called experts who, if they do not actually teach children, at
least can pretend to speak authoritatively, using questionable
statistics in an attempt to justify educational cutbacks. The Times
did not quote the teachers who have recently been "inheriting"
students who have benefited from reduced-size classrooms. I am a
fully credentialed teacher who has taught for many years. Experienced
teachers like myself have seen dramatic improvements in reading and
writing skills among the children who have recently come from
reduced-size classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the public has the common sense to understand the
real benefits of reduced-size classes. Parents realize that their
children deserve a quality education, despite the attempts by
so-called educational experts to justify financial cutbacks.</LD>

<TE>   I'm sorry to read that some districts are giving up on class-size
reduction so soon. Perhaps this is another example of putting too
much reliance on a single measurement, in this case standardized test
scores. The program had major weaknesses that have taken time to work
out, the primary one being a lack of trained teachers to fill the new
classrooms. The Cal State system was not given adequate support at
the time to expand its teacher-training program. Now that the supply
of credentialed teachers is catching up with the demand, shouldn't we
give class-size reduction a little more time to succeed?</TE>
<TE>   At my school, class-size reduction has helped our students better
make the difficult transition from middle school to high school.
Classes of up to 40 ninth-graders were overwhelming some of our
finest English teachers a few years ago and contributed to the high
level of teacher attrition that continues to be a serious problem in
education. I have difficulty imagining how our freshmen will continue
to make strong connections to each other and to this school without
class-size reduction.</TE>

<TE>   It is interesting that those who claim there is "no real evidence"
to support the "mythology" of the benefits of reduced class size are
researchers and administrators who are far removed from the
classroom. It is obvious to anyone who has observed a small class
that these students receive more teacher attention, have fewer
distractions, gain more access to materials and are more involved in
their own education than students in classes of 30 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Actual learning is not always measurable on the all-important
tests this administration advocates. At-risk students, whom
class-size reduction was designed to help, traditionally score poorly
on standardized tests. As a 24-year veteran teacher in public
schools, I have seen the difference smaller classes can make. The
numbers may not show it, but, undeniably, smaller classes give all
students a better opportunity to learn.</TE>

<TE>   About six years ago, the class-size reduction phenomenon came to
life in California and the practice spread quickly, fully funded and
applauded by lawmakers. I predicted that the first recession that
came along would demolish the reduction effort, because it was
actually a disguised plan to do something else: solve the
teacher-shortage problem. Today, with California in deficit and with
many calling for tax increases and spending cuts, the hero will be
the lawmaker who calls for an end to class-size reduction, saying
that it has been duly tried and has failed. Thus, a few thousand
teaching positions in the state will not have to be filled, saving
millions of dollars. In the end, the maneuver will work because
politicians are hardhearted and bold enough to pull that kind of
prank on the children of what was once a great state.</TE>

<TE>   Louis Harris' "State's Separate Systems for Rich and Poor"
(Opinion, May 19) is an accurate description of California schools.
He does, however, leave the most important question out. Why is there
such a discrepancy in school climate when funding for schools at risk
(at least in California) is as good as, and often better than,
schools that serve the "privileged"?</TE>
<TE>   If Harris had asked me that question, he would have heard the
following: Students whose behavior is the primary cause of the most
important poor working condition--the disruption of teaching in the
classroom--are punished, counseled, medicated, removed and/or
provided with therapy in privileged schools. Most of those same
students in the "least privileged" schools are simply housed until
they commit an act of violence, show disrespect to an administrator
or grow too old. The result is often good teaching conditions in
privileged schools and poor teaching conditions in the least
privileged schools. Students who are willing to give learning their
best effort are trapped in classes overrun by a few coddled
delinquents who care nothing for learning. Many talented and
experienced teachers become burnouts.</TE>
<TE>   Indirectly, Harris has pointed out a critical problem that is not
addressed in the current round of reforms. Until it is, the success
of anything we do to improve public education is limited.</TE>

<HD>Higher Cigarette Taxes Deter Teen Smokers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that
current smoking among U.S. high school students has dropped to the
lowest levels in a decade ( May 17). That's encouraging news for our
nation's health, though at 28.5% the high school smoking rate is
still too high. Here in California we are already ahead of the
nation, with a smoking rate among 12- to 17-year-olds put at 7.1% in
2000, but much more needs to be done. One promising action is a
50-cents-per-pack tax increase proposed by Gov. Gray Davis that would
put total state taxes on cigarettes at $1.37.</LD>
<LD>   Teenage smokers are especially sensitive to price increases,
studies have shown. The last time California increased cigarette
taxes--50 cents in 1999--smoking among the 12- to 17-year-old
population fell 35.5%. Combined with effective anti-tobacco media
campaigns and programs in schools and communities, Gov. Davis'
proposed 57.5% tax hike should discourage many more young people from
lighting up.</LD>
<LD>   The fact is that individual smokers, young and old, are not paying
their own way--society is. According to a CDC study in April, every
pack of cigarettes sold in the U.S. costs us more than $7 in medical
care and lost productivity, or more than $157billion annually. That
is $157billion more than any of us should be willing to pay.</LD>

<LD>"Versed in Traffic Control" (May 18), on haiku and horn-sounding in
Brooklyn, reminded me of many annoying honkings I've experienced.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1950s I lived in New York City, and one of my vivid
memories is of honking. At a traffic signal, as soon as the light
turned green, cars behind the first one started to honk. I was amazed
when I returned to California and found that a driver was given
several seconds before a polite beep was heard.</LD>
<LD>   In travels to India I was always annoyed by horn-honking.
Approaching every intersection, the drivers often honk. I guess that
gives them the right of way. Once, in Kashmir, I finally told a taxi
driver on the way to an airport to please stop honking. He did,
probably fearing his tip was a goner.</LD>
<TE>   In a cab in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, on a ride of several miles,
the driver--a jolly, wrinkled old Bedouin--kept his hand on the horn
almost all the way. Since he didn't speak English and I didn't speak
Arabic, there was nothing to do but enjoy the ride. Once, in Cairo, a
witty cabdriver who had been regaling me with the difficulties of
living in Egypt honked his horn wildly every time he saw an
attractive woman.</TE>
<TE>   It's wonderful that haiku can do more than hurled eggs.</TE>

<LD>Re "Entering the Court of Last Retort," May 18: I cannot remember the
last time I agreed with L.A. Mayor James Hahn in relation to anything
he said or did. Today, however, when I read his quote about people in
Sacramento and their being jealous of Los Angeles, I had to smile
(and agree). Once, many years ago, after reading a scathing, very
rude article about Los Angeles in a San Francisco newspaper, I asked
my mom why they would write such a thing and, beyond that, why our
neighbors to the north would seem to applaud and appreciate such a
diatribe.</LD>
<LD>   My mom's reply of "that old green monster, jealousy, and low
self-esteem" would (as Hahn suggests) fit Sacramento dwellers today
just as it fit the San Franciscans of a few years ago (and perhaps
now). Unfortunately for the Kings fans, they know that no matter
which team wins the best-of-seven series, we will still be Los
Angeles, Queen of the Angels, and the Lakers will be our team, while
Sacramento will still be, well, Sacramento.</LD>

<LD>In "The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class" (Commentary, May 19), John
Balzar deplores the shrinkage of our middle class. His statement was
one of the most powerful commentaries that I have read in The Times.
I wish such a man would lead Americans in a fight to avert a
government by money.</LD>
<LD>   The citizen has the strength to redress grievances with the
initiative and recall process, peaceful assembly and the vote. Let us
all stop saying "ain't it awful" and take action. America can unite
to fight war; why not unite to free ourselves from the tyranny of big
money?</LD>
<LD>   Let us start with an initiative to limit all campaigns to a resume
published in the newspapers. Resumes work for business. We could then
choose our representatives on the basis of what they have done
instead of what they are going to do.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Liberals such as Balzar who bemoan the increasing gap between rich
and poor should reflect upon how some of their favorite government
policies have contributed to the problem. High taxes, fanatical labor
and environmental regulations and hair-trigger liability laws hit
hardest not at high-tech companies or fast-food restaurants but at
the heavy manufacturing industries that have traditionally been a
source of decent-paying, blue-collar, middle-class jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is the world's biggest automobile market, but
the auto factories that used to dot the industrial suburbs of Los
Angeles are gone, and workers who could have been building cars for
$20 an hour are instead probably washing cars for minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, conservatives share some of the blame, particularly in
Orange County, where class-conscious zoning laws prevent the
construction of homes that a factory worker could afford. But
liberals, who profess to champion the common man, must reexamine
their anti-industrialist ideology.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The solution to the demise of the middle class is to revive what
originally created it: the labor movement. The largest, longest and
most evenly distributed economic period in our history coincided
almost perfectly with the period in which the unionized percentage of
the labor force was highest. This is doable. It would require
political will and repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, the odious labor
law that has hamstrung unions for over 50 years.</TE>

<HD>Sickout Staged by Capistrano Unified Teachers</HD>
<DH>Education: Although contract mediation was in its second
day, dozens of instructors at three Capistrano Unified high schools
called in ill. Negotiations stalled after a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of teachers called in sick Friday to three high schools in
Capistrano Unified School District, apparently over ongoing salary
and benefit disputes.</LD>
<LD>   Aliso Niguel High School--where 40 teachers were absent--took the
biggest hit. About 200 students staged an attempted walkout during
the morning break, only to be escorted back to campus by Orange
County sheriff's deputies. Several students reported chaotic early
morning conditions, with unstaffed classrooms, unruly pupils and some
vandalism.</LD>
<LD>   "There were kids tearing things off the wall, throwing tables,"
said Kristin Bower, 15.</LD>
<TE>   "Kids were knocking down the ceiling panels."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Charles Salter said classes returned to normal 15
minutes into first period and that substitutes, administrators, and
staff from other schools pitched in.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time of the 10:15 a.m. break, students had organized an
impromptu walkout. Senior Alexis Trimble, 17, said Salter pleaded
with students to stay, first over the school's loudspeaker, then in
front of the crowd with a megaphone.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'It's not "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." We need to get
back to the classroom,'" Trimble said.</TE>
<TE>   By noon, many students had called their parents and dozens went
home early. District officials did not have attendance numbers for
the day, but said they did not believe attendance was dramatically
different from normal.</TE>
<TE>   Several parents who pulled their teens out of school voiced
support for the teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on their side," said parent Cindy Mouzakis. "I think they
needed to do something to get [the district's] attention."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Myrna Esmaeili agreed. "I support some kind of
demonstration and I support the students. They're standing behind
their teachers. But I'm hoping it will resolve soon."</TE>
<TE>   Mediation between the district and teachers entered the second day
on Friday after nearly one year of negotiations. Teachers were angry
after initially being offered a small pay raise and an increase in
some health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   District's Latest Offer Is a 2% Pay Raise</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's mediation session, the district's offer stood at a
2% raise, The Times learned and district spokesman David Smollar
confirmed. The district previously had offered enhanced health
benefits as well, Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the contract problems, union representatives said the
sickout was not a sanctioned action. But if more teachers were absent
than on a typical day, Capistrano Unified Education Assn. President
Frank Weirath conceded, "There might be people out who are unhappy.
We've been doing picketing and leafleting at schools."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, 178 teachers called in sick throughout the district.
That number rose to 323 Friday, compared to 233 for the same day last
year, Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   Mediation is scheduled to continue June 11.</TE>
<TE>   Smollar called the sickout part of the "fun and games" that come
with protracted labor negotiations, and said district officials are
disappointed that it came during mediation and affected students.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 teachers also called in sick at San Clemente High School
and about 35 did not show up to teach at Capistrano Valley High
School, Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   No major problems were reported at either of those campuses.</TE>

<LD>A rape suspect surrounded by sheriff's deputies killed himself
Thursday night by driving full speed into the side of a building.</LD>
<LD>   "He was saying things like, 'You guys are going to have to shoot
me, I'm not giving up,'" said Sheriff's Sgt. Ruben Gracia. "Then he
just gassed it and drove himself into the side of a building."</LD>
<LD>   The dead man was identified as Isaac Magana, 42, of Pico Rivera.
He also was wanted on suspicion of kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Officers said Magana led them on a 20-minute chase on the San
Gabriel River Freeway, then he stopped near Whittier Boulevard and

<DH>Charity: Mexican girl receives reconstructive surgery
thanks to Southland donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miriam Murillo, 17, of Baja California had decorated her earlobes
with gold hoops and painted her lips a shimmery pink. But on her
face, Miriam still carried the painful, disfiguring remnants of a
rare childhood infection.</LD>
<LD>   The top of her mouth disappears into her lower jaw and one side of
her nose sinks into her face.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Miriam and her father, Manuel, prepared for the
reconstructive surgery they have been trying to find for years.</LD>
<TE>   "I never really thought this day would ever come," Miriam said in
Spanish. "I had lost all hope."</TE>
<TE>   Her father, who makes a modest living as a chauffeur for the city
of Loreto, said he had taken his oldest daughter to doctors
throughout Mexico to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "They would take our money and tell us they could help, and
nothing would happen," he said. "We just kept spending all this money
we didn't have."</TE>
<TE>   Miriam's luck changed when she was enrolled in a student-exchange
program about two years ago. Through the sister city program,
students from Hermosa Beach and Loreto, Mexico, visit each other's
country for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Hermosa Beach Sister City Assn. saw the girl
and began making calls. Soon enough, they had found several doctors
from Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles who said they could help and
were willing to donate their services. The association would have to
absorb the hospital costs.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and local organizations sold ads on Pacific Coast
Highway and left collection boxes at local businesses, raising about
$15,000. They are hoping to raise an additional $12,000.</TE>
<TE>   Miriam was born a beautiful, healthy girl with fair skin and
pretty green eyes, her father said.</TE>
<TE>   At about 6 months, she began vomiting and got a severe case of
diarrhea. Doctors put a tube into her nose to feed her. The tube
caused an infection which spread to the bones of her nose.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at Childrens Hospital speculate that Miriam was afflicted
with a rare bacterial infection that destroys tissue. It created a
gap in her upper gums, destroyed her upper lip and stopped her upper
jaw from growing outward, as well as destroying the left side of her
nose, said Dr. John Gross, one of Miriam's physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only seen this type of infection four or five times," said
Gross, who has been doing reconstructive surgery for more than a
decade. "The cases usually happen in impoverished areas. It'd be very
rare to ever see this in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a group of surgeons and orthodontists began the long
process of facial reconstruction by removing bone from her hip and
grafting it into the separation in her front palate.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are preparing Miriam for her next major surgery in July,
in which they will make an incision under her upper lip to separate
the roof of her mouth and her teeth from the rest of her face in
order to move her jaw forward.</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks, a halo-type device will be affixed to her
skull, hooking into her upper jaw and teeth to gradually move her jaw
forward.</TE>
<TE>   The device is equipped with a small screw that she will have to
turn about a millimeter a day, Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   When that is done, doctors will begin nasal reconstructive
surgery. "I wish it were happening sooner," Miriam said. "I've been
waiting so long for this."</TE>
<TE>   Her father is eternally grateful to the generous American
strangers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For a parent, it's the most awful feeling not to be able to help
your child," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In tears, Manuel clutched his daughter to his side. She hugged him
tightly and tilted her head on his chest but did not cry.</TE>

<KH>VALLEY SECESSION</KH>
<HD>A Valley City? Like, You Mean There Isn't One?</HD>
<DH>Confusion reigns about proposal to split the region from
Los Angeles. Separatists aim to clarify the issues before Nov. 5
vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of course Shannen Martin wants the San Fernando Valley to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   "Why wouldn't I want where I live to be a successful city?" said
the 34-year-old, her brows knitted in perplexity. "I only want the
best."</LD>
<LD>   Martin had misunderstood the question. Did she want the Valley to
secede? As in split from Los Angeles? The biggest municipal divorce
in U.S. history?</LD>
<TE>   "Oh," said Martin, a Chicago transplant, laughing and dismissing
the mix-up with a wave of her diamond-studded hand. "I don't know. I
don't really know much about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of the Valley VOTE office in a Sherman Oaks strip
mall--the secessionist headquarters--confusion about the breakaway
proposal reigned. News spread that secession had been placed on the
Nov. 5 ballot, but the folks sipping coffee, eating bagels and people
watching in the plaza below Valley VOTE's second-story roost were
fuzzy on the details.</TE>
<TE>   They wondered if they already had their own mayor (someone other
than James K. Hahn), where their boundaries were (Thousand Oaks?),
and what exactly this LAFCO was.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it a comedy store in Hollywood?" asked Shahrad Farhoudi, an
unemployed 21-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's the Local Agency Formation Commission, which placed
the secession measure on the ballot Wednesday. The panel is
considering similar proposals for Hollywood and the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   The blank stares and shoulder shrugs that greet queries about
secession come as no surprise to city officials and breakup
advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a lot of confusion? Absolutely," said Kam Kuwata,
political strategist for the mayor's anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next 51/2 months, there will be a lot of discussions
about secession," said Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE. "There
will be less confusion."</TE>
<TE>   The folks milling around Valley VOTE's cluttered digs wanted
answers on the basics--how a separation may affect city services,
crime, the local economy and taxes. However, they also sought clarity
on other tough issues surrounding the split.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would anyone want to call this place Camelot?" asked
Farhoudi. Camelot is one of five choices on the ballot for a Valley
city name.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll move to Los Angeles," said Farhoudi, reading a newspaper in
the plaza. Traffic inched by on Ventura Boulevard, as horns blared
and jaywalkers strolled across the lanes. "There's no way I can live
in a place called Camelot."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, pushed to get the Camelot
selection on the ballot. Brain is a customer of Linda Devars, who
owns a flower kiosk.</TE>
<TE>   "I see him every day," said Devars, a longtime Sherman Oaks
resident.</TE>
<TE>   She primped her sunflowers, white irises and summer lilac. She
twisted a strand of her dark hair around her finger and tilted her
head.</TE>
<TE>   "What is it he does?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Devars said she knows little about secession and isn't looking
forward to a five-month campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Just let things be the way they are," Devars said. "Things would
be easier."</TE>
<TE>   Apathy toward complicated issues is common, said John Shallman, a
political strategist who advises Los Angeles Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel. Earlier this month, Greuel proposed a New York-style borough
system as a secession alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "The public doesn't know who to trust on the complex political
issues," Shallman said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession doesn't grab Aron Cowen, who lives in Sherman Oaks. "So
much of the Valley has a dirty vibe," the 27-year-old native said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather have nothing to do with Canoga Park or Chatsworth.
There's too much porn and smog. ... It also has too many people with
no teeth," said Cowen, a musician who was spending the morning in the
plaza, slouched in baggy shorts and scribbling his musings on a pad
of paper.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the Valley create their own cities all the time," he
said, citing Valley Village as an example. "So why should I care if
the Valley doesn't want to be a part of Hollywood?"</TE>
<TE>   Cowen was taken aback when told that the Valley, including the
neighborhood of Valley Village, is part of Los Angeles. As is
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Davis, 52, is a Valley Village resident who enjoys chatting
with other java junkies at the Starbucks next to Valley VOTE. The
gray-bearded man reads several newspapers a day. He said he knows who
Brain is.</TE>
<TE>   "He's that guy with the big hair," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has also heard of LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   "He's some important guy," he said. "I've definitively heard of
him. What does he do?"</TE>

<HD>Oxnard, Ventura Police Call In Reinforcements Against Gangs</HD>
<DH>Crime: Amid an outbreak of bloody violence, law enforcement
agencies will be on the streets in full force for the Memorial Day
holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to a flurry of deadly gang-related violence, police
departments in Oxnard and Ventura have nearly doubled their gang
enforcement teams for the busy Memorial Day weekend. Extra officers
will patrol some of the cities' roughest neighborhoods at least
through Monday with the help of gang enforcement teams from the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to be aggressive and get a handle on this," said
Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez. "We are jumping on this a bit quicker
than in the past. We have learned some lessons."</LD>
<LD>   Officers from his department's violent crimes task force and
special enforcement units hit the streets almost immediately after
the fatal stabbing Monday night of a 15-year-old Oxnard boy and a
triple shooting Tuesday that wounded three teenagers, Lopez said.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, police arrested a man and a 16-year-old boy at St.
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard on suspicion of stabbing an
18-year-old man outside a music store during a gang confrontation
hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "By putting pressure on gang members, we are looking for
violations and will have no tolerance," said Cmdr. Mike Matlock, who
heads Oxnard's gang enforcement unit.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put more enforcement out, you put the pressure on, and
[gang members] know there is a higher likelihood they will get
caught," Matlock said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, where the Police Department's main focus has been
finding the man who shot and killed a 20-year-old college student
Wednesday night, more gang detectives will remain on the street
through the holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Although the gunman who shot Jose Pimentel yelled out the name of
a well-known Oxnard gang after the shooting, police have not found a
link among the attacks, said officials with both police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura police spokesman Sgt. Brock Avery said detectives from
gang, property crimes and school resources units compared information
on the shooting and will remain on the street hunting down leads and
attempting to prevent another attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They are taking their work out from behind the desk and into the
field," Avery said. "Issues related to gang areas have been
highlighted and the expectation will be to make increased contact in
known gang areas."</TE>
<TE>   As close-knit families in Oxnard and Ventura made funeral plans
after this week's violence, investigators continued to piece together
what led to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Marquez, 15, died Tuesday after being stabbed following a
car chase through city streets that ended only blocks from the Oxnard
home he shared with his parents and 14-year-old brother.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's parents said they did not know whether he was involved
with one of the city's 12 street gangs, and police have few leads
about suspects in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Marquez was pronounced dead at St. John's, three
teenagers were shot when a gunman stepped from a car and opened fire
as they stood in the courtyard of a Pleasant Valley Road apartment
complex.</TE>
<TE>   The three were treated at area hospitals for gunshot wounds to
their legs. No suspects have been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Less than six hours later, Pimentel, whom relatives described as a
hard-working college student who had hoped to become a police
officer, was shot in the head as he stood with friends in front of
his uncle's Olive Street home in west Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Avery and members of the popular young man's family said there was
no indication that Pimentel was a gang member. The brazen nature of
the shooting and the killing of what would appear to be an innocent
victim have stunned officers, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   "The patrol staff in the area feels victimized by this," Avery
said. "Everyone is talking about this and about trying to make sure
it doesn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   But the violence returned Thursday in Oxnard, where members of two
gangs began fighting about 5:15 p.m. in the parking lot near the
Wherehouse music store at Gonzales Road and Oxnard Boulevard, said
Det. Brett Smith of the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Three young men were stabbed, but only one remained at the scene
by the time police arrived. The 18-year-old victim, whose name was
not released, was taken by ambulance to St. John's with at least
seven wounds to his back and stomach, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   While in the emergency room he identified a man and a teenager,
who also were being treated for stab wounds, as his assailants.
Police arrested 19-year-old Victor Dearcos of Oxnard and the teenage
boy for investigation of attempted murder, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden spike in gang-related attacks in Oxnard is similar to a
weeklong period in the fall of 2000, when five shootings in less than
a week prompted a citywide police crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez came under fire at that time by members of the City Council
who demanded that he outline his plan for ending the violence.
Although he was one of Lopez's key critics then, Mayor Manuel Lopez,
who is not related to Art Lopez, praised the chief's recent actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very pleased with the response and I'm sure it will be
effective," the mayor said. "I know that [Chief Lopez] is on top of
the situation.... People learn from their experience that you have to
respond quickly."</TE>

<HD>Explosion Blamed on Gas Leak</HD>
<DH>Blast: Encino apartment house suffers heavy damage and five
people are injured. Mayor Hahn and an FBI representative allay fears
of a terrorist act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An explosion and fire apparently caused by leaking natural gas Friday
collapsed part of a three-story Encino apartment, leaving one person
critically injured and scraping nerves worn raw by this week's
warnings of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to one man badly burned, at least four people were
treated for less serious complaints caused by the blast at the
140-unit Park Encino, sandwiched between Ventura Boulevard and the
Ventura Freeway. More than 300 people were forced from their homes.</LD>
<LD>   "Now they're bombing Encino," former soldier Everett Betts
recalled thinking as the blast shook his apartment in an adjacent
building.</LD>
<TE>   Although the cause remained under investigation, Mayor James K.
Hahn said early indications pointed to a gas leak, not a deliberate
criminal act. Hahn, who rushed to the scene, added that it was
remarkable so few people were hurt, given the destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion occurred just after 11 a.m. at 5325 Newcastle Ave.,
shattering windows in surrounding buildings and showering debris over
neighboring properties. Most of the damage was confined to one
10-unit wing, portions of which collapsed and burned.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents first thought the sharp jolt was an earthquake.
But, in a sign of the times, many others feared the building had come
under terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was panicking and yelling, 'Evacuate! Evacuate! It's a
bomb!'" said Jehan Gasser, who had lived in the building for 21/2
years.</TE>
<TE>   Clyde Agnew, 45, who works in shipping and receiving at Mission
College, was in his mother's third-floor apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, KABLOOM!" he recalled. "Glass is flying at me
everywhere. It blew my Mom's wall out.... It just shook the whole
building, the whole neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Agnew, who was not hurt, said he first thought a bomb had gone
off.</TE>
<TE>   There was talk of terrorism all through the neighborhood, which is
heavily Jewish and includes many Israeli immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the explosion, one man, cell phone to his ear, was
matter-of-factly telling someone that terrorists had blown up his
building.</TE>
<TE>   Both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department sent
investigators and bomb technicians to the blast site. FBI spokeswoman
Cheryl Mimura later said there is no reason to believe terrorism
played any part in the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department dispatched 40 fire engines and
trucks, 200 firefighters, 12 ambulances and a helicopter and
extinguished the fire in three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of the work the firefighters did today," said
Hahn. He called the LAFD "the best fire department in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said five people required medical treatment, three of
them at hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cohen, 47, was in critical but stable condition at the
Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks with burns over 55% of his body.
Mary Jacobson, 76, was undergoing treatment at Encino-Tarzana
Regional Medical Center. Her husband, Larry Jacobson, said his wife
had trouble breathing after the explosion, but was doing well.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson said he and his wife live in a second-floor apartment in
the damaged building. He heaped praise on emergency workers. "These
guys really came on like gangbusters," he said. "The firemen and
paramedics--and the police came soon after. They all did a great
job."</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter was treated at a hospital for chest pains, "as a
result of strenuous firefighting," said Assistant Fire Chief Bill
Bisson.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, two people were treated at the scene for minor
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grossman Burn Center, Dr. Peter Grossman said Cohen will
have skin-grafting surgery on Monday and treatment is expected to
last six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was initially treated at Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical
Center, where Dr. Vincent Green quoted him as saying he lived in the
building and "has absolutely no clue what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Tax records indicate the building is owned by Avi and Janis Anne
Rojany. Property records list their address as a West Los Angeles
apartment. Neither could be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Building and Safety records show several complaints
at the Encino building during the last decade. The most recent was in
January 1997 when a tenant reported that part of the ceiling had
collapsed, according to department records. That file is still open.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1994, inspectors determined that Rojany had left the
central gas heating system in disrepair and installed improperly,
according to city records. By the end of that year, records show 90%
of the required repair work had been done.</TE>
<TE>   City building and safety spokesman Bob Steinbach would not comment
on the records.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents said Friday they had been smelling gas.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard at least a dozen people complain on Monday and now it's
Friday and this happened," said Adam Frankel, a resident on the first
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday afternoon, LAFD Battalion Chief Bob Franco picked his
way through the wreckage of the building: a courtyard littered with
roof pieces and shards of glass, the kidney-shaped pool black with
soot. Only one wall still stood where the blast and fire originated.
Debris and rubble was still smoldering.</TE>
<TE>   Franco said that the explosion had caused floors and roofs to
collapse in a "pancake effect."</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a dynamite blast or something," he said, surveying the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 p.m., residents were escorted into the building by
firefighters to gather belongings. People emerged with big rolling
suitcases, a guitar, vanity kits. Some retrieved televisions. One
person emerged with a 2-liter bottle of Dr Pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Fard, 57, retrieved his most valuable possessions--three
Persian parakeets--and headed for the Red Cross shelter.</TE>
<TE>   For Fard, Friday would be his second experience at a Red Cross
shelter. The first was when he lost his home in the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. His next residence, he joked, might be outside of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Franco said that 300 to 400 people would be displaced, at least
temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   Mick Fenton, a spokesman for the American Red Cross, said that
residents of nearby buildings were allowed back in Friday evening.
Those who lived in the damaged apartment complex were offered cots at
an evacuation center at nearby Portola Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, administrators at Portola had used the
school's computer to find the names of students living within the
5300 and 5400 blocks of Newcastle Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I went on the [public address system] and explained what
happened, told them to remain in class and to be calm," said
Principal Stephen Lawler.</TE>
<TE>   Lawler then asked students who lived in apartment buildings near
the burning building to come into his office and to call their
parents or other family members.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the students either talked to their parents or a relative
who assured them they were OK," Lawler said.</TE>

<HD>Fence Helps Mend the Emotions</HD>
<DH>Patriotism: On a street corner in La Habra, a mother of
four fashions a memorial to the tragic events of Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tracey Chandler watches the flags get folded up neatly and put away.
She notices how the candles no longer burn and how the prayers all
seem to have been said.</LD>
<LD>   And she doesn't understand.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly nine months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks brought a
wave of patriotism over the nation, much of the fervor has retreated,
pushed back by time and healing and the need to move forward with
everyday life.</LD>
<TE>   There's a fence she has adopted in La Habra, though, that keeps
evoking--and evolving.</TE>
<TE>   Drive down Whittier Boulevard past a jumble of strip malls to the
corner of Macy Street, where Chandler's patriotic memorial to the
tragedy surrounds a weed-choked lot below a billboard announcing the
return of the McRib.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like everyone has forgotten," said Chandler, a 33-year-old
mother of four from Whittier. "I think some people can't deal with it
anymore, so they've just turned away and went on with other things. I
could have done that. But I don't want to."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of American flags attached to the chain-link fence snap in
the breeze. A collection of red, white and blue plastic cups stuffed
into the lattice form another flag. On a 4-by-6-foot sheet of
plywood, Chandler painted a silhouette of New York's skyline, the
twin towers intact, superimposed on Old Glory.</TE>
<TE>   Down the block and around the corner, the fence is decorated with
flowers, pompoms and posters, store-bought patriotic signs and
hand-painted reminders to never forget.</TE>
<TE>   The fence has become what Chandler calls her new obsession, and
she is its curator.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the neighborhood add stuff now and then--a cardboard
flag painted by Raul, a flag-and-fireworks banner by Melissa and
Victor, a poster honoring seven servicemen from the Murphy and Davis
families. But Chandler and her children--Kellie, 5, Katie, 6,
Michael, 7, Michelle, 10--are the fence's primary contributors and
caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   They visit almost daily to take down the old and put up the new,
pick up trash and pull weeds. On the 11th of each month, the family
lights candles at the fence as traffic roars by.</TE>
<TE>   "If something starts looking wrong, gets discolored or old or
faded, I take it down and replace it," Chandler said. "I don't know
who owns the lot. I don't have anyone's permission. So I figure if I
keep it looking nice, he won't object."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler wasn't the first drawn to the fence after Sept. 11. Adam
Alexander, a 14-year-old who lives in the gritty apartments across
the street, hung the first cardboard flag. For weeks, he and his
mother joined neighbors in weekend candlelight vigils in front of the
fence. They hung posters, balloons and flowers, and left a prayer
book for people to sign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a little fence, but it has made a big difference. It
brought the neighborhood together," said Sandy Pischer, 32, Adam's
mother. "It's kind of taken on a life of its own."</TE>
<TE>   It was Adam who gave Chandler the idea to turn the fence and the
blighted corner into a canvas to express her love of country and a
therapy for her emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everyone else, I felt angry. I felt insecure, almost
afraid," she said. "More than anything, I'm sad. It's been a release
for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got four great kids, a great husband, and I can't imagine
the pain they're still in," she said of the victims' families. "I
don't ever want them to think we've forgotten about what happened.
And all the people who are serving overseas--I don't want them to
think we don't appreciate what they're doing for our country."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, she received a letter from the city of La Habra. She
worried it was a scolding for painting stars and "USA" on the
sidewalk in front of the fence. Instead, it was an invitation to a
City Council meeting, where she was given an award.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who still care about what happened. I care. But
I'm not as driven as she is," said Aaron Winer, 62, a former Marine
who owns a home-improvement business next to the fence. "I feel like
I'm a patriot--but not like her. She's a very, very moral person
who's trying to teach her kids to be good citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Strangers meet at the fence. Winer has encountered several people
taking photos; how unusual that something like this has survived so
long, they say. Pischer met a woman, an Army sergeant, who was
preparing to go off to war; she wished her luck and they parted.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm out working on the fence, the first question people ask
me is: Did I personally lose anyone?" said Chandler, who keeps a gold
charm of the World Trade Center around her neck and a picture of the
towers ablaze on her refrigerator. "My answer is that we all lost
thousands."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler's passion extends beyond the fence. Two months ago, Steve
Chandler, who services elevators for a living, found his wife
painting an American flag on their garage door. She would like to
paint the entire house, but that, he said, would be too much.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't mind that she dresses herself and the kids in red,
white and blue every day, or that Uncle Sam appears to have
redecorated their house. He doesn't mind that she named their golden
retriever puppies Freedom and Liberty, or that she's going to change
the license plates on their Chevy Suburban from TUF2PRK to NVR4GET.</TE>
<TE>   But he draws the line when his wife suggests--half joking--getting
a white rose with 9/11/2001 tattooed on her arm.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Tracey Chandler and her kids plan to begin turning earth in
front of the fence for red and white rose bushes.</TE>
<TE>   "Even my mom thinks I'm off my rocker," Chandler said. "It's hard
to explain. ... It started out as something that made me feel good.
It just kind of grew from there."</TE>

<HD>Odds Are the Gaming Channel Will Still Play on Santa Ana TV</HD>
<DH>Television: City officials don't like the new cable
offering but are likely to renew firm's contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financially troubled Adelphia Communications Corp. is facing another
crisis of sorts in Santa Ana, where city officials oppose a new
gaming channel the company is offering in its cable-TV service.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Pro Tem Patricia A. McGuigan is leading the opposition to
the gaming channel, where viewers can place bets on horse races. But
she and other city officials concede that the channel is probably
here to stay.</LD>
<LD>   "Gaming is inappropriate on a TV cable system. I would rather that
Adelphia use that channel for educational programming," said
McGuigan.</LD>
<TE>   Rip Ribble, executive director of the city's Parks, Recreation and
Community Services Agency, which contracts for cable-television
service, said he wrote a letter last month to Adelphia, expressing
the city's opposition to the new channel.</TE>
<TE>   But company officials have yet to reply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any control over it, but our concern is that people
can get addicted to gaming," Ribble said. "We want our local channels
to be used for wholesome programming about the community; to add to
the city's quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   The channel is offered at no extra cost to basic subscribers, who
pay $10.95 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is the only cable provider in the city, and its contract
expires next month. Ribble said the contract will probably be renewed
despite the controversy over the channel, which debuted in April.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Carpenter, Adelphia's representative in Santa Ana, said the
gaming channel is also available in five other Orange County cities
where the company has contracts. Santa Ana is the only city that has
complained about the new service, she said. Adelphia, the nation's
sixth-largest cable company, is the leading cable provider in
Southern California, where it has 1.2 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company is teetering on bankruptcy, claiming debts of more
than $15 billion. Lenders and investors have pressured the Rigas
family to relinquish control of the company, which they did Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The company was founded by John Rigas, who at one time was its
chairman, chief executive and president.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about $3.1
billion borrowed by Rigas family partnerships using Adelphia, which
is a public company, as a guarantor.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's financial troubles prompted McGuigan to wonder with
whom the city will be dealing in the future for cable services.
"Talks on the [contract] extension are ongoing, but we're in limbo
because we don't know what's going to happen to the cable system,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Slaying Victim's Co-Worker Sought</HD>
<DH>Crime: The woman whose body was found in the Mojave Desert
had a 2-year-old daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A manhunt is underway for a Barstow-area man suspected of killing a
co-worker and dumping her body near the desert town of Yermo,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The body found in the Mojave Desert near Fort Irwin Road is that
of 26-year-old Kristina Garcia of Barstow, San Bernardino County
coroner officials said Friday. The cause of death had not been
determined because of decomposition, said Randy Emon of the coroner's
office.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia, a Raytheon employee at the Army base, was last seen May
14.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities are searching for Lawrence Rivera, 30, who works at
Raytheon. He has been named as a suspect in Garcia's disappearance
and death, said Chip Patterson, a spokesman for the San Bernardino
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy we need to get in custody," Patterson said. "We
have concerns about his involvement in this crime and in the
potential for further violence."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is the last person known to be with Garcia, Patterson said.
His car was found in Los Angeles this week.</TE>
<TE>   When Garcia failed to show up at her job May 15, worried
co-workers went to her apartment in Lenwood, a town near Barstow.
They found the door unlocked and her 2-year-old daughter, Aurianna,
alone, said Patterson. Garcia's car and cell phone were still there.</TE>
<TE>   The toddler will live with her father, Brandon Garcia, 26, and her
grandparents in Tuscaloosa, Ala., family members said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a beautiful person, a wonderful mother with a beautiful
voice. She used to sing," said Linda Garcia, Brandon Garcia's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described Brandon and Kristina Garcia as estranged,
but Linda Garcia said they kept in contact and were working through
their differences. They spoke the night before her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   The couple met more than five years ago at Ft. Sill in Oklahoma
while both were in the Army.</TE>
<TE>   She came from a military family. They had been at Ft. Irwin for
about the last three years, and Garcia was happy with her job, though
"she wasn't crazy about the desert," her mother-in-law said.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Garcias, Rivera had been in the Army, authorities said.
He's known to have ties in San Diego and Lakewood. Authorities tried
to contact him after Garcia's body was found Wednesday afternoon, but
they couldn't find him. Rivera, who also goes by the name Lawrence
Hale, is about 5 feet, 10 inches, with hazel eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the case is asked to telephone San
Bernardino Sheriff's homicide detectives at (909) 387-3589 or (800)
782-7462.</TE>

<HD>Simon Addresses Abortion Issue</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Before a coalition of women's groups, GOP nominee
for governor says he does not support 'any litmus test' for
appointing judges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr., an abortion foe,
pledged Friday to name both opponents and supporters of abortion
rights as judges and said he would impose no litmus test on
appointees.</LD>
<LD>   "I am pro-life with exceptions for rape, incest and where the life
of the mother is threatened, but I understand that not everyone
agrees with me on this subject," Simon told 1,200 women at a
breakfast in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Simon promised that he would uphold all legal and constitutional
"protections of reproductive freedom."</LD>
<TE>   "A governor does not and should not have the power to pick and
choose the laws that will be enforced and the rights that will be
recognized," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he left some key questions unanswered, Simon's remarks
were the first significant step he has taken since the March 5 GOP
primary to broaden his appeal beyond his conservative Republican
base. His opposition to abortion rights has been a key focus of Gov.
Gray Davis' reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In a state where roughly two out of three voters support abortion
rights, Davis has used the issue to cast Simon as out of step with
the California mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in turn, has largely dodged the subject, saying he would
rather talk about education, the state budget and California's
infrastructure. But at the Bonaventure Hotel breakfast on Friday,
Simon abruptly shifted course and said he welcomed the chance to talk
about "reproductive freedom."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a topic that needs to be addressed," he told members of The
Women's TownHall, a nonpartisan coalition of women's groups. "It's a
topic that's all about respect. It's all about control."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also addressed concerns raised by Planned Parenthood and
other advocacy groups that he might appoint state judges who would
roll back abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not support any litmus test for the appointment of judges to
the state courts," he said. "I will appoint only the most qualified
jurists. Some I'm sure will be pro-choice, some I'm sure will be
pro-life, but I know one thing, they will be all good judges."</TE>
<TE>   He called on Californians "to rise above the rancor and rhetoric
so we can all respect each other's points of view" on abortion. But
Simon declined to say whether he would sign any legislation to curb
abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I will uphold the law, and I will not be an activist governor
when it comes to abortion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he would maintain state spending on contraception
and other family planning services, Simon said he believes the state
Constitution ensures such spending.</TE>
<TE>   But Laurie Beijen, who heads the California Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League's political committee, recalled
that former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian slashed spending on the
state Office of Family Planning. Beijen said the league, which has
endorsed Davis, would not trust Simon to protect abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Upholding the law is all well and good, but is he going to
advocate for making the law stronger, or is he going to unravel the
gains that we've made?" she asked. "My guess is that he would sign
laws that were in line with his views."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was scheduled to speak to the same group later in the day,
but bowed out because of a carpenters' union protest outside the
hotel. Several dozen union members carrying picket signs were
challenging the wage rates of a contractor remodeling rooms at the
Bonaventure.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis doesn't cross picket lines," said Gabriel Sanchez, a
spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   On abortion, Sanchez cited seven bills Davis has signed to enhance
abortion rights. He cited endorsements of Davis by Planned Parenthood
and the abortion rights league and said Simon is backed by the
California branch of the national Right to Life group.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll let those endorsements speak for themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon made the most of the governor's absence at the breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he cares about women, but apparently not enough to defy
his big union contributors and be here today," he told the crowd,
which burst into cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also said less than 30% of the people Davis has appointed to
key positions in his administration were women. Simon, whose own
record on women appointees came under attack in the GOP primary, said
his "target" would be 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides said Simon was only counting Davis appointees
confirmed by the Senate. They said 34% of the judges appointed by
Davis were women--up from 25% under his GOP predecessor, Pete
Wilson--and 40% of the governor's other appointees were women.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's so concerned about women, why is it he never appointed
women to senior management positions in any of his businesses?"
Sanchez asked. "Why didn't he appoint women to any senior positions
in his primary campaign?"</TE>

<HD>Lifeguards May Need a Rescue From Ventura County's Deficit</HD>
<DH>Beaches: Officials recommend curtailing patrols this summer
to cut expenses. With fewer eyes on the water, swimmers are told to
be extra careful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the busy summer season gets underway, Ventura County officials are
proposing to trim lifeguard patrols at three popular beaches to help
close a multimillion-dollar budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Harbor Director Lyn Krieger is recommending that lifeguards be
posted at Hollywood, Silver Strand and Kiddie beaches near Oxnard
from Fridays through Mondays instead of every day.</LD>
<LD>   With the county facing a projected $17.6-million deficit in the
2002-03 budget, the Harbor Department was forced to find a way to cut
expenses, Krieger said.</LD>
<TE>   State beaches in Ventura County will also see a 20% cut in
lifeguards because of proposed funding reductions. With fewer eyes to
help them out, families are being warned to be extra vigilant when
visiting the coast this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay away from rip currents and ... stay close to towers that are
guarded," said Richard A. Rojas, superintendent for state beaches in
Ventura and Oxnard. "And if someone can't swim, they shouldn't be in
the water. Period."</TE>
<TE>   All beaches will be fully staffed for Memorial Day weekend, the
unofficial start of the sand-and-surf season.</TE>
<TE>   Daily patrols will continue through June at the county-operated
beaches, but then the reduced schedule will begin unless the Board of
Supervisors agrees to restore about $50,000 to the Harbor
Department's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the unincorporated areas adjacent to Silver Strand,
Hollywood and Kiddie beaches have already started lobbying the Board
of Supervisors to maintain daily patrols.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the board, Vickie Finan said visitors who swim and
frolic near the ocean are unaware of rip currents and other dangers
that have led to drownings in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Public safety should be a priority as supervisors wrestle with
difficult budget decisions, said Finan, president of the local
community services district.</TE>
<TE>   "The county invites millions of people to come to their beaches
and I think they should have lifeguards to protect those beaches,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn, whose district includes some of the beach
areas, said he favors finding the money to maintain patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a safety issue, so we need to try to respond to that in
some way," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Finan said the county should spend less on beach maintenance to
free up money. But Krieger said that could be dangerous because beach
walkers may be injured by sticks, shells and glass shards hidden in
the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Public restrooms need to be cleaned regularly to avoid health
hazards, the harbor director said.</TE>
<TE>   She tried to cushion the service cuts, Krieger said, by keeping
beach patrols during the busiest weekend periods.</TE>
<TE>   Midweek visitors who need help will have to call 911, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We always tell people that whether or not a lifeguard is there,
you should take a lot of responsibility for yourself and be careful,"
Krieger said.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguards will continue to staff towers at state beaches in the
county, but some patrols will be scaled back, Rojas said. San
Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura, for instance, is usually
patrolled by three lifeguards daily during summer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, the seasonal guards will not be out if the weather
is gray and gloomy, Rojas said.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer lifeguards will be on duty toward the end of the day, and
swimmers may be asked to move near towers that are staffed, the parks
superintendent said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of tweaking the system to make sure the public
benefits," he said. "But we're looking for visitors to be smarter."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's city beaches near the pier and at Marina Park will have
daily patrols, Rojas added. The city contracts with the state to
receive lifeguard services, so there will be no interruption, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Deficit Looms Over Lifeguards</HD>
<DH>Beaches: Officials recommend curtailing patrols this summer
to cut expenses. With fewer eyes on the water, swimmers are told to
be extra careful.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the busy summer season gets underway, Ventura County officials are
proposing to trim lifeguard patrols at three popular beaches to help
close a multimillion-dollar budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Harbor Director Lyn Krieger is recommending that lifeguards be
posted at Hollywood, Silver Strand and Kiddie beaches near Oxnard
from Fridays through Mondays instead of every day.</LD>
<LD>   With the county facing a projected $17.6-million deficit in the
2002-03 budget, the Harbor Department was forced to find a way to cut
expenses, Krieger said.</LD>
<TE>   State beaches in Ventura County will also see a 20% cut in
lifeguards because of proposed funding reductions. With fewer eyes to
help them out, families are being warned to be extra vigilant when
visiting the coast this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay away from rip currents and ... stay close to towers that are
guarded," said Richard A. Rojas, superintendent for state beaches in
Ventura and Oxnard. "And if someone can't swim, they shouldn't be in
the water. Period."</TE>
<TE>   All beaches will be fully staffed for Memorial Day weekend, the
unofficial start of the sand-and-surf season.</TE>
<TE>   Daily patrols will continue through June at the county-operated
beaches, but then the reduced schedule will begin unless the Board of
Supervisors agrees to restore about $50,000 to the Harbor
Department's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the unincorporated areas adjacent to Silver Strand,
Hollywood and Kiddie beaches have already started lobbying the county
Board of Supervisors to maintain daily patrols.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the board, Vickie Finan said visitors who swim and
frolic near the ocean are unaware of rip currents and other dangers
that have led to drownings in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Public safety should be a priority as supervisors wrestle with
difficult budget decisions, said Finan, president of the local
community services district.</TE>
<TE>   "The county invites millions of people to come to their beaches
and I think they should have lifeguards to protect those beaches,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn, whose district includes some of the beach
areas, said he favors finding the money to maintain patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a safety issue, so we need to try to respond to that in
some way," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Finan said the county should spend less on beach maintenance to
free up money. But Krieger said that could be dangerous because beach
walkers may be injured by sticks, shells and glass shards hidden in
the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Public restrooms need to be cleaned regularly to avoid health
hazards, the harbor director said. She tried to cushion the service
cuts, Krieger said, by keeping beach patrols during the busiest
weekend periods.</TE>
<TE>   Midweek visitors who need help will have to call 911, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We always tell people that whether or not a lifeguard is there,
you should take a lot of responsibility for yourself and be careful,"
Krieger said.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguards will continue to man towers at state beaches in the
county, but some patrols will be scaled back, Rojas said. San
Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura, for instance, is usually
patrolled by three lifeguards daily during summer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, the seasonal guards will not be out if the weather
is gray and gloomy, Rojas said.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer lifeguards will be on duty toward the end of the day, and
swimmers may be asked to move near towers that are staffed, the parks
superintendent said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of tweaking the system to make sure the public
benefits," he said. "But we're looking for visitors to be smarter."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's city beaches near the pier and at Marina Park will have
daily patrols, Rojas added. The city contracts with the state to
receive lifeguard services, so there will be no interruption, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Envelope's Fumes Force Evacuation</HD>
<DH>Safety: 200 people are told to leave a Fountain Valley
office when a manila package gives off a sickening odor. Two are
taken to hospitals.</DH>

<LD>Two people were hospitalized and 200 more evacuated Friday when a
mysterious envelope released noxious fumes at the state Department of
Rehabilitation office in Fountain Valley, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials said they do not think the package was sent to
injure someone but believe a container inside the manila envelope may
have broken.</LD>
<LD>   The package, which smelled of acetone or nail-polish remover, was
delivered in a crate with other mail by a U.S. Postal Service carrier
about 1 p.m., said Joe Cucinotti, a Fountain Valley Fire Department
spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   A few minutes after opening the envelope, a 44-year-old office
worker began complaining of nausea and was sent home. A supervisor
called fire officials, who sent two hazardous-materials teams to the
building in the 10500 block of Talbert Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   When paramedics arrived, the postal carrier complained of
tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. The carrier, 32, was
taken to Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated
and released, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics visited the office worker at her home and took her to
Huntington Beach Hospital after learning she also was feeling ill.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a headache and burning eyes, and she'd begun vomiting,"
Cucinotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Six other office workers were examined but none complained of
problems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities evacuated the building, which also houses the
University of Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Most employees went home, but a few, determined to retrieve their
belongings, waited several hours until the building was reopened.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said tests showed the material in the envelope was
some type of acrylic resin, but they were unable to identify it. Fire
officials said the U.S. Postal Service will conduct more tests.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday afternoon, about a dozen people were evacuated from
the Boeing Co. plant in Seal Beach after an employee received a
package with a liquid leaking from it.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Friday, hazardous materials crews had not determined
what the liquid was, a company spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Shuts Its Emergency Room Doors</HD>
<DH>Health care: Indefinite closure sends patients scrambling,
and is the latest blow to Parkview in Riverside. It has filed for
bankruptcy and is struggling to survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest sign that Parkview Community Hospital in Riverside is
struggling for survival, hospital officials announced this week that
they can no longer handle emergency room patients.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital shut its emergency room doors indefinitely early in
the week, sending patients scrambling to find alternative care
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   "This will mean a struggle for everyone," said Dolores Green,
executive director of the Riverside County Medical Assn. "Emergency
room doctors are already stretched very thin, and now I'm hearing
stories about wait times way over four hours. That's unacceptable,
but what can you do?"</LD>
<TE>   Local hospitals, however, have been acutely aware of the
foundering medical center's problems and began beefing up their own
staffing levels, even hiring nurses from Parkview, just in case.</TE>
<TE>   "We had heard some of the rumors," said Ann Matich, spokeswoman
for neighboring Riverside Community Hospital. "I don't think this
came as a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Still, emergency room wait times at Riverside Community are
stretching up to eight hours some nights, she said. Financial
problems had forced Parkview to stop accepting ambulance traffic two
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Normally a hospital must post a 90-day notice before closing its
emergency room doors, but the California Department of Health
Services granted the facility a financial hardship exemption.
Parkview officials are hoping the closure will last no more than nine
months.</TE>
<TE>   It's the latest blow to the hospital, which has been mired in
financial problems and filed for bankruptcy protection in March.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Martin, executive director for Parkview, did not return phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Parkview was barred from participating in the
Medicare and Medi-Cal programs after state inspectors ruled that the
hospital posed an "immediate jeopardy" to the health and safety of
patients. It was a devastating loss, because nearly 70% of the
hospital's funding comes from Medicare and Medi-Cal patients.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the hospital was already battling overwhelming debt,
having recorded more than $30 million in losses since 1995. Although
the hospital's right to participate in the government insurance
programs was reinstated after a second inspection in March, the
interim financial loss was more than the facility could bear.</TE>
<TE>   After the bankruptcy filing, hospital officials said they hoped to
reorganize without shutting down service to Riverside's poor and
uninsured. Parkview became the main health care provider for
Riverside's low-income residents after the county's hospital moved to
neighboring Moreno Valley in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Among plans being considered by Parkview administrators are taking
on a financial partner or allowing another entity to operate the
emergency room, which costs nearly $3 million a year. Riverside
County has voiced an interest in the emergency room, possibly running
it as a satellite facility to the Moreno Valley hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But Riverside County officials want to complete an audit and cost
analysis of the emergency room before making a decision, said Ray
Smith, a county spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Matich said, Riverside Community Hospital is already
gearing up for more business. Plans have been in the works for months
to add 7,200 square feet to the emergency room. The addition won't be
complete, however, for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody here is just keeping their fingers crossed that
Parkview will be able to pull out of this one," Green said. "But it
will be a long haul."</TE>

<HD>Agency Created to Pay for Hotel Downtown</HD>
<DH>Development: Nonprofit would issue tax-exempt bonds to
finance the $280-million project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to create a nonprofit
corporation to issue tax-exempt bonds and pay for a $280-million
hotel next to the Convention Center, despite opposition from three
council members who worry about the city undertaking a project
shunned by private developers.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, city officials would make up most of the board
for a new Downtown Revitalization Corp. that would issue tax-exempt
bonds to build the 1,200-room hotel downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of a nearby hotel has been cited by Convention Center
officials as a reason they have had difficulty attracting events. A
sagging occupancy rate has hindered efforts to pay off the debt on
the $525-million Convention Center expansion.</LD>
<TE>   Private developers have not come forward to build the hotel on
their own, and the Community Redevelopment Agency has estimated it
may have to subsidize the project with $67 million to $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   "What if it turns into a situation like the Convention Center
where no one comes there?" Councilman Dennis Zine asked. "Who is
going to pay the debt?"</TE>
<TE>   Zine, along with council members Jack Weiss and Wendy Greuel,
voted against creating the nonprofit corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton told the council that the
hotel project would not go forward unless it can be shown that the
hotel, with limited subsidies, would generate enough revenue to cover
the bonds. Deaton said that creating a nonprofit agency would protect
the city's general fund from liability and that the tax-exempt bonds
are necessary to make the project work.</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot be financed otherwise," the analyst said. "It is not
economically feasible otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said that should give the council pause. "The city will be
involved at one level or another in a matter that strikes most of us
as the job of private enterprise, sink or swim," Weiss said. "Yet
here we go again with insufficient public discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Councilmen Eric Garcetti and Ed Reyes defended the project, saying
a hotel will allow the Convention Center to attract more business,
lessening the drain on the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hemorrhaging at the Convention Center," Reyes said. "The
only way to stop that bleeding is to begin this work today."</TE>
<TE>   Deaton said once the nonprofit is finalized, he will be able to
negotiate with builders and hotel chains that would contract to
operate the hotel. His goal is to negotiate a deal not requiring
public subsidies.</TE>

<HD>Trawler Seized in Case of Chinese Wading Ashore</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The name of the vessel matches that on
flotation devices the 10 men left on sands near Laguna Beach.</DH>

<LD>Barnacles and seaweed clung to the rusting hull of the 60-foot
fishing trawler. Inside, tiny cots lined a cramped bunkroom where
authorities suspect that 10 illegal immigrants spent up to a month on
their voyage from China to Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities Friday impounded the sea-torn Fu Ching at the
Port of Long Beach and detained the boat's two crew members for
questioning about the immigrants' predawn landing.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 men, naked and clinging to makeshift floats, waded ashore
early Thursday in front of a mobile home park near Laguna Beach,
where they were spotted by residents and detained later by police.</LD>
<TE>   Lifesaving equipment the men left on the beach was emblazoned with
the name "Fu Ching," meaning Lucky Star, leading federal authorities
to believe that the men were dropped off close to the coast by a boat
bearing the same name. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters spotted the Fu
Ching a few hours later 100 miles off San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel, which is registered in the north Taiwanese port of Kee
Lung, was reported missing May 11, when its owner lost contact with
the crew close to Hawaii, according to Taiwanese government
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The boat had been fishing alone, and authorities remain unsure
whether the crew was hijacked or simply wanted to stop communicating
with the vessel's owner, said Ellen Chen, an official at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the 10 men started their journey in a
different boat that took them from mainland China to Taiwan. Based on
early statements from the men, officials said the men switched
vessels at least once.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of Long Beach, a tugboat crew member described the Fu
Ching as run-down but in working condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very lived-in," said Jay Calhoun. "It's a little grubby, but
it's an older ship."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. immigration agents continued questioning the 10 captured men
Friday at a detention center in Santa Ana. The men will be appointed
attorneys next week, said Francisco Arcaute, a spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. He provided no more details
about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although smuggling of immigrants by sea has declined in recent
years, many Chinese still try to make the perilous journey.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard officials have reported seeing more Taiwan-registered
fishing boats with crews from mainland China. The crews may then
mutiny near the coast of Guam, Canada or the United States, forcing
the master to drop them off close to shore.</TE>

whether the crew was hijacked or simply wanted to stop communicating
with the vessel's owner, said Ellen Chen, an official at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the 10 men started their journey in a
different boat that took them from mainland China to Taiwan. Based on
early statements from the men, officials said the men switched
vessels at least once.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of Long Beach, a tugboat crew member described the Fu
Ching as run-down but in working condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very lived-in," said Jay Calhoun. "It's a little grubby, but
it's an older ship."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. immigration agents continued questioning the 10 captured men
Friday at a detention center in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The men will be appointed attorneys next week, said Francisco
Arcaute, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
He provided no more details about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although smuggling of immigrants by sea has declined in recent
years, many Chinese still try to make the perilous journey.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard officials have reported seeing more Taiwan-registered
fishing boats with crews from mainland China. Such crews may then
mutiny near the coast of Guam, Canada or the United States, forcing
the master to drop them off close to shore.</TE>

<HD>Jack Kruschen, 80; 'Apartment' Neighbor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Kruschen, a character actor with a flair for dialects who
received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his 1960
role in "The Apartment," has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Kruschen, who played the Greek grandfather in the 1980s sitcom
"Webster," had been in failing health for many years. He died while
traveling April 2, but news of his death was not immediately
reported.</LD>
<LD>   In a career that spanned more than six decades, Kruschen appeared
in more than 75 movies, including the original "Cape Fear," "The
Unsinkable Molly Brown," "The Ladies' Man" and "McClintock." He had
20 years of radio, TV and movie roles behind him when he was cast as
Jack Lemmon's annoyed yet kindly neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss, in Billy
Wilder's classic comedy "The Apartment."</LD>
<TE>   The role--and Kruschen's Oscar nomination--allowed audiences to
finally put a name to the familiar face.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon were the best things that ever
happened to me," Kruschen told The Times in 1960. "They worked with
me, helped me, brought out the ability to use whatever I have learned
of my craft."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Winnipeg, Canada, in 1922, Kruschen was the son of a
watchmaker who later set up shop in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood High School, Kruschen appeared in a dialect role in
the school production of "The Fortune Teller." That led to his doing
dialect roles in radio dramas for CBS radio.</TE>
<TE>   In the Army during World War II, Kruschen was assigned to the
Armed Forces Radio Service. After the war, he moved to New York and
returned to radio by doing an Alka-Seltzer commercial in Yiddish.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Hollywood, he became a regular on the radio and TV
versions of Jack Webb's "Dragnet" and, in 1949, he landed his first
small movie part in "Red, Hot and Blue." A string of other film jobs
followed, including small parts in "The Lemon Drop Kid," "Abbott and
Costello Go to Mars," "Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation" and "The Benny
Goodman Story."</TE>
<TE>   Kruschen even achieved minor cult status as one of the first
victims of the Martian death ray in the 1953 sci-fi classic "The War
of the Worlds."</TE>
<TE>   He worked steadily in television after "The Apartment." Kruschen's
final role was a small part in the 1997 romantic comedy "'Til There
Was You."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Mary; children; grandchildren; and a
sister.</TE>

<HD>Theodore Kurze, 79; Introduced Use of Microscope to Brain
Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Theodore Kurze, a pioneering neurosurgeon who radically altered
the practice of neurosurgery with his introduction of the microscope
to brain surgery, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Kurze died May 10 at his home in Newport Beach. He had been
battling prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Kurze's introduction of the microscope in the 1950s was an
innovation that caused death rates and complications from surgery to
plummet.</LD>
<TE>   "To do brain surgery before the microscope ... you had to be able
to accept the fact that people didn't do well, that you were hurting
and maiming people by trying to help them," said longtime colleague
Dr. Peter J. Jannetta, professor of neurosurgery at Allegheny General
Hospital in Pittsburgh. Surgeons in those days could ill afford to
become too friendly with their patients, said Jannetta.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1957, Kurze--who was in private practice in Los
Angeles--and his colleague Dr. Robert Rand of UCLA introduced the
microscope to better visualize the neural tissues they were working
with. Such methods had already helped change ophthalmology as well as
ear, nose and throat surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted had the sense to walk the microscope across the hall from the
laboratory to the operating room--it was a simple, fabulous,
constructive idea," said Jannetta, who as a UCLA resident in the
1960s would assist Kurze and Rand at operations around Los Angeles so
he could learn their techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Kurze first used the operating microscope in his surgical
specialty: removal of tumors on the nerves supplying the ear and
balance organs. Operations on these growths, called acoustic
neuromas, used to kill 20% to 30% of the patients and cause serious
side effects such as hearing loss, facial paralysis and difficulty
swallowing in the majority of survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Today, mortality for such surgery is less than 1% and rates of
serious complications are below 10%, said friend and colleague Dr.
Martin Weiss, chairman of the department of neurological surgery at
USC's Keck School of Medicine, a department once headed by Kurze.</TE>
<TE>   In the years that followed, the use of the microscope became
ubiquitous in neurosurgery.</TE>
<TE>   "It made surgery infinitely safer and really revolutionized what
we were able to do," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Kurze was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on May 18, 1922, and grew up in
Floral Heights, Long Island. He graduated from Washington College in
Chestertown, Md., in 1943, and received a doctor of medicine degree
from Long Island Medical College (now SUNY Downstate Medical School)
in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Kurze held several academic positions, and was associated with USC
in various capacities from 1959 to 1987. From 1963 to 1978 he served
as chairman of the department of neurological surgery, and
concurrently as director of neurological surgery at the Los Angeles
County Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   He was a member of many distinguished neurosurgical societies and
from 1968 to 1974 served on the American Board of Neurological
Surgery, the body responsible for the certification of neurosurgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Kurze, said Weiss, was a "chatty, gregarious, outspoken bon
vivant" with a love of sailing and cooking.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1981 Times interview, Kurze described unwinding from 10- to
12-hour stints of surgery by whipping up favorites like avocado soup
and huevos rancheros. He approached cooking much like surgery,
carefully setting out his utensils and ingredients in advance, just
as he would do with his surgical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Kurze also had a long-standing interest in medical ethics, taught
courses on the subject and received an honorary degree in that field
from Washington College.</TE>
<TE>   He consulted for television programs such as the medical drama
"Ben Casey." In fact, recalled Weiss, "He always claimed that the
role of Ben Casey was modeled after him--and like Ben Casey, he was a
bit of an independent spirit who spoke his mind." Kurze is survived
by his wife, Joan Kurze; four grown children from a previous
marriage, Janet Kurze of Rock Creek, Ore., Peter Kurze of San Luis
Obispo, Carol Nicholson of Baltimore, and Heather Kurze of South
Pasadena; and eight grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that donations in his memory be sent to the
Theodore Kurze '43 Memorial Fund, c/o Washington College, 300
Washington Ave., Chestertown, MD 21620, or c/o Alumni Fund for
Theodore Kurze, Alumni Assn., College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate
Medical Center, 450 Clarkson Ave., Box 1204, Brooklyn, NY 11203.</TE>

<HD>Church Took a Hard Line in Priest's Defense</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Diocese leaders rallied to shield man his bishop
called 'a mental case.' Records show no sympathy for the alleged
victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF DONN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine</DL>
<LD>Outside, prosecutors were building their case against a priest
accused of molesting hard-luck children along the city's seedy
waterfront. Inside, behind the brick walls of the chancery, the
leaders of the Roman Catholic diocese were plotting a bare-knuckle
legal defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. J. Joseph Ford, chancellor and chief administrator of the
diocese, set the tone with lawyers. According to his handwritten
notes, the diocese would give "every possible support" to the priest,
"hold hard" to his innocence.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, this was a mess, but not hopeless. The district attorney had
to recognize the "political repercussions" of prosecuting a priest,
Ford wrote.</LD>
<TE>   As for the accusers, the youngest probably won't testify anyway,
the priest's notes continued. His brother could be a problem, though.</TE>
<TE>   "Older one--vindictive queer," Ford wrote. Then he underlined the
last two words twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church has been widely criticized for
mishandling accusations of pedophilia involving priests. What church
leaders have said and done behind chancery walls, however, has
remained largely a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Not so for the Rev. Raymond-Joseph Lauzon. Several lawsuits were
brought against him in the 1990s for allegedly abusing children in
the 1970s and 1980s. For reasons that remain unclear, thousands of
pages of documents compiled in those suits remain on public file in
the Cumberland County courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Years before sex abuse charges were brought against Lauzon, the
documents show, he was already considered a headache--a cleric his
bishop once described, in writing, as "a mental case."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, when he was accused of abusing children, the church defended
him fiercely. Church leaders, the records indicate, were acting on an
instinct to protect the church from scandal, and on the belief that
any priest can be redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   An Associated Press review of the documents failed to uncover a
word of sympathy from church officials for the alleged victims. The
late bishop of Portland, Edward O'Leary, who made his name fighting
moral battles against abortion and pornography, was asked during
pretrial testimony to name the victim in the case. His reply: "Father
Lauzon."</TE>
<TE>   Ford, now a parish priest, and other diocesan officials did not
comment for this story. Neither did Lauzon, who has previously denied
molesting children. Lauzon was at the end of his second year at St.
Paul's Seminary, in Ottawa, Canada, when administrators told him not
to return.</TE>
<TE>   Their letter to Lauzon's sponsoring bishop in Portland said: "The
directors feel that they are relieving Your Excellency of a problem
child by turning this young man away; better now than later."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Daniel Feeney, who has since died, gave Lauzon a second
chance. Lauzon finished at another seminary and was ordained in 1955,
at age 29.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next eight years, he bounced around the state from parish
to parish. At least five supervising pastors complained that he was
foulmouthed, insulting, lazy or scornful of authority, diocesan
records show.</TE>
<TE>   "The man is a neurotic and psycho who looks for self-pity," one
pastor, the Rev. Eugene Bettez, wrote to the bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Finally sent home to await fill-in duties, Lauzon complained to a
Vatican emissary. Defending himself, Bishop Feeney replied in writing
that he had committed a "great error" by letting Lauzon finish
seminary.</TE>
<TE>   "Your Excellency knows American slang," Feeney wrote. "This man is
a 'nut.'"</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, Lauzon underwent eight months of psychiatric
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Lauzon became director of a new church thrift shop near
the Portland waterfront, then a seedy, crime-ridden part of town.
There he stayed for 15 years distributing clothing, furniture and
spiritual guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that in serving the poor, Father Lauzon had finally found
his calling," Bishop O'Leary, Feeney's successor, would say later in
pretrial testimony.</TE>
<TE>   As Anthony Matthews tells it today, he first tagged along at age 8
with an older brother on a trip to the thrift shop. Within a year, he
says, Lauzon had introduced him to sex. By age 14, he says, he had
had more than 100 sexual encounters with Lauzon.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, all five of Anthony Matthews' brothers were abused by
the priest, they later charged in lawsuits. Lauzon bought them a used
car, a small boat and four motorbikes, he later said in pretrial
testimony, saying he was just trying to keep them out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1977, a Portland woman, Madeline Shane, claimed to have
overheard a young man say he brought runaway boys to the thrift shop,
where Lauzon would molest them. She told five priests, including an
aide to the bishop, she said in an affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "He accused me of lying," she continued, "and when I told him I
was telling the truth, he said he would pass the information on." She
heard nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, police began tracking reports of child
molesting in the city's port area. The clues led to Lauzon.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Dion, an investigator, remembers interrogating the priest.
"He suggested that what I was doing was blasphemous, and I would have
to answer to the Almighty for it," said Dion, now a county sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   When Dion told church authorities of the inquiry, one priest said
something that he never forgot. This is going to be difficult for
Lauzon, the priest said, because it will make it hard for him to
realize his dream.</TE>
<TE>   The dream? To found an East Coast version of Boy's Town. In 1984,
Lauzon was indicted on charges of gross sexual misconduct with
Anthony and Joseph Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Asked later what he meant by "vindictive queer," Ford said he was
just writing down "facts and theories" laid out by the lawyers, court
papers show.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop O'Leary, who is now dead, made it clear in pretrial
testimony that the church probably would have sided with Lauzon, no
matter what: "Even if a priest has done things which are wrong or
even sinful, our faith teaches us there is still a calling here from
God and we may simply have not found quite the right vehicle for
him."</TE>
<TE>   But the diocese also feared scandal. After an early legal meeting,
Ford wrote in his notes: "It is not merely Fr. Lauzon but our clergy
and church."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lauzon went to Anthony Matthews, then 17, and begged
him to recant.</TE>
<TE>   "He started crying, telling me if I kept going on with what I was
telling the police, it was going to be 10 to 20 years in prison,"
Matthews said in a recent interview. Feeling pressure and shame, the
boy changed his story.</TE>
<TE>   Lauzon pleaded guilty to witness tampering for approaching the boy
and got four months in jail. In return, the sex charges were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh from jail, Lauzon accepted 11 months of psychiatric care and
resumed his shuffle through Maine parishes. In 1990, he joined a
Franciscan monastery in Kennebunk. After three years, he moved to the
Eastern European country of Lithuania. There, he started a new life,
teaching at St. Anthony College, a Franciscan school in Kretinga.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, lawsuits were piling up back home: six brought
by the Matthews brothers and two by David and Steven Simard. The
suits charged that Lauzon's alleged abuse went on for years, starting
before most of the boys reached puberty. Police reports show that at
least two other boys also accused the priest of sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Clegg, the Matthews' lawyer, says church leaders argued
"that I was representing young men who were unsavory and
untrustworthy liars and cheats, and we were doing damage to Lauzon
and the church."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, after two years of legal hardball, the diocese settled
the lawsuits. Anthony and Joseph Matthews say the church paid their
family nearly $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Lauzon, 76, is retired at a monastery in Lithuania. A
spokesman said he won't grant interviews.</TE>

<HD>MTA Will Pay Woman Raped by Bus Driver</HD>
<DH>Award: The $1.95-million settlement avoids a civil trial.
The driver had kept his job despite losing a civil verdict in a
similar attack 16 years ago.</DH>

<LD>A bus passenger who was raped by the driver will receive $1.95
million from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a settlement
motivated partly by the fact that the driver had lost a civil verdict
in a similar attack 16 years ago, yet remained on the job.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard Henry Howell, 57, was found guilty in criminal court last
year of sexually assaulting a San Dimas woman on Aug. 14, 2001. The
woman testified that she fell asleep on the bus after Howell gave her
an over-the-counter medication. She woke up at an El Monte bus depot,
half dressed and with Howell kissing her chest. DNA evidence linked
Howell to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA's settlement with her avoids a civil trial.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just happy this is finally all over," the 27-year-old woman
said. Since the attack, she said, she has had trouble keeping jobs
and socializing. "This shows the MTA needs to be more careful in who
they hire. As for me, I'm just trying to cope and get back on track."</TE>
<TE>   Howell, now serving an eight-year sentence, was found to have
committed a similar crime in 1986, when he worked for the transit
agency's predecessor, the Southern California Rapid Transit District.
The 1991 civil verdict in that case cost the agency $650,000,
according to the MTA's legal chief, Steve Carnevale. The district
attorney's office, citing insufficient evidence, did not file
criminal charges in that case.</TE>
<TE>   But for reasons the MTA says it has never been able to figure out,
Carnevale said, Howell was not fired after the civil verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact he remained on the job meant this would not have been an
easy case to try," Carnevale said. "It would not have been fun."</TE>
<TE>   The former transit agency did not keep adequate records of the
case, Carnevale said. It was not discovered by MTA officials when the
agencies merged.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't have any answers," he said. "But this woman was
seriously harmed. And she is entitled to significant damages. That is
what motivated the board."</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Howell had run-ins at the transit agency. He was
fired after fighting with a boss in 1997, only to be rehired,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Rapid Transit District] clearly dropped the ball in the
first place," said the woman's lawyer, David Ring. "And then the MTA
never figured it out, even though this guy had a history of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Ring speculated that his client would have been awarded around $5
million by a jury.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has approved more than $10 million in civil settlements
since last July 1.</TE>

<HD>Mormons Reconstruct History With Nauvoo Temple</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Once the apex of church life, the building burned
in 1848. New site honors founding members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY FLETCHER STACK</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>NAUVOO, Ill.</DL>
<LD>It was almost impossible for curious visitors getting their first
peek inside the reconstructed Mormon Nauvoo Temple to resist the
building's tactile enticements.</LD>
<LD>   Hushed crowds felt the urge to stroke the swirling dark wood
railings on the spiral staircase, finger the exquisite needlework in
the bride's room or kick the stone oxen under the baptismal font to
check for sturdiness.</LD>
<LD>   Many who expected the cavernous halls of a cathedral in the
165-foot-high building were taken aback by the feeling of intimacy
inside the temple.</LD>
<TE>   "It was much more impressive than I could have imagined," said
Kirk Brandenberger, a non-Mormon and director of tourism for Keokuk,
Iowa, just across the Mississippi River.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed how the temple's massiveness was broken down into
small rooms."</TE>
<TE>   That combination of grand and intimate has been achieved in
temples throughout Mormon history, but this five-story building is an
especially intriguing amalgam of old and new elements. The temple
opened for public tours May 6, and some 350,000 people were expected
to visit it over the ensuing five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The limestone exterior closely resembles that of the original
Nauvoo Temple, but the interior space is more akin to modern temples,
in which devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints make promises to follow Jesus Christ, participate in
ceremonies such as marriage and baptism for the dead by proxy, and
learn about the purpose of life.</TE>
<TE>   These ceremonies were introduced 161 years ago in Nauvoo, where
the temple was the apex of Mormon efforts to transform a
swamp-infested riverbank into a religious utopia.</TE>
<TE>   Mormon settlers in Nauvoo began the arduous building project in
1839 under the leadership of Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith Jr.
and dedicated it section by section as it was completed.</TE>
<TE>   During construction, the temple served as the church headquarters,
was used for weekly sacrament meetings and was the site of at least
one General Conference meeting. It even hosted recreational events,
writes Don Colvin in "The Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith."</TE>
<TE>   After Smith was killed by a mob in Carthage, Ill., on June 27,
1844, his anxious followers hurried to finish the temple so they
could participate in spiritual marriage ceremonies that would unite
them for "time and all eternity." In January and February of 1846,
several church leaders actually lived in the temple to accommodate
round-the-clock ceremonies. A dining room was installed to feed them,
and at least one man, Orson Hyde, used the temple as a hiding place,
Colvin writes.</TE>
<TE>   As antagonism with non-Mormon neighbors escalated, Brigham Young
left Nauvoo with a small group and, within a year, nearly 12,000
Latter-day Saints followed him, forced to abandon their beloved
temple. A few loyal members were left behind to try to sell or rent
the building. But just as they found a renter in 1848, the building
mysteriously burned, probably at the hands of arsonists, causing
irreparable harm.</TE>
<TE>   A May 1850 tornado completed the destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The lot stood empty for years, symbolizing the faith's loss and
grief over those early events. In the 20th century, Mormon visitors
routinely made pilgrimages to the site to honor their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a thrilling moment for many Mormon faithful when church
President Gordon B. Hinckley announced on April 4, 1999, the church's
intent to rebuild the temple as a memorial to those who sacrificed to
build it.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an audible gasp," Hinckley said in a recent interview.
"There is great interest in Nauvoo. There always has been and always
will be."</TE>
<TE>   The work took 21/2 years, the labor of 2,500 construction workers
and volunteers and $30 million, according to the Hawk Eye newspaper
in Burlington, Iowa. Hinckley donated a painting hanging just beyond
the front doors that his father acquired years ago from a local
artist.</TE>
<TE>   The church had acquired a copy of William Weeks' original
architectural drawings, which allowed modern contractors to replicate
exact details of size and materials. The location was determined by
an archeological study conducted in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The culmination of Mormon temple rites takes place in the
"celestial room," designed to invoke a sense of heaven and where
participants are invited to linger in contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fantastic," exuded Harold Pratt of Fort Madison, Iowa.
"You know that quiet room where they said you could meditate and say
a prayer? Well, I did. It was great."</TE>

<HD>Celebrating Decades of Unshakeable Faith</HD>
<DH>Belief: Five elderly nuns renew their religious vows,
reliving their long-ago journeys from Ireland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sparsely furnished chapel in Montebello, five elderly women
waited patiently at Mass to renew the vows they first took as long
ago as the 1930s. Despite some tumultuous times, they were still very
much in love.</LD>
<LD>   Clare Melody, Eileen Tuohy, Gabriel McCauley, Enda Martin and Mary
Thornton were celebrating their adoration of God after 50 to 70 years
as sisters in the Roman Catholic order called the Religious of the
Sacred Heart of Mary.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in blouses and turtlenecks, solid-colored blazers and
below-the-knee skirts, each woman held a red candle as friends and
family listened to them once again commit themselves to lives of
devotion and austerity.</LD>
<TE>   As young women, they left their families and homeland of Ireland
for New York. They endured homesickness, occasional loneliness and,
most recently, a national child abuse sex scandal that has left some
of the public questioning the church's leadership. But at a time when
many Catholics are saddened or outraged, no headline can shake these
women's faith.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday marks the 70th time that 89-year-old Mary Thornton has
renewed her vows. Some of her family had traveled from Ireland to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   "It never crossed my mind that I would see this day," she said in
a soft voice that still has an Irish lilt. "This is infinitely
magnificent."</TE>
<TE>   Thornton said she always knew that her only marriage would be to
God. It is a realization she still cannot put into words beyond
explaining that she was influenced by religious people as a girl and
inexplicably accepted that her life would never include marriage and
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to be a teacher, and I wanted to live that
lifestyle," she said. "My notions weren't really all that high and
mighty."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest girl in a family of 11 children, she faced great
opposition to her chosen path from her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "My father said, 'Don't worry. As soon as they give her a bucket
and broom, she'll be back home,'" Thornton said. "If he only knew how
many floors I've swept in my life." Becoming a nun "was something I
just had to do, but it was like breaking with family, and we're a
very close family."</TE>
<TE>   Thornton acted as a surrogate mother to her siblings and looked
after most of them when her mother couldn't. She tried to be strict,
but most of the time she'd find herself hugging them and spoiling
them, she recalled. "Knowing that I wouldn't have children never
really bothered me," she said. "Maybe I did too much baby-sitting
when I was growing up."</TE>
<TE>   Thornton described her hometown of Foxford in County Mayo as a
"little town that you'd miss if you blinked ... a glorified village."
Her niece, Mary Anne Schultz, said Thornton grew up "in a two-room
stone house with a thatched roof." Her aunt's departure for New York
"was one of the ways out of poverty and out of Ireland," Schultz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Seated in her tiny room at the Montebello convent, Thornton showed
a visitor a photograph of herself when she was 14 or 15. Her hair is
parted on one side, and two long braids, held in place by ribbons,
fall at her chest. She wears a pretty knee-length dress with a flower
print. Her mother sewed all their clothes.</TE>
<TE>   At 20, Thornton joined the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary,
an order established in France in 1849 to provide education and job
training to the country's destitute women. She was immediately sent
to New York, taking her vows in Tarrytown and quickly adjusting to
the religious life.</TE>
<TE>   Her fellow sisters shared household chores. They prayed together
and set out to establish schools throughout the country. Thornton
began at St. Mary's School in Queens, when the neighborhood was still
mostly Italian and Irish.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, the church sent her to California, where she began to
teach at a Studio City high school in the then-sleepy San Fernando
Valley. In those days, the new schools lacked substantial budgets;
the nuns served as teachers, painters and janitors, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in the customary habits, they would drive their station
wagon from their convent in Westwood and prepare for the school day.
After school, they would clean up and leave it ready for the girls.
Then they'd go home and say their prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton, who says she was a very strict teacher, keeps in touch
with many of her former students. A picture in a photo album shows
her on a 1950s school trip to the beach. In it, she sits casually on
the sand, covered from head to toe in a habit and reading a book. Her
students, clad in bathing suits, sit near her.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching gave me the most satisfaction," Thornton said. "It's
good to know that my efforts weren't wasted, that somebody benefited
somewhere. Those girls gave me life, lots of life."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Joyce McCauley, who was marking 60 years as a sister,
compared her decision to commit her life to the church to the moment
when a woman knows she has found her future husband.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know that man is the right one?" asked McCauley. "It's
one of those intangible things."</TE>
<TE>   Clare Melody, who was celebrating 50 years, remembered the day her
brother Jimmy accidentally shot himself in a hunting accident back
home in Ireland. He was dying from his injury, she said, and her
mother asked Clare and her other siblings to pray.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother told us that God always hears the prayers of children,
and I just started praying and praying and praying," Melody said. "He
lived, and I just felt there was a God watching over us.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always felt like I was in the right place and that this was
for me," Melody said. "That will never change, no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   McCauley remembered the time her older sister Teresa, who
eventually married and had nine children, told her she wanted to be a
nun.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'You don't have to be a nun to serve God!'" she said.
And then, recognizing the irony, she smiled.</TE>

<HD>150 Hospital Workers Launch 4-Day Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 150 health-care employees who contend understaffing is harming
patient care at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center
launched a four-day strike Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Nurses, lab technicians, respiratory therapists and other
employees chanted and picketed in front of the hospital on Vermont
Avenue. Administrators brought in about 150 outside workers to
maintain staffing levels during the strike.</LD>
<LD>   Service Employees International Union's Local 399 planned the
walkout after its members voted Thursday to reject the hospital's
most recent contract offer, which included an 11% raise over two
years and more subsidies for health benefits. The union's last
contract expired May 13.</LD>
<TE>   Although union leaders said about 1,000 workers would join the
walkout during the next three days, hospital officials said only 22%
of the hospital's 1,200 employees belong to the union.</TE>
<TE>   Union members said higher wages are needed to make the 434-bed
hospital competitive with other area hospitals to attract and retain
enough staff members. They also want bonuses and the establishment of
a patient-care committee of employees and administrators to make
decisions about staff-patient ratios.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators said that Queen of Angels feels the effects of a
statewide nursing shortage, but that patients are properly cared for
because other personnel always fill in when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that anyone would try to imply that improving
patient care isn't our main focus," said Julie Jatico, director of
the hospital's emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   Strikers plan to return to work Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   They said they will consider another walkout if the hospital does
not resume talks.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's unethical for health-care workers to strike, but at
this point we feel we have no choice," said Blake Lindgren, 47, a
union negotiator and intensive care nurse who was on the picket line
Friday. "It's in our heart to care for our patients, and striking is
our way of standing up for quality patient care."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said the proposed contract is fair.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't offer the workers anything less than we offer
ourselves," Jatico said.</TE>
<TE>   Striking workers said staff morale dropped after Tenet Healthcare
Corp., the country's second-largest commercial hospital chain, bought
Queen of Angels in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders and elected officials, including Los Angeles
City Councilman Eric Garcetti, walked with the workers and spoke
about their grievances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to fight with you, and we are going to bring Tenet
to its knees," said Scott Svonkin, chief of staff for Assemblyman
Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood). "Business has to learn that people
and patients are more important than profits or buildings."</TE>

<HD>Offbeat Youth Gambles With Traffic While Playing Solitaire
in the Street</HD>

<LD>One joker wild? The police log of the Seal Beach Sun reported that "a
juvenile was seen pulling over a white sports utility vehicle and
getting out to play solitaire in the street" at close to midnight.
"The juvenile stated that he was just relaxing."</LD>
<LD>   Just in time for summer: When I glanced at the ad Karen Trisko of
Laguna Niguel sent my way, I thought it might be a high-tech creation
for nude beaches (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it's for cars that don't mind baring all.</LD>
<TE>   What's the use of trying? Adele Rathbone of Torrance forwarded a
notice from an employer who doesn't seem to want workers with any
incentive (see accompanying). As for the second sentence of the ad, I
guess after they've been canned, they would be free to travel.</TE>
<TE>   No offense, dad: I'm still debating over a Father's Day special
snapped last year in Alaska (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Driving forces: Greeters along roadsides have long been a feature
of California, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Old Joe Lucas, a Portuguese fisherman who used to greet
stagecoaches as they passed through Laguna Beach more than a century
ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Lucas was succeeded in that town by Eiler Larsen (since
immortalized with a statue) and more recently by a character named
No. 1 Archer (it's on his driver's license; his mother couldn't
figure out what to name him).</TE>
<TE>   * The Waving Man, who stood on a street corner in Berkeley for
three decades, waving to passersby and crying out, "Have a good day!"
and "You keep smiling!"</TE>
<TE>   * Larry Green, who became a character on the Howard Stern show
after gaining attention as a guy who held up thoughts-for-the-day on
signs on Melrose Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Now, columnist David Allen of the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin has
found another species of greeter in Upland. He calls him the
Nose-Holding Man. Nose shows up every morning on a Foothill Boulevard
street corner, holding his schnoz as his way of shaming passing
drivers about smog.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a toilet that needs to be flushed," Nose told Allen. "I
hate to sound so damn negative, but who can be positive with this
damn dirty air?"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he should play solitaire.</TE>
<TE>   Stupid criminal tricks: At a video rental outlet, the Long Beach
Press-Telegram's "Crime Watch" reported, "someone broke the skylight.
As he climbed down, he broke his watch and cut himself, leaving blood
on the skylight. After tipping over a video rack, the alarm went off
and scared him away."</TE>
<TE>   Some days are like that.</TE>
<TE>   Expurgated resumes: U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra
Baldwin is the latest official to resign after fibbing about her
academic credentials. I was reminded of my late colleague Nieson
Himmel, who admitted that he also misled employers about his
education when he came West after World War II to seek a newspaper
job--but he misled them in a different way.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, the hard-drinking, poker-playing city editors
wanted nothing to do with "smarty-pants college boys," as they called
them (in so many words). So, Himmel led them to believe he had
nothing but a high school diploma when he was, in fact, a college
graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Dueling careers: I'm always hesitant about accepting an invitation
to speak, partly because I invariably become tongue-tied and partly
because some spectators expect to see Steve Harvey, the movie star.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I spoke during career day at my son's school, Fremont
Elementary. Sure enough, a couple of the kids came looking for the
other Steve. But I got through it OK.</TE>
<TE>   I kept my remarks short and urged the kids to do the talking. And
I remembered the sober advice my son Jamie gave me as a first-grader
when I last appeared at Fremont: "Don't tell any of your jokes or you
might get a time-out."</TE>

<HD>Aid for Ormond Cleanup Pledged</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Board votes to pitch in to help the state
purchase the beach wetlands and win approval from the Public Works
Board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors gave a boost Friday to the state's planned
purchase of Ormond Beach wetlands, pledging unspecified aid for
whatever environmental cleanup might be required.</LD>
<LD>   The board's resolution, which passed 3 to 1, was meant to help the
$9.7-million purchase clear its final hurdle--approval by the state
Public Works Board. Acquisition of the 265 acres from Southern
California Edison was approved by the Coastal Conservancy on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At issue Friday was Edison's refusal to clean up possible
contamination on the property, the site of old underground tanks and
pipelines serving a nearby power plant. County officials wanted to
nudge the purchase along by illustrating their willingness to pitch
in.</LD>
<TE>   However, Supervisor Frank Schillo, a longtime supporter of
wetlands preservation, objected, contending that the resolution was a
dangerous blank check.</TE>
<TE>   "The board has a record of voting for good projects without
hearing about the cost," he said. "I've been burned too many times."</TE>
<TE>   Others argued that the resolution committed no funds and detailed
none of the services the county might provide.</TE>
<TE>   The aid "could be as much or as little as we want," said
Supervisor Steve Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Works Board is to meet Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If it blocks the purchase, the property could go to the next
bidder in line--Occidental Petroleum Corp., which has proposed a
$250-million energy facility for the site.</TE>
<TE>   Both Occidental and the state must by contract meet the same
terms, which include doing any required cleanup themselves, a
spokesman for Edison said.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Conservancy has nearly $1.5 million earmarked for the
job.</TE>
<TE>   Leakage from two underground fuel tanks was cleaned up in 1996,
and state water officials have found some contamination that is not
hazardous, said Robert Gallagher, the county's environmental health
director.</TE>

<HD>Teens Blaze a Trail With Children's Forest</HD>
<DH>The nation's first wilderness set aside for youths gives
them hands-on experience with nature.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RUNNING SPRINGS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The constant screeches of blue jays and ravens can get annoying, say
high school buddies Sarrah Cherry and Rene Martinez, but both have
learned to deal with them.</LD>
<LD>   Cherry and Martinez live in different mountain communities in the
San Bernardino National Forest, but they share the birds as
neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't until the two Rim of the World High School students took
a forestry class with a Children's Forest group that they learned the
value of their plant and animal neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the bird songs sound more like a symphony to the two as they
climb rocks, fight through thick thorn bushes and hike through the
Children's Forest in the woods near Running Springs, a mountain
community of about 5,100 people.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought all we had up here were lots of trees," said Martinez,
17, who lives in Crestline. "I never knew there was so much more."</TE>
<TE>   Both are part of an eight-member trailblazing team, made up of
teens who spent their spring break and summer designing and mapping a
hiking trail, just one of the many activities at the Children's
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 youngsters each year visit the Children's Forest
for a variety of reasons: to learn about the function of dead trees
or plant new ones, train to be firefighters, or wear tennis rackets
as makeshift snowshoes and go on winter hikes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the U.S. Forest Service set aside 3,400 acres of
wilderness within San Bernardino National Forest as the nation's
first Children's Forest. It operates on a $190,000 annual budget from
sponsorships, grants and private donations, along with a few dollars
from the Children's Forest gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   Forty children from around the country christened the new forest
by creating a half-mile hiking trail with Forest Service staff
members and other experts.</TE>
<TE>   It is a simple circular trail with paved roads, accessible for
strollers and wheelchairs, and complete with interpretive signs so
visitors know what is growling or chirping in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   The forest is more than a walk in the woods, staffers say.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs sponsored by the Children's Forest offer credit for
high school students and opportunities for outdoor internships.</TE>
<TE>   Learning programs include an ecosystem management program that
allows young people to participate in research, planning and
implementation of resource management activities, such as snagology,
or the study of dead trees.</TE>
<TE>   Field trips give instructors an ideal backdrop to show biological
connections among plants, animals and people.</TE>
<TE>   Also, children can collect data on vegetation, wildlife, air
quality, soil and water, or harvest ferns and plant trees, said
Timothy Barany, education coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The latest project is the Children's Forest trailblazing team.</TE>
<TE>   The eight members, all students at Rim of the World High School in
Lake Arrowhead, are starting to plot a trail that will lead from
quaint, downtown Running Springs just off California Highway 18 into
the forest.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Chamber of Commerce and other community groups planned
the project in 1998, and the trailblazing team is starting the first
leg. It will stretch from the Children's Forest visitors center to
the original paved trail.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their chance to really have a voice," said Lacy
Goldsmith, director of the Children's Forest. "This is going to be
their trail."</TE>
<TE>   Before starting the trailblazing project, the teenagers learned
about nature and teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   Blindfolded and guided only by a sense of touch and smell, the
eight teenagers navigated through the forest; some tasted bark.
Later, they were divided into two groups.</TE>
<TE>   Four teens worked on grading and flagging, in which they looked
through the sight of an "Abney Scale," similar to a carpenter's
level, to determine the grade of a trail.</TE>
<TE>   The others followed behind wearing 10-pound Global Positioning
System units, which looked like something from "Ghostbusters."</TE>
<TE>   Their job was to locate satellite positions and create a trail
map, similar to how "police use LoJack to locate stolen cars," said
Jay Rizzo, the Children's Forest staff naturalist who taught
youngsters to use the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, construction teams will join the teens, working
alongside them to build the trail. The final phase will be erecting
signs to guide visitors. "This is a very big project," said Joyce
Miraflor, youth leadership program coordinator for the Children's
Forest. "These kids are a part of something special."</TE>
<TE>   The eight teens all live close to the forest in their various
mountain homes. Yet some knew almost nothing about the forest, while
others, like Joseph Scammahorn, are quite knowledgeable.</TE>
<TE>   "We call that deer brush," Scammahorn told the rest of the group,
pointing to a thorny bush sharp enough to rip through jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called that because deer are the only ones that can eat it.
They have tough skin inside their mouth."</TE>
<TE>   The Running Springs 16-year-old has been a Children's Forest
volunteer for more than four years, joining because he was curious
about forest lizards. Now, he knows just about every type of plant,
animal and tree in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Scammahorn frequently takes families on guided hikes, telling them
many odd stories and facts he's learned about the forest. He's
enjoyed his time in the woods, but says his future will not revolve
around deer, pine trees or hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking about becoming an armored truck driver," said
Scammahorn, who also uses the forest as his BMX bike course and
boulder-hopping playground.</TE>
<TE>   The trailblazers joined for various reasons. Some came because of
a general interest in the woods, others because their parents
suggested it.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Rogers, 16, of Green Valley Lake joined last summer because
he feels that since he uses the forest to hike, he might as well know
all he can about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been fun and a good experience," said Rogers, a punk rock
drummer with a garage band, Persona Non Grata.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like his brother Randy, 14, joined to kill time. "Not much
to do in Green Valley Lake," he said. "I'm glad I joined. Beats
staying home and getting in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Travis Garner, Rim of the World High's starting junior varsity
quarterback, believes the trailblazing team will bring him closer to
his father, an avid fisherman.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess this makes me an outdoorsman like him," the 16-year-old
Crestline resident said.</TE>

<HD>Not a Banner Day for Pilot of Small Advertising Plane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small plane made a successful emergency landing in an Edison
International Field parking lot Friday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot and a passenger walked away unhurt from the light-blue
Cessna, said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez and Kevin Uhlich,
senior vice president of business administration at the stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot apparently experienced engine failure or stalled while
pulling an advertising banner, Martinez said. He dumped the orange
mesh commercial banner near the Orange Freeway at Orangewood Avenue,
then touched down about 3:30 p.m. in the parking lot on the west side
of the baseball stadium, near South State College Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   The plane crashed through a small, brick retaining wall.</TE>
<TE>   The nose of the Cessna was smashed, and there was a small fuel
spill.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency landing did not affect Friday night's Angels' game
against the Minnesota Twins, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   However, some of the arriving cars had to be routed around the
plane, which was expected to remain in the parking lot for several
hours.</TE>

<HD>Lifeguards Rally for Old Glory</HD>
<DH>Patriotism: After waiting two years for the county to
replace a corroded flagpole at Topanga Beach, they do it themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were saluting all the way to downtown Los Angeles on Friday when
county lifeguards raised the American flag at a beach near Malibu for
the first time in two years.</LD>
<LD>   Lifeguards Jay Hopkins, Doug Pitts and Scott Davey spent their own
$200 and built a 30-foot flagpole after county officials calculated
that a broken pole at the Topanga Beach lifeguard tower would cost
$5,000 to replace.</LD>
<LD>   "After what happened Sept. 11, we wanted to have the American flag
up on Memorial Day," said Hopkins, a Mar Vista resident who has been
a lifeguard for nearly 20 years. "This being wartime, we felt it was
important."</LD>
<TE>   Hopkins is the regular lifeguard assigned to Topanga Beach, a
popular surfing location at the mouth of Topanga Canyon. Pitts, a
14-year veteran who lives in Venice, is a relief lifeguard there.
Davey, a lifeguard captain in charge of parts of the Santa Monica Bay
shoreline, has patrolled the beaches for 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   Salty sea air corroded the old stainless steel flag pole,
installed at the Topanga tower in 1986. The top 13 feet were so badly
deteriorated with rusty holes that lifeguards were afraid a gust of
wind could snap it.</TE>
<TE>   Tight county budgets kept delaying the pole's replacement. "We'd
missed quite a few holidays flying the flag," Hopkins said. "But with
what's been going on, it seemed like we should have the flag flying
this year on Memorial Day."</TE>
<TE>   So they decided to replace the pole themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On their days off, Hopkins scoured home improvement stores and
plumbing shops for galvanized pipe and Pitts welded parts together.
Davey searched coastal stores before finding a dolphin-shaped weather
vane to top the pole.</TE>
<TE>   Their generosity stunned county officials Friday. Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Topanga Beach, praised their
patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm personally guaranteeing they'll be reimbursed. I'll do it out
of my own pocket, if necessary," Yaroslavsky said. "What they've done
is a tribute to the American spirit.... We all owe them a debt of
gratitude for getting the flag flying at Topanga Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Beachgoers were equally impressed. Veteran surfer Robert Overby, a
house painter who has frequented Topanga Beach for 25 years, said the
flag-raising will help make this weekend's holiday even more
memorable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not pointing fingers at the L.A. County budget, but these
guys went above and beyond the call of duty," he said. "It's
beautiful to see the flag flying again. These guys didn't have to do
this. It says a lot about them."</TE>

<HD>Killer of Pumpkin Thief Found Guilty</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurors convict him of manslaughter, saying Buena
Park man did not intend to kill the teenager who took Halloween
ornament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Buena Park man accused of killing a teenage neighbor who stole a
Halloween decoration from his front porch was convicted Friday of
voluntary manslaughter by a jury that concluded the shooting was an
accident, not murder.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had sought a second-degree murder verdict against Pete
T. Solomona, saying he shot his 17-year-old neighbor in a rage over
having his plastic pumpkin stolen. The jury, however, said it
believed Solomona's story that the gun went off by accident.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors, some of whom said they cried during the deliberations,
believed in the end that Solomona didn't intend to kill the teen.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a terribly, terribly tragic accident," juror Bonnie
Livingston said. "I'm very sad for all the families involved in this.
My heart just cries out for them."</TE>
<TE>   Solomona returns to court in July for sentencing before Judge
Richard F. Toohey. He faces up to 11 years in prison. Had he been
convicted of murder, Solomona would have faced life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting received national attention, and three successive
juries struggled to decide a fair verdict for Solomona. The teen's
family expressed disappointment at the decision but hoped that it
will finally allow them to put the events of Oct. 18, 1999, behind
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what we wanted, it's not what he deserved, but at least
we got some justice here today for our son," said Jon Ketsdever,
father of the slain boy.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Ketsdever was 17 and a popular high school athlete at John
F. Kennedy High School. He was pulling pranks with a group of friends
one night when Solomona confronted the group in the street outside
his home. Solomona, who carried a .357 magnum revolver, told jurors
that he was banging the gun against the roof of Ketsdever's car,
trying to get the boy's attention, when the gun went off. Prosecutors
alleged that Solomona fired at Ketsdever in a rage.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona, who is also popular in the neighborhood, sat with his
head bowed as jurors read the verdict. His wife, Fui, wiped away
tears as bailiffs led Solomona to a courthouse holding cell.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting a not-guilty verdict," she said. "I know my
husband is disappointed too. He wants to be with his family."</TE>
<TE>   Solomona, 51, was convicted of murder at his first trial, but a
judge threw that decision out, citing errors in jury instructions. A
second trial, in December, ended in a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   At his third trial, jurors deliberated four days before reaching a
decision. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Carlisle-Raines said the
repeated trials made the case difficult to prosecute. "It's always
hard for witnesses to have to come into court over and over again,"
she said. "I am glad for the family that there's been a resolution."</TE>
<TE>   However, defense attorney Milton Grimes said he would file papers
asking for another trial, alleging misconduct on the part of
prosecutors and disagreements over jury instructions. Grimes said the
misconduct involved argumentative behavior and mischaracterization of
facts--charges that a prosecutor called "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "I and the family were clearly expecting a not-guilty verdict,"
Grimes said. "Pete Solomona did not commit a crime; he committed a
mistake in judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that even if Solomona had not intended to kill
Ketsdever, he showed criminal intent by confronting the boy with a
loaded weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous juries, panelists on Friday said they avoided
taking informal polls during deliberations for fear that jurors would
cement their opinions and "dig in their heels," jury foreman Richard
Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   Although jurors felt that Ketsdever's death was an accident, that
was not the basis of their verdict. Their instructions asked them to
consider whether Solomona's actions were so dangerous that they could
be expected to cause death.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody on that group felt that he intended to kill Brandon
Ketsdever or that he wanted to kill Brandon Ketsdever," Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the shooting, Ketsdever's parents, Jon and Jessie,
have separated, and relatives say it has been all but impossible for
them to move on with their lives. "We've all been living in hell,"
said Jeff Ketsdever, the boy's uncle.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona's family said they too have suffered. "It's been very
difficult. His family wants him home," Fui Solomona said of her
husband. "It's been difficult financially too. My husband has lost
his job, and we've lost our home."</TE>

<LD>U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta announced a
$75-million Federal Transit Administration grant Friday to the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District to help bring BART commuter
trains to San Francisco International Airport.</LD>

efforts to promote mobility and reduce congestion through public
transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Airport Extension Project is an 8.7-mile,
four-station addition to the BART system. The project consists of a
7.5-mile mainline extension from the existing BART station at Colma
to Millbrae. An additional 1.2-mile spur will take BART trains
directly to a station adjoining the new International Terminal at the
airport.</LD>

<LD>San Fernando Valley secession backers said Friday that they plan to
challenge Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the campaign against
breaking up Los Angeles, to a series of one-on-one debates throughout
the city.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn did not respond immediately to the challenge, but a
consultant for the anti-secession campaign said he expected there
would be a number of debates through the summer and fall.</LD>
<LD>   Also on Friday, the harbor area secession proposal--long troubled
by questions about its budget--won what could be a last-minute
reprieve when the head of the Local Agency Formation Commission said
he would request more time to review it. If the commission agrees, a
public vote on the idea may be delayed until 2004.</LD>
<TE>   The ballot measure on Valley secession, meanwhile, will be put to
a vote Nov. 5. To prevail, it needs the support of a majority of
Valley residents and a majority of the voters citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the public decide what kind of government we're going to have
here in Los Angeles," said Richard Katz, a former assemblyman who
represented the Valley from 1980 to 1996. He is a member of the board
of directors of the secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be in every neighborhood so that voters throughout Los
Angeles will have a clear voice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Katz's comments Friday at the Valley Municipal Building in Van
Nuys were repeatedly interrupted by hecklers, including a group of
elderly women, and by the wailing sirens of ambulances leaving the
fire station across the street.</TE>
<TE>   As Katz trumpeted the Valley's breakaway, joining with other area
leaders in hailing the benefits of independence, he was interrupted
by a vocal dissenter.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't speak for me, buster!" hollered Lillian Kohn, an
81-year-old great-grandmother from North Hollywood who thumped her
cane for emphasis. She was part of an outspoken cluster of Gray
Panthers who have joined the anti-secession group One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 secession opponents protested at the campaign kickoff,
where they were countered by about 40 secession supporters, many of
them waving red-white-and-blue signs.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides skirmished as people jostled to get their posters in
front of television cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The event's message was one that secession backers have delivered
many times: Valley residents--as well as those on the other side of
the hill--will enjoy more accountable and less costly government if
Los Angeles breaks apart.</TE>
<TE>   "The independence of the San Fernando Valley will transform one
sullen and dissatisfied city, saddled with an unresponsive and
arrogant City Hall, into two great cities with governments much
closer to the people," said state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand
Oaks), who helped change California law to allow voters to decide
secession proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Several Latino supporters who live in the Valley also spoke,
saying that secession would benefit the impoverished reaches of the
northeast Valley. That point is an especially sensitive one, as
secession advocates have bitterly disputed the suggestion that their
cause is motivated by a desire to break away from the minority
communities of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Recent census figures show that the largest ethnic group in the
Valley city would be Latinos, who would make up 43% of the
population, followed by whites with 41%. The Valley city would have a
far smaller percentage of African Americans than the city of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, a well-known black writer and activist denounced
Valley secession backers' efforts to promote their cause in
South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession will raise taxes and gut public services," said Earl
Ofari Hutchinson, president of the National Alliance for Positive
Action, in a statement. He pledged a campaign to educate people about
the "political and financial disaster of secession to black and
Latino residents."</TE>
<TE>   In Van Nuys, secession leader Richard Close said he planned to
issue the debate challenge to Hahn next week. Hahn advisor Bill
Carrick responded that the mayor's L.A. United campaign would
participate in many debates.</TE>
<TE>   "There are scores and scores of invitations coming in from all
over the city," he said. "I think things are going to rock along here
with ever-increasing intensity."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine
said he would ask the commission to delay its vote on placing the
harbor secession measure on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine, who just two weeks ago said a harbor city would not be
able to survive financially without Los Angeles, said he wanted extra
time to review information that might show otherwise. He also would
examine new figures submitted by the city of Los Angeles, which is
arguing that the area cannot survive and should not be split off.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mardesich, co-chairman of the harbor secession effort, said
he was relieved to hear that the proposal, considered all but dead,
might be revived.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing the new material could mean that harbor cityhood would
go before voters in 2004 instead of this fall, as proponents
initially had hoped.</TE>

<HD>UC Nurses Drop Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurses at the University of California's five medical centers
canceled a planned strike after reaching a tentative agreement Friday
on a new contract</LD>
<LD>   Union officials called the agreement historic and predicted that
it would have a major impact on recruitment and retention of nurses,
not just in the prestigious medical system but across the state.</LD>
<LD>   Under the accord, which will be voted on June 3 by the system's
8,000 nurses, UC would pay nurses based on seniority and boost
salaries an average of 19% to 25% over the next three years. It would
do away with the merit-based pay system nurses have battled.</LD>
<TE>   "This will make life in the hospital better for everyone, patient
and nurse," said Maxine Terk, a nurse in the neonatal intensive care
unit at UCLA. "This is a historic event. Never before have we
achieved such monumental advancement for nurses and patient care."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's celebrations marked a dramatic about-face in negotiations
that had been marked by anger, bitterness and charges of unfair
practices on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the nurses--who work in medical centers at UC
Davis, UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Francisco and UC San Diego--had voted
to authorize a one-day walkout Wednesday that could have been
followed by an open-ended strike.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials had said the action might force them to close trauma
centers and had begun seeking replacement nurses, offering wages of
$1,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   UC also had requested a temporary restraining order against the
strike.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and more than 40 members of
the Legislature signed a letter to the UC administration calling on
them to resolve the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said that did not play a significant role in the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "What got us to an agreement was us working out our differences
across the bargaining table," said UC spokesman Paul Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the accord, the California Nurses Assn. agreed to drop
its unfair practices charge, and the university said it would
withdraw its request for a restraining order and drop its unfair
labor charge.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Joseph P. Mullinix, senior vice president for
business and finance for the university, said the agreement "benefits
everyone, especially patients."</TE>
<TE>   A major sticking point in negotiations had been the university's
desire to keep in place a merit-based pay system. The nurses union
said merit pay penalizes senior nurses.</TE>
<TE>   In a compromise, the university will do away with the merit system
by offering lump-sum rewards for good performance. Both sides also
reached a compromise on staffing ratios.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the nurses union, which
represents nearly 45,000 nurses across the state, said it now will
now try to "get every other hospital to do this too."</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is the answer to the nursing shortage," she said.
"We're going to be rolling out a whole program."</TE>

<HD>Foes of Santa Paula Project Miss the Vote</HD>
<DH>Development: SOAR fails to get enough valid signatures on a
petition for a ballot initiative against the proposed 2,250-home
suburb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slow-growth activists in Santa Paula appear to have lost their bid
for a November ballot measure aimed at scuttling a proposed
2,250-home suburb northwest of the city.</LD>
<LD>   In a scramble to meet an unofficial May 15 deadline, they fell 77
voter signatures short of the 1,074 valid signatures needed to
qualify for the ballot, Ventura County elections officials said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Activists affiliated with the countywide group Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources submitted a petition with 1,406 signatures.
But nearly one-third were disqualified, in large part because they
came from city residents who were not registered to vote.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, the activists had more time than they thought to
gather the signatures. After originally specifying May 15 as a cutoff
date, county officials later said they could guarantee the issue
would make the ballot if the signatures were turned in by May 28.</TE>
<TE>   Had activists known they had two weeks longer, they argued, they
would have been more careful about who signed the petition. County
elections officials have said they cannot add signatures to the
petition once submitted.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-growth measure would have amended the General Plan for
the blue-collar city of 30,000, prohibiting Arizona-based Pinnacle
Development Group from building upscale homes, schools, hotels and
stores in a 5,413-acre canyon area.</TE>
<TE>   Because the development area falls outside the city's growth
boundaries, Pinnacle needs voter approval to build its project. Those
redrawn boundaries were promoted by SOAR and approved by voters two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the developer and its local backers have gathered enough
signatures to place their own initiative on the November ballot, one
that would amend the city's growth boundaries to include the canyon.
If that measure is approved, the City Council could sign off on
Pinnacle's plans without voter support.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Procter, a key backer of the slow-growth initiative, said
activists are unsure if there is a way to resurrect their ballot
measure this year.</TE>
<TE>   They could regroup for a second signature-gathering effort over
the holiday weekend, or try to convince three of five City Council
members to place their proposal on the ballot without the signatures.
Both options are longshots. In any case, they will focus on defeating
the developer's initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Lucero, a spokeswoman for the developer, defended the
planned suburb, saying it would be an economic boon to a cash-poor,
stagnating city. Of SOAR's failure to qualify a counter-initiative,
she said, "believe me, we are happy."</TE>

<HD>Visitors Bureau Spent Lavishly</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Some city officials, taxpayer advocates criticize
L.A. agency, which announces reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has spent nearly $3
million a year on travel, food and entertainment in its quest to
promote the city, once renting a hall in England's Kensington Palace
to woo airline executives and spending $84,000 to entertain travel
agents and others at the Wimbledon tennis tournament, documents show.</LD>
<LD>   The bureau, which is largely funded by the city, also spent
$835,000 on a gala dinner for travel agents in Glasgow, Scotland,
where Natalie Cole and her orchestra played for 3,000 VIPs, according
to bureau records released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show city officials and bureau members travel in
high style, staying in expensive hotels and dining in trendy
restaurants. For the Wimbledon event, for example, one bureau
delegate stayed five nights in an $854-per-night suite at London's
Four Seasons hotel, paid for by the bureau.</LD>
<TE>   The records sparked criticism from some city officials and
taxpayer advocates, who said they viewed the spending as lavish.</TE>
<TE>   "Even by Los Angeles standards this is an absolute outrage," said
Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. "At a time
when the city is claiming poverty, to waste money in this way--heads
should roll."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, vice chair of the City Council Budget
Committee, said he found the expenses "troubling," because the city
gave the bureau about $18 million in hotel bed taxes to promote
tourism and line up conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "Expenditures such as these justifiably cause taxpayers to be
skeptical," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit agency released heavily edited expense documents for
specific trips three weeks after The Times requested the papers. They
covered a three-year period beginning in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Other city records indicate the bureau has spent about $2.9
million a year on travel for its people and clients during the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   The same day the bureau released its documents, it also announced
it was taking steps to adopt reforms, including changes in spending
policies for trade missions and the bureau's bonus and compensation
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau President George Kirkland and Alan Rothenberg, chairman of
the bureau's Board of Directors, were out of town and not available
for interviews Friday, a spokesman said. They left behind statements
indicating the goal of the reforms will be to improve the bureau's
performance at attracting conventions and tourists.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview Rothenberg defended Kirkland.</TE>
<TE>   "He does what he thinks will bring business to Los Angeles and he
does it well," Rothenberg said. "I've found unless you have a
monopoly, you have to spend money to make money."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the last year for which bureau
budget records were available, the agency received $17.5 million from
the city in hotel bed taxes. The remainder of the bureau's
$27.9-million budget comes mainly from membership dues.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the bureau reported to the city that it spent $1.39
million in staff travel expenses, of which $1.1 million came from
city taxes. The travel expenses cover domestic and international
sales trips.</TE>
<TE>   Also that year, the bureau spent $2.1 million on client
accommodations, entertainment and travel. Records show bureau
officials favor restaurants owned by Wolfgang Puck and four-star
hotels. The bureau also racked up a limousine service bill of
$507,000.</TE>
<TE>   More than $700,000 was spent that year on food and beverages.
Expenses were similar for the other years.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 trade mission to England, which featured attendance at
the Wimbledon championships, was one of the most expensive mounted by
the bureau in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The city delegation was led by bureau President Kirkland and
included city Airport Commission President John Agoglia, Airport
Department assistant administrator Phil Depoian, city Chief
Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton, two bureau board members and three
other bureau officials.</TE>
<TE>   The city Airport Department, which pays the bureau $3 million a
year to promote city airports, paid $7,400 for each round-trip
business-class ticket to London used by Deaton, Agoglia and Depoian.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland and other bureau officials received complimentary tickets
from the airlines that are members of the bureau. Officials would not
disclose the value of the tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland, Agoglia, Deaton and the board members brought their
wives, but they were responsible for their own airfares.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel lodgings ranged from $419 to $854 per night, with the latter
a suite that also included space for entertaining and conducting
interviews. The hotel bills were paid by the bureau from its
membership dues.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau declined to identify who stayed in the suite and other
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Expensive hotel bookings are not unusual. Bureau delegates on a
trip to Germany the year before spent up to $616 per room per night.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of meetings with travel magazine and newspaper writers
and briefings in England, the city and bureau officials and their
wives went to Kensington Palace, where the British royal family still
maintains apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau spent $11,600 to rent a hall and provide a dinner for
the city delegation and select airline executives.</TE>
<TE>   The event was held "to promote LAX and the potential of Ontario
International Airport as an emerging passenger and cargo gateway,"
bureau records indicate.</TE>
<TE>   On the third day of the trip, the bureau spent $84,000 in city tax
funds to host 25 English tour operators, as well as the Los Angeles
delegation, for a day at the Wimbledon tennis championships.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to attending a center court match, the group went to a
bureau prematch reception and then to an after-match tea.</TE>
<TE>   The event was held to "strengthen L.A.'s visibility," bureau
officials said, adding afterward that Los Angeles was included in 15%
more tour operator brochures.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Weiss said he wanted to see the proof that the tennis
match was a worthwhile taxpayer expense.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a logic to showing someone a good time at a fancy
foreign location in a way that helps promote dollars on the ground in
Los Angeles, somebody please explain it to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Wimbledon and Kensington Palace events were costly,
their expense was a fraction of the $835,000 spent by the bureau in
1997 to fete 3,000 members of the American Society of Travel Agents
in Glasgow. City taxes provided $186,000 of the cost of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland said in a statement that reforms will call for "creating
policy guidelines with respect to trade missions."</TE>
<TE>   The 10 foreign sales missions held in the last three years are an
important part of boosting tourism in Los Angeles, the bureau
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' top seven markets, including Mexico, Japan and
Britain, generated 3.7 million international visitors in 2000 and
nearly $1.8 million in spending, according to the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lesa Slaughter, a member of the city Convention Center
Commission, said the bureau's spending is hard to justify when its
performance is as poor as it has been.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, 42 major conventions have canceled in Los
Angeles, the most scratches the bureau has experienced, officials
said. As a result, the Convention Center is operating at just 72%
capacity. The Times reported April 29 that the bureau had paid
$225,000 in bonuses to its sales staff and executives for booking
events at the city-owned Convention Center even though 20 of the
events cited to justify the payments were later canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau also has missed goals for boosting tourism to Los
Angeles in two of the last three years, records show.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a perception problem regarding the spending and they
don't have the performance to back it up," Slaughter said. "What it
raises is who is watching the cash register."</TE>

<HD>Police Chase Down Five Men Suspected in Brea Bank Robbery</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Five men were arrested Friday in Brea after a robbery at a Wells
Fargo bank and a police pursuit of apartment complexes and an
elementary school.</LD>
<LD>   A motorcycle officer suffered minor injuries when he crashed
during the pursuit, said Brea Police Lt. Martin Needham. Still, the
officer managed to capture one suspect after chasing him over
numerous block walls. A second suspect was detained at the crash
scene.</LD>
<LD>   A third suspect was cornered by police dogs in an apartment he had
broken into to escape, police said. The man was bitten by one of the
dogs and treated for minor injuries by paramedics at the Brea City
Jail, Needham said.</LD>
<TE>   A fourth man was caught after running onto the Country Hills
Elementary School campus while classes were in session, he said. The
last suspect was arrested during a search of the area, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The men are suspected of holding up the bank branch on South State
College Boulevard at 2:45 p.m., then fleeing in a sports utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Brea police officers spotted the vehicle about a mile from the
bank. The vehicle crashed during a brief chase and its occupants
scattered.</TE>

<HD>Chargers' Stadium Is Target of Suit</HD>
<DH>San Diego: Attorney claims NFL is trying to 'extort'
taxpayers into paying for a new football arena. City says the lawsuit
is frivolous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>An attorney who has been involved in other controversies over public
funding for professional sports teams sued Friday to block city
officials from holding what he claims are secret meetings with the
Chargers over the professional football team's desire for a new
stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyer Michael Aguirre also accused Mayor Dick Murphy of not
standing up to the National Football League.</LD>
<LD>   The former federal prosecutor turned civil litigator said the
league is attempting to "extort" San Diego taxpayers into paying for
a stadium by threatening to encourage the Chargers to move to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Aguirre said that Murphy, a former Superior Court judge, should
"act more like Rudy Giuliani and less like Mr. Rogers."</TE>
<TE>   At Murphy's request, a committee of city staffers and private
citizens talked to the Chargers about the stadium issue and what the
team needed to do to remain financially competitive with teams in
larger media markets.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre demanded that information exchanged at those meetings be
made public. He also argued that any discussion by the City Council
of the Chargers issue should be in open session, not behind closed
doors, as suggested by one council member this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting the San Diego Chargers on the same economic footing as
other teams in the NFL is not a legitimate function of government,"
Aguirre said. "It's a waste of taxpayer funds."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy declined to comment on Aguirre's assertions, but City Atty.
Casey Gwinn said the lawsuit is frivolous.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the citizens of San Diego are tired of government
by litigation," Gwinn said.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen lawsuits were filed to block construction of a downtown
ballpark for the Padres baseball team. The suits put the project two
years behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Also, litigation by Aguirre and others sought, but failed, to
block expansion of Qualcomm Stadium, where both teams now play, in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the publicly funded expansion--which made the
stadium eligible to host a lucrative Super Bowl--the Chargers agreed
to remain in San Diego until 2020.</TE>
<TE>   But a clause in the contract allows the team to shop for a new
city after 2003 if it faces financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego, in turn, retains the right to match any offer made by
another city.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his litigation, Aguirre said he will seek financial
documents from the Chargers to see if the team is close to exceeding
the NFL salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   The team's contract with the city says the Chargers are not
eligible to look for a new city until they break the professional
football limit on player pay.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fabiani, a lawyer hired by the Chargers to seek a new stadium
either in San Diego or Los Angeles, dismissed Aguirre's allegations
that the city was violating the state's open government laws.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chargers are committed to keeping the public as informed as
we possibly can," he said. "That's why we announced these
discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Fabiani repeated the Chargers' position that they would prefer to
remain in San Diego but might pursue other options if the team's
financial performance does not improve.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility would be a move to a stadium that billionaire
Philip Anschutz wants to build near Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>

<LD>More than 300 train riders traveling from Santa Barbara to Los
Angeles County got a jolt Friday when an Amtrak Surfliner slammed
into an abandoned truck on the tracks just outside Moorpark.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt, like, a shock, and then the train lurched as the
conductor put the emergency brake on and then dust went flying," said
passenger Tulley Brown, 70, of La Crescenta.</LD>
<LD>   Truck driver Michael Vang, 39, of Palmdale had been heading home
on California 118 when he failed to see that several cars in front of
him had stopped for the passing train.</LD>
<TE>   Vang slammed on his brakes, swerved and came to rest on the
tracks. His company truck stalled, so he ran, police said. He was not
hurt.</TE>

<HD>Outlook Sunny and Crowded for Holiday Weekend</HD>
<DH>Memorial Day: Freeways and recreation spots are packed as
travelers get an early start. Train crash mars Friday commute.</DH>

<LD>Jammed roadways, beaches and campgrounds Friday in Ventura County
marked the beginning of a cool and sunny Memorial Day weekend, a
holiday generally regarded as the kickoff of summer.</LD>
<LD>   The California Highway Patrol started its "maximum enforcement
period" about 6 p.m. Friday. Officials said that every available
officer will be patrolling the county's freeways for speeders and
drunk drivers throughout the three-day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   An onslaught of commuters and vacationers filled the Ventura and
Ronald Reagan freeways Friday evening, but officers reported no major
problems.</LD>
<TE>   More than 300 Amtrak passengers traveling from Santa Barbara to
Los Angeles County got a jolt Friday afternoon when their train
slammed into an abandoned truck on the tracks near Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt a shock, and then the train lurched as the conductor put
the emergency brake on, and then dust went flying," said passenger
Tulley Brown, 70, of La Crescenta.</TE>
<TE>   Truck driver Michael Vang of Palmdale was heading home on
eastbound California 118 when he failed to notice that several cars
in front of him had stopped for the oncoming train near Hitch Road.</TE>
<TE>   Vang slammed on his brakes, swerved and came to rest on the
tracks. His welding company work truck stalled, so he got out and
fled for his life, officers said. Vang, 39, was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   National Weather Service officials forecast low clouds and fog in
the mornings but clear, sunny afternoons through Monday, with high
temperatures expected in the low 70s--perfect weather for outdoor
activities.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the county's campgrounds filled at a record pace and by
Wednesday, no beach spots for overnight campers were available, said
Pam Gallo, operations supervisor for the county Parks Department.</TE>
<TE>   Many Memorial Day commemorations will be held throughout the
county to honor the nation's veterans, as well as those who lost
their lives in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize the sacrifices that not only the men and women in
uniform have made, but those in public service who have answered the
call in the defense of this nation in its current battle against
terrorism," said Navy Capt. Mark Swaney, who will speak at the annual
memorial held at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a list of some scheduled observances:</TE>
<TE>   * Camarillo: Conejo Mountain Memorial Park, 2052 Howard Road. The
service will begin at 11 a.m. and include a flag ceremony, firing
detail, a tribute to Gold Star Mothers and a performance by the Air
National Guard Brass Quintet.</TE>
<TE>   * Fillmore: Bardsdale Cemetery, 1698 S. Sespe St. An 11 a.m.
service will include performers and memorial addresses.</TE>
<TE>   * Moorpark: Veterans Memorial, Moorpark and Los Angeles avenues.

Post 502 and Boy Scouts Troop 604.</TE>

include an address by Marine veteran Pete Duncan, who served during
the Vietnam War.</TE>

Activities will begin at 10:30 a.m. with speeches by Mayor Manuel
Lopez and military personnel.</TE>

officer during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   * Simi Valley: Simi Valley Public Cemetery, 1461 Thompson Lane.
Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10049 will hold a 10 a.m. ceremony with

<HD>O.L. 'Ollie' Weeks, 90; Grower Won Honors for Breeding
Roses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>O.L. "Ollie" Weeks, who took a rented horse, a plow and an acre and
became one of California's largest and most reputable rose growers,
died May 11 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   His death came after several hospitalizations this year for heart
problems, said his wife, Verona.</LD>
<LD>   Weeks founded the business that became Weeks Wholesale Rose Grower
in Santa Ana in 1937. With his wife, he ran what grew into a
multimillion-dollar enterprise spread over 250 acres in the Kern
County town of Wasco, for almost 50 years, until retiring in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   A leading breeder who was partial to red blooms, Weeks created
many award-winning roses known for their beauty and robust growth.</TE>
<TE>   A number, including an unusual lavender rose called Paradise, were
named All-America Rose Selections, the Oscars of the rose world.</TE>
<TE>   Texas-born Weeks was an unpretentious, plain-spoken man who was
happiest wearing work clothes and driving a tractor over his land.
"He was a hillbilly ... and he made no apologies for that," said
Verona Weeks, who was married to him for 64 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although his elegant creations became known to rose fanciers
around the world, he "could have cared less" about the attention,
said Harold Young, editor and publisher of the trade publication
Pacific Coast Nurseryman, who knew Weeks for more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was driven by his love of roses," Young added. "They were his
hobby and his livelihood."</TE>
<TE>   Weeks left the little town of Rotan, Texas, when he was 3 months
old and settled in California's Imperial Valley with his parents, who
raised cotton. By age 12, he was working summers at a nursery, where
one of his jobs was packing roses for shipment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, he was a production foreman for the citrus processor
Treesweet Products Co. in Santa Ana when he started growing roses as
a sideline.</TE>
<TE>   He married Verona, a secretary for the Army Corps of Engineers, in
1938. She is his only immediate survivor.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II ended and the Santa Ana Army Air Base where
Verona worked closed, the Weekses decided to pursue roses full time.
By 1952, they had joined other rose growers in Chino. When the
post-war housing shortage made land too precious there, they moved
their growing operation to agriculture-friendly Wasco, near
Bakersfield, which was fast becoming the rose-growing capital of the
state.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, Weeks Wholesale Rose Grower harvested and sold more
than 2 million plants a year. It had about 300 acres in cultivation
in Wasco and Chino, and grew more than 200 varieties.</TE>
<TE>   The company developed a reputation for quality, honesty and
personal service that extended to notes to customers handwritten by
Verona that often contained poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a very loyal customer base," said Tom Carruth, an
award-winning hybridizer who joined the company a few years after the
Weekses sold it. "They established an independent rose nursery, which
was one of the most successful in the United States, especially for a
mom-and-pop organization."</TE>
<TE>   Rose breeding is a tedious affair that can take as long as 10
years of patient tending of thousands of rose seedlings before
finding one worth cultivating. Weeks produced more than 40 new roses
during his five decades in the business.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade starting in 1954, Weeks collaborated with breeder
Herbert C. Swim to produce a number of roses that have endured in
today's marketplace. The most famous is Mr. Lincoln, a quintessential
red rose, long-stemmed and rich in fragrance, which has been a
bestseller since its introduction in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Another Swim-Weeks effort resulted in Angel Face, which Carruth
described as a breakthrough for its novel lavender color. It was the
first of that hue to earn the All-America Rose Selections honor, one
of six that the two men would win together.</TE>
<TE>   After his partnership with Swim ended, Weeks continued to breed
winning roses on his own. Among his best known are Perfume Delight, a
deep pink beauty with a heavenly scent, and Paradise, a lavender rose
with a dark plum blush. They were among his All-America Rose
Selections winners, which also included standouts named Arizona, Bing
Crosby and Sweet Surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks sold his company in 1985 to a group that included former
employees of Armstrong Nurseries. It is currently owned by
International Garden Products, a family of horticultural companies.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Weekses sold the last 28 acres from their rose
business and donated the $4.3 million in proceeds to Good Samaritan,
where Ollie Weeks had been treated for esophageal cancer in 1996. The
hospital will use the donation to expand and upgrade its cancer
treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks, who once said he found "thundering tranquillity" in working
the land, continued to breed roses for a few years after his
retirement. He spent much of his time in pursuit of what his wife
called "the definitive yellow" rose. Three of his last
creations--including a brilliant yellow one called Canary
Diamond--will be on the market later this year.</TE>

<HD>Raid in Afghanistan Kills 1</HD>
<DH>Asia: Coalition seizes 50 people and items at a suspected
enemy refuge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. military officials said coalition soldiers killed one person and
captured about 50 on Friday in a raid on a compound that intelligence
sources identified as a refuge for senior Taliban and Al Qaeda
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "Items of intelligence value were found," along with weapons and a
large amount of cash, said Capt. Steve O'Connor, a spokesman for the
U.S. military in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Officials were trying to determine the identities of the
detainees.</LD>
<TE>   Two others from the compound, west of Kandahar, were wounded in
the raid, which lasted more than eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   No coalition soldiers were injured, said Maj. A.C. Roper, a U.S.
military spokesman in the southern city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Roper said 150 soldiers were involved in the mission--half from
the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division based in Ft. Campbell,
Ky., and half from Special Operations forces. He would not specify
whether other countries contributed troops, although Canadian
officials said their nation did.</TE>
<TE>   Roper said experts were evaluating the confiscated items.</TE>
<TE>   There might have been more people in the compound than the 50 men
taken into custody, possibly including women, O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were killed and more than 30 captured in a similar
raid north of Kandahar on May 12. The U.S. military has not finished
processing those detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's attack came as British commanders said Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters--who have not gathered in large forces since a major
battle with the coalition in March--are expected to turn to smaller
insurgency tactics.</TE>
<TE>   A senior British military official said foes of the U.S.-led
coalition are likely to try vehicle bombs, drive-by shootings and
other tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and Taliban forces are thought to have broken up into
small groups and gone into hiding since coalition troops launched
Operation Anaconda in early March and waged a major battle against
enemy fighters farther north in mountainous eastern Afghanistan. Some
are thought to have crossed the border into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The British military official said those who fled might filter
back into Afghanistan to conduct attacks on coalition forces or try
to disrupt next month's loya jirga, a meeting of Afghan leaders to
choose a new government for the nation.</TE>

<HD>Support for Argentina's Duhalde Shrinks in His Peronist
Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Unable to persuade even members of his party to support a series of
economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund,
Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde faced new doubts this week about
his ability to govern this teetering South American country.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the governor of Buenos Aires province, Felipe Sola,
sounded the latest note of discord within the ruling Peronist party.
Sola said he would insist on bypassing Duhalde's government so he
could negotiate directly with the IMF, which is asking for draconian
budget cuts in provincial spending as a condition for emergency loans
to Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important that Buenos Aires explain a few things directly to
the IMF," Sola said. "The country is under siege because of the
mistakes" made by Duhalde's economic team.</LD>
<TE>   The struggle between Duhalde and his party is expected to come to
a head Monday when he is to attend a summit conference with Peronist
governors in rural La Pampa province. Peronists control most of the
nation's largest provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Juan Carlos Romero of Salta province, another Peronist, added
his voice Friday to the chorus of politicians criticizing Duhalde.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said he was troubled by the "uncertain direction" of
Duhalde's rule, which has been marked by flip-flops and policy
failures as the president wrestles to undo the knot of Argentina's
economic crash.</TE>
<TE>   Since he was appointed president by the National Assembly in
January, it has become clear that Duhalde serves at the pleasure of
the most powerful leaders of the Peronist party.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina is entering its fifth year of recession, with the
official unemployment rate at 25%, its devalued currency worth less
than a third of its January value, and inflation galloping toward an
annual rate of 90%.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF and other international agencies have been reluctant to
grant Argentina further loans after it defaulted on part of its
$141-billion public debt.</TE>
<TE>   After returning Wednesday from a trip to Europe, Duhalde appeared
eager to bring to a close a months-long effort to implement the IMF
reforms. He said he would step down if the measures weren't approved
quickly, but his spokesman said a day later that the president wasn't
threatening to resign.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Peronists struggled to get a quorum in the
Chamber of Deputies to vote on the proposed revisions to "the law of
economic supervision," which punishes executives whose business
decisions harm "the national interest."</TE>
<TE>   The law has recently been invoked by judges investigating whether
bankers illegally withdrew billions of dollars from the troubled
banking system. The IMF made repeal or revision of the law a
condition for further aid, arguing that the law discourages
investment in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But Duhalde's opponents see overturning the law as an unpatriotic
surrender to outside interests.</TE>
<TE>   When the vote was taken, a dozen Peronist deputies had broken with
Duhalde and voted against his proposed reforms. The measure was
defeated 102 to 99.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Begins 'Routine' Missile Tests</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Tensions between India and Pakistan rose another notch, with Pakistan
today launching the first in a weekend series of test missiles and
the release of a letter Friday from India's prime minister to
President Bush saying his nation was running out of patience.</LD>
<LD>   India and Pakistan routinely test their missiles and notify each
other according to an agreement designed to avoid misunderstandings.</LD>
<LD>   "We have notified neighboring countries, including India, about
these tests," Pakistani Information Secretary Anwar Mahmood said
Friday in Islamabad. "We have also informed India that these tests
have nothing to do with the current situation."</LD>
<TE>   In New Delhi, Indian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao
also said the tests are "routine and not central to the current
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Launch of the medium-range missile today "demonstrated Pakistan's
determination to defend itself, strengthen national security and
consolidate strategic balance in the region," a statement released by
the military said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials said the government in Islamabad, Pakistan's
capital, had said that the tests would involve short- and
medium-range missiles and would run today through Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive rhetoric has increased recently between the nations,
locked in a standoff over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is
divided between them. Two of their three wars have been fought over
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Indian and Pakistani forces traded heavy fire overnight in
Kashmir. The nuclear-armed neighbors had exchanged deadly shelling
and threats of war Thursday, with New Delhi calling for a "decisive
victory against the enemy" and Islamabad warning of retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Rao said Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee wrote this week to
Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin stressing that India was losing patience.</TE>
<TE>   "The prime minister has said that India has exercised restraint in
the face of grave provocations from the Pakistani side and also
taking into account requests by the international community that we
should exercise patience, but we see no change in Pakistan's
attitude," Rao said of the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Tension escalated last week after suspected Pakistan-based
militants raided an army camp in the Indian-controlled portion of
Kashmir, killing 34 people.</TE>

<HD>Fear, Optimism Compete as Lesotho Returns to the Polls</HD>
<DH>Africa: Residents are wary as they recall the chaos that
ensued after 1998 elections. Political analysts say things are
different now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MASERU, Lesotho</DL>
<LD>No public holiday has been declared for today's general election in
this southern African kingdom. But Tsepo Ntabe, owner of a
well-stocked pharmacy here in the capital, plans to empty the cash
register, send his staff home and lock the iron bars that barricade
the store's windows and door.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm worried," said the 60-year-old Ntabe, who has reason to fret.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, following the last national election, dozens of
businesses in Maseru were destroyed as supporters of disgruntled
opposition parties rioted, claiming that the vote had been rigged.
Ntabe's original pharmacy was gutted, costing him about $125,000.</LD>
<TE>   Chaos reigned when the nation's security forces took sides, with
some rising in mutiny against the government. Scores of people were
killed when troops from neighboring South Africa and other countries,
acting under the auspices of the Southern African Development
Community, intervened to restore order.</TE>
<TE>   So, as Lesotho citizens prepare to vote today, it is no surprise
that they remain anxious over the prospect of violence. Peace and
economic stability top the concerns of many here.</TE>
<TE>   While residents worry, however, local politicians, foreign
diplomats and regional analysts say they are confident that the
election will go smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "All the indications on the ground are to the effect that we do
not have even the slightest semblance of the types of tensions that
we had in 1998," said Mokhele Rantsie Likate, commissioner for the
country's Independent Electoral Commission. "So we are expecting it
to be very successful."</TE>
<TE>   About 831,000 of 900,000 eligible voters are registered to cast
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   A new voting system, the product of lengthy South Africa-led
negotiations between Lesotho's wrangling parties, is being touted as
a example of finding an African solution to an African problem, an
approach many Western governments have long argued best serves the
continent.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign observers are hoping that a successful election in
Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa, might help discourage
nondemocratic trends that have been seen recently in southern Africa.
Elections in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Madagascar have raised concerns
over incumbent parties manipulating the rules to ensure reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to see in this election in particular is the
establishment of a precedent, where they can have a good, clean
election here, build a track record ... and then carry the trend
forward," U.S. Ambassador Robert Geers Loftis said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the revamped electoral procedure, Lesotho's National
Assembly has been expanded from 80 to 120 seats. Eighty of the seats
in the lower house will go to the winners of the popular vote in each
race; the remainder will be distributed proportionally to parties
based on the number of votes they get. The system is designed to give
opposition groups a greater chance of getting seats and to encourage
party coalitions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fairly complicated formula, but it does guarantee that no
[party] can completely dominate the Parliament," Loftis said.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to ensure transparency in the vote, the electoral
commission has requested that the 380 accredited observers remain in
place until all ballots have been counted. The parties'
representatives at polling stations will be asked to confirm the
number of voters at each site on the spot, rather than raising
objections later. And there will be a limit of 500 voters per station
to minimize delays.</TE>
<TE>   Steps are being taken to prevent the military from being tempted
to interfere in politics. South Africa and India have been running
training programs aimed at converting Lesotho's army into a
professional force, while the U.S. has provided education in how to
conduct a court-martial and sponsored seminars on civil and military
relations.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, 33 soldiers were convicted on charges of mutiny
and jailed for between three and 13 years for their role in the 1998
attempted putsch.</TE>
<TE>   "The consensus is that the military will remain apolitical this
time around," Loftis said.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen parties are fielding candidates for Parliament, and the
top vote-getting party will be in a position to choose the next prime
minister. The post currently is held by Pakalitha Mosisili, who was
almost deposed in 1998 by the mutinous troops.</TE>
<TE>   Mosisili's ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy is promising to
continue initiatives aimed at creating jobs, alleviating poverty and
providing a free and compulsory elementary education.</TE>
<TE>   Such policies attract votes, said Government Secretary Tlohang
Sekhamane, because "people are interested in who has demonstrated
that they can deliver."</TE>
<TE>   The LCD's toughest challenge is expected to come from Justin M.
Lekhanya, a retired army general, who leads the opposition Basotho
National Party and held power from 1986 to 1991 following a coup.</TE>
<TE>   His party is promising to revive the economy, improve living
conditions and launch a full-scale attack on crime and corruption.
Although opponents accuse him of being a dictator, he is convinced
that voters will give him another chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The people want to see the BNP back in power," Lekhanya said.
"They want a change for the better."</TE>
<TE>   No matter who wins in today's voting, the short-term prospects for
Lesotho remain bleak.</TE>
<TE>   The country, which gained independence from Britain in 1966, is
buckling under a famine that has compelled the government to declare
a national food emergency. Poverty is stalking almost every
household, and unemployment is raging at more than 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have taken a nose dive," said Prince Seeiso Bereng Seeiso,
a senator and brother to King Letsie III. "For ordinary people,
things really have not picked up."</TE>
<TE>   Scores of businesses closed permanently after the turmoil of 1998,
pushing hundreds of people out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ntabe managed to rebuild his pharmacy using a bank loan
and savings, he let go 11 of his original 20 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The six businesses owned by Ahmed Tanweer's father were torched in
1998, sending more than $1 million worth of assets up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been difficult recovering," said Tanweer, who manages his
father's new fabric store, the family's only remaining venture.
"People are saying what happened won't happen again. Let's hope it
doesn't. [People] can't afford to restart their businesses for a
second time."</TE>

<HD>Pope Doesn't Blame Bulgaria</HD>
<DH>Religion: Pontiff rejects allegations that the nation had a
role in a 1981 attempt on his life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOFIA, Bulgaria</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, meeting Friday with this nation's president,
bluntly rejected allegations that the former Communist government
here was involved in a 1981 assassination attempt on the pontiff's
life.</LD>
<LD>   "The Holy Father at the meeting with the president expressed his
view on the topic. He literally said, 'I never believed in the
so-called Bulgarian connection,'" Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Three Bulgarians faced trial in Italy as alleged co-conspirators
in Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca's attempt to kill the pope in St.
Peter's Square. They were acquitted for lack for evidence, but
allegations that Bulgaria's secret service and the Soviet KGB had
played a role were never entirely put to rest.</LD>
<TE>   "His Holiness' judgment was that it was an insinuation and a great
injustice to the Bulgarian people," President Georgi Parvanov said
after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's statement was treated as a cause for celebration here,
on the grounds that it erased a stain on the country's name.</TE>
<TE>   Afternoon tabloids ran front-page headlines such as "The Pope
Announced After 21 Years: I Have Never Believed in the Bulgarian
Connection," and "Pope John Paul II: Sergei, You're Innocent," a
reference to Sergei Antonov, one of the three Bulgarians acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   The news also was announced to the audience at an evening cultural
show attended by the pontiff.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's words came on a day when he honored the memory of
saints Cyril and Methodius, 9th century Scripture translators and
inventors of the Cyrillic alphabet. They are considered the patron
saints of Bulgaria for their role in converting the nation to
Christianity, and Friday was a holiday in their honor.</TE>
<TE>   "The work of Cyril and Methodius made an outstanding contribution
to forming the common Christian roots of Europe," John Paul said in a
speech at the cultural event, which featured top performers of
symphonic, choral and traditional folk music and dance.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, met earlier in the day with Patriarch Maxim, head
of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, in an effort to promote closer
understanding between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox faiths. At that
event he was greeted with a traditional offering of nuts, coffee,
water and plum brandy. The pontiff politely declined to taste the
brandy but was given a bottle to take back to Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Before the meeting, John Paul visited Sofia's main Orthodox
cathedral, where he was greeted by Bishop Simeon, leader of the
Bulgarian Orthodox Church's activities in Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Simeon gave the pontiff an icon of saints Peter and Paul,
declaring: "We admire your great deeds. We take you as an apostle."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the cathedral, John Paul rode briefly in his
bulletproof popemobile to greet well-wishers, who waved flowers and
cheered.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech during his visit with Maxim and Orthodox bishops, John
Paul expressed the anguish he feels at divisions within Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   "Christ our Lord founded a single church, while we today appear to
the world divided, as if Christ himself were divided," he said. "Such
division openly contradicts the will of Christ, scandalizes the world
and damages that most holy cause, the preaching of the Gospel to
every creature."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches
"suffered grievous wounds in the course of history," he added. "Often
enough, people of both sides were to blame.... Today we can give
thanks to God that the bonds between us have been much strengthened."</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches split in 1054, and over
the centuries they have at times been bitter rivals.</TE>
<TE>   There are just 80,000 Catholics in Bulgaria, a nation of 8 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox faiths have been cool to the pontiff's overtures in many
countries, in some cases fearing that Roman Catholics were trying to
win over their traditional believers.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent attempt to allay such fears without ruling the
Catholic Church out of the picture, John Paul's speech assured Maxim
and other Orthodox leaders of his "constant prayer that the Lord will
grant the Orthodox Church of Bulgaria to accomplish with courage,
together with the Catholic Church, the mission of evangelization
which he has entrusted to your church in this land."</TE>
<TE>   As a gift to the Orthodox Church, John Paul turned over to Maxim a
wooden box containing what is believed to be an arm bone of St.
Dasius, which the pontiff described as "a famous relic." The pontiff
noted that the 1,700th anniversary of his martyrdom is approaching.
John Paul also met Friday with representatives of Bulgaria's
3,500-member Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his trip, which took him first to the former Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan, John Paul--who is frail and suffering from
symptoms of Parkinson's disease--has read parts of his speeches
himself and had aides read out the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Dineva, 43, a nurse, said: "I was proud. In spite of his
physical state, he looked happy, which means we were able to arouse
those feelings."</TE>

<HD>Arab Extremists Looking for a Bigger Payoff</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Targeting of Israeli fuel depot reflects a shift
as more suicide bombings are thwarted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian extremists are concentrating on so-called hard targets of
strategic and economic value as suicide bombings against civilians
have become more difficult to pull off, Israeli government officials
say.</LD>
<LD>   Recent examples of such targets include an attack this week on a
fuel depot and plans recently unearthed to blow up a skyscraper in
Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   "They're putting more effort on these sorts of targets as they see
more suicide bombers being intercepted," said Raanan Gissin,
spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "Their infrastructure has
been severely damaged, so they want to focus on one singular attack."</LD>
<TE>   Early Thursday, a disaster was narrowly averted when a bomb
attached to the undercarriage of a diesel tanker truck went off in
the fuel depot, near Tel Aviv. The explosion, detonated by remote
control using a cell phone, caused a relatively small fire. Military
officials say it was only a stroke of luck that nearby fuel barrels
didn't ignite, potentially killing many residents in the densely
populated area.</TE>
<TE>   The attack followed the recent disclosure by Israeli officials
that they had found plans in the West Bank town of Tulkarm for an
attack on Tel Aviv's Azrieli towers, among the nation's tallest
buildings. The plans reportedly called for driving a vehicle loaded
with 2,200 pounds of explosives into the structure's basement parking
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon told the parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
on Monday that the army foiled a related plan to carry out a
coordinated strike against seven Israeli coastal cities.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say several other factors have contributed to
the Palestinians' focus on strategic targets. The recent wave of
Israeli military incursions, the erection of more checkpoints, and
airstrikes on West Bank and Gaza Strip targets have put
violence-prone groups on the defensive, they say, prompting militants
to look for a "big win" to show that they're still functioning.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials also believe that competition among extremist
groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
for leverage and political credibility as the Palestinian government
prepares for elections is spurring similar pressures to distinguish
themselves through high-profile attacks. Officials cited as an
example rival projects to build rockets. On Friday, the army
destroyed a workshop in Gaza City it said was making Kassam rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Israeli officials claim some success in stopping suicide
bombings and say the blasts are not creating as great a shock and
global publicity as desired by the attackers, which has prompted
militants to switch gears.</TE>
<TE>   Three suicide attacks have occurred in the last two weeks,
including Wednesday evening's explosion in a park in Rishon Le Zion
near Tel Aviv, which killed two Israelis and wounded three dozen.
However, Israeli officials say attackers are getting caught more
often; the military says it has intercepted nearly two dozen in the
last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials counter that a far different lesson should
be drawn from recent events. While asserting that they don't condone
suicide bombers, the officials say the full brunt of Israel's
military machine still has not stopped the violent attacks. The only
long-term hope for peace is a political solution, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities, meanwhile, say the focus on more strategic
targets requires the attackers to have greater coordination and more
sophisticated intelligence. Unlike suicide bombings, which can be
done by almost anyone without extensive planning, attacks against
civic and economic targets call for more legwork and help from allies
living inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "A suicide bombing is a one-way mission," Gissin said. "They don't
have to go back."</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's fuel depot attack, for instance, the bomb had to be
attached to the underside of a truck, which then was driven in by
remote control. Those responsible had to study the facility's layout,
identify security weaknesses, account for delivery schedules, plant
the bomb and then get away, all without being discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The government said it is investigating whether security lapses
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In an indication that Tulkarm remains a focus of Israeli military
attention, soldiers mounted another incursion into the town Friday.
According to a military spokesman, troops drew heavy fire by gunmen
positioned near the town's refugee camp. Other details were not
immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Many Russians See Summit as More of a Valley</HD>
<DH>Reaction: As differences detract from Bush-Putin accord,
ordinary citizens remain wary of U.S. and hardly feel more secure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, good chemistry between the leaders of the United
States and Russia and the signing of a sweeping arms accord was all
that was needed to bolster the sense of security in the world.</LD>
<LD>   But the issues that stalked Friday's meeting between President
Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin underscored the uneasy
feeling that today the world is not necessarily any safer, no matter
what is happening between Washington and Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours after Putin and Bush met to sign the arms accord, a
senior Bush administration official was juggling questions not about
the number of deployed warheads but about other dangers: Iran's
nuclear program, the threat of terrorist groups acquiring weapons of
mass destruction from Russia, and worries about a possible war
between nuclear powers Pakistan and India.</LD>
<TE>   And on Moscow's streets, even the summit's main proclaimed
achievement--the solidifying of trust between the United States and
Russia--seemed not to be wholly believed by ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   Many Russians say the U.S. wants not so much to pursue world peace
but to press its advantage, whether the issue is nuclear arms, frozen
chickens, Olympic gold medals or rolled steel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "does a lot for America, but he does it in a way that makes
things worse for other countries," complained Lena Ilyukhina, a
16-year-old interviewed near the hotel where Bush was staying. "He is
making America richer, and Russia is getting poorer."</TE>
<TE>   Her sentiment was reflected in a recent poll by the Public Opinion
Foundation here in which 58% of respondents described the U.S. as
"unfriendly" toward Russia, while 25% considered it "friendly."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, the summit seemed to come up far short in the
feel-good department compared with meetings between American and
Russian leaders in the not-so-distant past.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the atmosphere here was soured even before Bush arrived
because of news that the U.S. Senate had refused to take action to
repeal what Russians describe as one of the most outdated relics of
the Cold War: the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974, which tied access
to U.S. trade privileges to the levels of Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union. (The Soviet Union is now gone, and Jewish emigration
from Russia is open.)</TE>
<TE>   Several other hoped-for steps by the U.S. to help boost Russia's
economy also did not materialize in the Bush-Putin meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary Russians will most likely remain indifferent--they have
seen several treaties like that signed since [Soviet leader Leonid
I.] Brezhnev's times, but their daily life has not gotten a tad
better," said Viktor A. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the USA-Canada
Institute, a think tank here. "There is nothing in the treaty and all
the agreements signed [Friday] that would make an average Russian
person say, 'Wow.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the summit's lack of drama also can be seen as a good thing,
said another analyst, Alexander A. Konovalov, president of the
Institute for Strategic Assessment, also a Russian think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The more routine these meetings get, the better it is," he said.
"There will then be fewer pompous words and more action."</TE>
<TE>   There was no action on one issue of importance to the U.S.:
getting Russia to stop assisting Iran in building a civilian nuclear
power plant, which U.S. officials suspect is being used by the
Islamic republic as a means to acquire nuclear weapons technology.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of their declared new friendship, Bush and Putin sparred
publicly on the issue, with Bush saying Russia was in danger of
helping "a nontransparent government run by radical clerics" obtain
nuclear weapons, and Putin saying Russia was doing nothing of the
kind.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Bush administration official briefing reporters
afterward could cite no specific progress by Bush on persuading
Russia to back down. He said, however, that the two countries were
making progress behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   To some Russians, it will probably be a point of pride that Putin
did not surrender to the American pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Putin appears to have shown his mettle and had it his own way; he
said no to the Americans on Iran. And maybe this is good," said
Kremenyuk.</TE>
<TE>   "If Russia had continued to make concession after another
concession, the U.S. would have finally lost the rest of its respect
for Russia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, the administration official said Russia and the
U.S. would be expanding and intensifying their joint efforts to make
sure that the thousands of nuclear weapons in Russia do not fall into
the hands of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   And regarding the potential for war between India and Pakistan,
both governments were speaking in one voice to try to rein in the
South Asian rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The issues showed both the limits, and the potential, of the new
U.S.-Russian partnership Bush and Putin are forging.</TE>
<TE>   "The world ... will not be able to sleep peacefully just knowing
that the relations between the U.S. and Russia are friendly. Many new
challenges have emerged," said Andrei A. Piontkovsky, director of the
Independent Institute for Strategic Studies in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet the alliance between the U.S. and Russia," he added, "also
will be extremely instrumental for meeting these new challenges and
ensuring global stability."</TE>

<HD>9/11 Charities Didn't Tap Out U.S. Giving, Studies Say</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Most groups have met goals, despite fears
that Americans would donate only to victims' funds. Low stock prices
hurt some foundations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even after donating billions of dollars to relief efforts after Sept.
11, Americans pulled out their checkbooks to sustain most of the
nation's charitable organizations, two new studies show.</LD>
<LD>   A study by the Assn. of Fundraising Professionals found that about
60% of charities reported raising more money in 2001 than in the year
before. Another 10% said they maintained 2000 funding levels.</LD>
<LD>   Some nonprofits did indeed suffer a falloff in donations last
year, and the two reports paint a complex picture of giving,
revealing spotty giving patterns to some types of charities.</LD>
<TE>   But James Ferris, the director of USC's Center on Philanthropy and
Public Policy, said many nonprofits that cried broke after the
terrorist attacks were acting on fears that donors would divert all
their money to victims' funds. The fears proved to be premature, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows an amazing generosity of the American people," Ferris
said. "People did not just give in record amounts to terror-related
efforts, but they kept on giving to their usual charities."</TE>
<TE>   Almost three in four donors surveyed by Independent Sector, which
studies nonprofit management, said they gave to 9/11 charities and
maintained their regular giving to churches and other beneficiaries,
such as public radio.</TE>
<TE>   Some charities have made up losses from the cancellation of winter
holiday campaigns that were called off for fear they would be
considered in poor taste so soon after the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't all been good news.</TE>
<TE>   In some sectors, such as education and health care, about 30% of
charities may have been hit hard by economic sluggishness. Private
foundations that were heavily invested in the stock market have less
money to pass around this year.</TE>
<TE>   Contributors responded swiftly and intensely to the terrorist
attacks, giving more than $2 billion to funds for victims in just
under two months. Money was flowing to New York so fast, said
California Community Foundation President Jack Shakely, that
charities everywhere "could only stand back in amazement."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us believed there was only one national pie getting cut
up in many ways," Shakely said. "We found out there was new money out
there, another whole pie."</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the attacks, Shakely's group coordinated
awareness campaigns with other community foundations nationwide to
encourage donors not to abandon local charities.</TE>
<TE>   The California Community Foundation, which receives funds from
more than 1,000 benefactors, has seen its assets grow from $530
million two years ago to about $548 million now.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market fall did not hurt foundations like ours as bad
because it did not affect the type of people who are our
contributors," Shakely said. "So there are not as many 25-year-old
dot-com millionaires. Twenty-five to 28-year-olds are not big
philanthropists anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Foundations like ours are funded by estates and really wealthy
people, people who aren't hurt by the stock market because they're
diversified enough to weather it."</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising experts who tally nationwide numbers have not
completed final calculations of IRS statements, foundation reports
and professional surveys that detail the national picture. But the
trends are clearly apparent, they say, and final figures will be
released in June.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is that, anecdotally, we are hearing reports [that]
there are good stories coming out from the organizations that have
professional fund-raisers to steer them over the rocky shoals of the
past year," said Leo Arnoult, chairman of the American Assn. of
Fundraising Counsel Trust for Philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   Arnoult said the Assn. of Fundraising Professionals' study is
"statistically defensible enough to be an accurate picture of its
membership" of 25,000 professionals.</TE>
<TE>   A summary of that study released in April showed that predictions
by the charitable sector over last year swung widely with the news of
the day. Last August, just over half of all charities said they
expected to raise more money in 2001 than in 2000. Even that increase
told of despair among fund-raisers, Fundraising Professionals Vice
President Walter Sczudlo said, because they had hoped for even larger
increases.</TE>
<TE>   By October, charities were panicked, with nearly two-thirds of
fund-raisers saying their numbers would fall flat or be short of 2000
totals.</TE>
<TE>   "That tells you that these people weren't just asking for more
money; they really did anticipate a falloff," Sczudlo said. "The
strength of giving at year's end surprised us all."</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raisers wondered after Sept. 11 whether they should go
through with year-end benefit dinners and holiday letter campaigns.
The final quarter is a key time for many charities, since many donors
are motivated either by the holidays or the desire to make
tax-deductible donations before the year's close.</TE>
<TE>   "We told them, 'Your needs--the poor the sick, the elderly,
whatever--are still there, and your organization still has the
responsibility to try to meet their needs,'" Sczudlo said.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax scare last fall prompted Washington state-based
WorldVision United States to reschedule a holiday mailer, said Atul
Tandon, senior vice president of marketing. The Christian relief
organization had planned to send envelopes filled with pumpkin seeds
to potential new donors around Sept. 20 but delayed the mailing until
January.</TE>
<TE>   "Our donors told us not to let up, that they had not changed their
giving plans," Tandon said, adding that the pumpkin seed mailer drew
more than $440,000. Private donors have contributed nearly 8% more in
the 2001 fiscal year than the $216 million given in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Los Angeles-area foundations and charities expect to
end their fiscal years with bigger bottom lines, or at least without
having lost ground.</TE>
<TE>   United Way Los Angeles settled on a $66-million target for its
current fund drive--the same as last year's--after considering a
less-ambitious goal in October. But the agency expects to surpass
that total when its current campaign ends in June. President Joseph
Haggerty said the number of donors in Los Angeles County, mostly
employees giving through paycheck garnishments, grew from 400,000 in
2001 to about 450,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Haggerty attributes the growth to its advertising campaign with
the California Community Foundation. "It's mostly from what I'd call
a spotty economy," he said. "We're seeing strong donations from
strong sectors like real estate. But employees from hotels and
airlines are not giving as much because their companies aren't doing
as well."</TE>
<TE>   Childrens Hospital Los Angeles has brought in more than $190
million over the last two years, much more than the $30 million
annually it took in before 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Our board has helped by making investments themselves and calling
on their friends and associates to make investments in us," said
Claudia Looney, senior vice president of development at the hospital.
"This certainly is not something we've built overnight, and 9/11 and
the economy have not slowed us."</TE>
<TE>   Others are not so fortunate. Some foundations, such as the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation, are tied intimately to stock values.
The foundation's assets are attached to Hewlett-Packard stock, which
has fallen from a high of about $77 a share in 2000 to less than $19
a share Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Packard Foundation, which supports charitable groups
nationwide, awarded $615 million in grants in 2000 but is expected to
give only $250 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   To offset some of the cuts, the foundation is dedicating 8% of its
endowment to grants this year, up from the conventional 5%, Packard
Communications Director Chris DeCardy said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with stock-based endowments, the hardest-hit charities will
not be the high-profile urban and national nonprofits, but the
small-town and community-based organizations that depend on seamless
fund-raising, said Pat Read, Independent Sector's vice president for
public affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very skeptical of headlines that say, 'Oh, look, the
nonprofits are doing fine,'" Read said. "These studies say to me that
there is a dichotomy of groups who say they've raised more funds in
the past year and those who see big trouble ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Shakely of the California Community Foundation and Sczudlo of the
professional fund-raisers group agree that the challenge will be
maintaining the dwindling steam of nonprofit growth if the economy
does not recover soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's this year, 2002, that will probably be a flat year," Shakely
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sczudlo pointed to a historical resilience of nonprofits in the
time of crises. Despite world wars, recessions and political
instability, Americans have donated more money each of the last 62
years, with the exception of 1987, when the stock market fell
dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "Crises like Sept. 11 seem to emphasize how fragile the charitable
sector is," Sczudlo said, "and reinforced to Americans the importance
of charitable giving."</TE>

<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Sonny Perdue is facing sharp
criticism, and not just from Democrats, for a campaign video that
depicts Gov. Roy Barnes as a giant rat.</LD>
<LD>   Perdue plans to send 2,000 copies to supporters, and the short
movie was made available free on his Web site.</LD>
<LD>   Perdue's challengers in the Republican primary called the video
"disgusting" and called on Perdue to stop distributing it.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like a 1970s Godzilla movie. It's funny. We don't think
people are going to overthink it too much," said an aide to Perdue.</TE>

<LD>The Justice Department said it will fight a judge's ruling that
banned the department from interfering with an Oregon law that allows
doctors to help terminally ill people kill themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft challenged the law last November but was
rebuffed by a judge who ruled in April that the Justice Department
lacks the authority to overturn the state law, the only one of its
kind in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department lawyers filed paperwork on their plans to
appeal to the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Jones said in his decision in April that Oregon voters twice endorsed
the law and "have chosen to resolve the moral, legal and ethical
debate on physician-assisted suicide for themselves."</LD>

patients, have killed themselves using the law.</TE>

<HD>In Florida's War Against Canker, Judge Squashes Seeds of
Tyranny</HD>
<DH>Courts: Cutting privately owned citrus trees to fight
disease smacks of when individuals' rights 'were at the mercy of a
whim of royalty,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>For retiree Jack Haire and his wife, one of life's daily joys is
their citrus trees: orange, grapefruit, tangerine and Key lime. The
10 trees on their half-acre property give shade, shelter for
butterflies, and in season, a bounty of juicy fruit.</LD>
<LD>   That's why Patty Haire, 54, was even willing to risk arrest to
protect them after state agricultural officials announced that the
Haires' home was in a "kill zone," where all citrus trees would be
destroyed to prevent the spread of a disease called citrus canker, a
threat to the state's $9-billion-a-year citrus industry.</LD>
<LD>   When state inspectors knocked on their door, Haire insisted no one
was going to come near her healthy trees, her husband recalled. "I
said to my wife, 'The worst thing is that we could lose our trees,'"
he said. "My wife said, 'No, the worst is that these people will be
back for years trespassing on our property and interrupting our
privacy.'"</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, a judge agreed with the Fort Lauderdale couple that the
state has been outrageously high-handed in its battle against citrus
canker.</TE>
<TE>   In language reminiscent of the American colonists' grievances
against King George III, Broward County Circuit Judge Leonard Fleet
declared that Florida's program to eradicate the disease "returns the
state to a period of time when the rights of an individual were at
the mercy of a whim of royalty."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, after the disease was found in a single tree near
Miami International Airport, nearly 600,000 trees in Floridians'
yards and 1.5 million in commercial groves have been cut down by the
state, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture.
California's citrus industry has escaped the disease, which prospers
in more moist climates.</TE>
<TE>   In his 20-page decision, Fleet ruled that a law that gives Florida
the right to cut down healthy trees--passed this year by the
Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush--violates the state
Constitution and the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable
searches and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Fleet objected to a provision that allowed cutting
crews to work under blanket search warrants that covered entire
counties, giving them the power to enter anyone's yard and fell all
citrus trees, sick or not, within 1,900 feet of any one infected
tree.</TE>
<TE>   Fleet's ruling appears to apply only to his jurisdiction, but an
expected appeal could affect the policy statewide.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of trees has been stopped occasionally by lawsuits,
and some property owners have taken up arms to protect their trees
from the state's chain saws.</TE>
<TE>   The Haires, whose lawsuit was joined by Broward County and other
municipalities, were delighted by Fleet's decision. So was another
co-plaintiff, Laz Schneider, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who has two
large grapefruit trees, both more than 30 years old, that provide
welcome backyard shade.</TE>
<TE>   "My focus has shifted from the trees to the totally outrageous act
of our Legislature and governor in attempting, as best as I can
determine, to abolish the Bill of Rights," Schneider said. "What the
statute and [Florida Agriculture] Department are doing is taking
property without due process of law. They are performing searches and
seizures without due process of law."</TE>
<TE>   For Florida's agricultural interests, the decision was a bruising
setback, and the Department of Agriculture said it will try to have
an appeal heard immediately by the state Supreme Court. Terence
McElroy, the department's spokesman in Tallahassee, said Fleet's
reasoning was the equivalent of allowing Typhoid Mary to keep her job
in the restaurant trade.</TE>
<TE>   "The rights of a relative few," McElroy said, were prized over the
interests of the single biggest sector of Florida's agriculture
industry, one that employs more than 100,000 people. Legal challenges
to the eradication efforts and resulting court injunctions, he said,
have resulted in increasing numbers of infected and at-risk trees in
South Florida's Broward and Miami-Dade counties, climbing from as
many as 80,000 in 2000 to 200,000 today. The canker also has spread
north to Palm Beach County.</TE>
<TE>   Citrus canker is a bacteria that produces dark, oily lesions on
leaves and fruit, weakening the tree and sapping its capacity to bear
fruit. It has no known ill effects on humans, but makes oranges and
other citrus look unappealing to consumers. According to the state
Agriculture Department, the canker, which is spread by wind, has
devastated the production of Key limes, a traditional Florida
delicacy, in Miami-Dade County. Grapefruit trees also are very
susceptible, as are some varieties of oranges.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Galinkin, 59, who owns a tree nursery in Delray Beach in
Palm Beach County, said the homeowners who sued are selfish. "They
only care about their one tree," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the yard of his suburban Fort Lauderdale home, he has
grapefruit, orange and calamondin orange trees. "We are better in the
long run killing everything that has the canker," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Meyers, an attorney for Broward County, claimed the law
passed this spring, which validated the state's practice of cutting
down trees since 1995, was the creation of the powerful citrus
growers and their allies in the Agriculture Department.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he said, the department acted by administrative fiat in
cutting trees within 125 feet of a sick tree. When those actions were
challenged in court, he said, growers prevailed on legislators to
pass the law authorizing destruction on a much wider scale.</TE>
<TE>   "Their whole policy is based on junk science," Meyers said. "In
fact, we proved at the hearing that the way they cut down trees
actually spreads the disease."</TE>
<TE>   Under Fleet's decision, Florida must compensate tree owners for
disease-free trees that were felled. He said a jury could determine
their worth. He also said that, in the future, warrants must be
restricted to a specific property.</TE>
<TE>   For the Haires, the ruling was a welcome reprieve for their trees,
though they expect court battles to continue. "I've lived here for 37
years, and some of those trees were planted by my children," said
Jack Haire, 67. "It'd be devastating, going out there and seeing just
vacant space."</TE>

<HD>Congress Will Probe FBI Whistle-Blower Report</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Lawmakers to take up an employee's criticism
that the agency failed to act. Intelligence panels plan to begin
their hearings in June.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Congressional investigators said Friday they will probe
an FBI whistle-blower's criticism that bureau headquarters failed to
aggressively pursue a lead in August about a suspected accomplice to
the Sept. 11 terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called the accusations that FBI headquarters put up an
obstacle to a pre-Sept. 11 investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui "very
serious." Authorities believe Moussaoui, who aroused the FBI's
suspicions in August while taking flight training, was planning to be
"the 20th hijacker" in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Graham said the accusations by Coleen Rowley, general counsel in
the FBI's Minneapolis office, would be part of an investigation by
the House and Senate intelligence committees into charges of
pre-Sept. 11 lapses. Rowley sent a letter to Congress complaining
that agents in her office were reprimanded for contacting the CIA
after failing to get help from their own agency.</LD>
<TE>   "She would be someone high up on the list of people that we would
like to interview further and potentially to call as a witness,"
Graham said at a news conference. Rowley was interviewed Wednesday by
staff members of the investigating committees.</TE>
<TE>   "We know enough now to say that there was a lack of aggressive
follow-through of information that ... deserved to have gotten
greater attention and treatment," Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   The committees are preparing to hold their first hearing, behind
closed doors, June 4, the day after Congress returns from its
Memorial Day recess. Lawmakers are planning public hearings with some
witnesses, including CIA Director George J. Tenet and FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, calls for an independent commission to investigate
the lapses intensified. At the same time, support for an independent
commission was threatened by a partisan dispute over how members of
the yet-to-be-authorized panel would be appointed.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's response to suspicions raised by Minneapolis agents
about Moussaoui and to a July memo by an FBI agent in Phoenix urging
his superiors to investigate Middle Easterners enrolled in U.S.
flight schools has become a central issue of lawmakers' questions
about possible intelligence failures before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), an intelligence committee member, called
Rowley's letter "very troubling."</TE>
<TE>   "It raises significant questions about whether the field people
are more willing to take risks than people in the central office," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a frequent critic of the FBI,
said that after being briefed on the letter, "I don't blame agents in
Minnesota for wondering if there were unwitting collaborators of
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "If field agents committed these egregious errors, they would be
facing discipline and relocation. But the double standard of
discipline and accountability continues, even though Director Mueller
has pledged to me that it was gone."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, some lawmakers appeared willing to give
Mueller, who was sworn in as FBI director Sept. 4, time to reform the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), another intelligence committee
member, said in an interview that Mueller "understands that the FBI
didn't do a good job" of responding to the Phoenix memo.</TE>
<TE>   "His job now is to convince us he's going to reform the FBI so
this couldn't happen again," Durbin said. "What Mueller is trying to
do is change a management ethic that has been in place for decades."</TE>
<TE>   Graham and Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, said they have assembled a staff of 23
experts, ranging from a Middle East research director from the Rand
Corp. to a former deputy inspector general for investigations at the
CIA, to conduct the committees' inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   They have collected more than 30,000 pages of documents and
conducted about 175 interviews as part of an investigation that will
examine U.S. intelligence dating to 1986, when the CIA's
Counter-Terrorist Center was established.</TE>
<TE>   In a "Dear Colleague" letter to members of Congress, leaders of
the intelligence committees said, "The hearings are designed both to
inform the Congress and the public about what happened before, on,
and after Sept. 11 as it relates to the performance of the
intelligence agencies, and to recommend reforms."</TE>
<TE>   The letter appeared to be an effort to head off calls for an
independent commission, similar to one established after the attack
on Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Rowley's
letter underscores the need for an independent commission.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it was ignored and that somebody of her stature and
experience in the FBI is complaining about the lack of
information-sharing and the lack of response to the information made
available is yet another illustration of why a commission is
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic leaders who support the idea of a commission
reportedly are upset that Republicans would appoint a majority of the
members. As proposed, President Bush would appoint four members and
the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-run Senate, five each.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Intelligence
Commission, expressed concern that "political pressures" could drive
leaders of the inquiry to open the hearings to the public
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   "Public hearings are not for the purpose of gathering information.
They're for the purpose of disseminating information," Kyl said.
Holding hearings too soon "raises more second-guessing."</TE>

<HD>Indian Affairs Aide Is Fired, but He Blames White House</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The No. 2 official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs was fired Friday,
a move he contended was retaliation for refusing to follow White
House orders on a decision involving California Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Department spokesman Mark Pfeifle denied the assertion by
Wayne Smith, saying the termination was "because of actions [Smith]
took as an employee at the Department of Interior."</LD>
<LD>   Pfeifle, whose agency oversees the BIA, declined to describe the
actions.</LD>
<TE>   Smith's former business partner, Philip Bersinger, is being
investigated by the FBI and Interior Department inspector general for
trying to use his relationship with Smith to land lobbying contracts
with tribes.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said her client was forced out
because he refused to give the Buena Vista Me-Wuk Indians federal
tribal status for a casino.</TE>
<TE>   Luque said she has asked the U.S. attorney's office to investigate
"what I believe is an improper use of influence by the White House
and those connected to Republican politics and reprisals against Mr.
Smith for reporting that influence."</TE>
<TE>   She declined to say why the White House wanted the decision
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Luque said that Smith has sought protection under federal
"whistle-blower" statutes that shield workers from retaliation.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Defense Urges Access to Detainees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for John Walker Lindh pressed their case Friday for
interviews with detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and said they have
received critical information that the young Northern Californian
never turned his rifle against U.S. military troops before his
capture in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The defense team wants to visit with numerous detainees to learn
more about what Lindh was doing while fighting for the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., where Lindh is to stand trial
in August, is likely to rule Tuesday on whether the defense will be
granted access to the detainees.</LD>
<TE>   The government has maintained that security concerns and other
factors make it ill-advised for outside parties to speak with the
detainees. But in court papers Friday, the Lindh defense team said
that representatives from other countries have visited with some of
the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's lawyers also said U.S. government reports turned over to
the defense show that many detainees have said he was not soldiering
against the United States, and he would have left the Taliban army
but feared for his life.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has now produced 24 FBI reports of interviews with
Guantanamo detainees that it admits provide material and exculpatory
information" beneficial to Lindh, the defense lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said the government reports show that Lindh was not
fighting against U.S. troops when he was captured during a prison
riot at the Qala-i-Janghi fort in Afghanistan, where CIA agent Johnny
"Mike" Spann was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "When the uprising began, Mr. Lindh was sitting on the [fort's]
lawn with his arms bound behind him," the lawyers said. "And as soon
as the uprising began, Mr. Lindh was shot by Northern Alliance
guards."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers also said that some of the detainees attended the same
training camp in Afghanistan as Lindh and that they have insisted it
was for military schooling.</TE>
<TE>   "The testimony of these witnesses is highly important to
corroborate that, contrary to government assertions, the training at
that camp was solely military and not terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers also said that detainees have claimed there was
"no way to safely leave" Afghanistan during the war.</TE>
<TE>   One prisoner, identified only as "DT-24," said that after the
Sept. 11 attacks, "he wanted to leave the front line and return home
but could not get out of Afghanistan because everything was closed
down and bombs were being dropped everywhere."</TE>

<HD>Missile Parts at Saudi Base Spark Warning</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The surface-to-air weapon may have belonged to
Al Qaeda. FBI issues an alert on possible attacks against U.S.
aircraft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Remnants of a surface-to-air missile discovered at a Saudi military
base used by U.S. troops likely belonged to Al Qaeda operatives,
prompting an FBI warning about possible missile attacks against U.S.
aircraft, according to a classified alert issued this week.</LD>
<LD>   Intelligence officials have suspected for years that Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network may have access to surface-to-air
missiles, but the discovery of a missile-launching tube from a
shoulder-mounted missile at the Prince Sultan Air Base appeared to
offer troubling confirmation.</LD>
<LD>   In an alert obtained by The Times, FBI officials said an
investigation has revealed that the missile remnants discovered in
early May are "likely" connected to an effort by Al Qaeda to target
U.S.-led coalition forces on the Arabian Peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   While the FBI alert cautioned that it has no specific information
indicating that Al Qaeda is planning to use surface-to-air missiles
in terrorist attacks, it warned law enforcement agencies within the
United States to be "alert to the potential use [of the missiles]
against U.S. aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI warning does not say how investigators concluded that Al
Qaeda was likely behind the placement of the missile at the military
base, but it notes that Al Qaeda has targeted both the U.S. airline
industry and U.S. military in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-foot-long launching tube was found two weeks ago inside the
perimeter of the base, two miles from a runway used by U.S. warplanes
at the sprawling facility. It appears to have come from an older
model, relatively crude SA-7 missile first made by the Russians in
1969. The missile had been fired, though it is not known when.</TE>
<TE>   The type of missile is known as a MANPAD, or Man Portable Air
Defense System, and it has a range of up to 3.5 miles, according to
the FBI alert.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official who asked not to be identified said that "we've
had the concern for years that shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles
would be the perfect terrorism weapon. You could hide in the bushes
somewhere around a major U.S. aircraft and when a plane was coming in
for a landing or taking off, you could let one of those fly and take
down a plane. It's a terrifying prospect."</TE>
<TE>   Surface-to-air missiles are only the latest in a long line of
weapons that authorities have warned both publicly and privately
could be used by terrorists to inflict mass destruction. Other
threats cited since Sept. 11 include trains, subways, cargo
containers, commercial trucks, crop dusters, "walk-in" suicide
bombers, scuba divers and many others.</TE>
<TE>   The older-style Russian missiles "are available on the gray
market, and they're relatively small, so it is within the realm of
possibility that they could use that type of method to launch an
attack," said another U.S. government official who also requested
anonymity. "That's something we're mindful of and concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery at the remote Saudi site so close to U.S. personnel
and warplanes, however, has raised the concerns about such an attack
to a higher level within the United States, and it is also likely to
deepen Pentagon concerns about the military's presence in Saudi
Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials revealed two weeks ago that they had found the
missile parts on the Saudi base, but they downplayed the significance
of the discovery and, unlike the FBI's warning issued Wednesday, did
not mention any links to Al Qaeda at that time. Military officials
said Friday that they remain uncertain about the significance.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps Capt. Robert Riggle, a spokesman for Central Command
in Tampa, Fla., said Friday that "it was just found laying there; no
one knows how it was fired and how it got there." In the view of
military authorities "there's really not that much to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. forces were unaware of any sign that any MANPAD had
been fired at U.S. fliers.</TE>
<TE>   Some questions may remain unanswered, however, because the Saudis
destroyed the missile tubing after it was photographed.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces were moved to the Prince Sultan Air Base in the center
of Saudi Arabia in the 1990s to make the American troops a less
visible presence in the kingdom, where many are hostile to them. But
as the years have passed, concern has grown over threats to personnel
and hardware. Meanwhile, their Saudi government hosts worry that the
U.S. presence has stirred domestic opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Goure, a former defense official now at the Lexington
Institute think tank in suburban Washington, D.C., said the discovery
points to the risk that U.S. forces face in so many places.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people there don't like the United States, and the
borders are porous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that driving the United States out of Saudi Arabia was
Bin Laden's top goal and that the dissident has been linked to a 1995
bomb blast in Riyadh that killed five American troops. And terrorists
struck the Khobar Towers Air Force Base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in
1996, killing 19.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force operates dozens of aircraft out of the Prince Sultan
Air Base, including F-15 and F-16 fighters, electronic jammers and
refueling planes. The planes fly patrols over the southern region of
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. commanders have been laying plans to shift more aircraft
and other personnel to other Gulf allies, notably Qatar, in case the
Saudi bases come under attack or the Saudi government cools further
on the American presence.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI warning noted that Stinger missiles, an American-made
second generation version of the MANPAD, were used by anti-Soviet
fighters in Afghanistan in the 1980s and that Al Qaeda and Taliban
members are believed to have had access to them.</TE>
<TE>   The shoulder-mounted missiles have become common in many parts of
the world in the last three decades, including the Russian-made
version and the American-made Stinger and similar products.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defense officials worried from the beginning of the Afghan
war that Al Qaeda and Taliban forces would use the Stingers left over
from the battles against them. And there were some reports of MANPADs
being used against American planes and helicopters in the early
stages of the war, though apparently they were never able to bring
down U.S. aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban were believed to have about 100 of the U.S.-supplied
Stingers at the start of the war.</TE>
<TE>   The weapon uses a sensor to locate an aircraft by the heat it
emits. About a yard and a half long, the SA-7 fires a high explosive
shell.</TE>
<TE>   The weapon's effectiveness depends on the operator's ability to
lock on to the heat source of low-flying helicopters and airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   But Goure noted that "this is not a perfect weapon."</TE>
<TE>   It can be thrown off by flares that suggest a different heat
source. It is also easily fooled in nighttime encounters and isn't
effective against high-speed aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Goure said the U.S. fliers can better protect themselves by taking
off at steeper angles and making sure that the perimeters of the base
are secure.</TE>
<TE>   Stingers were enough of a worry to U.S. officials that they
organized a buyback program to try to recover arms that remained in
Afghanistan after the U.S.-backed effort to oust the Soviet-supported
government in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Alaska to Test Whaling Ban</HD>
<DH>Law: Eskimos who hunt bowheads won't abide by the
international rule, congressman says. Commission rejected U.S.
request for a waiver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>Eskimo subsistence hunters who depend on bowhead whales won't be
stopped by the International Whaling Commission's decision to ban the
hunts, Alaska's only member of the House of Representatives said.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Don Young, a Republican, said North Slope and western Alaska
villages will continue hunting whales despite the IWC vote against
renewing quotas for subsistence hunting of bowheads.</LD>
<LD>   "The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission will continue their harvest
under domestic regulations until this can be corrected by the IWC,"
Young said Friday in a statement released by his Anchorage office.</LD>
<TE>   The United States had asked the commission to renew a quota
allowing Eskimos to hunt 55 bowhead whales over five years. The
request received 32 votes in favor and 11 opposed Friday, the final
day of the meeting in Shimonoseki, Japan. That fell short of the
required three-fourths majority of the IWC's 48 members.</TE>
<TE>   The rejection came after the U.S., Britain and other nations
blocked Tokyo-led attempts to lift the IWC's commercial whaling ban.
The IWC on Thursday denied a proposal to end the 1986 ban.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Japan was denied the right to let four
coastal whaling towns catch a total of 50 minke whales from nearby
waters.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Dave Whaley of the House Resources Committee said
the IWC has no power to sanction the U.S. if Alaska whalers ignore
the ban. But he acknowledged that U.S. credibility could be
questioned by other member nations if Eskimos hunt without a quota.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we don't want to go that route," he said. "We want to
do things legally."</TE>
<TE>   The IWC meets once a year. The decision could be reversed in a
special meeting or by a mail ballot, Whaley said, and steps are
underway to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The quota is in effect through the fall hunt, and whalers would
not be affected until spring, Whaley said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mexico announced an accord Friday to protect whales in
its waters, making it the world's largest national sanctuary for the
giant mammals, environmental groups said. The office of Mexican
President Vicente Fox said the "Area of Refuge" accord would provide
added protection in areas such as reproduction, growth and migration
to 39 whale species that spend time in Mexican waters.</TE>
<TE>   Alaskans reacted strongly to the ban on Eskimo whaling.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the action outrageous
and unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision was the worst form of petty global politics and is
simply intolerable," Murkowski said. He said he will file a formal
protest with the IWC.</TE>
<TE>   "Subsistence whaling certainly is not a threat to the growing
number of bowhead whales, but its absence is a threat to a
centuries-old lifestyle and to the well-being of Alaska Eskimos,"
Murkowski said. "Alaska natives always have protected the whales,
always observing sustain-yield principles."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, said the action was a harpoon aimed
at the hearts of indigenous subsistence users of Alaska's North Slope
and Russia's Chukotsk Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   George Ahmaogak, a whaling captain and mayor of the North Slope
Borough, urged the 10 villages that make up the Alaska Eskimo Whaling
Commission to remain calm.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmaogak, who landed a whale earlier this month, said the
commission will work with the Commerce Department to ensure
protection of bowhead hunts.</TE>
<TE>   "The 32 countries that voted to support our subsistence quota
request support us in our efforts," Ahmaogak said. "We will work with
the U.S. and the whaling communities to take the necessary steps to
protect and continue the way of life that our elders have taught us."</TE>
<TE>   The IWC was formed in 1946. The commission focused on commercial
whaling activities for years, but in 1977 voted to ban Alaska Eskimo
subsistence harvests of bowhead whales.</TE>

<LD>A UC San Francisco researcher attempted so-called therapeutic cloning
of human embryos before moving his research to England last year, the
university confirmed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts by geneticist Roger Pedersen and his colleagues did
not succeed in producing any viable human embryos, and the effort was
not publicized because of the lack of success, according to Dr. Keith
Yamamoto, vice dean for medical research at the school.</LD>
<LD>   The attempts were revealed as the result of a Freedom of
Information request filed by the Wall Street Journal, which published
a story Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no effort to be secretive of anything that we're
doing," Yamamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   The only other publicly acknowledged attempt at therapeutic
cloning in the United States was performed by a small biotechnology
company, Advanced Cell Technology. Their efforts also were not
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pedersen was not available for comment Friday, a
statement he wrote released by the university indicated that the work
on campus was terminated both because of the complexities involved in
funding and his decision to accept a post at the University of
Cambridge in Britain. Pedersen was widely thought to have accepted
the Cambridge post at least in part because of the prospect of U.S.
bans on such research.</TE>
<TE>   But he is not now conducting such research, he said in his
statement, and probably will not in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Yamamoto said that research protocols governing therapeutic
cloning are still in place at the university but that the research
would not be resumed until competing bills now before the U.S. Senate
are resolved. One bill would outlaw all cloning in the United States.
A second would outlaw cloning for purposes of reproduction but would
permit therapeutic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The House has already passed a bill outlawing all cloning, and
President Bush has made two speeches indicating that he supports such
a ban.</TE>
<TE>   A vote on the competing bills had been postponed for several
months and is now expected in June.</TE>
<TE>   In therapeutic cloning, DNA from an adult's cell is placed in a
human egg that has had its own DNA removed. The goal is to produce a
very early embryo from which fetal stem cells could be harvested.
Such cells are widely viewed as potential treatments for a host of
diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The advantage of using
clones is that the tissue would be genetically identical to the
patient's and thus less likely to be rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Once researchers learn how to control the growth of stem cells,
they also potentially could be used to produce replacement organs for
transplants.</TE>
<TE>   David Baltimore, president of Caltech, said such studies involving
stem cells and cloning are important, both for developing a deeper
understanding of biology and devising new medical therapies.</TE>
<TE>   But USC bioethicist Alexander Capron said he is worried about the
UC San Francisco revelation. While he is not morally opposed to using
stem cells for medical purposes, he thinks there are insufficient
regulations today to avoid cloned embryos resulting--somewhere--in
the birth of a cloned child.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a good deal of further thought about this before we
plunge into research cloning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pedersen's research was conducted in the first six months of 1999
and over a five-month period at the beginning of 2001. His group used
eggs donated by a fertility clinic that the clinic's physicians had
been unable to inseminate. Experts said Pedersen's failure to obtain
viable embryos was not surprising, considering the eggs' history.</TE>
<TE>   Yamamoto did not reveal how many eggs Pedersen had worked on. The
documents obtained by the Journal said he had proposed studying as
many as 1,000 eggs a year.</TE>
<TE>   Pedersen's research was complicated by the fact that U.S. law
prohibits any research on human cloning using federal funds. Thus,
his experiments were supported with state funds and money from Geron
Corp., a biotechnology company in Menlo Park.</TE>
<TE>   But keeping his research entirely separate from other studies
conducted with federal funds was difficult, a situation that
contributed to the cessation of the work.</TE>
<TE>   Although the protocols permitting the UC San Francisco research
are still in place, anyone who wanted to do human cloning there would
have to go through the approval process again, Yamamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will simply be able to walk in and start doing
experiments," he said.</TE>

<HD>The Baby Registry of Choice</HD>
<DH>Thousands of pregnant South Koreans travel to the U.S. to
give birth to American citizens. A mini-industry has been created to
serve them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>In a few weeks, Kim Jeong Yeon will put on her baggiest overalls to
disguise her bulging belly and board a flight for Los Angeles. She
will spend three months in the United States, staying on a tourist
visa, after which she will return to South Korea with a newly minted
U.S. citizen in tow.</LD>
<LD>   "It's easy. If you register the birth, it's automatic that your
baby can get an American passport," says Kim, a 31-year-old importer
of Italian shoes who is pregnant with her first child.</LD>
<LD>   One might say it is the ultimate gift that South Korean parents
can give their newborns. Those who can cough up the $20,000 or so it
costs are coming to the United States by the thousands to give birth
so their newborns can have American citizenship. Their reasons range
from a desire to enroll their offspring in American schools to
enabling them to avoid South Korean military service.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the most popular destination because of its large
Korean-speaking population, along with New York, Boston, Hawaii and
even Guam. Although there are no figures on how many "tourists"
overall have babies in the U.S., the practice is also believed to be
popular among women from Hong Kong and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   So many are doing it, in fact, that a mini-industry has developed
here of agencies that refer expectant mothers to travel agents,
immigration lawyers, prenatal clinics, hospitals and even
baby-sitters, arranging what are, in effect, package tours for
pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   "From birth to citizenship," advertises one Korean-language Web
site (www.birthinusa.com) that helps women give birth in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is one of the few countries that grants
citizenship to anyone born on its soil. Britain and Australia altered
similar laws in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by immigration foes in Congress to stop the practice have
failed because the citizenship rights of such children, even those of
illegal immigrants, appear to be guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution, added after the Civil War to bestow the right on
the descendants of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service says the birth tours
are not illegal as long as the women have enough money to pay their
medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing inherently illegal about somebody coming over
here as a tourist and bearing a child. Doing so doesn't necessarily
violate the terms of being a tourist," said Thomas Schiltgen,
district director of the INS office in Los Angeles. "Any tourist
needs to establish that they have the funds to accomplish their
purpose in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean women giving birth in the United States tend to
be well educated and upper-class, with big ambitions for their
children. Since many have been to America before and have good jobs
in South Korea, they are deemed unlikely to overstay their welcome
and thus can easily get tourist visas. Indeed, most are eager to fly
home as soon as they can get the birth certificates and passports for
their newborns.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought a first-class plane ticket. I go to the United States
frequently on business, so I know my way around. I had no problems,"
said a 36-year-old advertising executive, whose daughter was born in
December at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Chang Kyu, an obstetrician and gynecologist with a practice in
the wealthy Kangnam neighborhood of Seoul, estimates that as many as
5,000 South Korean babies--about 1% of annual South Korean
births--are born in the United States each year. In his practice
alone, about 10 maternity patients each month deliver in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   They are motivated by a desire to get their children into American
schools, which are considered less grueling and often better quality
than South Korea's, and, in the case of boys, to keep them out of the
26-month mandatory military service. Others believe that having a
child who is a U.S. citizen will help the parents immigrate and will
make it easier to open bank accounts in the United States in order to
get around strict South Korean laws regarding foreign currency.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is seldom voiced, Kim says some of his patients also
have a nagging fear that South Korea could become engulfed in another
devastating war with North Korea, and they would like a way out if
that happens.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these people are really rich. They don't want to feel
like they are trapped by Korea," said Kim, who went to medical school
in the U.S. and sends his own children to American prep schools.
"Recently there has been a remarkable increase in my patients' going
to the United States, and some of it I just think is social pressure.
Others are doing it and people want to keep up with the Joneses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Mother's Dream for Her Children</TE>
<TE>   Among several expectant mothers who talked about their plans for
giving birth in the United States, Kim Jeong Yeon was unusual in that
she was willing to be named. Elegant even in her eighth month of
pregnancy, Kim wore pearls over a fashionable navy blue maternity
dress and high-heeled sandals as she stepped out of a BMW
convertible. She is not bashful about having money and what it can do
for her.</TE>
<TE>   "If they could afford it, all my friends would go to the United
States to have their babies," Kim said. Even before she was married
two years ago, she knew she wanted her children to be born abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest complaint about Korea is the educational system. In
high school, you have to study past midnight or else you fall behind
the others and can't get on with your life. And since the baby is a
boy, I thought it would be a big gift for him not to be burdened with
military service."</TE>
<TE>   "We're also thinking about immigration, so all in all we thought
it would be better if the baby is an American citizen," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim estimates the trip will cost at least $20,000, much of it in
medical bills that would be covered by her health insurance if she
stayed at home. That figure does not include the loss of her income
from having to leave South Korea a full month before her due date in
order to comply with airline restrictions regarding pregnancy. It
would be even higher if she didn't have a grandmother in Los Angeles
with whom she can stay.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say most South Korean women who come to the United States
to give birth--many to be joined by their husbands just before the
due date--pay in cash. Not surprisingly, there are plenty of services
catering to their needs. Most operate discreetly, relying on word of
mouth for their clientele. But there are others that market
aggressively, such as Hana Medical Center, which last year launched
the birthinusa.com Web site, complete with graphics of a stork
carrying a baby back to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean-run Hana has three centers for expectant mothers--on
Olympic Boulevard in Los Angeles, in Panorama City and in
Pacoima--and last year opened an elegantly furnished postnatal
facility called Larchmont Villa in Koreatown where women can stay
until it is time to fly home. Their services include such
conveniences as a private car for pickup at the airport and a guide
to help get the baby a Social Security number and passport.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. School System Attracts Parents</TE>
<TE>   "Education is the main reason women come here," said Cindy Kim,
who counsels patients at Hana. "It is really a tough system in Korea.
At 2 or 3, they teach the children English. At 7 or 8, many of the
children are sent to the United States to be educated. It is harder
than it used to be to get study visas, so it is easier if the
children have U.S. citizenship."</TE>
<TE>   Kim says that Hana has five to seven patients each month who fly
in from South Korea to have their babies and that none has had
problems with the INS in entering the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But there is some apprehension among expectant mothers about new
immigration rules that could take effect this summer that will
shorten the standard tourist visa from six months to 30 days unless
visitors can explain satisfactorily to the immigration officer at the
airport why they need to stay longer.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new rules are designed to deter terrorists from
establishing a foothold in the United States, they could also
intimidate South Korean women, particularly those who do not speak
English.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration critics believe that far stricter measures are needed
to prevent women from coming to the United States for the sole
purpose of giving birth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Critics Decry Loophole</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it is not illegal immigration per se, it is
exploiting a loophole," said Jack Martin, a project director at the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group
that advocates restrictions on immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The federation is especially critical of what it calls anchor
babies, whom mothers arrange to have in the United States with the
hope that the child will later help the entire family immigrate.
Under the law, a U.S. citizen cannot sponsor anyone for immigration
purposes until the age of 21, but according to Martin, the long wait
is not a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to conceptualize a strategy that is so long-term with
regard to U.S. citizenship, but that's what they are
doing--establishing a foothold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The federation says 165,000 babies are born in the United States
each year to illegal immigrants, most of them from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   For South Koreans, the harshest condemnation of the practice comes
not from immigration critics in the U.S. but from other Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not natural to fly for thousands of miles to have a baby
far away from family members," said Catherine Choi, a South
Korean-born physician who runs the Beverly Health and Birthing Center
in Los Angeles. She often sees patients who fly in from South Korea.
"Koreans think this is a way to give their baby a better chance in
life, but I do not encourage it."</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, travel agent Min Yong Kee, who says he has sold many
pregnant women plane tickets to the U.S., says he nevertheless
adamantly disapproves.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be technically legal, but the majority opinion is that it
is ethically dubious. Koreans are nationalistic. Why should they go
to the United States to give birth? It doesn't seem right," Min said.</TE>
<TE>   Under South Korean law, children can have both Korean and U.S.
citizenship, but they must choose between them when they turn 18. But
that could change. American births have become so popular among the
privileged that Koreans are starting to complain that soon only the
children of the poor will serve in the army.</TE>
<TE>   Having U.S. citizens in the family has also become something of a
political liability for public figures.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Hoi Chang, the conservative opposition leader who is running
for president, has faced staunch criticism because his son and
daughter-in-law went to Hawaii earlier this year to have their baby.</TE>
<TE>   Lee reportedly has consulted a lawyer in an effort to get his
granddaughter, now 5 months old, to forfeit her U.S. citizenship. He
reportedly was told it couldn't happen until she reached the age of
18 and could make her own decision.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Heroes Whose Skills Spoke Volumes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>This is one in an occasional series chronicling untold
stories from the war in Afghanistan.</SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>The first time he saw the Khyber Pass leading into Afghanistan, he
was a frightened 11-year-old refugee from Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The next time he saw those sheer rock walls--31 years later--he
was a seasoned U.S. Marine Corps officer engaged in the hunt for
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Of all the untold tales of the U.S. war against terrorism, one of
the most remarkable is about a ramrod-straight Marine lieutenant
colonel named Asad Khan. Born in Pakistan and raised in the United
States, a Muslim married to an Episcopalian from Connecticut, Khan
was assigned to classified duties with the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad
from early October until March.</LD>
<TE>   Fluent in Urdu, Pashto and Arabic, Khan quickly became one of the
most important figures in the anti-terrorism campaign, alternating
between delicate diplomatic duty here in the Pakistani capital and
dangerous Special Forces field missions in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "His work was absolutely pivotal," U.S. Ambassador Wendy
Chamberlin said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   In the frantic days following Sept. 11, Khan was one of a handful
of Afghan and Pakistani Americans who helped plug a huge hole in U.S.
intelligence operations, working the front lines as interpreters,
interrogators and liaison officers. They allowed the U.S. to overcome
a major disadvantage by calling on its richly diverse citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   Khan worked with the Pakistani military to set up U.S. bases,
interviewed Afghan informants about Al Qaeda operations, coordinated
the rescue of American aid workers, led a State Department diplomatic
team into Kabul to secure the embassy, and participated in several
missions with Special Forces outside Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   When a key U.S. Embassy intelligence official died of a heart
attack, Khan, who has the highest possible security clearances, took
over his job.</TE>
<TE>   And when an Al Qaeda suspect captured in the hunt for Osama bin
Laden broke out of his plastic handcuffs and attempted to escape,
Khan tackled and restrained him until he could be subdued by military
police.</TE>
<TE>   The overall number of Afghan and Pakistani Americans involved in
the war effort has not been released, although their recruitment by
CIA and Defense Department agencies has been very public. They range
from the very high-profile Zalmay Khalilzad, the former Rand Corp.
analyst who serves as President Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan,
to Wahid Shah, a Southern California real estate broker who worked as
a Dari-language translator for the U.S. military at Bagram air base
north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Because most of their work was secret, few of the men have
received any public recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, now at Camp Lejeune, N.C., preparing for a battalion
command, was recently permitted by military and State Department
authorities to talk about some of his activities, but many others
remain classified.</TE>
<TE>   Another Marine, a mess hall clerk from Salt Lake City, also has
emerged as a hero.</TE>
<TE>   Cpl. Ajmal Achekzai was chosen in November to raise the American
flag over the coalition base near the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar. But until his recent return to his post at Camp Pendleton,
the four months that he spent on the front lines interviewing
prisoners and acting as a guide on forward reconnaissance missions
were kept under wraps.</TE>
<TE>   "Achekzai was the go-to guy," said Marine Maj. Tom Impellitteri,
who took the young clerk with him on the mission to capture Kandahar
airport in November. "Every time we went into a new village he was
the first to dismount and engage the locals."</TE>
<TE>   "They told me I was going to be in Afghanistan for three to five
days; I ended up staying four months," said Achekzai, who before
Sept. 11 had been resigned to a career making sure fighting Marines
had enough water and food packets.</TE>
<TE>   Achekzai was a noncombatant specialist; they are referred to
derisively in the Corps as POGs, or "People Other Than Grunts." But
in his first week in Afghanistan he was involved in a firefight with
a convoy of fleeing Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The contributions of others, however, remain hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted at his suburban San Diego home, real estate broker Shah
would not discuss details of his translation work at Bagram, where he
lived in the intelligence compound known as "Motel 6."</TE>
<TE>   Shah, who grew up in Kabul, said he hopes to go back to
Afghanistan for another tour of duty.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlin said she still works closely at the embassy with
another Pakistani American whose name is kept secret because of the
sensitive nature of his work. Like Khan, the young man, described by
Chamberlin as being in his late 20s, is fluent in Pashto, the
language spoken by nearly 40% of the Afghan population, including
most of the Taliban. Only 6 years old when his family emigrated from
Pakistan to the United States, he also speaks idiomatic American
English and is comfortable with U.S. culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottom line," Chamberlin said, "is that these may be hyphenated
Americans, but they are 100% American."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks after Sept. 11, U.S. diplomats in Islamabad began
hinting that they had some special assets with linguistic skills
embedded in the embassy's intelligence cell, including a field-grade
military officer. It is becoming clear that the most important among
them was Khan, who arrived here Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   His contribution to the U.S. mission is evident in a five-page
letter from embassy officials recommending that the 42-year-old Khan
be awarded the Bronze Star for valor, one of the country's highest
combat awards.</TE>
<TE>   According to the document, a redacted copy of which was obtained
by The Times, Afghans regularly came to the U.S. Embassy compound
here offering "vital information on the location of terrorist
elements and operational planning against Americans in Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was Lt. Col. Khan the only American who could
communicate with them," the document states, "he was the only
American who had the ability to act on the information. For example,
Lt. Col. Khan was involved in an interrogation concerning locations
of possible Al Qaeda safehouses on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border."</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of Pashto-speaking American intelligence agents was
nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   Former CIA official Frank Anderson said that even during the
1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when billions of dollars
were poured into the anti-Soviet moujahedeen movement, the
intelligence agency had only one Pashto speaker, a retired Army
officer who learned the language on a military exchange assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that we never trained Pashto speakers," recalled
Anderson, who directed the CIA's Afghan task force from the agency's
Langley, Va., headquarters from 1987 to 1989. Instead, Anderson said
during an interview in his Washington, D.C., consulting office, the
intelligence agency relied almost exclusively on Pashto-speaking
Pakistani military officers.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, this was not a comfortable arrangement for
U.S. officials. Pakistan had been the fundamentalist Taliban regime's
biggest supporter. Its most vociferous support often came from the
many ethnic Pushtuns serving in the Pakistani army. This made
Americans such as Khan critical to the anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   When not working in the embassy intelligence cell, Khan was often
out in the field on special assignments, sometimes working with
Special Forces units. During the December to January hunt for Bin
Laden in the mountainous Tora Bora region of eastern Afghanistan,
Khan was assigned to take custody of 238 Al Qaeda fighters who had
been captured trying to flee to Pakistan. It was then that he tackled
the escapee.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronze Star recommendation also cites Khan's participation in
operations that remain classified. Two photographs obtained by The
Times show Khan in the field, but the faces of his partners are
obscured for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole experience was like living out a Tom Clancy novel,"
said Khan, reflecting on his 31-year journey from Pakistani schoolboy
to American war hero.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's family hails from a place not far from Pakistan's border
with Afghanistan, near Tora Bora in the White Mountains south of
Jalalabad. He belongs to the Afridi clan, a powerful Pushtun family
known for its fighting skills.</TE>
<TE>   His great-grandfather, grandfather and father were all military
men who served in Kashmir during the British colonial era. A
colorfully written recent book, "History of the Northern Areas of
Pakistan" by Ahmad Hasan Dani, describes one of Khan's more famous
uncles as a "stoutly built, short figure of indomitable courage and
strength [that he] inherited from his ancestral Afridi stock of Tirah
in Northwest Frontier Province but in whose veins also ran the blood
of the land--mountain daring and wild hunting."</TE>
<TE>   After siding with the successful 1947 Pakistani independence
movement, the Khan family settled in the town of Abbottabad, where it
founded the country's first commercial poultry farm and lived
comfortably, allying politically with a succession of military
rulers.</TE>
<TE>   But when Gen. Yahya Khan was forced to step down in 1971, the
family lost its political connections. Their home in Abbottabad was
attacked by armed supporters of Pakistan's new civilian ruler,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, then 11, remembers being awakened by his pistol-packing
father and told that they were leaving for Afghanistan. Using a
forged passport, his father was able to sneak the family, including
all six children, through the Khyber Pass to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being afraid, but I also remember at the time thinking
we were embarking on a great adventure," Khan recalled. "To reassure
us, my mother kept telling us we were on our way to see Disneyland.
But I didn't even know what Disneyland was."</TE>
<TE>   A year of travel as political refugees took the family from
Afghanistan to Spain, Britain and finally the United States. They
settled in West Hartford, Conn., near the poultry company that had
helped the family establish its farm in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, a schoolboy athlete in football and lacrosse, attended Avon
Old Farms preparatory school in Avon, Conn., and later Babson College
outside Boston, where he met his wife, Cheryl. After graduating with
a business degree, Khan volunteered for military service.</TE>
<TE>   "Now here comes the corny part," Khan said in a recent interview.
"America is my country of choice. I wanted to give something back for
the privilege of being an American. No other country in the world
would let an immigrant like me become an officer in its military and
command its offspring."</TE>
<TE>   Khan has done well, rising to lieutenant colonel at a young age
for the notoriously slow-to-promote Marines. He has won appointment
to several of the prestigious command colleges, including the Naval
War College, where he earned a master's degree. He also contributes
regularly to military publications, including an upcoming article on
the anti-terrorism campaign in the Marine Corps Gazette.</TE>
<TE>   Khan qualified for a program maintained by the armed services to
identify soldiers with useful language and cultural skills. Between
1992 and 1993, he spent a year with the Royal Saudi Marines in Saudi
Arabia, where he learned Arabic. In 1999 and 2000, he made two trips
to Pakistan to help combat international drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks struck at the core of Khan's moderate Islamic
beliefs and the American system that had welcomed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just find it an abomination that these people had hijacked our
religion and exploited illiterate and desperate people in that part
of the world," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   It was also personal. "My wife is Episcopalian. We have to honor
each other, to follow the principle the United States abides by." The
couple has three children.</TE>
<TE>   So it was with an evangelical zeal that Khan went to Pakistan.
Chamberlin credits Khan with breaking down the mistrust between the
Pakistani and American militaries following the imposition of
sanctions against Pakistan for developing nuclear weapons. The
ambassador and the Marine fasted together during the holy month of
Ramadan and often broke fast together in the evenings.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlin turned to Khan to direct the rescue of eight Christian
aid workers, including Americans Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer, who
had been kept prisoner for months by the Taliban regime in Kabul.
Working from the embassy in Islamabad, Khan organized their
helicopter rescue, then took the pictures when the two young women
were reunited with their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "This came at a time we were all looking for something good to
happen--and it did," Khan recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In January, while on assignment supervising security along the
Pakistani-Afghan border, Khan found himself poised at the mouth of
the legendary Khyber Pass, where he had stood on the first leg of his
family flight to America.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1971 we were fleeing, not knowing where we were going or when
we would return," he said. "I never imagined that it would take 30
years to come back to the same spot."</TE>
<TE>   Khan said he was struck by the sight of refugees massed at the
border, just as he and his family had been three decades before.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, nothing had changed," he said. "I could have very
easily been any one of them. By the grace of God, and good fortune, I
am an American."</TE>

<HD>Tactical Devices Still Present Major Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S.-Russian strategic arms deal signed Friday in Moscow has won
praise around the globe, yet the agreement says nothing about a class
of atomic weapons that experts believe poses the greatest threat: the
smaller devices called tactical nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of these arms are scattered throughout Russia, in the
form of missile warheads, artillery shells, aircraft bombs and land
mines. Because of the security weaknesses of Russia's decaying
military infrastructure, these explosives are more likely to fall
into the hands of terrorists or "rogue" states than those of any
other country, say Western government officials and independent
experts.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials acknowledge that such tactical weapons pose a
proliferation danger, and they discussed safeguards with Russian
leaders in the talks that led to the treaty signed Friday. But
analysts say the Americans were reluctant to push too hard, for fear
of endangering the agreement to reduce by two-thirds the number of
nuclear warheads deployed by the two nations.</LD>
<TE>   Critics maintain this was a mistake, considering that the Sept. 11
attacks drove home the message that terrorists and rogue regimes
might pose a greater risk than a long-range strike by a former Cold
War adversary.</TE>
<TE>   "In the post-9/11 world, these are the [weapons] that pose the
greatest threat," said Alistair Millar, of the Fourth Freedom Forum,
an arms control group in Washington. "That's a pretty severe
omission."</TE>
<TE>   Some prominent centrist and conservative figures have joined
liberal arms-control advocates in arguing that the United States
should be pushing for greater controls on tactical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), former Clinton administration
Defense Secretary William J. Perry and retired Air Force Gen. Eugene
E. Habiger, former commander of U.S. strategic nuclear forces, argued
this week that top priority should be given to an accurate accounting
of both countries' tactical nuclear arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the nuclear weapons most attractive to terrorists--even
more attractive to them than [radioactive bomb-making] material, and
much more portable than strategic warheads," the three wrote in an
opinion page article in the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Tactical nuclear weapons are generally defined as those designed
for use against military targets on the battlefield. Strategic
nuclear weapons are larger long-range weapons that are designed for
use against cities or strategic nuclear missile forces.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei G. Arbatov, a ranking member of Russia's Duma, or lower
house of parliament, has been quoted as saying that Russia has about
3,800 tactical nuclear weapons. But many Western estimates range as
high as 18,000.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has about 1,670 such devices, according to Millar,
including 180 bombs stored in seven Western European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Tactical weapons are generally compact enough to be carried by one
or two persons, said Millar. They are usually relatively small in
destructive power--equivalent to less than 100 tons of TNT--but they
can also pack as much force as 1 million tons or more of TNT. Some
are 60 times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, Japan,
in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say these weapons pose more of a danger because they are
designed to be set off by front-line troops and do not have the
elaborate safeguards employed with strategic missiles and bombs.
Also, they are deployed in front-line areas near cities, rather than
on remote bases or missile fields.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have insisted that their inventory is safe and
in good hands. But some officials have acknowledged the risks.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Gen. Yevgeny P. Maslin, a Russian defense official in charge
of nuclear munitions, told Special Warfare magazine in 1996 that
theft of nuclear weapons from Russian facilities was "impossible."
But he acknowledged that the weapons were at risk when being
transported and that he was concerned that they could be stolen by
fired nuclear-industry specialists, "social malcontents, embittered
individuals."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no weapons are publicly known to have been stolen. But
there have been unconfirmed reports of Russian tactical weapons being
offered for sale, Millar said.</TE>
<TE>   The International Atomic Energy Agency reported the recent case of
two Lithuanian arms brokers who offered to sell Russian tactical
nuclear weapons to undercover U.S. agents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest sources of Western concern about the tactical
arsenal has been an unnerving absence of information on what has
occurred since Russia began downsizing its arsenal and withdrawing
tactical weapons from former Soviet republics.</TE>
<TE>   After President George Bush, the current American leader's father,
made unilateral cuts in the U.S. tactical force, Russian President
Boris N. Yeltsin promised in 1992 to sharply slash the tactical
force. But since then, there have been only vague statements about
that downsizing.</TE>
<TE>   One obstacle to any reduction in the Russian arsenal is the
suggestion from Bush administration officials that the Pentagon might
need to develop a new class of small "bunker-buster" nuclear weapons
to destroy deeply buried enemy command posts and weapons storage
facilities. U.S. officials have publicly denied that they have
decided to build such new weapons, but several officials are known to
privately favor such an effort.</TE>
<TE>   North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials have openly expressed
their concerns about Russia's tactical inventory.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the tactical force has become even more important to Russian
defense in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Russia no longer has enough money to maintain the robust
conventional forces it would like. And many in the country feel
threatened by the continuing expansion of NATO, which is expected
this year to add seven members, including Baltic states and others on
Russia's western flank.</TE>
<TE>   "They see this as their nuclear equalizer," said Thomas Z. Collina
of the Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration had hoped to make progress on the
subject. In 1997 in Helsinki, Finland, President Clinton got Yeltsin
to agree to further discussions. But the American leader made no
further headway, and the Bush administration has so far made it a
second-tier issue.</TE>
<TE>   John R. Bolton, undersecretary of State for arms control, said in
March that U.S. officials had raised the tactical weapons control
issue "periodically over the last year, and I'm sure we'll continue
to discuss it with them."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the administration's first priority with the Russians
was the ballistic missile treaty, the second was the offensive
strategic arsenal and the third was other proliferation issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue of tactical nuclear weapons is still out there," he
said in an interview with Arms Control Today magazine.</TE>

<HD>Bush and Putin Sign Nuclear Arms Treaty</HD>
<DH>Pact: Two-thirds of each nation's arsenal would be
deactivated within 10 years. Russia's aid to Iran on an atomic plant
is still a point of contention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Closing one of the last chapters of the Cold War and proclaiming a
new cooperative relationship, President Bush and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin signed a treaty Friday to cut by two-thirds the
number of deployed warheads in their nations' nuclear arsenals.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush was unable to budge Putin from Russia's support of an
Iranian nuclear power project. U.S. officials fear the deal will
increase the risk that terrorists could gain nuclear weapons
technology.</LD>
<LD>   The arms control pact coupled with the differences over nuclear
proliferation illustrates how the U.S.-Russian relationship has
changed. The two presidents have found new areas for strategic
cooperation, which they emphasized, but the multibillion-dollar
nuclear project is too economically tantalizing for cash-deprived
Russia to abandon.</LD>
<TE>   The treaty places "a period of time in the rearview mirror of both
countries," Bush said at the Kremlin.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders also agreed to expand their nations' limited
cooperation on the development of missile defense systems.</TE>
<TE>   In reach, brevity and the speed of the negotiation that produced
it, the nuclear arms agreement is a stark reflection of the changes
that have occurred in the world since Moscow and Washington began
their rapprochement barely a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The two nations now deploy about 6,000 nuclear warheads each. The
pact, if ratified by the Senate and both houses of the Russian
parliament, would reduce the number to no more than 2,200 by the end
of 2012, its expiration date. Under the pact, the decommissioned
warheads would be stored or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast with the several years of negotiations needed to
produce the early arms control treaties between the United States and
the Soviet Union, this one was finished in a matter of months. And
rather than spelling out in voluminous detail each step in the
removal of weapons, the treaty's five articles are written in a total
of 10 sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The presidents signed the pact and a joint statement "on the new
strategic relationship" between their nations in the grand St.
Andrew's Hall, the former throne room of the czars that Peter the
Great dedicated in 1698.</TE>
<TE>   The documents were contained in leather binders, two in red, two
in black. Aides passed them from one president to the other for
signing.</TE>
<TE>   The convergence of policies--on arms control, the war on
terrorism, economic cooperation and other issues--was matched by a
sartorial convergence: Each president wore a navy blue suit and white
tab-collar shirt. Their blue ties differed only in tone. Bush was the
man with the American flag pin on his left lapel.</TE>
<TE>   But more than the policy agreements and dress demonstrated the
breadth of the changes taking place in U.S.-Russian cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where residents were once kept in the dark about where
top officials lived, Bush and his wife, Laura, had dinner Friday
evening with Putin and his wife, Lyudmila, at a suburban dacha that
serves as the Putins' personal residence. The couples spent the night
at the wooded estate that fronts on the Moscow River. In November,
the Putins stayed at the Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop of a Cold War relationship turned domesticated,
however, only drew attention to the contentiousness of the Russian
project helping Iran develop a nuclear power plant in Bushehr.</TE>
<TE>   The two presidents played down those differences at a news
conference after they signed the treaty. But a senior Bush
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, made
clear that no significant progress could be reported. He said that
the two sides had discussed the issue in the past and that Bush
thinks "there is a way we can move forward."</TE>
<TE>   To Russia's denial that it is doing anything that could transfer
nuclear weapons technology to Iran, the official said dryly: "It's
interesting that Iran, which is not a country with an energy
shortage," would spend large sums developing a nuclear power
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official said that Putin and Bush discussed the
matter extensively and that the Russian leader "strongly defended the
civilian nature" of the assistance his nation is providing Iran.</TE>
<TE>   At their news conference, Bush and Putin also said they had spent
considerable time on the issue during their approximately two hours
of private meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about Iran and I'm confident Vladimir Putin worries about
Iran, and that was confirmed today," Bush said. "He understands
terrorist threats, just like we understand terrorist threats. And he
understands that weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to Russia,
just as they are to America."</TE>
<TE>   Expressing their shared concern that "a nontransparent government
run by radical clerics doesn't get their hands on weapons of mass
destruction," Bush added: "He gave me some assurances that I think
will be very comforting for you to listen to."</TE>
<TE>   Putin pronounced nuclear proliferation a key international
security problem and said "cooperation between Iran and Russia is not
at all a character which would undermine the process on
nonproliferation."</TE>
<TE>   Then, he tried to turn the issue back to Bush. He pointed to U.S.
support for civilian nuclear development in North Korea and said that
missile development programs in Iran are based largely on Western
technology and the support of Western companies. The United States
has promised to help North Korea obtain two light-water reactors if
the Communist nation opens its nuclear program to international
monitors.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute aside, Bush and Putin competed to see who could
present a more optimistic report.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the treaty they signed "liquidates the Cold War legacy
of nuclear hostility between our countries" and brings a spirit of
cooperation and trust.</TE>
<TE>   Putin said their steps toward stability were "in the interest of
all the civilized human society."</TE>
<TE>   Defending the arrangement under which warheads can be stockpiled,
but need not be destroyed, against criticism that the weapons could
be redeployed in weeks, Putin, a former KGB officer, said anyone who
has held a rifle knows that it is safer to have it disarmed or
disassembled "rather than to have it in your arms and charged with
bullets in it and with your finger on the trigger at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian president, who appears to maintain a mostly dour
expression, used self-deprecating humor to illustrate the
nitty-gritty level of his economic discussions with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   They talked about trade in aircraft and poultry, he said, noting
that presidents might say such matters are not important enough for
them to raise and then launch "a lengthy monologue on specific
matters."</TE>
<TE>   And he made a pitch for better access to the American market for
the Russian metals industry, saying "had Americans bought our cheap
aluminum and steel, then their aircraft would have been cheaper and
more competitive, including in our market."</TE>
<TE>   The two governments turned out a thick sheaf of joint
declarations.</TE>
<TE>   They stated their readiness to cooperate in the area of missile
defense, only months ago one of the more contentious issues between
them as the U.S. neared abandonment of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty. A White House official said they would seek to share
information and technology, but no specific arrangements were made.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrating the expansion of the relationship, they initiated
government-to-government cooperation in researching nuclear power
plant fuels and agreed to work together on eliminating weapons-grade
nuclear material and trying to reduce volatility in the international
energy market as they cooperate on various energy projects.</TE>
<TE>   They also pledged cooperation in the Middle East and a continued
alliance in the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In a carefully choreographed visit--which will continue today when
the two presidents share a stage at St. Petersburg State University,
Putin's alma mater--a moment of spontaneity crept in.</TE>
<TE>   The two presidents and their wives had been scheduled to stroll at
midafternoon through the Kremlin's Cathedral Square, bordered by
historic churches. U.S. Embassy officials said the Russians had
planned to clear the area of tourists and bring in art school
students with their easels.</TE>
<TE>   The students showed up, the tourists were never shooed away, and
the two couples encountered the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   As they passed the church of St. Michael the Archangel, where the
16th century czar Ivan the Terrible is buried, they were surrounded
by the students, tourists and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   After seven minutes of mingling, they headed back to Putin's
office.</TE>

<HD>Pope Accepts Resignation of Milwaukee Archbishop</HD>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>MILWAUKEE -- Pope John Paul II accepted the resignation Friday of the
archbishop of Milwaukee, who had long struggled to open his church to
modern sexual values only to leave torn up over his own moral
complexities.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop Rembert Weakland, the spiritual leader of Milwaukee
Catholics, has been accused of sexually assaulting a man 23 years
ago. He denies there was an assault but has admitted to others to a
relationship. The archdiocese paid his accuser $450,000 out of church
coffers to prevent a lawsuit and to obtain his silence.</LD>
<LD>   Weakland is "remorseful for the strain and stress this brought on
the archdiocese and the church" and plans to make a public apology,
said his spokesman, Jerry Topczewski, at a news conference Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Weakland's resignation marked a particularly poignant moment in
the four-month-long sexual abuse scandal that has resulted in
accusations against more than 200 Roman Catholic priests and put the
church's American leaders under pressure to adopt a national
"one-strike" guideline.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland submitted a resignation letter to the pope in April on
his 75th birthday, the mandatory retirement age for bishops. But
after Paul Marcoux, who says Weakland "date raped" him in 1979, broke
his silence on ABC News this week, the archbishop asked the pope to
speed up the resignation. He hadn't expected to leave until fall. But
Weakland said in a statement Thursday he did not want to be an
obstacle "to the church's search for credibility" when it was in
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The pope made the resignation effective immediately, and an
auxiliary bishop was named Friday to assume Weakland's duties while
the Vatican looks for his replacement to lead Milwaukee's 600,000
Roman Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland was not merely the most prominent churchman to face
sexual misconduct charges, he also enjoyed high moral standing among
his fellow bishops, who regarded him as a rare progressive agitator
for opening the church on many issues, sometimes upsetting his
conservative brothers. He had quietly pressured for the ordination of
women and worked to bridge the gap between conservative and liberal
church thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, his downfall came not through the molestation of a
child, a felony, but for a relationship with a theology student who
was 31 at the time, a circumstance that may cast more uncomfortable
light on a priesthood that experts say is at least one-fifth
homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide leader of the Benedictine order before going to
Milwaukee, Weakland was also known for starting a program there 12
years ago that provided support for priest abuse victims and
treatment for offenders.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is hard for all Catholics here,'' said Jim Olsen, a
42-year-old developer who has attended numerous Milwaukee-area
parishes during his 20 years here. ''This is a very Catholic city.
And almost everyone knew Archbishop Weakland and admired him.''</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Dist. Atty. E. Michael McCann has acknowledged that
Weakland told him many years ago that he had had a consensual, if not
troubling, relationship with a man. "He advised me that he had a
relationship that had compromised him in some fashion," McCann told
the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in Friday's editions. "He was troubled
by it, but there was nothing criminal in it."</TE>
<TE>   But McCann said he would now consider appointing a special
prosecutor to determine the source of $450,000 the archdiocese paid
to Marcoux after he threatened to file a civil suit against it and
Weakland in the late 1990s. McCann said he wanted to know whether the
money came from specific programs such as Catholic Charities or from
general contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Topczewski, the archdiocese spokesman, told reporters Friday that
none of the money used to pay Marcoux came from annual fund-raising
campaigns or from individual parish contributions. Generally,
settlements for abuse claims are paid from investment income, rental
property and other sources, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland has said he had paid into the archdiocesan coffers more
than $450,000 by giving over all his lecture and writing fees during
his tenure as bishop. Church officials apparently plan to provide an
exact accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Marcoux was taking theology courses at Marquette University in the
late 1970s when he met the archbishop, who one evening invited him to
his apartment to discuss Marcoux possibly joining the priesthood.
Marcoux, then 31, claims Weakland, then 52, forced himself on him
sexually. Marcoux, now 54, told reporters that their sexual
relationship did not go further. But in an 11-page, handwritten
letter to Marcoux in 1980, Weakland reveals an intimate relationship
between the two men, though it does not appear to provide support for
Marcoux's claims of assault.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop told Marcoux in the letter that he felt he was not
being honest with God and that he felt like "the world's worst
hypocrite. So gradually I came back to the importance of celibacy in
my life."</TE>
<TE>   While Weakland had given Marcoux $14,000 of his own savings for a
church project 17 years later, in 1997, Marcoux wrote to Weakland
asking that the two meet with "objective arbitrators" in hopes of
"reaching some closure" on the so-called abuse incident. The payment
and confidentiality agreement were done in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Police Scour Park for Clues in Chandra Levy's Death</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Medical examiners have not yet determined a
cause, but police officials appear close to declaring the case a
homicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Awaiting word from medical examiners on the cause and
timing of Chandra Levy's death, police continued hunting for more
evidence Friday as they reconstructed the possible crime scene.</LD>
<LD>   Conceding that sweeps last year had skipped the wooded slope where
a man walking his dog discovered Levy's remains Wednesday,
investigators now are relying on forensic anthropologists and a
computer positioning device for a more thorough canvassing for clues.</LD>
<LD>   "If the body was there during the search [last year], it's obvious
we missed it," said District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Chief
Charles H. Ramsey.</LD>
<TE>   The "total station" computer grid normally is used to measure skid
marks in traffic accidents. But investigators were plotting evidence
found along the steep hillside in Rock Creek Park in hopes of
learning whether Levy died at the scene or whether her body was
discarded there after she was killed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Medical examiners said they likely would not make a determination
on the cause of death until next week. They were conducting a
pathological examination on a cracked portion of Levy's cranium,
still uncertain what caused the fissure. But reports mounted Friday
suggesting that police had already made up their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Medical examiners need to "do further tests on the remains that
they have," said Deputy Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer. Asked if
investigators were leaning toward ruling Levy's death a homicide,
Gainer said: "Given the circumstances, it seems like that."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey and other senior Metro police officials declined to comment
on unconfirmed reports that detectives had found some of Levy's
clothes knotted together, suggesting she may have been restrained
before she died.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not talking about the specifics of a crime scene," Ramsey
said. "And because I can't comment on it, it gives it some validity."</TE>
<TE>   At one point Friday, one of the lead homicide detectives in the
Levy case and other investigators were seen crossing their wrists as
they talked over their findings near the grassy site.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did say that it would have been difficult for someone to
have dumped Levy's body so deep in the woods. Her remains were
recovered just off a rugged hiking trail thick with trees and rocks,
more than 100 feet away from the nearest road, across a rock-clogged
creek and up a steep incline.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you are driving a car right up to where that body
was found," Ramsey said. But investigators also reportedly are
mulling the possibility that Levy's body could have been dumped from
the top of the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Washington lawyer William R. "Billy" Martin, who has
led a private investigation for Levy's parents in Modesto, said he
already has concluded that the 24-year-old former intern was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Police, Martin said, "will upgrade this death investigation to a
homicide investigation. Chandra Levy did not walk over to that park,
fall down that hill and die."</TE>
<TE>   In Modesto--where Robert Levy and his wife, Susan, have not
emerged from their house in two days--family friends said they were
making preparations for a town memorial service Tuesday in a civic
hall.</TE>

<HD>Financier Pleads Guilty to More Charges</HD>
<DH>Court: Ex-fugitive admits to nine counts in Mississippi.
Officials seek the stolen assets.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAYMOND, Miss.</DL>
<LD>RAYMOND, Miss. -- Martin Frankel, the financier accused of swindling
more than $200 million from insurance companies while living in
luxury, pleaded guilty to corruption charges in Mississippi on
Friday, more than a week after his guilty plea to federal charges for
the same scam.</LD>
<LD>   The 47-year-old former fugitive pleaded guilty to nine counts of
mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and one count of making false
statements and representations. He faces up to five years in prison
on each count.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge L. Breland Hilburn deferred sentencing for a year as
part of a deal with state and federal prosecutors. Frankel has agreed
to cooperate in the investigation and possible recovery of assets.</LD>
<TE>   State insurance officials said Friday they have recovered from $80
million to $90 million. Most of the looted money was from Mississippi
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Commissioner George Dale said policyholders have been
reimbursed from a state fund financed by assessments on life
insurance companies doing business in Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Looking pale and thin, Frankel responded only briefly to questions
by Hilburn on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He was represented by a public defender.</TE>
<TE>   Hilburn approved Frankel's return to authorities in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel is accused of gaining control of small insurance companies
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee and
stealing cash from the company reserves. The FBI said he put the
money in banks around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In Mississippi, Frankel and unnamed co-conspirators are accused of
taking $192 million from First National Life Insurance Co. of
America, Franklin Protective Life Insurance Co., and Family Guaranty
Life Insurance Co. The companies have been in liquidation since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He ran the scam from a two-mansion compound in tony Greenwich,
Conn., that he turned into a warren of offices with more than 80
computers and wide-screen televisions tuned to financial news
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Frankel spent money on private planes, luxury
cars, pricey wines and lavish gifts for women.</TE>
<TE>   On May 15, Frankel pleaded guilty to 24 federal corruption charges
in New Haven, Conn. For those charges, he could get up to 150 years
in prison and $6.5 million in fines at sentencing next year.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Will Try to Net Sick Orca</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Scientists will try to capture an ailing orphan orca that's been
languishing in Puget Sound for several months and return her to her
native pod in Canada, the National Marine Fisheries Service said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Fisheries service officials said that while it would be a
high-risk operation, it would be best to remove the young female
killer whale from the busy waters off Vashon Island as soon as
possible.</LD>
<LD>   After a few weeks of rehabilitation in a pen, the whale would be
relocated to Johnstone Strait off Canada's Vancouver Island, the
summer home of her pod.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to emphasize this is a first. It has never been done
before," Bob Lohn, regional administrator for NMFS, said at a news
conference. "We don't know what the prospects are, but we think it is
worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   Lohn said a team of scientists is being assembled to determine the
best way to capture, treat, transport and prepare the young female
for return to her pod. Although whales have been captured in the wild
and placed in captivity, no one has yet captured a wild whale and
reintroduced it into a pod.</TE>
<TE>   No schedule has been set, he said, but officials hope to capture
the whale in two or three weeks, spend another two weeks giving it
medical tests and treatment, then transport it to the strait in a day
if possible. The whale then would be kept in a netted-off section of
a bay for about two weeks or until her native pod arrives on its
annual migration south, in approximately mid- to late July.</TE>
<TE>   Lohn had no cost estimate for the operation but said it could
easily be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. He said NMFS may
apply for federal grants to help pay the cost and turn to
public-interest groups to get additional funding from private donors.</TE>
<TE>   Lohn repeatedly emphasized the risk of the capture and relocation,
but said it was better than leaving the whale, whose health appears
to be deteriorating, in Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really proceeding on very unknown ground," Lohn said.</TE>

<HD>FBI Brass Accused of Apathy</HD>
<DH>Investigations: Former agent wrote that Phoenix officials
failed to make anti-terrorism a priority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN and RICH CONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>FBI agents attempting to investigate terrorism were hamstrung for
years by top officials here despite abundant evidence of Middle
Eastern extremists, according to a letter sent to FBI headquarters
late last year by a longtime special agent.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, written five months before the now-famous flight
school warning memo by Phoenix agent Kenneth Williams became public,
portrayed counter-terrorism as "the lowest investigative priority in
the Phoenix Division."</LD>
<LD>   "The [international anti-terrorism] program ground to a halt a
couple years ago because of the micromanaging, constant indecision,
and stonewalling," retired Special Agent James H. Hauswirth wrote in
his two-page December letter to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.</LD>
<TE>   As far back as 1994, the 27-year FBI veteran said in the letter
reviewed by The Times, the Phoenix office had evidence of Islamic
potential terrorists operating in the region. That year, agents were
monitoring a Phoenix FBI informant who had been recruited as a
suicide bomber, the letter says. One of those recruiting the
informant, according to a source, was linked to a terrorist involved
in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1998, the office's international terrorism squad
investigated a possible Middle Eastern extremist taking flight
lessons at a Phoenix airport, wrote Hauswirth, who retired from the
FBI in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such activities, the commitment to anti-terrorism by some
in top management at the Phoenix office was lukewarm at best,
according to Hauswirth. One top Phoenix FBI official described
anti-terrorism investigations as "hokey-pokey work" before Sept. 11,
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, just maybe," the Dec. 6 letter concluded, "we could have
been one step ahead of the eight ball on Sept. 11, 2001 if the
[international terrorism] program had the full support of top
management in the Phoenix division."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations, echoed by other former agents here, in some sense
mirror complaints by a Minneapolis FBI lawyer this week about
inaction at bureau headquarters in the Zacarias Moussaoui case. That
letter claims officials in Washington set up a "roadblock" for
Minneapolis agents, who were pursuing a search warrant on the radical
flight school student just weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Special Agent Manuel Johnson, spokesman for the division,
said Friday he was not aware of Hauswirth's letter and neither he nor
Special Agent in Charge Guadalupe Gonzalez could discuss the
allegations because of ongoing oversight investigations.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokesman in Washington, D.C., also declined to comment,
other than to say it is not uncommon for the bureau headquarters to
receives letters from former agents critical of operations. "They
write the letters after they leave because they don't have the
[nerve] to write them while they're still agents," the spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Letter Reflected Broader Concerns</TE>
<TE>   In a one-paragraph January response, Director Mueller thanked
Hauswirth, saying the matter had been referred to the appropriate
personnel for review. Hauswirth's letter prompted a brief interview
by an FBI official as part of a routine office audit.</TE>
<TE>   Hauswirth declined to comment on his letter. But records and
interviews show it reflected broader concerns among some current and
former FBI agents in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who work [international terrorism] have been
frustrated," said another former Phoenix agent. "Management didn't
take them as seriously as it should have."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Phoenix memo author Williams, who appeared before
congressional committees this week, left the international terrorism,
or IT, squad in frustration, according to two sources. He was later
persuaded to rejoin when a new squad leader was appointed, the
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   That such complaints were festering in an FBI office that produced
what now appears to be a model of anti-terrorism foresight is more
instructive than surprising, agency veterans said.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not unique to Phoenix, several added.</TE>
<TE>   Until the Sept. 11 skyjacking attacks on New York and Washington,
many FBI field office managers viewed crimes such as bank robberies
and high-profile busts of drug dealers as their bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked down on people who worked for counterintelligence
because they couldn't show results. They're not arresting people,"
said one former federal law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been the lowest priority throughout my ... years with the
FBI," said another retired agent. "That is probably because [before
Sept. 11], we hadn't been hit between the eyes since Pearl Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Informant's Bomb Training Videotaped</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the Bush administration are debating how best to
refocus the mission of the FBI and permanently shift resources from
areas such as bank heists and identity theft to the fight against
international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Hauswirth's letter, while not as long or detailed as Williams'
memo, highlights the potential significance of the investigations by
the Phoenix international terrorism squad.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1994, the Phoenix IT squad developed an informant who was
being trained to be a suicide bomber," the letter says. "In fact, the
Phoenix [Special Operations Group] videotaped the man being taken out
into the desert and being trained to set off bombs."</TE>
<TE>   One of the men tracked by FBI surveillance was an associate of
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Muslim cleric imprisoned for the
1993 World Trade Center bombing, according to a law enforcement
source familiar with that investigation.</TE>
<TE>   For almost three months, the source added, agents had the two men
under surveillance before moving on to another investigation. The
suspects were never charged, though it was not known if they remain
under surveillance by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1998, Phoenix FBI agents investigated a Middle
Eastern flight student who had received literature from a suspected
terrorist fund-raising group, according to the Hauswirth letter.</TE>
<TE>   That man was never linked to terrorism or the Sept. 11 attacks.
But some familiar with the 1998 investigation believe it may have led
Williams to his subsequent observations that Middle Eastern students
sympathetic to Osama bin Laden were attending Phoenix-area aviation
schools.</TE>
<TE>   By early 2000, Phoenix anti-terrorism agents were monitoring a
group of Middle Eastern students at small flight schools, as well as
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of those students, Zakaria Soubra, acknowledged in
The Times last fall that he was a member of the Arizona chapter of Al
Muhajiroun, a virulently anti-American group based in London. Some
intelligence officials suspect the group of links to Bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Soubra, who is Lebanese, said he endorsed Al Muhajiroun's vision
for Muslim world rule but said he opposed violence against American
civilians. He has not been charged with any crime and is expected to
complete his senior year in aeronautical studies next year.</TE>
<TE>   It was partly the concern about Al Muhajiroun and connections to
flight schools that prompted Williams' July memo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conflicts Developed Over Paying Operatives</TE>
<TE>   While FBI officials have pointed out that none of those referenced
in Williams' memo have been linked to the Sept. 11 terrorism,
authorities knew just hours after the East Coast attacks that
skyjacker Hani Hanjour had trained at Arizona flight schools. Hanjour
was the suspected pilot of the American Airlines flight that crashed
into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Months before the 2001 attacks, Williams appeared to be trying to
muster resources for a large-scale prevention push by sending his
e-mail memo to Washington urging a nationwide investigation of
possible Al Qaeda infiltration of U.S. flight schools. Congressional
investigators are examining why the memo did not make it to the
highest levels of the FBI and why it was not connected with other
warning signs of a terrorist strike.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a 12-year FBI veteran who also trained as a SWAT team
leader and sniper, was working on the international terrorism squad
then made up of just eight to 10 agents--a fraction of the roughly
200 agents assigned to Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had developed an expertise in Middle Eastern extremist
groups. Records and interviews show he worked closely with another
squad member, agent George Piro, one of the few FBI agents nationwide
who is fluent in multiple Arabic languages.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the IT squad began developing paid operatives
with ties to Arizona's Muslim community, records and interviews show.</TE>
<TE>   But conflicts developed between the IT squad and the Phoenix
office management, partly over money that agents thought was needed
to keep paid informants working, according to sources familiar with
the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show at least one former informant in the Muslim
community near Tempe sued the FBI in 1999, claiming his payments were
dramatically reduced. IT squad members blamed a "new boss," records
show.</TE>
<TE>   "These [management] guys did not want to pay sources," said one
former agent who discussed the rift with the anti-terrorism squad.</TE>
<TE>   "They just didn't understand what [the squad] did." Without money,
the source added, "you're not going to get the informants you want."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top Agent in Phoenix Target of Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Much of the criticism in the letter is directed at Phoenix Special
Agent in Charge Gonzalez. A former Marine, Gonzalez has a background
in drug investigations and by some accounts favored those
investigations over counterterrorism probes.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, sources said, Gonzalez rejected an IT squad
proposal to build a database for the hundreds of Arizona leads and
reports tied to the Sept. 11 investigation, using the FBI's Rapid
Start tip management program.</TE>
<TE>   One source said Gonzalez told agents to just box up their reports
and ship them to the FBI in New York because it was that office's
case.</TE>

<HD>Missed Memo Stirs More Trouble at FBI</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Phoenix agent sent his July report to the same
supervisor who was working Moussaoui case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Phoenix FBI agent's memo warning about terrorists at flight schools
last summer was sent to the same FBI counter-terrorism supervisor in
Washington who dealt with suspicions in Minnesota surrounding flight
school student Zacarias Moussaoui, government officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But, for unknown reasons, the supervisor apparently never saw
agent Kenneth Williams' memo, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosures raise new questions about whether FBI officials
should have been able to piece together parallel suspicions last
summer in Arizona and Minnesota concerning flight schools to detect
the possibility of an imminent attack.</LD>
<TE>   Questions about the FBI's performance leading up to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon erupted
anew this week after the disclosure of a letter from the chief lawyer
in the Minneapolis FBI office chastising the bureau for its handling
of the Moussaoui case.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Friday that one criticism levied by Coleen Rowley's
letter is that Minneapolis agents had corroborated from French
intelligence sources their suspicions that Moussaoui was a suspected
terrorist--not merely a radical Islamic fundamentalist. But FBI
officials in Washington deleted that information in considering a
request for a special surveillance search warrant against Moussaoui,
the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at her office Friday, Rowley told The Times she was
"extremely concerned" about the issues raised in her letter. "I can't
comment. I'm in a position where I can't comment at all to the media.
I'm, of course, very concerned. I'd be crazy if I wasn't concerned.
But I'm not going to explain" the allegations raised in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Defending their handling of the Minnesota and Arizona cases from
critics inside and outside the bureau, FBI officials have maintained
for weeks that the two investigations operated largely on separate
tracks, with different people responsible for each case.</TE>
<TE>   But government officials familiar with the investigations said
Friday that Williams sent his July 10 memo directly to the attention
of David Frasca, who heads the FBI's Radical Fundamentalist Unit in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Frasca's role is significant because he also was the key liaison
in Washington for the Minnesota FBI field office in its failed
efforts to get permission to do a secret search of Moussaoui's
belongings.</TE>
<TE>   A search approved immediately after Sept. 11 revealed a flight
training simulator program on Moussaoui's computer and other possible
terrorist tools. Authorities now believe that he may have been the
"20th hijacker" had he not been taken into custody. He has been
indicted on terrorism charges that could bring the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't Frasca and his special counter-terrorism unit in
Washington draw a connection between suspicious flight school
activities in Arizona and Minnesota?</TE>
<TE>   A government official who asked not to be identified said Frasca
"did not see [the Phoenix memo] until after 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   The official was unwilling to say why that happened--a question
that could be key in congressional reviews into the FBI's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, three senior members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee--Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sens. Charles E.
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.)--asked FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III in a letter Friday to explain Frasca's role in
the probes. The letter sought information on "what connection, if
any, [Frasca] or others drew between the two ongoing investigations,
and whether he or others brought such a connection to the attention
of higher level FBI officials."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate statement, Grassley said that "if FBI headquarters
is still handling terrorism information like it handled the Moussaoui
case, we're in grave danger."</TE>
<TE>   A congressional official who asked not to be identified said
lawmakers will seek to determine whether Frasca did in fact see
Williams' memo and why his unit never adequately linked Williams'
suspicions to the Moussaoui case.</TE>
<TE>   The two cases were "at the same desk. You'd think they could have
put it together," a congressional source said. "The only explanation
can be that either [Frasca] did not make the mental connection or he
did not read a memo that was addressed to him."</TE>
<TE>   Agents in Minneapolis were apparently made aware of Williams'
concerns in late August or early September, but were not sent his
memo, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did officials in Washington take Williams up on his
recommendation to canvass flight schools around the country for
Middle Eastern terrorist suspects, a recommendation that some FBI
officials now say would have been impractical because of the numbers
of students at such schools. Such an undertaking also would have
raised serious civil rights concerns, some officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy in Phoenix did a really good job, but he didn't have a
smoking gun," one federal law enforcement official close to the case
said. "If we went out and started canvassing, we'd get in trouble for
targeting Arab Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Several law enforcement officials said a culture of fear had
pervaded FBI counter-terrorism agents, particularly before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Agents in the field, said one Justice Department official, "are
afraid of being accused of profiling in some cases, or of
discrimination, basing their request solely on the race of the
individual rather than on evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, agents in Phoenix and Minneapolis pursued the cases
aggressively, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But fresh questions are being raised about whether their superiors
then failed to follow through.</TE>
<TE>   As the FBI and the Justice Department gear up for congressional
hearings, they are reviewing the matter internally and focusing on
how the Phoenix memo and the Minneapolis office's request for a
special warrant were handled at the field office level and, more
important, once they reached Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among the points of contention: whether a supervisor in
Minneapolis also changed the wording of the warrant request to make
it harder for it to be approved. The request was made under the 1978
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which lets the
government monitor suspected foreign agents or terrorists with the
approval of a secret court in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The [special agent in charge] in Minneapolis looked at it and
made substantive changes that made it harder for the lawyers [in
Washington] to say yes," the Justice Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Several government officials who defend the FBI's handling of the
Moussaoui matter said the case simply wasn't strong enough to bring
to the FISA court, particularly after a judge on the panel criticized
the FBI for abusing its authority in past requests.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew [the case] stunk, but we couldn't put our finger on
it," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In the charged political atmosphere of Washington, FBI and Justice
Department officials spent Friday quietly trying to find answers--and
political cover.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard sorting it out. You don't know what the truth is," one
law enforcement official said. "Everyone is trying to cover their
behinds, and this is what you get when everyone is running for
cover."</TE>
<TE>   Outside Washington, the week's controversy has deepened a rift
between agents in the 56 field offices and officials at FBI
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Many field agents echoed Rowley's complaints about how things
don't get taken seriously at headquarters unless they are developed
there. Even special Al Qaeda trackers in a New York-based unit
complained that their efforts weren't given proper respect at
headquarters, even before Mueller moved earlier this month to
consolidate almost all counter-terrorism activities at headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows the dissatisfaction with Mueller among street
agents," one official said. "He is not perceived as defending the
people in the field. There are two FBIs: headquarters and people in
the field. And the feeling is that they are circling the wagons only
at headquarters. There are some really bright investigators in the
field, and they sometimes feel like they are not taken seriously
enough."</TE>

<HD>That Bad Feeling Extends Beyond Bryant</HD>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the Lakers have to show some intestinal fortitude, they had
better hope Kobe Bryant's gastrointestinal problems are finished.</LD>
<LD>   The four three-pointers he knocked down in the fourth quarter of
the Lakers' loss in Game 3 Friday night were the only signs that the
Sacramento Hyatt's room service vs. Bryant's stomach won't go down as
the most important matchup of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   That double-team of a bad bacon cheeseburger and cheesecake tore
through Bryant's stomach, left him weak for Game 2, wrecked the
Lakers' workouts and helped sink the Lakers in the first quarter of
Game 3, when the series swung in the Sacramento Kings' favor.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant's five-for-12 shooting in the fourth quarter, when he made
half of his eight three-point attempts, was the only evidence to
support all of the talk that he felt fine. It enabled him to finish
with 22 points on eight-for-24 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Beforehand, Laker Coach Phil Jackson said that Bryant "showed good
color; he was vibrant."</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could say the same thing about my television set.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the Lakers' training staff said Bryant didn't complain
all day, that the food poisoning had run its course.</TE>
<TE>   It sure didn't look that way at the start of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was sluggish. He came up short on almost every jump shot,
and made only three of his first 15 shots. There weren't any
acrobatic drives to the hoop. He had only two rebounds and two free
throws.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches always say to conserve energy on offense and use it on
defense, and that's exactly what Bryant appeared to be doing. Only he
acted as if there were another Enron-caused power shortage.</TE>
<TE>   When the Laker offense went dormant in the first quarter--a time
when Bryant would normally demand the ball and then harass his
teammates all the way to the timeout huddle if they didn't give it to
him--he was strangely silent. He just disappeared for a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   But he was active on defense, running around the court and waving
his arms. The player he covered, Doug Christie, scored only five
points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Things switched in the fourth quarter. Bryant somehow found enough
lift to drain those four three-pointers, one of them when he was
fouled.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how spent he was in the first half, with everything
that went on in the last week," Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman said.
"He certainly didn't look spent in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   But Bryant did move in slow motion on defense. Mad dashes and
scrambles turned into jogs. The late rotations were one reason the
Kings managed to score 28 points in the fourth quarter, which turned
the Lakers' three-point barrage and 38 points of their own into
nothing more than a fireworks show.</TE>
<TE>   "My energy felt pretty good," Bryant said. "You know, rhythm was
obviously a little out, as far as getting legs under shots and things
like that. But I was happy my legs finally came around. I feel
confident going into the next game."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said one reason the Lakers looked so horrendous at the
start of this game could be traced to the food poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a good practice week," Jackson said. "Things came
apart over the course of this week, we didn't have a good work
schedule, which is kind of natural, I guess, if Kobe's in and out of
practices and wasn't feeling so great in others."</TE>
<TE>   Laker trainer Gary Vitti said it's not farfetched for the effects
of the stomach distress to last through a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally with food poisoning like this, you can have a real
irritation of your [gastrointestinal] tract," Vitti said. "That sort
of violent vomiting and all of that can really irritate that system."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers can't sit back and use Bryant as an excuse. Even when
he produced a sickly two points in the first half, it was two more
points than the Kings have from the injured Peja Stojakovic in the
entire series.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the burger, Bryant still gave the Lakers 44 points in
80 minutes of basketball. The reasons for their 2-1 deficit are much
more complex than that. There are so many other things wrong with
them right now, on offense and defense, it's time to move on.</TE>
<TE>   How much have things been turned upside down? The first half of
this game was the first time I have watched a game involving Bryant
and Vlade Divac and not marveled about what a great date in history
July 11, 1996, was for the Lakers. That's the day the Lakers sent
Divac to Charlotte for the draft rights to Bryant, a move that
enabled them to get two future Hall of Famers because it also freed
up salary cap room to sign Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   It was such a great deal that even Divac has said he would have
made it if he were Jerry West.</TE>
<TE>   For once, Divac brought more to the table than Bryant. He was the
single most important player on the court in the first quarter, when
the game was won.</TE>
<TE>   Divac played good defense, legitimate defense, on O'Neal, forcing
him farther from the basket than the Laker center had been at any
point in the series (O'Neal shot one for four in the quarter). Divac
was great in stopping the ball as well, blocking a Robert Horry dunk
and breaking up an alley-oop attempt for O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   On offense, he sank a couple of jumpers, he drove right at O'Neal
and dished to Chris Webber for a dunk as part of his tidy package of
six points and two assists in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, meanwhile, was missing five of his first six shots as the
Lakers fell behind, 32-15.</TE>
<TE>   "He's telling me he's feeling fine," Vitti said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the toughest guy I've ever worked with. He's going to tell
you he's fine."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the report on Bryant is a little better than on
the Lakers overall right now.</TE>

<HD>Baerga Doesn't Let Red Sox Blow Lead</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Baerga finally heard the cheers instead of leading them.</LD>
<LD>   Baerga, who dances and hugs teammates in the dugout, hit a
sacrifice fly in the 11th inning, giving the Boston Red Sox a 9-8
victory Friday night after they pounded the New York Yankees' Roger
Clemens before squandering a six-run lead at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "I enjoy every minute, every at bat," Baerga said. "It was
awesome. Everybody said it can't happen to a better person."</LD>
<TE>   He wasn't boasting, just confirming what teammates have said about
him since he signed as a free agent in December after spending two
years out of the majors. He spent most of his career with Cleveland
and the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Another veteran, Rickey Henderson, started the winning rally with
a headfirst slide for an infield single and ended it with a
feet-first slide as center fielder Bernie Williams' throw after he
caught Baerga's liner hit the mound and went to the first-base side.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre thought Henderson left third early.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe an outfielder is throwing me out so I don't have
to leave early," Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson had singled off Steve Karsay (1-2) and moved to second
on Shea Hillenbrand's fourth hit of the game, a single to left. They
moved up on Trot Nixon's sacrifice bunt before Jason Varitek was
walked intentionally, loading the bases.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees came back from an 8-2 deficit to tie the game with
five runs in the seventh and one in the eighth after Clemens lasted
only 32/3 innings, giving up seven runs, five earned, and nine hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox's second consecutive victory over the Yankees and
fifth in six games this season gave them a three-game lead over New
York in the American League East.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, Baltimore 2--Mark McLemore and Ruben Sierra homered off
Scott Erickson (3-5) in the fifth inning at Seattle and the Mariners
maintained their mastery of Baltimore at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles dropped to 0-14 at Safeco Field and have lost 15 in a
row in Seattle dating to a victory June 1, 1999, in the Kingdome.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 9, Tampa Bay 8--Adam Piatt hit a tiebreaking two-run homer
in the eighth inning as the Athletics won at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Hernandez followed Piatt with a solo home run for the A's,
who have won only five of their last 20 games. With the score tied at
6-6, Olmedo Saenz doubled off Victor Zambrano (1-4) and Piatt
homered.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 12, Detroit 1--Mark Buehrle pitched a five-hitter at
Chicago to become the American League's first eight-game winner and
Frank Thomas hit one of four Chicago homers as the White Sox routed
the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, Magglio Ordonez and Paul Konerko hit three-run homers and
Kenny Lofton had a solo shot as the White Sox won their third in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Toronto 2--Rookie Ryan Drese won his third start in a
row as the Indians won at Toronto to end a four-game losing skid.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome went three for three with two walks for the Indians, who
also ended a six-game road losing skid.</TE>
<TE>   Drese (5-3) gave up one run and seven hits in 62/3 innings. He
struck out five and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   Texas at Kansas City, ppd.--The Rangers and Royals were rained out
for the second consecutive game. Friday's game will be made up as
part of a doubleheader on July 15. Thursday's rainout will be made up
as part of a doubleheader Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Twins Tag Ortiz Early, Angels Lose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It appeared to have all the makings of a classic home run derby.</LD>
<LD>   Ramon Ortiz, tied for the major league lead with 13 homers
allowed, was on the mound for the Angels. Rick Reed, right behind
with 12 homers allowed, was starting for the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't take long for Ortiz to put some distance between himself
and the rest of the pack as Twin outfielder Jacque Jones hit Ortiz's
first pitch into the right-field seats and the Twins tagged Ortiz for
two more homers in a 5-1 victory before 27,494 at Edison Field
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Reed also gave up a home run, but he limited the Angels to a
season-low three hits in a masterful 103-pitch performance.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the same every time you face him," Angel center fielder
Darin Erstad said. "Great control. Great movement. Nothing
overpowering, but he picks you apart."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz (4-5) has now surrendered 16 home runs in 64 2/3 innings,
including seven in his last 13 1/3 innings. Last Saturday, Ortiz gave
up a career-high four homers in a 10-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going through a little stretch of not being able to get the
ball in good locations early in the game to get his feet on the
ground," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said of Ortiz. "He's paid a
price for it."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz has kept the opposition in the park in only two of his nine
starts--a 5-1 loss to Oakland on April 12 and 1-0 loss to Seattle on
April 23.</TE>
<TE>   "My location the last two games has been no good," Ortiz said.
"I'm throwing a lot of high pitches."</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped the Angels three games behind the first-place
Seattle Mariners in the American League West. It also ended the
Angels' four-game winning streak and eight-game home winning streak.
Still, they are 13-3 over the last 16 games at Edison Field since
opening 1-8 in their first nine games at home.</TE>
<TE>   The contraction-threatened Twins, who began the night tied with
the Chicago White Sox for first place in the AL Central, extended
their winning streak to three games behind the 36-year-old Reed, who
pitched his 11th career complete game.</TE>
<TE>   Reed (5-2), acquired from the New York Mets in a trade last July
for outfielder Matt Lawton, gave up a first-inning single to Erstad,
a fifth-inning homer to Brad Fullmer and an eighth-inning single to
Bengie Molina in his fourth three-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out four and maintained his reputation as one of
baseball's top control pitchers by not walking a batter for the third
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing looks that difficult to hit, but it's just not in the
spot you're looking--it's always on the borderline," Angel outfielder
Tim Salmon said. "If he's not commanding his stuff, he's probably
going to get hit around. But if he is sharp and hitting corners like
he was tonight, he can really get you off balance and shut you down."</TE>
<TE>   Reed, who improved to 4-1 lifetime against the Angels, said he
struggled to control his curve ball early in the game but got by with
control of his fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "I got away with some pitches early, but I kept throwing the curve
ball knowing that I would need it later in the game," Reed said. "You
have to have a little bit of luck on your side, and I think I had a
lot of it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was not as fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Jones hit Ortiz's initial offering for his ninth homer, the fourth
time this season the former USC standout has led off a game with a
home run.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, Ortiz gave up consecutive singles to Jones
and Cristian Guzman. Two outs later, Torii Hunter hit the first pitch
over the wall in left-center field to put the Twins ahead, 4-0. It
was Hunter's American League-leading 13th homer.</TE>
<TE>   "A solo shot is OK but with people on the base that's no good,"
Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins went ahead, 5-0, in the fourth when A.J. Pierzynski hit
his first homer of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave up only one other hit before he was replaced by Donne
Wall after walking Corey Koskie with one out in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Reed finished the Angels in the ninth by getting Adam Kennedy and
Erstad to ground out and by striking out Troy Glaus.</TE>

<LD>Alfredo Amezaga did not have time to ease into the major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Amezaga, promoted Friday by the Angels from triple-A Salt Lake,
made his big league debut as the starting shortstop in a 5-1 loss to
the Minnesota Twins at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Amezaga, 24, started in place of David Eckstein, who missed his
third consecutive game because of a knee injury suffered Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm trying to think about helping the team and doing the things
that Eckstein was doing," Amezaga said. "I just want to cover his
spot, have fun and let things happen."</TE>
<TE>   Amezaga, a switch-hitter, hit .234 with 18 runs batted in in 44
games at Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively, he plays with a lot of confidence," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "This is a great litmus test for him to come out
and do it on a major league field. We're not bringing him up for a
look, we're bringing him up because we're anticipating what he can do
for us to help us win a ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Amezaga touched the ball twice on defense. He tagged
out Jacque Jones on a steal attempt at second base in the sixth
inning and threw out Jones at first after fielding a ground ball hit
up the middle in the ninth. Amezaga struck out against Rick Reed in
his first at-bat, was thrown out by Reed on a bunt in the sixth and
hit a fly ball to center in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein took ground balls for the first time since injuring his
knee, but he missed a third consecutive game because of injury for
the first time since 1999, when he was hit on the foot by a pitch
while playing for double-A Trenton in the Boston Red Sox
organization.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utilityman Benji Gil, who went on the disabled list on April 6
because of a sprained left ankle, began a rehabilitation assignment
at Salt Lake. First baseman Shawn Wooten, rehabilitating from surgery
on his right hand, is not expected to begin playing in minor league
games until next week, Scioscia said.</TE>

<HD>Avengers Cast Jackson as the Hero, Win at Atlanta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Jackson missed the Avengers' last two games with a broken bone
in his right wrist, but on Friday, wearing a soft cast, he didn't
miss anything, catching 13 passes for 194 yards and six touchdowns to
lead Los Angeles to a 74-53 victory over the Georgia Force before
5,512 at Phillips Arena in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   In going two games over .500 for the first time in their brief
history, the Avengers (4-2), who led 37-30 at halftime, set a team
single-game record for points scored.</LD>
<LD>   With 1:51 remaining and Los Angeles trailing, 53-45, Jackson
caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Graziani,
then caught a two-point conversion pass to tie it, 53-53.</LD>
<TE>   "He is a money player," Avenger Coach Ed Hodgkiss said of Jackson.
"And he's yet to let us down."</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing kickoff, Avenger kicker Remy Hamilton recovered his
onside kick attempt at the Los Angeles 11. Three plays later Graziani
floated a 31-yard scoring pass to Greg Hopkins with 36 seconds left
that gave Los Angeles the lead for good, 60-53. Hopkins caught eight
passes for 90 yards.</TE>
<TE>   But Georgia (1-5) wasn't through imploding. The Force mishandled
Hamilton's next kickoff, which bounced off the goal nets, and the
Avengers recovered at the Force six.</TE>
<TE>   Graziani, who completed 27 of 36 passes for 352 yards and seven
touchdowns, capitalized with a three-yard touchdown pass to Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The final indignity for the Force came on the next kickoff.
Hamilton's kickoff hit the goal nets again and bounced off the
crossbar. Chad Dukes fell on the ball in the Georgia end zone for the
Avenger's last score.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the uniqueness of the Arena game," Hodgkiss said. "The
nets are in play, and sometimes you get a break like that. And our
guys did a super job of running down and recovering the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the difference in the game tonight."</TE>

<LD>Breaking up isn't all that hard to do if you're a beach volleyball
player.</LD>
<LD>   It usually takes a simple phone call: Partner A gets partner B on
the line and recommends they go their separate ways because of injury
or ineffectiveness. Nothing personal, of course. Just business.</LD>
<LD>   The breakups between teammates, however, seemed to hit an all-time
high during the most recent off-season of the Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals tour.</LD>
<TE>   There are few intact impact teams returning as the AVP kicks off
its seven-stop tour with the main draw of the Huntington Beach Open
today and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest surprise was the split between longtime partners Dax
Holdren and Todd Rogers, who won six tournaments the last two years
but broke up when Holdren agreed to play with Sydney Olympic gold
medalist Eric Fonoimoana.</TE>
<TE>   "[Rogers and I] had been playing since I was a junior in high
school and professionally about 12 years," Holdren said. "We just
wanted to try something different. We hadn't been showing a lot of
energy."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers ultimately joined Sean Scott.</TE>
<TE>   The changes didn't stop there. Dain Blanton, Fonoimoana's Olympic
teammate, is playing with Carl Henkel. Lee LeGrande will team with
former U.S. Olympic indoor player Mike Lambert.</TE>
<TE>   Only two top teams remain intact from last season: Stein Metzger
and Kevin Wong, and Mike Whitmarsh with Canyon Ceman. Metzger and
Wong won the final two tournaments last season at Chicago and
Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The women's field is similarly shuffled, with top players Holly
McPeak and Elaine Youngs playing together for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak, the top U.S. player in career earnings ($805,000), had
played primarily with Lisa Arce and Misty May since 1996, but joined
Youngs after receiving a phone call from her last month.</TE>
<TE>   Youngs won four tournaments with Barbra Fontana last season but
opted out of the partnership after Fontana was slow to recover from a
back injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a business decision," Youngs said. "Barbara and I had a
good year last year, but we weren't able to train because of her
back. I worried about her being healthy."</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs are the top-seeded team at Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, eight men's teams advanced to today's main draw,
including former UCLA standout Brandon Taliaferro and Andy Witt. Four
women's teams advanced.</TE>

<LD>Noah Bryant and Jarered Morgan didn't treat the Southern Section
Masters track and field meet Friday merely as a stepping stone to the
state finals.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, a senior at Carpinteria High, and Morgan, a senior at La
Quinta, took aim at personal barriers and left Cerritos College with
state-leading marks in the weight events.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant didn't reach his goal of 70 feet in the shotput, but he won
with a personal-best mark of 66-7 1/2. The mark is third best in the
nation this season behind Kevin Bookout of Stroud (Okla.) High (70-1
1/2) and Lucas Mireles of Corpus Christi (Texas) Calallen High (66-11
1/2).</LD>
<TE>   Morgan surpassed the 200-foot barrier in the discus for the first
time in his career, winning with a throw of 200-3. The mark is
seventh best in the nation this season and nearly 32 feet farther
than the closest competitor.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the difference between runners and throwers," said Bryant,
who also qualified third in the discus. "They only run fast enough to
qualify, but we're always throwing as far as we can."</TE>
<TE>   However, Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist and Matt Bruno
of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills didn't follow that strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Felix won the 200 meters in 22.95 seconds, tying her for fifth on
the all-time national high school girls' list. Felix, the defending
state champion in the 100 meters, also retook the state lead in that
event with a victory in 11.48.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno made up for a loss to Long Beach Poly's Derrick Jones in the
200 last week at the Southern Section Division I finals by winning in
20.93, the best time in the state this season and third fastest in
the nation. Bruno also won the 100 in a personal-best 10.48, the
second-fastest legal time in the state this season.</TE>
<TE>   Other producers of state-leading marks on Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Dominique Manning of Riverside North in the 100 hurdles (13.99).</TE>
<TE>   * Ashley Freeman of Long Beach Wilson in the 400 (53.71).</TE>
<TE>   * Julia Pitts of North Torrance in the 300 hurdles (42.36).</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson's girls' 1,600 relay team finished in a
nation-leading time of 3:38.71.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly appears headed to its second consecutive girls'
state title after dominating the sprints and relays. The Jackrabbits
qualified three runners in both the 100 and 200 and were the top
qualifier in the 400 relay (45.40).</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Poly boys' team also left in good shape, winning
the opening 400 relay in 40.87 and the closing 1,600 relay in a
state-leading 3:12.10. The Jackrabbits also qualified four runners in
the sprints. Chreston Anderson of Long Beach Poly and Lionel Larry of
Compton Dominguez nearly finished in a dead heat in the 400 relay.
Larry took the baton a stride behind Anderson and ran out of room
before crossing the finish line. Dominguez was second in 40.91.</TE>
<TE>   Larry, who won Division II titles in the 100 and 200 last week,
later was disqualified in the 100 for a false start.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Rio Mesa had two top qualifiers: Phillip Reid won the 1,600
in 4:14.32 and Justin Johnson won the 110 hurdles in 14.26.</TE>

<LD>Norman Chad on America Online: "I don't wish to offend all my friends

the way--but the Celtics-Nets series is essentially the NIT final and
the Kings-Lakers series is essentially the NCAA Tournament final.</LD>

<TE>   Old school: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "The NFL

<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1935, Jesse Owens of Ohio State set

<DH>Baseball: Green gets record-tying fifth homer in two games,
but Schilling takes control to lead Arizona to 14-3 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The ball shot off Shawn Green's bat like a cannon Friday night,
screaming toward right field and bouncing off the top of the fence
for a first-inning home run, giving the Dodgers a lead and their
right fielder his major league record-tying fifth homer in two games.</LD>
<LD>   That was pretty much it for Dodger highlights.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona pitcher Curt Schilling tamed the Green Monster--kind
of--and shut down the rest of the Dodgers, throwing seven crisp
innings to lead the Diamondbacks to a 14-3 pasting of the Dodgers
before 42,862 in Bank One Ballpark.</LD>
<TE>   Schilling, who leads the National League in wins (nine) and
strikeouts (114), and is averaging less than one walk per nine
innings, gave up one run on six hits, struck out seven and walked
none, improving to 8-0 against the Dodgers dating to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander gave up a homer and a sixth-inning single to
Green, who became the 14th player to hit four homers in a game
Thursday in Milwaukee and the 25th player to hit five homers in two
consecutive games with his shot Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But Schilling (9-1) struck out Green with a nasty split-fingered
fastball with a runner on second base in the third inning, when the
score was still close, and he subdued a Dodger offense that had
busted out for 33 runs on 52 hits, including 15 homers, in the
previous four games.</TE>
<TE>   Green singled off reliever Mike Morgan in the eighth for his 25th
total base in two games, tying a major league record held by Ty Cobb
of the Detroit Tigers (May 5-6, 1925) and Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee
Braves (July 30-31, 1954).</TE>
<TE>   But by then, the game was out of hand--the Diamondbacks having
shredded Dodger starter Odalis Perez for five runs on seven hits in
four innings and added a touchdown off reliever Jeff Williams in the
seventh, sending 12 to the plate during the six-hit inning. Williams
was optioned to triple-A Las Vegas after the game and will be
replaced by knuckleballer Dennis Springer tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who is 0-3 with a 7.00 earned-run average in five career
games against Arizona, had his string of eight consecutive quality
starts ended during his shortest outing of the season, and he has
looked far more vulnerable in his last two starts than he did in his
first eight.</TE>
<TE>   "That was his worst start of the season from a command
standpoint," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He was deep in counts, and his
pitch count (81) was up. We've seen him reach the seventh or eighth
innings with the same amount of pitches. When you match up against
Curt Schilling, you have to have your A game, and he didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Perez (4-3) said he felt fine warming up, but when the game
started, "none of my pitches worked," he said. "I went to 3-2 counts
on most of the hitters. I wasn't able to throw any of my pitches for
strikes."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey had three hits, including a first-inning home run,
and three runs batted in, shortstop Tony Womack had two hits and
three RBIs, and catcher Damian Miller had two doubles to pace
Arizona's 15-hit attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got a scare in the third when first baseman Eric
Karros leaned over the rail in foul territory to catch Jose Guillen's
popup before tumbling into a camera well. Karros, whose 2001 season
was ruined by back problems, got up gingerly but remained in the
game, and Tracy said afterward that he was fine.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca hoped to send a message to the
Diamondbacks in this series, that the Dodgers are a team to be
reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the Diamondbacks and Giants feel the [division race] is
between them, and we're not in the picture," Lo Duca said Thursday. "
... You look at the sports highlight shows, and it's all Arizona and
San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   It was all Arizona on Friday night, and looming large this weekend
is 6-foot-10 Diamondback left-hander Randy Johnson, who will start
against the Dodgers on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "If you watch 'SportsCenter', we're the defending world champions,
so they're going to show a ton of us, and the Giants have Barry
Bonds, so they're going to show a ton of them, so maybe the Dodgers
don't get the same play," Arizona pitcher Brian Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not going to discount them. They have some great
players and a tremendous pitching staff. They can outslug you or beat
you, 2-1."</TE>

<HD>Not Business as Usual for Green on Day After</HD>

<LD>Shawn Green had a full day to absorb Thursday's four-homer, six-hit,
six-run, seven-RBI game against Milwaukee, but by Friday afternoon
the Dodger right fielder still hadn't come to grips with the
magnitude of it.</LD>
<LD>   "It was one of those days when all the stars had to be aligned
right," Green said before Friday night's game against Arizona. "I saw
[Dodger catcher] Paul Lo Duca get six hits last year and remember
being amazed. I saw [Seattle outfielder] Mike Cameron hit four homers
[on May 2] and thought that was incredible. To have both in one day
blows my mind. It still hasn't sunk in."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers were bombarded with interview requests for Green on
Thursday and Friday. Green's voicemail on his cell phone filled up
Thursday afternoon, and he erased them before boarding the team's
flight from Milwaukee to Phoenix. By the time the plane landed,
Green's voicemail was full again.</LD>
<TE>   Green, who also doubled and singled in the game, set a major
league record with 19 total bases, tied a modern major league mark
with six runs and a National League mark with five extra-base hits.
He became the first Los Angeles Dodger to hit four homers in a game;
Gil Hodges hit four in a game for Brooklyn in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat in my hotel room [Thursday] and watched 'Baseball Tonight'
and 'SportsCenter,' and I was even more amazed than I was in the
dugout Thursday," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "Do you know how
hard that is to do?</TE>
<TE>   "He centered six balls and mashed them. That single [in the eighth
inning] was a heat-seeking missile.... Think about it. Six for six
with four home runs, six runs, seven RBIs, 19 total bases ... that's
a pretty good career for some guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Jesse Orosco, who has been sidelined by a strained
abdominal muscle, threw in the bullpen Thursday and will throw again
today and Monday. The Dodgers expect Orosco to be ready when he is
eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday.... Left-hander
Terry Mulholland, out since May 4 because of back spasms, joined the
team in Arizona on Friday and threw off the mound for the first time
in weeks. The reliever is still at least a week from being activated.</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 3 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 32 LAKERS 15</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: The series shifted from the Little House on the
Prairie to Staples Center, from country to city, from pickups to
SUVs. Didn't seem to make much difference in the Laker shooting,
though. They continued to toss bricks at the basket, picking up where
they left off in Game 2. They started by making six of 22 (27.3%).
That's not going to get them a victory over L.A. Southwest College.
The Lakers' shooting was almost as bad as the traffic on the freeways
as folks got a head start on the Memorial Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: A true fitness report on Kobe Bryant. He
still looked shaky on the floor early, missing five of six shots. One
of his misses was an airball from 18 feet. Only he knows how low he
has been knocked because of the bad bacon cheeseburger and slice of
cheesecake. It's clear, he's not right, though.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Kings' 14-for-26 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Shaquille O'Neal had two points on one-for-four
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Robert Horry 5, Derek Fisher 4;
Kings--Chris Webber 8, Hedo Turkoglu 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Rick Fox 4;
Kings--Turkoglu, Doug Christie and Vlade Divac 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 52 LAKERS 40</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Earth to Lakers, earth to Lakers. Anybody there?
The hometown heroes looked like no-shows, trailing by 21 points early
in the quarter. Lindsey Hunter broke a 14-0 Sacramento run with a
jumper. With 8:59 remaining in the half, the Lakers trailed by 38-17
and they were shooting a crisp seven for 28. Then O'Neal awoke with a
start, dominating the paint and hauling the Lakers into the game. He
scored 11 of the Lakers' 13 points during one stretch, including
eight in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A plausible explanation for why the Lakers
don't dump the ball into O'Neal almost every time down the floor.
Divac and Scot Pollard have as much chance at stopping him as you do,
dear reader. Too much Hunter and not enough O'Neal is the Lakers'
problem by halftime. They need all Shaq, all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Twenty-one, the Kings' largest lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: One for seven, Bryant's first-half shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 13, Hunter 4; Kings--Mike Bibby 9,
Bobby Jackson 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 3, Devean George 2;
Kings--Webber, Divac, Pollard, Jackson 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 75 LAKERS 52</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Kings continued to poke holes in the Lakers'
aura as unbeatable champions on a roll toward their third title in a
row. The Lakers appeared vulnerable, which is a nice way of saying
they were horrible. They had time to get their game together, but
Game 3 all but slipped from their grasp during a pitiful opening to
the second half. The Lakers went more than four minutes without
scoring. Webber rebounded Christie's miss and dunk. Webber then
swished a pretty hook shot, giving the Kings a 65-42 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Heart and soul. The Kings had it; the Lakers
did not. Bryant's frustration boiled over with an elbow to Divac's
face. Remarkably, Bryant was not penalized for his blatant lack of
composure. The plain fact was that Divac schooled the Lakers on both
ends of the floor. He needed to keep cool and the Kings would have
Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Kings' 15-2 run to open the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Lakers' five-for-25 shooting and 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 4, Brian Shaw 3; Kings--Webber 8,
Christie 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 8, Horry 5; Kings--Christie 4,
Bibby 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 103 LAKERS 90</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: All that remained was the inevitable charge to the
parking lots. Why would anyone in any arena in the world want to
watch the home team put on such a lifeless performance? Funny thing,
though, the Lakers showed some gusto at long last, trimming a
27-point deficit to 87-72 with 7:11 remaining. Crazier things have
happened. Where was all this passion to start the game? The Lakers
paid for their lackluster start at the end. Had they started the way
they finished, they would be leading the series, 2-1, instead of
trailing.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Was that panic the Kings displayed midway
through the quarter? It sure looked like it, as the Lakers went on an
14-0 run to pull within 87-75, with almost 7 minutes to play. The
Lakers thrive on spotting a weakness and exploiting it. Game 4
figures to be radically different if the Lakers play with the sort of
energy they had late in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Five, the number of King road victories in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Twenty-seven, the Lakers' largest deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 16, Hunter 10. Kings--Webber 8,
Jackson and Bibby 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--George 5, O'Neal 4. Kings--Christie 5,
Webber 4.</TE>

<HD>No Drawing Power for Capriati, Hewitt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The draw was not especially kind to either of the top-seeded players
at the French Open on Friday at Roland Garros.</LD>
<LD>   First, consider defending champion Jennifer Capriati. One of her
clay-court losses this spring was to the resurgent Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland at Charleston, S.C. So, where was Schnyder positioned in
the field? A mere four lines away from Capriati, looming as a
possible fourth-round opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Should she survive the first week, there could be a quarterfinal
meeting with No. 7 Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia, who is playing in the
final at Strasbourg, France, today. And, perhaps, a Williams sister
in the semifinal--No. 3 Serena, who has been playing the best
clay-court tennis of late, along with Justine Henin of Belgium.
Serena and Henin could meet in the quarterfinals, and they have split
their last two meetings this spring on clay.</LD>
<TE>   The Williamses are on opposite sides of the draw, a comforting
development for them, the way it was at the U.S. Open, in which they
met in the final. But Venus has never gone past the quarterfinals
here, nor has Serena.</TE>
<TE>   On the men's side, there's No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia. He
has lost twice this clay-court season to Carlos Moya of Spain.
Certainly, his hope was to see Moya far away on the other side of the
draw. But Moya landed close by, as a potential fourth-round opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi, champion in 1999, opens against a qualifier, and
Pete Sampras will start against Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy. After
reaching the final in Houston on clay, Sampras lost in the first
round of consecutive tournaments in Rome and Hamburg, Germany. He is
in the same quarter of the draw as three-time champion Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil, Moya and Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's place in the draw is hardly ideal. He is in the same
quarter as Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, who has been struggling with
an injured leg but did win the Monte Carlo event. Also in Agassi's
quarter is Roger Federer, who won his first Masters Series event on
Sunday in Hamburg on clay.</TE>
<TE>   Missing the French Open--which begins Monday--for the first time
since she turned pro in 1994 is Martina Hingis. Twice a finalist in
Paris, Hingis had recent ankle surgery and will probably be out for
three months. Lindsay Davenport, who had knee surgery in January, is
attempting to return in time for Wimbledon.</TE>

<HD>Revamped Revolution in Store for the Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM BARRERO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the same time the Galaxy will get its first look at new CMGI
Field, it also will see a drastically altered New England Revolution
team.</LD>
<LD>   In the 48 hours before today's 4:30 p.m. PDT game at Foxboro,
Mass., the Revolution not only changed coaches but completed a
six-player trade with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars that it
hopes will bring a much-needed boost in team chemistry.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of having to prepare for Mamadou "Big Mama" Diallo, the
leading scorer in Major League Soccer in 2000, the Galaxy will have
to contend with Colombian forward Diego Serna, one of three players
the MetroStars sent to the Revolution on Friday in the largest player
deal in MLS history.</LD>
<TE>   The trade came one day after New England fired coach Fernando
Clavijo, who was replaced on an interim basis by assistant Steve
Nicol, a former Liverpool and Scotland defender.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Serna, the Revolution acquired former Galaxy
midfielder Daniel Hernandez and defender Brian Kamler from the
MetroStars. New York/New Jersey added Diallo, midfielder Andy
Williams and defender Ted Chronopoulos. Williams was New England's
team MVP in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Serna figures to give last-place New England a boost, especially
since he is being reunited with Alex Pineda Chacon, whom he paired
with last season for the Miami Fusion to form the league's most
potent goal-scoring duo. The two combined for 34 goals and 24
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Diego is a proven goal scorer who has made an impact in this
league since he joined it in 1998," Nicol said. "He and [Chacon]
connected so well together on the field last year, and we are excited
to pair them up again."</TE>

<HD>Perkins Advances Despite Difficulties</HD>
<DH>Track: Defending 200 state champion qualifies in that event
and the 100, but injuries have taken their toll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel Perkins of Cerritos Gahr High advanced to the state track and
field championships for the fourth time in her illustrious career
with two season-best performances Friday in the Southern Section
Masters Meet at Cerritos College.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Perkins, the defending state champion in the girls' 200
meters, will find herself in the unfamiliar role of underdog when the
state meet begins at Cerritos College next Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Perkins, the top-ranked girls' 200 sprinter in the nation last
year, will point out that she entered the previous two state
championships as an underdog to Monique Henderson of San Diego Morse
in the 200 and 400. But this year will be different in several ways.</LD>
<TE>   While Perkins was a slight underdog to Henderson, the national
high school record-holder in the girls' 400, she will be a longshot
to win the 100 or 200 next week. The strong fields are headed by
junior Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist, who ran career
bests of 11.48 seconds and 22.95 to win the 100 and 200 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins was on a roll entering the last two state meets, but she
isn't expected to be 100% next week after missing 21/2 weeks of
training with an injured left hamstring in March and being slowed by
a tight muscle in the upper part of her left leg Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's my left hip," Perkins said as she walked off the
track with a noticeable limp following her fourth-place finish in the
200.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't hurt that much, but it's just real tight....
Everything else is fine. I know it sounds like I have a new injury
every day, but I'm fine."</TE>
<TE>   Perkins' positive attitude is admirable, especially for someone
who entered the season as the fastest returning sprinter in the
nation in the 100 and 200 with bests of 11.45 and 23.07, and with the
second-fastest returning time in the 400 at 52.18.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she was selected as the girls' athlete of the meet in
the World Youth (under 18) Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, last
July after winning the 200 and running the 300 leg on the victorious
sprint medley relay team that included Felix.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on what I did last year, my goals this year were to win the
200 and the 400 in the state championships and to take a shot at the
national [interscholastic] records of 22.67 in the 200 and 50.74 in
the 400," said Perkins, who has signed with Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins, who did not run the 400 on Friday because of the training
time she lost because of her hamstring injury, got off to a great
start in the 100 before being overtaken by Felix and sophomore
Shalonda Solomon of Long Beach Poly in the second half of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Felix led the field out of the blocks in the 200, but Perkins was
in second entering the home straightaway before being passed by
Solomon and Long Beach Poly junior Dominique Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I was happy with my start in both races," said
Perkins, who ran 11.74 in the 100 and 23.76 in the 200. "I led the
100 for about the first 30 meters and I made up the stagger on
[Dorsey] in the 200.... I think I'll be fine next week."</TE>

<HD>Texas Buddies Top Memorial</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justin Leonard and Harrison Frazar, roommates their freshmen year at
the University of Texas and best friends ever since, were atop the
Memorial leaderboard heading into a suddenly soggy weekend at Dublin,
Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   And Tiger Woods was nowhere near them.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard surged to a one-stroke lead Friday with an eagle and a
tap-in birdie on consecutive holes late in his round for a
seven-under-par 65, his best score in 27 trips around Muirfield
Village, and a 10-under 134 total.</LD>
<TE>   Frazar also had a 65 and finished one stroke behind, a rare
occasion when the Texas-Exes get to play together on the PGA Tour--in
contention, no less.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't get too friendly out there and forget what we're trying
to do," Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   It's still too early to forget about Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to become the first player in 75 years to win the same
tournament four years in a row, Woods finally got a putt to fall on
the final hole for a 70, leaving him 10 strokes behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to shoot something in the mid-60s tomorrow and see where I
stand," Woods said. "The golf course is soft and we got some rain
coming in. It might be possible."</TE>
<TE>   Anything seems possible in this Memorial, especially considering
62-year-old tournament host Jack Nicklaus is still playing.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was in a tie for ninth at one point Friday until a
mid-round collapse. Still, the Olden Bear had a 74 and made the cut
for the first time in two years on the PGA Tour, one shot behind
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jean Bartholomew shot a five-under 67 to tie Laura Diaz for the
second-round lead in the LPGA Corning (N.Y.) Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, who began the day tied for the lead with Beth Bader and
Sherri Steinhauer at six under, carded three birdies and stayed out
of trouble in shooting a 69 for a nine-under 135 total.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former amateur stars Jay Sigel and David Eger shot five-under 67s
to share the lead in the Farmers Charity Classic at Ada, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel, 58, had his best opening round since August. Eger, a former
PGA Tour and U.S. Golf Assn. official playing his third senior tour
event since turning 50 in March, shot his first sub-par round.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Kings of Court? Certainly Not the Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, how was that for a resounding thud?</LD>
<LD>   In this glittering land where the only things ringing during
basketball games are cell phones, the mighty Lakers, twice-defending
champions of all they surveyed, took a great fall Friday night at the
hands of the once-but-no-longer-lowly Kings.</LD>
<LD>   In case you hadn't noticed, things have changed.</LD>
<TE>   This isn't last season's Laker team, or even the one from the
season before.</TE>
<TE>   To add to the Lakers' predicament, these aren't the Kings they
swept, 4-0, last spring, or the ones who showed up here for a
deciding Game 5 the season before, got three quick illegal defenses
called against them and lost by a fast 27.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally different," said Coach Rick Adelman after Friday
night's 103-90 shocker. "We have a completely different team. We have
different players. The mentality's different....</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they could beat us at Arco because they'd done it but we
felt real strongly we could win here. We really did. We'd proved it
to ourselves in the last half of the year. We proved it to ourselves
in the first two rounds of the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Kings had madcap rookie Jason Williams at the
point, backed by almost-as-zany Jon Barry, so one hesitates to say
they had any "mentality" at all.</TE>
<TE>   Since, however, they have replaced the wild Williams with
up-and-coming Mike Bibby; the fading Nick Anderson with the
hard-working Doug Christie, and the high-strung Barry with tough
Bobby Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   People still look at them as the team of Chris Webber, who's
supposed to be soft, and Vlade Divac, whom some Utah fans once
greeted by donning long blond wigs and fake beards, but people had
better look again.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, who are 4-1 away from Staples Center this postseason,
are no longer the best road team in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the Kings, who are 5-0, having won twice in Salt
Lake City and twice in Dallas before Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also won 12 of their last 14 on the road in the regular
season, and one of the losses was that season-ending game in L.A.
they donated to the Lakers. That makes 17 victories in their last 19
road games.</TE>
<TE>   "You play all year and you get the best record but that's
dismissed, people say you just win at home," Kings' player personnel
director Jerry Reynolds said before the game. "You go on the road and
win and they say, 'Yeah, but it was Dallas.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think what people tend to forget, this is a team. It truly is.
We really have a good basketball team. Now, if you want to compare us
to Shaq [O'Neal] and Kobe [Bryant], maybe you can't do that, but we
really have a lot of guys who are good players.</TE>
<TE>   "We won 20 of 27 without Chris this season and nine of 11 without
Peja [Stojakovic], two All-Stars."</TE>
<TE>   This was a standard Laker home game, except that Bryant had been
knocked off stride by his illness and wasn't there to bail them out
until late.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal came out tentatively, as he has been doing all postseason.
His teammates, who'd gone cold in Game 2, stayed cold in Game 3, and
suddenly this didn't look like the defending champions of anything.
When the Big Two aren't going, better not expect the Little 10 to
carry the load.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Kings, allowed to establish themselves, started
making shots, which is something they can do. Their starters played
all 12 minutes in the first quarter and each of them shot at least
50%.</TE>
<TE>   How was this for balance?</TE>
<TE>   Webber had eight points; Hedo Turkoglu, alive again, had seven;
Divac and Bibby had six and Christie had five.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal went to the bench with 1:22 left in the first quarter with
two points, having missed three of four shots, and the Lakers
trailing by 14.</TE>
<TE>   He returned with 3:01 gone in the second quarter and the Lakers
trailing by 21.</TE>
<TE>   After that they tried to rally, which is difficult against a team
on which everybody can handle the ball, pass and shoot, too."Without
looking forward, because it's a long series and it's not over, but it
is a big night for our fans and for Kings supporters," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers could be in real trouble. It may have been unthinkable
once, like six days ago, but it isn't anymore.</TE>

<DH>Retirement didn't feel right for veteran driver Luyendyk,
who is chasing a third victory at the Indianapolis 500</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Arie Luyendyk is 48, hasn't driven a race in a year, is starting
Sunday's Indianapolis 500 near the back of the pack--and he thinks he
can win it?</LD>
<LD>   "If the race is on the line, I'll be as aggressive as any
20-year-old," the Dutch-born veteran said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   And, really, why shouldn't he think he can win? He's a proven
winner here, having put his likeness on the Borg-Warner trophy twice,
in 1990 and 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Usually, though, he starts up front, where if the winning isn't
easy, it's at least easier. Car problems bedeviled him on pole day,
though, so he missed a shot at one of the choice starting spots and
will be starting 24th in the 33-car field, outside in the eighth row.</TE>
<TE>   That's going to make his job harder.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like one of the best fields that's been here in a
long, long time," Luyendyk said. "The teams are all high-quality
teams so starting back in 24th probably will be a matter of just
having a good car, and driving to the front will [require] quite a
bit of strategy and some luck with the [caution periods]--maybe not
coming in [to pit] when everyone else comes in--to gain track
position.</TE>
<TE>   "Starting back there is going to be tough.... You're behind so
many cars that the turbulence is unbelievable the first few laps, the
methanol [racing fuel fumes] gets in your eyes, and the dust too.
They clean the track here but when you get all the cars together and
running in places where they never really run, there's quite a bit of
dust kicking up in the air and you get it all in your face. That's
why I'd rather be in front."</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk wouldn't be putting up with all this stuff if this
weren't the Indy 500--his 17th.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1999 season, he retired to the comfortable life of a
two-time Indy winner and part-time entrepreneur in Scottsdale, Ariz.
He even donned a blazer and tie to join the ABC television crew for
the race here in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Then he thought, "Oh no! What have I done?"</TE>
<TE>   "That was really it," he said. "That was the moment when I said to
myself, 'I want to race again here.' Being up in the booth, I
realized I missed driving here .... It's the best moment in racing,
walking out there and getting ready to sit yourself down in the car."</TE>
<TE>   So last year, Luyendyk was here again, in his driving suit, not a
blazer. He's here now, and he plans to continue coming back. A.J.
Foyt, Mario Andretti and Al Unser were driving competitively here
into their 50s, so Luyendyk figures he has a few years left.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel old, at all," he said, adding that if you're only
going to drive one race a year, this is the one it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first day here, I'm pretty stiff--my neck and my arms,"
he said. "But that gets less and less as you drive more and more so
that's the nice thing about Indy. It's not just a weekend event, it's
a month event. You get to practice hundreds of laps ... so that's why
I can do this race. That's why racing with these guys doesn't seem to
be a problem with me."</TE>
<TE>   Foyt, a four-time winner here, suggested one possible drawback to
being a once-a-year driver.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know the moves some of the young guys might make," he
said. "When you race all the time, you know everybody's moves."</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk has taken that into consideration but said, "The young
drivers these days have been around for so long--they were racing
go-karts when they were 9 or 10--by the time they're 20, they have a
wealth of experience and actually are quite level-headed."</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk himself spends more time in race cars than anyone would
expect of a retired gentleman. Since last year's race, he tested here
in October, then again in April. In between, he tested in February at
California Speedway in Fontana and at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. And
he has driven 16 races here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's always a balance between being too aggressive or
being somewhat conservative and relying on your experience," he said.
"So I have a lot of experience and I probably won't make the kinds of
moves that some of the younger guys might make ... but I'll be as
aggressive as I need to be. I feel really good about going into the
race now."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a time, Ron McAnally dominated the Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap,
which will be run for the 51st time today at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The trainer won the Grade I for older fillies and mares five years
in a row between 1989-93. He won twice with Bayakoa and Paseana and
once with Brought To Mind.</LD>
<LD>   McAnally added a record sixth Milady victory with Listening in
1997 and he'll try to improve upon his total today with Affluent.</LD>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Janis Whitham, the 4-year-old Affirmed filly
will break from the rail under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye in the field
of six going 11/16 miles. If she is to win for the seventh time in 15
starts, Affluent will have to beat favorite Azeri.</TE>
<TE>   In two previous meetings, Azeri has gotten the better of Affluent.
The daughter of Jade Hunter has established herself the best female
dirt performer in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and trained by Laura
De Seroux, Azeri will be trying for her third consecutive Grade I
victory and her sixth victory in seven starts. In her last two races,
she won the Santa Margarita at Santa Anita and the Apple Blossom at
Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by anybody else in the field would be an upset.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the lineup are Cashmina, who has won two of four for
trainer John Shirreffs, Collect Call, who has earned two of three
victories at Hastings Park in western Canada, Ask Me No Secrets, who
has won three of five for trainer Dave Hofmans and was only a length
behind Azeri in the La Canada Stakes earlier in the year, and
Elaine's Angel.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth, a $48,000 allowance at six furlongs,
attracted a full field.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Michael Hushion. The trainer, who usually wins at a
high percentage, had three victories at Belmont Park on Thursday and
he will send out contender Be That Way in today's ninth at Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Aaron Gryder. The jockey began the Belmont meet in a
three-for-47 slump.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Magic Mission in the
fifth, using La Bandera, Hot War, Forward March and Bettor Royalty in
the sixth and Steadfast And True, Sunkosi and Classic Brief in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 5/56. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $28.80/$319.40. Total money bet: $378.</TE>

<KH>KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Stojakovic Will Sit Out Game 4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Rick Adelman on Friday ruled out playing Peja Stojakovic,
an All-Star swingman, in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Stojakovic has been sidelined since spraining his right ankle May
9, during Game 3 of the Kings' 4-1 series victory over the Dallas
Mavericks in the conference semifinals. He shot jump shots and did
some light jogging Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling better," he said. "I can't say when I can play. It
won't be until I can go on the floor and have a hard practice. Today,
I tried to run up and down. It's still stiff. It's tight."</LD>
<TE>   Stojakovic said Friday he believed the injury was more than a
simple sprain. He also sprained his left ankle severely during a
summer league three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic averaged 18.3 points in seven playoff games before he
was injured. Hedo Turkoglu, his replacement at small forward, was
averaging 6.5 points in the playoffs before Friday. He was averaging
four points on four-for-16 shooting in the first two games of this
series.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman has been tempted to start energetic guard Bobby Jackson in
place of the struggling Turkoglu, but has so far resisted doing it
because it would create matchup problems for the Kings against the
taller Laker guards, including Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has been content to play a reserve role, scoring 21 points
in 25 minutes in Game 1 and 17 points in 23 minutes in Game 2. Of not
starting, Jackson said, "I'm OK with it. My role is to come in and
bust my [rear end] and make something happen."</TE>

<TE>   Adelman grew up in Lynwood, went to high school at Pius X in
Downey and attended Loyola Marymount. He was a Laker fan, watching
Jerry West and Elgin Baylor practice at Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry West was my idol," said Adelman, the most valuable player
of the West Coast Conference as a senior in 1967-68.</TE>
<TE>   Like any other Laker fan old enough to remember the series,
Adelman recalled with a trace of bitterness the team's loss in Game 7
of the 1969 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "[Owner Jack Kent] Cooke had all the balloons ready to be released
from the ceiling," he said, referring to part of a championship
celebration that never took place for the Lakers and their
long-suffering fans. "Everybody thought they were going to win. I was
a fan of that [Laker team]. I'm not sure I'm a fan of this one."</TE>
<TE>   Adelman and the Kings engaged Phil Jackson and the Lakers in a war
of words over all manner of subjects, including the officiating,
during the three days between Games 2 and 3.</TE>

<LD>The officiating had become such an issue the Lakers did not have to
wait until Friday night to learn the identities of the Game 3
referees.</LD>
<LD>   "I know already," Coach Phil Jackson said in a late-afternoon news
conference. "The scouts in L.A. called up and said who the referees
are going to be. It's incredible what it's like in the playoffs. And
I don't want to know."</LD>
<LD>   Veterans Steve Javie, Bennett Salvatore and John Vaden called the
game.</LD>
<TE>   Asked what he thought of the trio, Jackson said he believed the
Lakers would get a fair shake, particularly in regard to Shaquille
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're among the strongest group we've seen, probably
the best group of officials that we've seen," he said. "They all have
certain characteristics, and I think this one will call three
offensive fouls on Shaq if he creates an offensive-foul situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any problems with these guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento Kings shot 35 free throws and the Lakers shot 15,
but there would be no griping from the Lakers, who undermined
themselves in the 103-90 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant and Vlade Divac received double technical fouls late
in the third quarter after they tangled under the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Wrestling for position, Bryant hit Divac in the face with his left
elbow, and Divac turned and confronted Bryant. Players and referees
stepped in before Divac could get to Bryant, who chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker said Friday that he probably has small tears in the
cartilage of his left knee and that he hoped to avoid off-season
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look at it again," he said. "I'll do everything possible to
make that the last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Walker suffered a bone bruise on the knee about two months ago and
has been at less than full strength since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, on David Robinson's announcement that he would retire
after next season: "Let's see, I made [Arvydas] Sabonis leave. I made
Rik Smits leave..."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "No, he's a great guy," O'Neal said of Robinson. "Can't say
nothing bad about a guy like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker publicist John Black was hospitalized Thursday after feeling
lethargic. He missed Friday's game. ... O'Neal has 3,221 career
playoff points, 12th on the all-time list. Wilt Chamberlain is 11th,
at 3,607. O'Neal averaged 27.8 points in 115 games, Chamberlain 22.5
points in 160.</TE>

<DH>Kings regain home-court edge as L.A. rally from huge
deficit is too little, too late</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From behind tinted sunglasses and a wry smile, not to mention a very
thorough playoff loss that left the Lakers' three-peat expectations
more fragile than ever, Kobe Bryant leaned into a microphone and
said, "Well, we're not bored now."</LD>
<LD>   No, boredom, assuming that is what stunted their game for weeks at
a time in the regular season, and for quarters at a time in the
postseason, should not be an issue after Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Sacramento Kings defeated the Lakers, 103-90, at Staples
Center and so lead the best-of-seven Western Conference finals, two
games to one. Game 4 is Sunday at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Behind the daring Mike Bibby and the jump-shooting Chris Webber,
who combined for 50 points, the Kings built leads of 17 points in the
first quarter, 21 in the second and 24 in the third and 27 in the
fourth before the Lakers found their jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   Still suffering from the last drops of food poisoning, Bryant
scored two points in the first half and 20 in the second. Shaquille
O'Neal scored 20 points and, like everyone else, was overrun by the
Kings early, and too far behind late. The home-court advantage the
Lakers wrested away with a Game 1 victory was lost in an end-to-end
game dictated by the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a fight on our hands," O'Neal said. "We just have to
fight. We play better when we have a fight on our hands anyway."</TE>
<TE>   In their occasionally distracted quest to become the fifth team to
win three consecutive titles, the Lakers often were the last to know
they were in a fight. So vulnerable, the Lakers missed 16 of 22
first-quarter shots, while the Kings made 14 of 26, and it went on
like that until the King lead was even more than they could blow.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's so much shocking as it was disappointing,"
said Laker guard Lindsey Hunter, who scored 14 points in 21 minutes,
most of them instead of Derek Fisher. "We want to play well, of
course. We want to play a solid game."</TE>
<TE>   Then he admitted that, maybe, it was inconceivable for the Lakers
still to be unable to draw effort out of themselves in anything other
than the most dire of circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they played harder than we played," he said. "That's
shocking."</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, this was not only a win, but a win that would seem
to make another one, here on Sunday afternoon, possible.</TE>
<TE>   Given three days off and the chance to convince the Kings they
didn't belong, that Game 2 was a fluke derived from a bad burger and
worse officiating, the Lakers were virtual no-shows for the better
part of three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   They were booed at 42-23.</TE>
<TE>   Booed at 63-42.</TE>
<TE>   Booed at 83-56.</TE>
<TE>   There were desperation cheers near the end, when the Lakers scored
38 fourth-quarter points and a couple of times drew within 11 points.
Bryant scored 16 in the fourth quarter, when he made four of eight
three-pointers. But the seconds clicked away, and the Kings kept
scoring, and the Lakers refused to defend. The Kings shot 49.4% and
six players scored at least 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, in a solemn gray suit, sat quietly for most of the
game, his forearms resting on his thighs, his long hands dangling off
the ends of his knees.</TE>
<TE>   In the blowout, he let Bryant, who is recovering from the bad
cheeseburger, and O'Neal, who has bad feet, play 40 minutes each. He
was pleased the Kings were forced to work for their victory at the
end, and that they played only seven players, Scot Pollard for only
seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much to reach for.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not have a good practice week, obviously," Jackson said.
"Things came hard for us this week, and we did not have a good work
schedule, which is kind of natural if Kobe is in and out of practice
and not feeling so great."</TE>
<TE>   They scored 12 points in the third quarter after Jackson had
harped for three days about playing better coming out of halftime,
after they had scored 17 in the third quarter of Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out lethargic," forward Samaki Walker said. "It's hard
for me to figure out."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had gotten some run out of the league-wide view that
they are beatable this year, that they lacked the talent and charisma
of the team that hung a banner in only 16 playoff games last season.</TE>
<TE>   They drew bits of motivation from a sense they were vulnerable
with O'Neal hurt and the bench thin and the power forward not Horace
Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are beatable, it would seem. Now they are vulnerable, and
the Kings appear to be gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   They won their fifth consecutive road playoff game, previously a
Laker statistic.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost two of their last three playoff games at
Staples Center, and they trail this late in a series for the first
time since the 1999 conference semifinals, when they were swept by
the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   They last lost consecutive playoff games in the 2000 conference
finals, Games 5 and 6 to the Portland Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how we're going to respond," Bryant said. "We're going to
come back and play Laker-style basketball. This is a huge challenge
that we have facing us right now. This is a good Sacramento team and
we have to be ready to accept that challenge. I think we're going to
be ready to do that."</TE>
<TE>   It probably was no different than usual, but Bryant's uniform
appeared to be too big, as if he had shrunk since Monday.</TE>
<TE>   His first step lacked its usual blur. When he asked for something
more out of his legs, it didn't come. He was one for six from the
floor in the first quarter and three for 12 through three quarters.</TE>

<HD>These Rumors Are Just Sick</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Kobe's illness is subject of myriad conspiracy
theories, one straight out of a 'Sopranos' episode.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you hear what really caused Kobe Bryant to come down with food
poisoning? It was a New Jersey mob guy. It seems the Jersey mob has
bet heavily that the Nets will win the NBA title.</LD>
<LD>   So it was the mob that poisoned the infamous bacon cheeseburger
Bryant ordered from room service in the Sacramento Hyatt the night
before Game 2 of the Western Conference finals?</LD>
<LD>   You don't believe it? That's the story a caller to an L.A. talk
show this week swears by.</LD>
<TE>   There's also a story, just as unlikely, that Bryant never even ate
that cheeseburger, that he came into the hotel that night too drunk
to find his room, much less order room service.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one is claiming the guy on the grassy knoll cooked the
burger, but the last few days have certainly supplied enough stories
for a full season of "The X-Files."</TE>
<TE>   "Reporters have been calling here all week," said Jerry
Westenhaver, general manager of the hotel, "trying to make this into
the JFK conspiracy. They are really out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Westenhaver is happy to talk about the incident. Rather than
discouraging people from ordering room service at his hotel, the
effect of the Bryant incident has been just the opposite, according
to Westenhaver. Everybody, it seems, wants a Kobe Burger.</TE>
<TE>   "We are selling hamburgers beyond what we did before," Westenhaver
said. "It's the cheeseburger heard 'round the world. A local food
critic came in, ordered our food and gave it three stars in his
review."</TE>
<TE>   The local health department has also looked into the matter,
Westenhaver said, but discovered nothing amiss.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we get a food complaint, we look into it," Westenhaver
said, "but there's not much to investigate."</TE>
<TE>   Westenhaver says a bacon cheeseburger was definitely delivered to
Bryant's room that night, but one thing left hotel officials
perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a problem, it's usually not just one person [getting
sick]," Westenhaver said. "We served 1,700 meals that night,
including 300 hamburgers, and nobody else reported a bad reaction."</TE>
<TE>   That might suggest a flu bug instead of food poisoning, but not to
Laker trainer Gary Vitti, who treated Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's almost a no-brainer," Vitti said. "He ate and, five
to six hours later, he had vomiting, diarrhea and all the other
symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   Vitti said that at practice Sunday, hours before his bad meal,
Bryant had expressed an urge for Mexican food.</TE>
<TE>   Given the location of a Mexican eatery, Bryant changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I better not," he said. "It might mess up my stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention the plans of those Jersey mob guys.</TE>

<TE>   Is Shaq Deep Throat or just Big Mouth? I don't know. But I do know
that you did not report the story.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant big man on the championship team did not make what
you characterized as "thinly veiled complaints about the
officiating." He alleged game fixing, fraud and a criminal conspiracy
to extend the series through biased officiating for the monetary
benefit of the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Hot air? Sour grapes? Another bad hotel meal? Maybe. But it
deserves to be taken seriously as a story. Prove him wrong and make
him shut up or see if there is a pattern in how early playoff games
are called and how referees are assigned.</TE>
<TE>   In any other section of the paper, such serious allegations would
not be dismissed without either investigation or commentary.</TE>

<TE>   Shaq, are you so arrogant and full of yourself that you think the
only way your team can be beaten is by cheating? Everyone knows
that's what you meant by your statement. That's funny, because if
anyone can be associated with that word it is you. You are one of the
greatest players in the game. Don't tarnish that by being a whiner.
There are enough of those on other teams, including my Kings.</TE>

<TE>   Kudos to Tim Brown for his article on the Robert Horry family [May

Lakers for the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   I have never heard him complain about his daughter's disease, nor
anything else for that matter. I will try to remember that the next

<LD>I just about choked on my Wheaties seeing an actual minor league
baseball column in The Times on May 18. Kudos to writer Ben Bolch and
the sports page editors for realizing that there are a few Angelenos
out there who would welcome a (semi) regular column about minor
league baseball in the L.A. Times.</LD>
<LD>   I would much rather read a column on the hottest players in the
minors than read Ross Newhan's "Salaries Cap Dodgers' Offense" about
the team's fiscal irresponsibility the very next day. Please save
that for the Business section, not the Sports section.</LD>

<LD>By pure luck I tuned into the Dodger game Thursday and was blessed
with the real-time version of Shawn Green's incredible performance.
Even more incredible, however, was that Ross Porter, the Sultan of
Statistics, the Maven of Minutia, the Titan of Trivia, could not keep
up with all the records being broken. You could literally hear the
pages turning of the encyclopedia he carries. I hope he has
recovered.</LD>

all-time record 19 total bases. Did I miss that Gary What's-his-name
came back to the Dodgers for Green's "protection" in the batting
order? I didn't think so, but I did see that Gary's barely hitting
his weight even with Chipper Jones' "protection."</TE>

<LD>Mike Penner's crass characterization of Italian soccer as dirty
["Mexico Defeats Little Italy," May 20] is insulting to soccer fans
everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Italy's Seria A is a world-class league, considered by many tops
in the world. Italy is among the favorites to win the World Cup
again, which would be its fourth world championship.</LD>
<LD>   The World Cup warmup Mexico played with AC Milan was with a "C"
Milan team not only without many of its starters (who were training
with their national teams for the World Cup), but with a handful of
"guest" players--guaranteeing a lack of cohesion on the field and
resulting in chaotic play. Penner's crude bias aside, when Mexico and
Italy meet in the World Cup on June 13 we can expect to see a
hard-fought but clean and fair game.</LD>

<TE>   I'd like to thank The Times for giving the World Cup at least some
coverage. Mike Penner is really coming along with his knowledge of
"the beautiful game," and The Times should be commended for
dedicating two reporters full-time to the event. As a warning: Please
no stupid, jingoistic articles from T.J. Simers.</TE>

<LD>The other night I had the wildest dream! I dreamed that a bunch of
multimillionaires from the NFL approached L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn and
told him they wanted to bring a football team to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Sure," Hahn replied, "how much will you pay us for the right to
play here?"</LD>
<LD>   Rich Varenchik</LD>
<TE>   Valencia</TE>

<TE>   I am a rabid NFL fan who can't wait for the new team to arrive in
Los Angeles. Can you please tell me where the line forms for season
tickets? I want to get in line before the politicians get all the
best seats.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Park</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have an idea: Instead of building a new football stadium, which
will lose money, why not let the losing team (Chargers, Cardinals,
Saints) play in the convention center? It already loses money, so we
could put two money losers together, and cut our losses.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody will go to watch them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Robinson</TE>
<TE>   Ridgecrest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pity poor Bill Plaschke [May 17]. It seems he has never grown up
enough to develop interests in the real world. Among other things he
misses "feeling connected to the neighbors on winter Monday nights."
I presume he's referring to the "Monday Night Football" TV
broadcasts. (Just how does watching TV connect one with the
neighbors? How does he connect the rest of the year?)</TE>
<TE>   Those rooting for the return of NFL football in a new stadium
represent a minuscule minority of Los Angeles area
residents--sportswriters such as Plaschke, whose perks and job
opportunities would doubtlessly expand enormously, and slick
millionaires seeking to make more millions by gulling the citizens
into approving a $100-million bond issue for the stadium that I'm
sure they'd find a way not to repay (as other football team owners
have done).</TE>
<TE>   Talking about small percentages--what percent of the Los Angeles
area population does the 64,000 seats in that proposed $450-million
stadium represent? And that's assuming that there are that many
people rich enough to afford to buy a ticket to a game.</TE>
<TE>   Harold D. Watkins</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading about the new stadium, I think it's time for The
Times to print one of Larry Stewart's analyses of how one, or two,
NFL teams in this "media capital" will drastically reduce the number
of football games actually televised to the million-plus L.A.
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   As viewers will recall from the Ram/Raider days, L.A. rarely had a
televised doubleheader, which we now have weekly. This looks like a
lot of lost televised football for the convenience of a few thousand
corporate execs and drunkards.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if Bill Plaschke misses the NFL presence so much, why
doesn't he spend the next year in San Diego and then tell us his
thoughts? I think T.J. Simers is right about him.</TE>

<LD>Roger Kahn's story about pitcher Joe Black [May 18] was superb. It
was centered upon the man and his belief in the quality of being an
American, not just an African American. His quotes referring to the
proper use of the English language--as opposed to what some regard as
the way it is acceptable to speak in order to be thought of as
"cool"--hit the center of the strike zone, right down the pike.</LD>
<LD>   Those who cherish baseball, who cherish gentlemen, who cherish the
quality of character regardless of race or ethnicity, will cherish
the memory of Joe Black.</LD>

<LD>In the article in which Commissioner Bud Selig suggests that six to
eight major league teams may fold as long as the current economic
arrangement remains, Selig complains that he can no longer see the
continuation of funding loans because the sources are "drying up."</LD>
<LD>   Is the commissioner so blind to the fact that in today's America,
we often hold out a helping hand to those who need it (at least for a
while). When the helping hand is no longer able, those teams should
fold up their tents. After all, their owners want to sell for prices
higher than the average spectator could ever earn in three lifetimes.</LD>

<TE>   With negotiations heating up between the players' union and major
league owners, the fans face a dilemma. Whom are we supposed to root
for? The spoiled millionaires or the imperious billionaires?</TE>
<TE>   However, when we consider that it was the owners who were
convicted of collusion and forced to pay millions of dollars in
restitution, and that the owners have steadfastly refused to open
their books to a neutral party, and that the current commissioner,
Bud Selig, whose job is to represent the mutual interests of players
and management, is himself an absentee owner (of the Milwaukee
Brewers), that decision becomes a whole lot easier.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento's Space Odyssey Leads to a Laker Collapse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget fast ball, small ball or even three ball. The Lakers were
beaten by team ball. What Sacramento showed Friday night was the
essence of that.</LD>
<LD>   The vaunted Laker defense was collapsed, exposing draw-and-kick
opportunities for the Kings, from every angle imaginable. Sacramento
ran its offense high and wide. Offense is spacing and spacing is
offense.</LD>
<LD>   It was a demolition of sorts. The Lakers were driven on by the
smalls (shorter, faster players). They were posted up by Chris
Webber, and this time, Webber's post-ups put him at the foul line, or
in position to make opportunistic passes to teammates.</LD>
<TE>   Vlade Divac added insult to injury by driving, drawing and
kicking.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, even with the Lakers making a late run, it was
the Kings living large and the Lakers hanging to the lifeboat.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Laker defense looked a lot like the implosion
of the old Aladdin in Vegas. The genie out of the bottle this time
was a well-spaced, second-sided attack in the half court.
Sacramento's offense incorporated ball and player movement for this
magic carpet ride.</TE>
<TE>   This one, sadly for the Lakers, was over about the same time as
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Webber is so important to all this.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers cannot allow Webber to catch and shoot, uncontested or
late-contested, in the elbow area. Webber should be made to put the
ball on the floor. He must be made to finish at the rim.
Historically, he is not a good finisher inside. He doesn't like the
contact, doesn't like to play through the contact.</TE>
<TE>   If you had to summarize, two things really won this game for
Sacramento and lost it for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   First, Divac played well in the first half in every way. He played
defense and flew around, but didn't flop. He scored well, penetrated
well and made Shaq play him. He hit perimeter shots and also made
penetration shots.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the Lakers looked emotionally like the collapse of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   If you took a look at the Laker bench, it had all the emotion of
the nine Supreme Court justices. Even the Lakers' designated
cheerleader, Mark Madsen, was asleep at the switch. You got a role to
play, Mark. Play it.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Sacramento's bench was animated, energized and
enthusiastic. It reminded me of the old North Carolina bench under
Dean Smith. Remember that, Mitch Kupchak?</TE>
<TE>   The big Laker comeback? Of course, it was too little, too late.
Like I said, this one was done when the first quarter was done. But I
had no problem with all the three-pointers the Lakers kept launching,
even when they cut the lead to 13 and then 11. Those shots were in
rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Lakers got their main chance with the late run off
the press, and ironically, Sacramento violated in the full court the
most important thing it had adhered to in the half court--spacing.
Their press offense lacked deployment. They sped up and played right
into the Lakers' hands by doing so. You don't beat a press by
fastbreaking it.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers need to do a lot of things, or Cow Town may quickly
become Titletown.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers need to return to La-La Land ball and meticulously run
the routes of the triangle offense, which is their bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   And they need to remember to do what all great teams must do: go
home with the girl you brought to the dance.</TE>

<HD>Robinson to Retire After Next Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Robinson's 14th NBA season will be his last. The San Antonio
Spurs' 10-time All-Star is getting ready to retire.</LD>
<LD>   "My career here has been like a dream--perhaps better than a
dream," he said Friday. "It's been a great 13 years for me, and I'm
excited about next year."</LD>
<LD>   The 7-foot-1 center, who turns 37 in August, will play out the
final year of the two-year, $20-million contract he signed last
summer.</LD>
<TE>   The Spurs' career leader in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and
assists is coming off a sub-par season.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson saw limited time on the court in the playoffs because of
nerve problems in his back, legs and foot.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 4.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 20 minutes in four
playoff games for the Spurs, who beat Seattle, 3-2, in the opening
round, but were beaten, 4-1, by the Lakers in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   "Class act, legend, still my idol," Laker center Shaquille O'Neal
said before Friday's Western Conference final Game 3. "I can't say
anything bad about a guy like that."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson averaged a career-low 12.2 points and 8.3 rebounds during
the regular season, well below his career averages of 21.9 points and
10.8 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   He made his decision three years after teaming up with 7-footer
Tim Duncan to lead the Spurs to the NBA championship in 1999.
Robinson said he revealed his intention to retire well in advance to
allow the team time to plan for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the Lord has good things for me to do," Robinson said.
"But hopefully we'll have a great summer and come back and have a
fantastic year next year."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was a unanimous choice as Rookie of the Year for the
1989-90 season, was named MVP in 1995, and defensive player of the
year in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah Jazz forward Donyell Marshall had surgery to repair a damaged
right wrist, an injury that didn't cause him to miss any games last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall has spent two seasons in Utah but can become an
unrestricted free agent this summer. He said he hopes to re-sign with
the Jazz but plans to test the market.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monica Seles and Chandra Rubin advanced to an all-American final
Friday at the $170,000 Madrid Open.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin easily defeated Fabiola Zuluaga, 6-4, 6-2, but Seles
struggled to a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Paola Suarez to reach
today's championship match of this clay-court tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Suarez took the first set with a strong service game and with
precision returns just inside the lines. But Seles recovered and
played well to win the next two sets.</LD>
<TE>   "Without doubt it has been the toughest [match] of the week, and
it was very equal," said the top-seeded Seles, who won this event in
1992. "I had a good serve, however, I won because I played better on
all the decisive points."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jelena Dokic and second-seeded Silvia Farina-Elia
advanced to the final of the Strasbourg International in France with

the French Open tuneup. Farina-Elia defeated Magdalena Maleeva, 6-3,
6-1.</TE>

<TE>   Second-seeded Nicholas Lapentti will meet Fernando Vicente in
today's final of the Raiffeisen Grand Prix tournament at St. Poelten,

<TE>   After Lapentti defeated Oliver Rochus, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, Vicente
dominated the second semifinal, defeating Flavio Saretta, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>

<TE>   Russia earned a berth in the final by routing Britain in the
decisive doubles match and will face Argentina for the World Team Cup
title at Duesseldorf, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Marat Safin called for medical attention on his back early in the
match against Martin Lee, but he was able to continue for a 7-5, 7-5
victory.</TE>
<TE>   That evened the Russia-Britain meeting at 1-1 after Yevgeny
Kafelnikov lost, 6-2, 7-6 (6), to Tim Henman.</TE>
<TE>   The deciding doubles was won, 6-1, 6-0, by Kafelnikov and Safin
over Lee and Miles Maclagan, putting Russia into today's final.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Ron Hornaday, hired three weeks ago to replace Lyndon Amick,
earned the first Busch series pole of his career by qualifying first
for the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Concord, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Hornaday set a record with a lap of 182.094 mph around Lowe's
Motor Speedway, besting the 179.485 mph set by Jeff Burton seven
months ago. Michael Waltrip qualified second for today's race
followed by Bobby Hamilton Jr., Jeff Green and Todd Bodine fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The pole effort is a highlight for the 43-year-old Hornaday, who
started the season with no job after parting ways with Winston Cup
car owner A.J. Foyt at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   He has since filled in for Ricky Hendrick in the Busch series.
Hendrick is the replacement driver for Amick and will race in the
Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday as a temporary fill-in for Shawna Robinson as
that team tries to improve its results.</TE>
<TE>   Hornaday took over for Amick at New Hampshire and finished 14th.</TE>

with a 6.882-second pass at 199.61 mph in a Dodge Neon.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Gray is the provisional No. 1 qualifier in funny car after

<HD>Quinn Returns to Hospital; Game 5 Status Uncertain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Toronto Maple Leafs face elimination from the NHL playoffs after
failing to draw inspiration from Pat Quinn's unexpected return.</LD>
<LD>   The Maple Leafs on Friday had no update on Quinn, who returned to
the hospital after Thursday's 3-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes in
Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Leaf assistant coach Rick Ley said Quinn remained hospitalized,
where he is being monitored for an irregular heartbeat. He didn't
know whether Quinn he would be cleared to travel to Carolina for
today's Game 5.</LD>
<TE>   The Hurricanes lead the best-of-seven series, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ley said Quinn would not be on the team's flight Friday afternoon,
but didn't rule out the possibility of the coach making another
surprise appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a travel concern, but I think everybody knows
him well enough that, certainly, he'll be pulling out all stops to be
there," said Ley, who would take over for Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn spent two days undergoing tests and then surprised nearly
everyone by showing up Thursday night, two hours after being released
from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs played their best game of the series, out-shooting
Carolina, 31-15, but goaltender Arturs Irbe recorded his first
playoff shutout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On one side is a confident Dominik Hasek, surrounded by future
Hall of Famers and playing in a comfort zone.</TE>
<TE>   On the other is a desperate Patrick Roy, aware that he needs to
summon his best effort to prevent his team from falling into a big
hole in the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   In a matchup of two of hockey's best goalies, Hasek and the
Detroit Red Wings hold a 2-1 lead over Roy and the Colorado
Avalanche. Game 4 is today. With its second win in Denver, Detroit
could clinch the series at home on Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek, who needed to make only 20 saves in the Red Wings' 2-1
overtime win on Wednesday night, said he feels more at ease on the
ice since joining Detroit this season.</TE>
<TE>   "If I give up three or four goals, we can still score the extra
goal, whether it's four or five," he said. "Here, I can make a
mistake and my teammates can win the game for me. In Buffalo, usually
when I made a mistake, it was more difficult to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, I'm with nine Hall of Famers. In Buffalo, maybe I was the
only one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who came out of retirement to join the
New Jersey Devils in February, has retired again.</TE>

Hockey League.</TE>

<LD>Back in Cincinnati's lineup for the first time in seven weeks, Ken
Griffey Jr. was so uncomfortable in the early going he felt like "a
deer in headlights."</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the Reds must not have felt much better.</LD>
<LD>   Vinny Castilla had a three-run double in Atlanta's seven-run third
inning, helping the Braves ruin Griffey's return with an 11-2 victory
over Cincinnati on Friday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Griffey went one for four in his return after missing seven weeks
with a torn tendon in his right knee. He singled sharply in the first
inning off Kevin Millwood (3-5) in his first game since April 7. The
Reds went 25-16 in his absence and lead the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of innings I was like a deer in headlights,"
Griffey said. "As the game went on, I felt more and more comfortable
being in the outfield. I think that's going to be the adjustment
playing. It's going to be playing the outfield."</TE>
<TE>   Millwood won for the first time in seven starts, and his first
since April 8. He gave up two runs and eight hits in six innings. The
Braves had scored an average of 2.9 runs in Millwood's last nine
starts but tied a season high with 11 runs to win for the sixth time
in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Bragg started in right field in place of Gary Sheffield,
who is day-to-day because of a strained hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, San Francisco 5--Bobby Estalella homered and drove in
four runs, and Todd Helton hit his 100th home run at Coors Field as
the Rockies defeated the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Estalella went three for four with two doubles and his fifth home
run. Helton also doubled to back Denny Stark (3-0), who left after
five innings with a 6-2 lead as the Rockies won their fourth in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, St. Louis 2--Kip Wells shut down the league's
hottest team by limiting the Cardinals to three singles over 62/3
shutout innings at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals figured to carry the momentum from their 9-1 home
stand into PNC Park, where they were 6-1 last season, to lose for
only the second time in 12 games and third in 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Florida 4--Vic Darensbourg (1-1) walked four batters
in the 10th inning at New York, including Jay Payton with the bases
loaded, as the Mets overcame Armando Benitez's first blown save of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   After Tim Raines tied the score with two out in the ninth against
Benitez with his first career pinch-homer, the Mets won it in the
10th.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Philadelphia 1--Vladimir Guerrero's three-run double
off Randy Wolf (3-3) at Montreal capped the Expos' four-run seventh
inning for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Tomo Ohka (4-3) pitched seven strong innings and Jose Vidro had
two hits to extend his career-best hitting streak to 18 games, tied
for the longest in the majors this season.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, San Diego 2--Catcher Marcus Jensen made the most of
his first start of the season, hitting a three-run homer to lead the
Brewers at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Houston 4--Fred McGriff and Moises Alou each had RBI
singles in the 11th inning off Billy Wagner at Houston, leading the
Cubs to their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>

<HD>Baldwin Resigns as USOC President</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Decision comes one day after she admits to
inaccuracies in her biography.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Sandra Baldwin resigned Friday as president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, a day after admitting to discrepancies in her USOC
biography, including the listing of a doctorate in American
literature that she does not possess.</LD>
<LD>   Baldwin, 62, of Mesa, Ariz., the first female president in USOC
history, tendered her resignation following a lengthy conference call
involving the USOC's policy-making executive committee. The call
settled nothing. It was, however, made clear that the issues would be
referred to the USOC's ethics committee, thus prolonging, possibly
for months, the uncertainty over her status. Baldwin chose instead to
resign.</LD>
<LD>   Her resignation propelled the USOC into turmoil. Even as USOC
Secretary Marty Mankamyer, a Colorado Springs, Colo., businesswoman,
became acting president, factions supporting different candidates
began jockeying for position. No timetable was set for the selection
of the next president.</LD>
<TE>   The resignation also sent ripples through the International
Olympic Committee, whose ruling executive board convened a meeting
here today with the 199-nation Assn. of National Olympic Committees.</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge said Baldwin's resignation was "the
dignified thing to do," but also said, "It's a loss for the USOC and
for sport."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin had been elected an IOC member in February, at the Salt
Lake City Winter Games, by virtue of her status as USOC president; by
resigning her USOC role, she loses her IOC position.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has three other IOC members, all based in
Southern California--Anita DeFrantz, Jim Easton and Bob Ctvrtlik.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Mario Vazquez Rana, who has been president of the Assn.
of National Olympic Committees since 1979 and had recently made
Baldwin a vice president of that group, said, "In any other country,
she could save herself. But not the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Among those believed to be interested in succeeding Baldwin is
Bill Hybl, her predecessor as USOC president and IOC member. He
stepped down as USOC president at the end of his term in December
2000, but held on to the IOC seat until last February.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Friday if he would be interested again in being an IOC
member, Hybl, a Colorado Springs businessman and politician, said,
"That's a decision for the International Olympic Committee."</TE>
<TE>   Paul George, a Boston attorney who narrowly lost the 2000 USOC
presidential election to Baldwin, said he would "definitely consider"
running anew.</TE>
<TE>   Some USOC sources called Friday for the return of Harvey Schiller,
a USOC executive director in the 1990s. Schiller, now in business in
New York, said, "It's important to pick the right person. I think
they have a lot of qualified candidates. I haven't been part of
Olympic stuff for a while. Right now I'm focusing on New York."</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz, who, like the two other remaining U.S.-based IOC members
also serves on the USOC's executive committee, said, "I believe an
Olympian ought to lead us." A bronze medalist in rowing at the 1976
Montreal Games, she was quick to add, "I'm not proposing myself. But
there are many Olympians who could lead our organization."</TE>
<TE>   Some on Friday suggested Michael Lenard, a 1984 Olympian in team
handball, now a Los Angeles businessman. Lenard ran against Hybl for
the presidency in 1996, losing by a slim margin. He has long been
close to Baldwin and declined to comment Friday on his plans, saying,
"To be honest, I'm just sitting here kind of numb."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, an Arizona real estate executive, was elected USOC
president in December 2000, succeeding Hybl.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin's USOC biography says she graduated from Colorado
University in 1962 with an English degree. In fact, she graduated
that year from Arizona State. She spent her freshman and sophomore
years in Boulder, then moved back to Arizona, where she is from, and
finished college at Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   The bio also says she earned a doctorate in American literature in
1967 from Arizona State. She did not earn the degree, she said
Thursday. She said she never completed her dissertation.</TE>
<TE>   Questions emerged about Baldwin's biography only after a student
at Colorado, inspired by an on-campus talk a few weeks ago, decided
to write a feature for the school's alumni magazine about
Baldwin--only to find out she had not graduated from the university.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin had concluded over a whirlwind few days that she had
little choice but to resign--because, as she was told, significant
discrepancies in one's self-supplied biography were at odds with a
movement that promotes integrity and ethics.</TE>
<TE>   She hesitated, however, out of concerns that resigning would undo
her strategy of reaching out to other national Olympic committees,
particularly within the Western Hemisphere, and that her departure
would leave the USOC in the hands of political opponents.</TE>
<TE>   She issued a statement Friday through the USOC saying, "I accept
full responsibility for the mistakes I have made."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Ward, a former chief executive at Maytag, became USOC chief
executive in October after Baldwin had pressed for his hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Ward left the USOC's Colorado Springs headquarters for a weekend
at his Florida home shortly after telling the staff about Baldwin's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Many connected with the USOC apparently were taking a fresh look
at their resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Perez, a member of the executive committee who won a gold
medal in taekwondo at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said, "I'm going
through my bio right now. You want to know the truth? Everybody is."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "The good news about being an Olympic gold
medalist--that's a fact."</TE>

<LD>A bacon cheeseburger, please.</LD>
<LD>   And a slice of cheesecake.</LD>
<LD>   And hurry.</LD>
<TE>   Ours is a town that today is desperately in need of something to
make it double over like a shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Anything to avoid looking at Friday, a night when Staples Center
was poisoned with careless, lazy, laughable Laker basketball.</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to Kobe Bryant's earlier stomach problems,
their 103-90 loss to the Sacramento Kings wasn't only a game.</TE>
<TE>   It was a two-and-a-half-hour purge.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the notion that the Lakers are the better team in these
Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, they were barely even a team.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the notion that the Lakers are destined to be playing for
another month of Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   If they don't win this Sunday, their season is over.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the idea that when pressure pushes, their veterans know
how to shove.</TE>
<TE>   There were veterans out there Friday?</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal certainly didn't act like one. According to Coach
Phil Jackson, the center of the Laker attack began the game by asking
the Lakers not to throw him the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Go away,' and, 'Let me get my feet into this game,'"
Jackson said, noting that O'Neal wanted to establish his own rhythm
in the wake of tight officiating. "I think that he was a little bit
tentative perhaps about how the game was going to go for him inside,
and what it was going to look like."</TE>
<TE>   By taking only four shots while his team was outscored, 32-15, in
that first quarter, O'Neal established a rhythm indeed. Instead of
the usual thump-thump-thump, though, it was ping-ping-ping.</TE>
<TE>   The league's heavyweights were featherweights. The two-time
champions were tomato cans.</TE>
<TE>   They avoided not only throwing the ball to O'Neal, but throwing
themselves at the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Awful defense. Lousy loose-ball effort. Dumb shots. You folks
driving those crowded freeways at 3 p.m. Friday, you weren't the only
ones who started the three-day weekend early.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played harder than us," Brian Shaw said. "They
outhustled us. Our defense was not aggressive. We just didn't play
hard. You can live with other kinds of losses, but not that."</TE>
<TE>   On offense, they surely set the playoff record for airballs, and
don't ask, I stopped counting.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, they certainly at least tied a playoff record for air
between them and the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher couldn't stay with Mike Bibby, hasn't stayed with
Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, still obviously weakened from his apparent poisoning, was
beaten to the basket by Doug Christie.</TE>
<TE>   And Chris Webber was more alone than a Sacramento vegetarian.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like they had just about any shot they wanted in the
book," said Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   All this, and the Lakers still amazingly had a chance to win the
game, pulling to within 12 points with five minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But, after using three pointers to cut what was once a 27-point
deficit, they forgot that they suddenly had time to move a little
closer.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Hunter threw up an awful, forced three-point attempt that
was short.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George threw up an awful, off-balance three-point attempt
that also missed.</TE>
<TE>   The relieved Kings answered with five consecutive points, and soon
it was time for questions.</TE>
<TE>   How could this happen?</TE>
<TE>   How do the Lakers, tied 1-all with a difficult opponent, walk into
Game 3 at home like it was recess?</TE>
<TE>   How does a team that beat the Kings by 27 points in a similar
series-tied playoff game here two years ago lose so much ground so
fast?</TE>
<TE>   Despite scoring 16 points in an adrenaline-nuts fourth quarter,
Bryant is still clearly recovering from--or still suffering
from--this week's stomach illness.</TE>
<TE>   Despite surviving earlier duels with Damon Stoudamire and Tony
Parker, Fisher is wearing down against the emerging Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Despite finally moving well in Game 2, O'Neal is standing around
again, either because of injury or perceived insults from the
officials.</TE>
<TE>   And despite making big plays in so many big playoff games the last
two years, Rick Fox and Robert Horry--a combined four for 17
Friday--seem just plain tired.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' dominating opening-game victory in this series,
clearly their best game of the playoffs, was thought to inspire them.
Instead, it seems to have worn them out.</TE>
<TE>   Lose Sunday, and they'll probably have the rest of the summer to
snooze.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we'll see what we're made of," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully it's not the stuff of bacon cheeseburgers and
cheesecake, but stranger things have happened.</TE>

<LD>No one on Reseda Cleveland's baseball team, seeded No. 15 for the
City Championship playoffs, seemed surprised Friday by its 3-1
victory over No. 2-seeded Roosevelt (24-5) in a first-round game at
East Los Angeles College.</LD>
<LD>   "We think we can beat anybody," said Cleveland pitcher Byron
Grubman, who threw a five-hitter to improve to 7-3.</LD>
<LD>   Cleveland (18-11), the fourth-place finisher in the West Valley
League, handed Roosevelt left-hander Ricky Romero his first defeat.
Romero (12-1) came into the game with 152 strikeouts in 73 innings.</LD>
<TE>   The Cavaliers were aggressive from the outset, taking advantage of
four wild pitches, four walks, two hit batters and three stolen
bases. Romero struck out 10 and gave up four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Spottiswood had an RBI single in the third inning for
Cleveland. Grubman's RBI single in the sixth and a sacrifice fly by
Matt Jordan made it 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second year in a row that the 15th-seeded team has won
its opener. Roosevelt did it last year, making it to the final at
Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Southern Section quarterfinals:</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo 2, Palos Verdes Peninsula 1--The top-seeded Scorpions
couldn't collect the clutch hit they needed to overcome a masterful
pitching performance by Peninsula's Andy Beal, so they capitalized on
a hit batter instead.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded in the bottom of the sixth inning, Beal
plunked Brad Boyer with a changeup that brought Brett Scyphers home
with the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   Delmon Young (4-1) pitched 11/3 scoreless innings of relief to
seal the victory for Camarillo (28-4), which advances to play Long
Beach Poly (22-8) in a semifinal Tuesday at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Beal (8-2) allowed six hits and two unearned runs over six
innings, striking out five and walking three. The sophomore shut down
Young, who went hitless in three at-bats. Peninsula (20-9) scored in
the fourth inning when Jordin Gill reached base after being hit by a
pitch and later scored on Kyle Degener's RBI groundout.</TE>
<TE>   But the USC-bound Degener made a costly error in the bottom half
of the inning when he fielded Travis Sutton's ground ball at third
base and didn't make a throw to first, thinking the ball was in foul
territory. The ball was ruled fair, allowing Doug McGee to tie the
score at 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood 2, Anaheim Esperanza 0--The Lancers scored two unearned
runs in the fifth inning and junior right-hander Jason Wanamaker
tossed a three-hitter in a Division I game at Lakewood High.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza left-hander Greg Miller, who has signed with California,
held second-seeded Lakewood (27-5) hitless until Patrick Luyben's
one-out double in the fifth. Allen Woods followed with an infield
single.</TE>
<TE>   Miller (9-4) struck out Aljay Davis for the second out. With
Daniel Steward at the plate, Miller's pickoff throw caught Woods off
first. First baseman Rick Taloa took two steps toward Woods, then
threw home after Luyben broke for the plate. Taloa's throw was in the
dirt, allowing Luyben to score and Woods to reach third.</TE>
<TE>   Woods scored when shortstop Ryan Vanderstraeten couldn't get
Steward's grounder out of his glove.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood, which will play Righetti on Tuesday, is making its first
baseball semifinal appearance since 1994. Esperanza finishes at
19-10.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>This is a city of feet. You walk in Boston. At a stoplight somebody
says, "How 'bout those Sox?" You nod at the stranger and he asks,
"Got tickets for tomorrow?" "For the baseball game?" you ask. "Or the
Celtics, either way," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Only sports can do this for a city. And in this city most of all.</LD>
<LD>   There is too much to talk about, too much to celebrate, too much
to argue over, dissect, contemplate in this town on this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The Celtics are almost the Celtics again. They gradually became
UnCeltic after their last NBA championship team in 1985-86. The last
time they had won a playoff series was a first-round sweep of the
Pacers in 1992. They were really finished being the Celtics during
the Rick Pitino era, when there was lots of complaining and
squabbling by players and coaches but not much winning.</TE>
<TE>   There is no Boston Garden anymore and the Celtics are still trying
to rebuild a connection to the fans who wandered away. For a while it
was too hard to be a Celtic fan, if you had admired Bill Russell or
Larry Bird or Dennis Johnson or Bob Cousy or Kevin McHale or Robert
Parish. By the time Pitino went to Louisville, many fans had
disconnected from the Celtics, shut down, turned off. They'd cheer
politely, boo perfunctorily, but they kept their hearts to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They haven't quite given up their hearts yet, but their chests are
open. Coach Jim O'Brien is one of them, Irish, an Eastern basketball
gym rat. The Celtics are in the NBA Eastern Conference finals, tied
with New Jersey at a game each and home for games today and Monday on
a holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   And the Yankees are in town for four glorious games. The Yankees
and Red Sox are two of the three best teams in baseball right now,
according to the standings. The series started Thursday night. Pedro
Martinez was brilliant, the Red Sox won, 3-1, and this city hums like
a quivering tuning fork, reverberating faster and faster, noisier and
noisier.</TE>
<TE>   There is a group of boys playing baseball in a small park next to
Logan Airport. Some are wearing Red Sox shirts, some are wearing
Celtic jerseys and all of them stop their game to talk about their
favorite teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Pierce went three for 20 and the Celtics won anyway,"
13-year-old Antonio Michael says. "No way Pierce goes three for 20
again. Nets can't beat the green when Pierce is three for 20,
whaddaya think's gonna happen when he goes 14 for 20? Huh? Celtics
rule."</TE>
<TE>   "But did you see Pedro last night?" 12-year-old Jose Portas asks.
"I wish Pedro could pitch all four games this weekend. I hate the
Yankees. I like the Celtics too, but I really hate the Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   Portas has lived in Boston five years. He came from Puerto Rico
with his father, also Jose, five years ago. "I never heard of the
Celtics or Red Sox before," Jose says. "But they are in my head all
the time now, you know? I made my father get me a radio. I want to
listen to all the games all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is smitten with the Lakers, of course. Angelenos
expect the Lakers to win another championship and don't want or
expect to hear anything else. The series with Sacramento is important
and talked about. It is in all the papers, on all the talk radio
stations. But Laker feeling doesn't seem to run through the fabric of
our city in quite the same way.</TE>
<TE>   We are in cars and hear about the Lakers on the radio. Then we are
in our houses and watch the Lakers on TV. We don't get to walk and
talk to strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Around Fenway Park on Thursday night, there were dozens of men,
boys, some women, who stood and listened to the Red Sox-Yankee game
on the radio. They didn't have tickets and could have been home
watching on TV, but they wanted to be there. They wanted to touch a
Fenway wall, buy a grilled sausage and stand next to a stranger to
argue, pitch by pitch, every move on each team.</TE>
<TE>   No team in baseball has been playing as well as the Anaheim Angels
and nobody cares. Barely 16,000 come to the park. The games have been
invisible, hardly on TV and changing radio stations every night. It's
hard work to find an Angel game and all that bad history means an
empty stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Here, a bad history means angst and disgust, sadness and a
psychiatrist's encyclopedia worth of analyses about what has been
wrong with the Red Sox, the Celtics and the city. But it doesn't mean
empty stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   "You are here for the Celtics?" the cabdriver asks. He is from
Bangladesh, a Boston resident for 12 years. It is a struggle to
understand the man. His voice is still rich with the sounds of his
birthplace. But he wants to talk. He wants to talk Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think the defense the Celtics played on Tuesday turned
things around?" he asks. "I think that is the difference now. The big
mo has shifted."</TE>
<TE>   The cab driver understands momentum and the game and loves that
"my Celtics," as he keeps saying, played the kind of defense he
expects. He says that after Bird retired, he turned his attention to
the Patriots. He says it was also too heartbreaking to be a Red Sox
fan. "But I like these Celtics," he says. "They do something for me.
How can I explain? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   There is no explaining, only enjoying. It is what sports can do.
Make neighbors of everybody on one holiday weekend.</TE>

<LD>There are SWAT teams and then there are "so what" teams, and the
former met the latter Friday when the U.S. World Cup team arrived in
South Korea after an exhausting 141/2-hour flight from New York.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans expected tight security to surround them during the
tournament, but what they found when Korean Air Flight 82 touched
down at Incheon International Airport caught even them by surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Once the players emerged after being rapidly cleared through
customs, they passed through a corridor of several hundred police
officers and other armed security officials who secured their way to
the team bus, parked outside not far from an armored vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   The bus was escorted on the 30-mile ride into Seoul by police in
cars and on motorcycles, by a van carrying eight SWAT team members
who rode alongside it, and by three police helicopters overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans took it all in with a shrug. So what else is new?</TE>
<TE>   "You really don't pay much attention to it," said forward Clint
Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been here before and we anticipated great security," said
Coach Bruce Arena. "Perhaps not to this degree, but we're not
complaining."</TE>
<TE>   All 32 World Cup teams are being closely guarded during the
monthlong tournament in South Korea and Japan, but Korean officials
have tripled the security detail assigned to the U.S. team, according
to Shin Sung-Chul of the National Police Agency's World Cup security
squad.</TE>
<TE>   All teams will have four plainclothes officers with them at all
times, but Shin told the Associated Press earlier in the week that
"the U.S. team will have eight more SWAT team members following them
as it is considered a likely target for terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   That possibility was underlined Friday by the U.S. State
Department, which issued a warning to American citizens already in
the two countries or intending to travel there to see the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorism and hooliganism are the usual security risks at
international sporting events," the State Department said. "Americans
should avoid demonstrations or large groups where hooligans may
congregate."</TE>
<TE>   The warning was intended to be cautionary in nature.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no information at this time that there are any specific
or credible threats directed at the World Cup teams or events
surrounding the World Cup," the State Department said.</TE>
<TE>   During the first round of the World Cup, the American team will be
based at a hotel in downtown Seoul. That, too, is heavily secured and
surrounded by a sort of buffer zone.</TE>
<TE>   With labor unrest increasingly likely during the May 31-June 30
tournament, the South Korean government has banned protest rallies
within 1,000 yards of World Cup stadiums and within 600 yards of team
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, the J.W. Marriott, has set aside one floor for the U.S.
delegation and blocked off elevator access to that floor, except for
one elevator for the exclusive use of players, coaches and team
officials. The SWAT team will be stationed on the same floor.</TE>
<TE>   Metal detectors, bomb-sniffing dogs and a bomb-disposal team are
only part of the security net for the Americans. According to Gene
Williams, a former Marine who is the team's security director, 120
people are involved in protecting the U.S. squad, and include at
least four CIA agents as part of the undercover detail.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team is accustomed to tight security whenever it plays
abroad and especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Arena was asked at the airport whether he was worried about
potential terrorism during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about that," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mathis: "Whatever happens, happens."</TE>
<TE>   The players will take a day or two to acclimate, and then they can
start thinking about their June 5 opener against Portugal.</TE>

<HD>That 32-0 Gets Put to the Test Right Away</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After Sparks' ring ceremony, Liberty will
get first shot at cracking Cooper's goal of undefeated season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How long did league officials deliberate before approving a matchup
of the Sparks and the New York Liberty in the WNBA season opener
today?</LD>
<LD>   Thirty seconds at most.</LD>
<LD>   And that was before Spark Coach Michael Cooper brazenly declared
his team is striving to go through the 32-game regular season
undefeated.</LD>
<TE>   New York has never feared the Sparks. Last year, the Liberty ran
Los Angeles out of Madison Square Garden, beating the Sparks by 13 in
a physical game that resulted in L.A.'s largest losing margin of the
regular season. Cooper admits to a grudging respect for New York,
which lost to Charlotte in the playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a veteran team, so it's going to be an interesting
matchup," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of the way Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson are an "interesting"
matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's going to be a tough, physical game," Cooper
continued. "But I think we're as ready as we can be right now."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to getting their rings for winning the 2001 WNBA
title, the Sparks will get a quick reading on their chance to repeat.
The Liberty has appeared in three league finals--losing every time to
Houston--and is a perennial contender. They have perhaps the East's
best center, Tari Phillips, and a three-guard tandem enhanced by the
acquisition of Korie Hlede from Utah in exchange for New York's
first-round pick in the 2002 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Hlede gives New York Coach Richie Adubato another veteran to spell
starters Teresa Weatherspoon, Vickie Johnson and Crystal Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks will play without one regular today. Latasha Byears
will receive her championship ring but will not be in uniform. She
must serve a one-game suspension imposed by the league after pleading
no contest this spring to a reckless driving charge in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *SPARKS TODAY</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records (2001)--Sparks 28-4, Liberty 21-11.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Liberty (2001)--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Those attending today's game should get there early. The
arena doors will open at 10:30 a.m., and new security measures at
Staples Center require all bags to be searched. Staples officials
advise spectators not to bring bags larger than a small briefcase. No
cans, bottles, banners, signs, video cameras or cameras with
interchangeable lenses will be allowed inside. Small, fixed lens
cameras are acceptable. The championship ring ceremony is scheduled
to begin at 11:30 a.m. Last year in New York, the Liberty handed the
Sparks their worst loss of the season, 82-69.</TE>

<DH>Lakers: Up-tempo style brings L.A. back into game, but
don't expect team to now rely on it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers played lifeless basketball for three and a half quarters
Friday at Staples Center, beaten down by the more energetic
Sacramento Kings. When the Lakers rallied impressively midway through
the fourth quarter, it was still too late to make a difference in a
103-90 loss in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   What will it mean for Game 4?</LD>
<LD>   "There's not too much we can take from this game other than the
energy we had in that situation," said guard Brian Shaw, one of three
reserves to play 11 minutes or more in leading the fourth-quarter
charge. "We have to play the next game with reckless abandon. Like
they play."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings built an 83-56 lead by playing with energy, passion and
precision. The Lakers trimmed Sacramento's advantage to 87-75 in a
little more than two minutes by playing a frenetic game that goes
against Coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, searching for a spark, ditched his customary method of
operation after the Lakers trailed, 75-52, after three quarters.
Jackson opened the fourth with Shaw, Devean George, Lindsey Hunter
and Kobe Bryant--four guards--playing with power forward Samaki
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Starters Shaquille O'Neal, Rick Fox and Robert Horry were on the
bench. O'Neal played eight minutes in the last quarter. Horry played
one minute and Fox didn't play at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We mixed it up a lot," Hunter said. "We had all guards on the
floor [except for Walker and later O'Neal]. We were pressing, trying
to play a helter-skelter game. It was a little too late.... I don't
think we woke up in time to know there was a game going on."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, don't expect the Lakers to play the same
scrambling style as they did in the last quarter Friday when they
face the Kings in a must-win Game 4 on Sunday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   It's not their style. It was a one-time thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to cut it to 10 points with six minutes to go," Bryant
said. "If we had cut it to 10 with six to go, it's a whole new
ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers got as close as 98-87 by forcing turnovers with
full-court pressure deployed by Bryant, Hunter, George and Shaw. They
also got within striking distance on the outside shooting of Bryant,
who scored 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, Hunter (10 of
14 in the fourth) and Shaw (five of 10).</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers made 23 of 70 shots (32.9%) through three quarters, but
improved only slightly, to 13 for 31 (41.9%) in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to expend so much energy trying to get back in the game,
we had nothing left," Shaw said. "It's not a matter of their Xs and
O's are better than our Xs and O's. They played harder. If they
continue to play harder, they're going to win the series."</TE>

<HD>It's Still Balancing Act in WNBA's Sixth Year</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: As the league hits benchmark season,
commissioner Ackerman is optimistic, but questions remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Happy birthday, WNBA.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 season will be the sixth year of operation. No other U.S.
women's professional sports league--the LPGA is a tour, not a
league--has made it past five years. The WNBA's former hoop rival,
the American Basketball League, folded in 1999 after three seasons.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm more optimistic than ever about our future," said WNBA
Commissioner Val Ackerman, predicting that 2002 will prove to be a
watershed season by building on the league's success to date.</LD>
<TE>   WNBA attendance averaged more than 9,000 a game last year, and 12
of the 16 league teams reported increases from the 2000 season. The
biggest jump was in Los Angeles, which went from 6,583 in its last
year in the Forum, to 9,278 in its first year at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   National corporate sponsors include American Express, General
Motors, Lady Footlocker, Sears, Anheuser Busch and America Online.
The biggest sponsor remains the NBA owners, whose financial support
allows the league to survive.</TE>
<TE>   More teams are on the way. San Antonio, which needs 6,000 pledges
of $50 each to field a team in 2003, is more than halfway toward
meeting the Nov. 15 deadline. Golden State Warriors' officials have
expressed an interest in unveiling a team in Oakland in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is a high-profile rookie class entering the league,
including four members of the NCAA champion Connecticut team, who are
expected to bring a following with them. "Part of that optimism is
[that] women's basketball is coming of age," Ackerman said. "It's
been successful at so many levels: the number of girls who play at
youth levels is growing, the high school game is established and
popular, the collegiate game is very solid and the international game
is vibrant. And WNBA has made strides as well. The game is in great
shape."</TE>
<TE>   Many challenges lie ahead. Start in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   The Sting's NBA counterpart, the Hornets, are moving to New
Orleans. The WNBA has never operated a team in a non-NBA city. Until
now.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said the league will operate in Charlotte this season
with the goal of keeping the Sting there. If successful, it's more
likely the league will look to establish other teams in non-NBA
cities and welcoming non-NBA owners.</TE>
<TE>   "[Charlotte] ... is a test," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The key will be fan support. The Sting's attendance had fallen
from a high of 8,561 in 1998 to 5,685 in 2000, before inching back up
to 6,595 last year. And much of that increase can be credited to
Charlotte's rebounding from a 1-10 start to reach the WNBA finals.</TE>
<TE>   League officials are eyeing San Antonio for an expansion
franchise. But if the Sting can't get back to an average of 7,000 a
game and the league can't find ownership to its liking, that Carolina
drawl will fastbreak into a Texas twang.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line," said Sting General Manager Sam Russo, "is can
the city can be successful with attendance and the corporate
sponsorships that came in this year? We are doing better than in the
past with [attracting] sponsors. The ticket sales aren't where we
want to be yet.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum we got from last year's playoff run is where we'll
hang our hat. We have coming back the team that played the Sparks in
the finals, where last year we had new players and a new coaching
staff. Right now we're in a better position to start the season."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman is counting on a new crop of players to deliver the fans.
Although rookies who are not first-round picks have a hard time
earning a roster spot, only 26 of the 110 players that began the
league in 1997 are still here.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 class, starting with that peerless Connecticut quartet of
Sue Bird (the year's top draft pick), Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and
Tamika Williams, and including other rookies such as Nikki Teasley,
Stacey Dales-Schuman, Sheila Lambert, Michelle Snow and Danielle
Crockrom are the next generation of WNBA player--bigger, faster and
more athletic than her predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   While the WNBA is traditionally seen as a more team-oriented,
fundamentally sound game than the NBA, the move toward more
one-on-one soloists seems inevitable and irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that could help generate fan interest. Cleveland
President Jim Boland does not: "I think one of the very exciting
things of WNBA is the team approach in our game. It's a throwback to
the old days. "Perhaps the biggest issue lurking for the WNBA is
money--and who gets it.</TE>
<TE>   Player salaries are among the lowest in sports. Ackerman says the
average salary could reach $60,000 this season. The officials from
the WNBA Players Assn. says subtract the health plan, housing
subsidies and meal per diem, which the league pays for but factors in
when discussing contract figures, and the figure is closer to
$40,000.</TE>
<TE>   That seems even more paltry considering players can earn double
and triple those figures playing overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty thousand is not a sustainable salary," said union spokesman
Dan Wasserman. "The players aren't getting more than 15% of the
league revenues. They devote six to eight months of training and
practice. And when a player signs a contract, they are obligated to
make appearances and are required to participate in exhibition games.
... It's a year-round commitment."</TE>
<TE>   The Basic Agreement, negotiated between the players' union and the
owners in 1999, expires after this season. Besides increasing
salaries, the union will probably press for free agency and the
ability of players to market themselves to others besides league
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Since the league and not individual teams negotiate player
contracts, free agency does not seem feasible until the franchises
are operating on their own. That, according to Ackerman. will not
occur in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming our business model opens up and we place teams in
non-NBA cities we go in that direction," Ackerman said. "But there's
no intention now to make [the WNBA] a stand-alone league. We cannot
replicate the infrastructure that the NBA makes available."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said the league is not yet profitable "and there is no
timetable" to make it so.</TE>
<TE>   That will make salary increases, and what is a fair raise, the
driving issue of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Spark owner Johnny Buss believes it's time for a generous salary
hike, particularly for the first-generation WNBA players who may not
be in the league that much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "For me personally, I think we're to the point where we should
sustain approximately a 50% increase," Buss said. "I would like to
see salaries double.</TE>
<TE>   "To compensate for that increase in player salaries we'd have to
sell more national sponsorship, do better with TV contracts, and
bleed it down to the local marketing. But a league that's 6 years old
should be able to start pulling in more sponsors and better dollars
to compensate for players' salaries."</TE>
<TE>   Buss' words will hearten folks such as Bruce Levy, a New
York-based agent who has been representing female athletes for 24
years. Last season his agency represented 40 WNBA players.</TE>
<TE>   "Women should get a fair share of what they generate," Levy said.
"Give the women 5% of what the [NBA] men make and I would be happy,
which means average salary would be around $200,000."</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments do not thrill most WNBA executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have an investment in the league, and that is to protect
the expenses and operate prudently," said Kelly Krauskopf, CEO of the
Indiana Fever. "We'd all like to see the players get raises like
employees at typical companies. But we have to continue to monitor
our revenues versus expense and make sure we're in business 10 years
from now."</TE>
<TE>   Boland is more blunt. "A move like that could be extremely
detrimental to a league still trying to establish itself. To double
salaries makes no business sense."</TE>
<TE>   The players' union and league management agreed there would be no
strike or lockout, making sure the season will be played.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations will not intensify until September, meaning all the
WNBA action this season will be on the court.</TE>

<LD>The WNBA is identical to the NBA in one respect: The West has better
athletes and more quality teams than the East.</LD>
<LD>   A true East team has yet to win the league championship. (Yes,
Houston was in the Eastern Conference in the maiden 1997 season, but
there is nothing more "west" than Texas.) And the West has won all
three league All-Star games.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Los Angeles broke Houston's four-year grip on the WNBA
title, and aims to establish a similar dynasty. The challengers,
however, are lined up and ready to knock off the Sparks' crown--in
the East as well as the West.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOXES)</TE>
<TE>*--*
EASTERN CONFERENCE
Cleveland (22-10)
Coach: Dan Hughes
Best player: Merlakia Jones (13.5 ppg)
Prospectus: The Rockers rolled to the East's regular-season title but
were dropped by Charlotte in the playoffs. Cleveland doesn't give up
much--a league-low 55.9 points a game--but needs more scoring. Hughes
hopes the offense can be more evenly spread between Jones, fellow
veteran starters Chasity Melvin and Rushia Brown, and newcomers
Deanna Jackson and Penny Taylor. The Rockers will miss point guard
Helen Darling, who may be out for the season after giving birth to
triplets
New York (21-11)
Coach: Richie Adubato
Best player: Tari Phillips (15.3 ppg; 8.0 rpg)
Prospectus: No other team knows championship heartbreak like the
Liberty, which has lost three WNBA finals series. The biggest
question is whether New York has another title run left. The core of
Vickie Johnson, Phillips, Teresa Weatherspoon and Tamika Whitmore are
all 30 and older. Adubato has started retooling, drafting forward
Linda Frohlich and trading for guard Korie Hlede
Miami (20-12)
Coach: Ron Rothstein
Best player: Elena Baranova (11.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg)
Prospectus: The Sol made the playoffs for the first time and is
poised for bigger things in 2002 if ... Baranova makes an appearance.
The 6-5 forward is preparing with the Russia national team for the
world championships in September, and may be a no-show this year.
Without her, Miami falls back unless Sheri Sam and Sandy Brondello
continue their excellence, and Ruth Riley emerges as force
Charlotte (18-14)
Coach: Anne Donovan
Best player: Andrea Stinson (14.1 ppg)
Prospectus: Charlotte began the year 1-10 and could have packed it
in. Instead the Sting got hot and made it to the WNBA finals before
bowing to L.A. Stinson and Allison Feaster are the foundation; Tammy
Sutton-Brown is developing into a dependable center. The Sting has to
hope point guard Dawn Staley's knees aren't about to give out, and
that exciting rookie Sheila Lambert's broken right leg heals quickly.
Southland products Erin Buescher and Maylana Martin were acquired
from Minnesota
Orlando (13-19)
Coach: Dee Brown
Best player: Nykesha Sales (13.5 ppg)
Prospectus: The most watched rookie at Orlando may be Brown, who had
a 12-year NBA career and is taking his first shot at coaching. The
most watched player may be Clarisse Machanguana, whom the Miracle
acquired from Charlotte in exchange for the seventh pick in the
draft. She joins Sales and Taj McWilliams-Franklin in the front
court. Guard Adrienne Johnson needs to rebound from last year's
Achilles' injury
Indiana (10-22)
Coach: Nell Fortner
Best player: Tamika Catchings (injured last year)
Prospectus: Why is 10-win team generating a big buzz? For starters,
the Fever has a sound Tamika Catchings, the 2000 college player of
the year. She missed last season with a torn ACL but could be the
best rookie this year. Then there's Nikki McCray, acquired from
Washington. McCray has been derided as being past her prime and is
eager to prove people wrong. In the draft, Indiana picked up Tawana
McDonald with the 13th pick, a 6-4 center who was put in injured
reserve Friday
Detroit (10-22)
Coach: Greg Williams
Best player: Astou Ndiaye-Diatta (11.8 ppg)
Prospectus: The Shock's off-season has been good and bad. On the
downside, Australian guard Jae Kingi will not play this season, guard
Rachael Sporn is out (pregnancy) and projected starting guard
Dominique Cantry broke her left hand. On the upside, taking Swin Cash
with the second pick in the draft should pay off handsomely
Washington (10-22)
Coach: Marianne Stanley
Best player: Chamique Holdsclaw (16.8 ppg, 8.8 rpg)
Prospectus: The Mystics were second in the league in home attendance.
Imagine what it would be like if the fans had a team worth watching.
New coach Stanley (and "consultant" Pat Summitt, a pretty fair coach
herself at Tennessee) are trying hard to change Washington's loser
status. The Mystics grabbed Stacey Dales-Schuman and Asjha Jones in
the draft. If veteran forward Vicky Bullett can again be a
double-digit scorer, and Holdsclaw plays hard every night, the
franchise cornerstones are in place</TE>

WESTERN CONFERENCE
Los Angeles (28-4)
Coach: Michael Cooper
Best player: Lisa Leslie (19.5 ppg, 9.6 rpg)
Prospectus: It's rare when a defending champion makes a critical
lineup change. But the Sparks sent point guard Ukari Figgs to
Portland for the rights to Nikki Teasley and have given the rookie
the ball. L.A., with prime-time players such as reigning MVP Leslie,
Tamecka Dixon, DeLisha Milton, Mwadi Mabika and Latasha Byears, is
good enough to return to the finals. Cooper is banking that Teasley
will be the piece the Sparks need to be a dynasty
Sacramento (20-12)
Coach: Maura McHugh
Top player: Yolanda Griffith (16.2 ppg, 11.2 rpg)
Prospectus: The Monarchs were the only team last year to take a game
from the Sparks in the playoffs, and they expect to challenge both
L.A. and Houston for West supremacy. Sacramento was stunned by the
loss of talented guard Edna Campbell, who is sitting out the season
because of breast cancer. The Monarchs do have high hopes for top
draft pick Hamchetou Maiga, and veterans Ruthie Bolton, Kedra
Holland-Corn, a sound Ticha Penicheiro and Tangela Smith make them
dangerous
Utah (19-13)
Coach: Candi Harvey
Best player: Natalie Williams (14.2 ppg, 9.9 rpg)
Prospectus: Last year the Starzz made the playoffs for the first
time. Utah could be better this year. Besides Williams, there is the
terrific talent of Marie Ferdinand, heady veteran Jennifer Azzi and
Margo Dydek, at 7-2 the tallest player in the league. Draft
selections Danielle Crockrom and LaNeishea Caufield strengthen the
Utah bench
Houston (19-13)
Coach: Van Chancellor
Best player: Sheryl Swoopes (back from injury)
Prospectus: It's a tossup on what was harder on Swoopes, the 2000
MVP: sitting out the year rehabbing a torn ACL, or watching the
Sparks win the title. Swoopes is loudly telling anyone who'll listen
that now that she's back, no one can mess with Texas. She has
hyperextended her injured knee, but it's not like she carries the
load alone. Forward Tina Thompson (a team high 19.3 points) and guard
Janeth Arcain were All-Stars last season, and the draft yielded
Michelle Snow. The Comets also acquired Rebecca Lobo from New York
Phoenix (13-19)
Coach: Cynthia Cooper
Best player: Jennifer Gillom (12.3 ppg)
Prospectus: Cooper spent last season establishing discipline
(suspending talented head case Brandy Reed for the year) and finding
out who can play and who can't. This season she starts making over
the Mercury. But if Reed, who has been bothered by an ankle injury,
is ready to be a team player, she's a 20-point-a-night scorer. If
center Maria Stepanova has the year she is primed for, she can be a
force
Minnesota (12-20)
Coach: Brian Agler
Best player: Katie Smith (23.1 ppg)
Prospectus: The Lynx have the league's top scorer in Smith, but the
rest of the starting lineup is sorting itself out. Injuries are an
issue: If Kristi Harrower is sufficiently recovered from a torn ACL,
Smith has a point guard to get her the ball. If not, Betty Lennox
will move to the point, though she is better suited for shooting
guard. Small forward Svetlana Abrosimova should be over her foot
injuries. Rookie Tamika Williams brings muscle at power forward, and
Michele VanGorp has the size, if not always the will, to be the
center
Portland (11-21)
Coach: Linda Hargrove
Best player: Jackie Stiles (14.9 ppg)
Prospectus: By trading its top pick for Figgs, the Fire is taking a
bigger gamble than L.A. Hargrove is betting that Figgs can turn
Stiles (recovering from a wrist injury) and Portland into an
efficient offense. Hargrove is also betting the trade, which sent
Sophia Witherspoon (12.8 points) to L.A. for draft pick Gergana
Slavtcheva, will not come back to haunt her. Kristin Folkl and Sylvia
Crawley need to take some of the scoring burden off of Stiles
Seattle (10-22)
Coach: Linn Dunn
Best player: Lauren Jackson (15.2 ppg, 6.7 rpg)
Prospectus: Dunn will be happy not to have the first pick in the
draft next year. The Storm has chosen first the past two years,
getting Jackson in 2001 and Sue Bird in April. They should be the
players Dunn needs to build the team. Jamie Redd gives Seattle
another scorer; Bird will have to keep Redd from being selfish. With
the retirement of Michelle Edwards and Katy Steding, Seattle still is
young</TE>
