<LD>After more than a year in stores and 4.4 million copies sold, the "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack is finally No. 1 on the U.S. pop
sales chart.</LD>
<LD>   Despite steady sales, the traditional folk/country collection was
never higher than No. 10 until it soared to No. 2 after winning an
armful of Grammys last month.</LD>
<LD>   "O Brother" moved to No. 1 this week after selling 159,000
copies--about 4,000 more than Brandy's No. 2 "Full Moon" generated
during its first week in stores, according to SoundScan.</LD>
<TE>   The other positions in the top 10 are held, in order, by Alanis
Morissette, Linkin Park, Alan Jackson, Ludacris, Alicia Keys,
Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue and Pink. The nation's best-selling
single is B2K's "Uh Huh."</TE>

<HD>More Fans Digging His Roots</HD>
<DH>A soulful blend of rock and blues is bringing William
Topley greater attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The voice of William Topley runs deep, a warm and husky instrument in
the tradition of Van Morrison, Paul Rodgers and Mick Jagger. That's
no accident, since it was those fellow British blues shouters who
introduced Topley to the roots of rock and pop.</LD>
<LD>   That same sound has defined Topley's career, first as a member of
the group the Blessing and now as a solo artist. But he reserves
special respect for the Rolling Stones singer. "What he's done is to
combine something that British people find hard to combine: hard work
and fun," says Topley, a London native. "I don't think I have the
same energy levels as that. I'm more of a slow burner."</LD>
<LD>   At 37, Topley--who plays the Coach House on Tuesday and the
Troubadour on Wednesday--is a 10-year veteran of pop music. But he's
only now being discovered by a growing number of fans drawn to his
roots-flavored solo work. His newest album, "Feasting With Panthers,"
is a soulful mix of blues and rock, with touches of reggae
("Excuses") and even hip-hop ("Soul I Want").</LD>
<TE>   "It does change the experience," Topley says of the larger crowds.
"In Denver we had 3,000, and that doesn't happen to me all the time.
So there is still a bit of a learning curve there. It's just nicer to
have more people there who know the words and sing along."</TE>
<TE>   The new album also marks his debut on the fledgling Lost Highway
label, which has quickly built a reputation as a dependable home for
such acclaimed, roots-influenced artists as Ryan Adams and Lucinda
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're trying to create a label that serves as its own
recommendation," Topley says.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenage musician playing his first gigs in London, Topley
felt much the same about Island Records and its roster of reggae acts
and such British singers as Steve Winwood and Robert Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Topley's career with the Blessing began in 1987 and soon
accelerated with a monthly gig at the Half Moon pub in London for
three years. By the end of the band's run there, more than 300 fans
were regularly crowding the shows. Record companies noticed.</TE>
<TE>   The Blessing enjoyed some success in England, recording two albums
before disbanding. "It was exciting," Topley remembers. "We were very
naive. I must confess to making the mistake of thinking the entire
world was waiting to hear my points of view on Western civilization.
It was quite chastening at the age of 26 to find that they hadn't
been."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Blessing broke up, the band did some work with producer
Jimmy Miller, still best known for working on such genre-defining
rock albums as the Rolling Stones' "Beggars Banquet" and "Exile on
Main Street." Topley and Miller became friends and neighbors, working
on tracks with the Blessing at Olympic Studios, where Miller had once
recorded the Stones.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did for us as a group was to connect us intellectually
with the heart of the music," he says of the late producer. "He
taught us what to go for and what to value."</TE>
<TE>   That same direct approach is what Topley says he had in mind while
recording "Feasting With Panthers." The singer, who still plays with
former Blessing guitarist Luke Brighty, solidified a raw, forceful
sound for such tracks as "Back to Believing" and "Desire Is Sad" in
late 2000 while playing new songs to a live audience for three nights
at the Fox Theater in Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "I came marching out there knowing that some of the stuff would
work," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After the bigger sound of the '90s Blessing albums, Topley says,
the more direct music of his solo career has been a refreshing return
to his roots as a musician. "In a way, you could say my career is
working backwards," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The rewards have been encouraging. "This tour has brought me more
people than I ever had before," he says. "I hope I can continue to
develop the artistic side a little bit more. The two things do go
hand-in-hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Without support and encouragement, every singer-songwriter is a
potential mini-cab driver."</TE>

<TE>   Anyone who's watched flamenco firebrand Antonio Marquez flatten
audiences in the Latin world has already bought tickets to see the
Compania Espanola de Antonio Marquez on its first visit to the
Southland. Everyone else will have to scramble to catch Marquez, the
next big world-dance sensation. In collaboration with his ensemble of
17 dancers and six musicians, he'll perform choreography by Jose
Granero, Javier La Torre and his own. Born in Seville in 1963,
Marquez gained the title of "king of flamenco" only last October when
he danced for King Juan Carlos of Spain at the Royal Theatre in
Madrid. But his style is definitely more feral than regal:
passionate, assaultive and charismatic.</TE>

four works choreographed by artistic director Frank Chaves, three by
co-artistic director emeritus Sherry Zunker (one of them in
collaboration with Ginger Farley and Kevin Iega Jeff), and one apiece

<TE>   8pm Grunion</TE>
<TE>   It's that time of the year for fishing the easy way. Grunion, the
small, sardine-size fish of the silversides family, ride the waves
ashore to spawn on dark, sandy beaches in the spring and summer,
usually two to six nights after the full and new moons. Spawning
begins after high tide and continues for several hours. The Cabrillo
Marine Aquarium will offer a guided glimpse of the grunion run
Saturday night. After a film on the fish at the aquarium,
participants will assemble at the beach. As the fish come ashore to
lay their eggs, the grunion may be caught by hand. Grunion catchers
16 years and older, however, must have a valid California fishing
license.</TE>
<TE>   "Meet the Grunion," Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, 3720 Stephen White
Drive, San Pedro. Exhibit hall will open at 8 p.m.; film at 9 p.m.;
grunion run at the beach at approximately 10:30 p.m. $1 to $2. (310)

<TE>   8pm World Music</TE>
<TE>   Guinean musician Prince Diabate has been described as the "Jimi
Hendrix of the kora." Not surprising, since he has been known to
combine electric sounds with his 21-stringed, harp-like instrument,
and season his Mandingo songs with reggae, blues and rap rhythms. In
his program "Jaliyaa: Music From the Mandingo Empire," Diabate will
perform with his two cousins, guitarist Abdoulay Diabate and Famoro
Diabate on balafon.</TE>

<LD>   A young woman, sick and tired of the less-than-desirable men she's
been dating, takes a chance on a personal ad posted by another woman
in the romantic comedy "Kissing Jessica Stein." The pair hit it off
instantly and embark on a sweet but wacky courtship, making up rules
as they go along. Co-written by its two leads, Jennifer Westfeldt and
Heather Juergensen, the film has charmed audiences at several film
festivals and won audience awards at both the Los Angeles Film
Festival and the Miami Film Festival.</LD>
<LD>   "Kissing Jessica Stein," rated R for sexual content and language,
opened Wednesday in selected theaters.</LD>

art-rockers Sonic Youth, ATP kicks off with a feisty display of
wordplay, with spoken-word luminaries such as Lydia Lunch, John
Sinclair, Gerard Malanga and others joined by headlining jazzman
Cecil Taylor. Friday's highlights include an Eddie Vedder set and a
Television reunion; Saturday brings Wilco and Sleater-Kinney; and
Sonic Youth wraps it up Sunday.</TE>

<LD>Eddie Nichols is a superstar. The Royal Crown Revue frontman never
looked or sounded better than last Thursday at the Key Club. And now
I know why RCR's sax player Mando has so much soul. He was raised in
Watts....</LD>
<LD>   The Key Club party was in honor of Mark Mahoney, sort of a
welcome-to-the-neighborhood for his Shamrock Social Club tattoo
parlor. And by the by, crooner Jake LaBotz is doing a Saturday
residency at the Shamrock.... Was happy as a clam at Joey Sehee's
recent Moomba gig. The lounge wizard rocked the full house in fine
shagadelic form.... Am counting the days until March 30, when such
beach boys as Too Rude and Slightly Stoopid perform at the Roxy.
There's gonna be so much funky punky reggae love in the house, it
just might levitate.</LD>
<LD>   Author Clynt Catalyst says the Sunday reading salons at the new
Parlour club in West Hollywood are "must-hear non-TV."... Texas Terri
blew away the Viper crowd at Camaro night on Monday, thus earning her
the underground icon status as the hardest rocking gal in show
biz.... Save the dates: Duff McKagan's uber-hot rock band, Loaded,
returns to the Viper on April 1 and Slim Jim Phantom's birthday party
is at the Cat Club on March 28.</LD>
<TE>   Caught Motochrist again at a recent Dragonfly show. If those four
boys rocked any harder, they'd spontaneously combust.... Flogging
Molly's Dave King tells me he was raised in a one-room flat in
Beggar's Bush, outside Dublin. King, whose band kicks off a
three-night run at the Troubadour tonight to celebrate the release of
"Drunkin' Lullabies," says despite the tight quarters, his family
always made room for a piano. Music to me ears.</TE>

<DH>The Echo, a new club in Echo Park, has hot turntablists and
a lo-fi ambience for another reason to take the party east.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Echo Park's always been cool. The colorful region east of Hollywood
and north of downtown boasts killer views, affordable rent and an
invigorating mix of cultures. So it's no surprise that over the past
few years, Echo Park and its neighbors, Silver Lake and Atwater
Village, have become a hotbed of bars and guitars.</LD>
<LD>   The Echo is the latest draw to this already happening area.
Although only a few months old, the new spot feels like it's been
there for years, where locals mix with the area's musicians with
ease.</LD>
<LD>   With seven years of success under his belt as the driving force of
Spaceland, former Westside resident Mitchell Frank created the Echo
as an outlet for cutting-edge deejays and local artists. Frank, the
music director at Spaceland--Silver Lake's groundbreaking live music
venue--adopted the Echo and transformed it into an extension of
Spaceland, which is just a mile or so away. Like Spaceland, which
grew out of a funky old discotheque, the club doesn't have its name
out front. Just follow the line of hipsters or look for the lighted
sign promising "Guatemalan Musica" on the outside of the building.
Inside, however, it's a different story. The nightclub, which looks
like a beat-up L.A. dive, is a haven for hot deejays--its primary
raison d'etre.</LD>
<TE>   Frank, who's ushered a thousand bands in and out of Spaceland
since '95, including memorable shows by Ween, Weezer, the Foo
Fighters, the White Stripes and Beck, is focusing on two turntables
and a microphone at the Echo. I poked my head in on a recent Thursday
and caught Mannequin Lung, a deejay playing instrumental hip-hop. The
music was so good and the sound system so crisp, you couldn't help
but get swept out to the dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   Like Spaceland, the Echo also offers a stage for live performances
where bands such as Ozomatli have rocked the house since it opened
three months ago. But weekends are made for dancing, and the Echo
mixes things up on Fridays and Saturdays with hip-hop, '80s music,
punk and all forms of indie rock. In some ways, the Echo is the dance
club equivalent to Spaceland, giving music lovers the option to get
their groove on out on the dance floor. But if you're not used to
slumming it, go west, young man, because the Echo is not for you.
Aside from some colorful strings of Christmas lights, the Echo's
interior looks like blackened carne asada. Its primary creature
comforts are dozens of vinyl booths filling out the two-room club.</TE>
<TE>   Although located on Sunset Boulevard, the Echo is on the stretch
where you don't have to stuff a million quarters into the parking
meters. Parking is free at night. Mondays and Tuesdays are free, and
the cover on other nights stays way low. It's 18 and older most
nights, too, and the young crowd appreciates the very un-Hollywood
prices.</TE>
<TE>   It's so lo-fi, the respected indie music magazine, Destroy All
Monthly, chose the Echo to host a punk rock yo-yo contest. And where
else is someone going to hand you a flier for a 100%
computer-generated "B.Y.O.L." (Bring Your Own Laptop!?) event?</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, music lovers can check out some soul-house deejays, and
Saturday the Echo's hosting a Black Arts "funk hop" party. Monday is
'70s glam and old punk night; Tuesday is the convening of the Echo
Park Social Club, a collective of local musicians and artists.</TE>
<TE>   On March 19, the club presents live performances by Alex Gordon
and Hels Fornander, with deejays Santo, Solid Todd and Pigpen helming
the turntables.</TE>
<TE>   The area already boasts some of the city's most vital live music
venues in the Derby, the "Fold" in the Silver Lake Lounge, the Garage
and Spaceland, and a list of hot bars: the Short Stop, the Bigfoot
Lodge, 4100 Bar, Good Luck and Akbar, to name a few. The Echo is but
one more incentive to head east.</TE>
<TE>   The Echo, 1822 Sunset Blvd., Echo Park. Open nightly. 18 and older
with exceptions; some shows, 21 and older. Free Mondays and Tuesdays.
Cover varies other nights. (213) 413-8200.</TE>

<HD>If You're Game, It's on the Menu</HD>
<DH>With fox, snake and other exotic meats, Phong Dinh appeals
to a sense of adventure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snake salad probably won't ever rival Caesar or Cobb on the American
salad hit parade, but it's a hot seller at Phong Dinh in Rosemead.</LD>
<LD>   If you order it, don't expect to find something slithery and
ominous-looking. The snake meat looks as much like a snake as
hamburger looks like a steer. This Vietnamese-style snake salad is a
beautiful arrangement of ground meat with fresh, fragrant herbs and
crunchy tree-ear mushrooms, all tossed in a sweetish, lightly spiced
vinegar dressing. And it's fun (and delicious) to eat: You scoop up
mouthfuls with dainty pieces of the puffy sesame-studded crackers
(banh da) that garnish the platter.</LD>
<LD>   Phong Dinh actually bills itself as the home of "World Famous
Baked Fish" (a large baked catfish served with rice papers and
dipping sauce is its best-selling entree), but the menu devotes whole
sections to such once-rare meats as venison, ostrich and boar. They
may seem downright pedestrian, though, next to the kangaroo in XO
sauce (a fashionable Hong Kong bottled sauce), the alligator in rich
curry or the several dishes made from fox.</LD>
<TE>   To the Vietnamese, exotic game meats may bring to mind traditional
up-country meals, but in some circles they're the "it" food of the
moment--you half expect Anthony Bourdain to brave his way through
Phong Dinh's door with a Food Network camera crew in tow to exploit
the novelty of tender goat hot pot with kai choy for "A Cook's Tour."
Ostrich, once too weird to think about eating, now gets a thumbs-up
from nutritionists who favor it as an ultra-lean alternative to other
meat.</TE>
<TE>   And Ted Turner is turning bison into populist fare with his new
chain of bison-burger restaurants, Ted's Montana Grills.</TE>
<TE>   All this is good news for Phong Dinh, which has cultivated an
image as a Vietnamese-style Saddle Peak Lodge, albeit far more
casual. A photo mural of tumbling waterfalls spilling into lakes and
streams covers an entire wall. The scene evokes Vietnam's central
highlands around Dalat. Famed for its cool forest groves, it was
where French colonists and well-heeled Vietnamese escaped Saigon's
unmerciful heat to relax in French villas bathed in the waterfalls'
mist. They also went there, as people still do today, to dine on the
local fish and game.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tables in Phong Dinh's wide-open dining room are big
round ones seating eight, 10 or 12. A few smaller tables are pushed
into the corners, but the restaurant caters primarily to large
groups. I found this out the first time I went there. I ordered
chicken foot salad--mostly chewy tendons and spicy shredded
cabbage--and another dish of ground ostrich wrapped in la lot leaves
and rolled into pinkie-size cylinders, and the orders could have
easily fed six.</TE>
<TE>   The next time I brought a group of friends eager to experiment.
The service was solicitous but nobody ever gave us that line, "You
won't like that." Our young waitress, clearly American-raised, didn't
try to dissuade us when we inquired into the various preparations of
alligator. She told us the alligator came from Louisiana--and that
she thought maybe it was eaten in Vietnam too.</TE>
<TE>   We were sure kangaroo is not typically eaten in Vietnam, but
everyone wanted to try it. This version (No. 91) came in thin slices
marinated in garlic and lemon grass. They bring you cubes of butter
to lubricate the table-top grill, which adds needed richness to the
lean, mild meat, wonderful right off the grill.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the alligator's ferocious reputation, its meat too is
mild. Alligator luc lac style (No. 107) is cut into cubes and
drenched in brown glazy sauce under a sprinkle of chopped peanuts.
The meat is arranged on shredded lettuce and surrounded with tomato
slices, giving the platter the look of a festive banquet dish.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the snake salad (No. 111) was the hit of the entire meal. A
close second was fox with glutinous rice (No. 79): a rich, meaty
brown stew of fox accompanied by crisp polenta-like squares of
compressed rice.</TE>
<TE>   One guest took home the remaining kangaroo and the leftover
alligator, which he thought would interest his children. When they
come back, he's going to see if they'll give the fresh frog a try.</TE>
<TE>   Phong Dinh, 2643 N. San Gabriel Blvd., Rosemead. (626) 307-8868,
(626) 280-7799. 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. Beer, wine. Parking lot.
All major cards. Main dishes (most serve six to 10 people) $10.95 to
$42.95; baked fish $25 to $45. What to get: baked fish, snake salad,
kangaroo grilled at table, fox with glutinous rice, alligator luc
lac.</TE>

<HD>Dressing Up the Old Art of Seduction</HD>
<DH>In an era of explicitness, the new burlesque thrives on
leaving something to the imagination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD> Dean Kuipers is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I've noticed that people have been a little down, what with
terrorists, the recession, the war," purrs the formidable-looking
woman at the end of the catwalk in a corset and fishnets. Miss Astrid
flicks her cigarette holder and fixes the packed house at the El Rey
with one kohl-rimmed eye, the one not covered with a patch, then
continues in her languorous Marlene Dietrich plaint. "Well, cast
yourself back before all that--you were miserable then too." She
registers only feigned fatigue at hoots from the crowd. "Tonight I'd
like to introduce you to a little three-letter word. It's called
fun."</LD>
<LD>   The joke, of course, is that she doesn't say the three-letter word
that is on everyone's mind, sex. This show, the Velvet Hammer, is a
"new burlesque," and the waft of curling pheromones is clearly the
draw. So when a French mignon named Ursuline floats onstage in
circa-1789 a pannier and headdress, escorted by the men of her court
and two snotty maids named Fifi and Mimi Poubelle, the crowd of a
thousand or so roars its approval. Knowing how the skit will end only
makes it better. Suddenly, the two men tear away her hoop skirt.
Then, as the turban-clad house band pumps out the timeless bump 'n'
grind, Ursuline slowly shows us the real French Revolution, peeling
down to pasties and G-string with a libertine flourish.</LD>
<TE>   At the Velvet Hammer, it's the entertainment itself that is naked.
It's live music, bad jugglers, the sinister Miss Astrid and cardboard
props. It's a hootchy-kootchy show, a tease, a vaudeville throwback.
And as corny as that might sound, given the many flavors of live
erotica available in Los Angeles, a capacity crowd jammed the
November 2001 two-night stand at the El Rey eager to be part of the
show. Women in the audience are poured into Chinese gowns, affecting
looks from '40s gun molls to '60s casino dolls. Their besuited and
greased-back men are looking their speak-easy and hot rodder best.
Everyone's drinking (something you can't do in fully nude clubs in
California) and living out their own version of club land.</TE>
<TE>   But the new burlesque that's taken root in Los Angeles is more
than just a sexed-up celebration of retro camp. The new burlesque is
about the age-old art of seduction, about a glamorous mix of
costumes, music and titillation that's putting the sexiness back in
sex shows. And it's proving a popular reprieve from the mainstreaming
of serious sleaze. The Velvet Hammer, a semiannual event at the El
Rey next due in town March 29, along with the monthly Moulin Rouge
nights at Jumbo's Clown Room in Hollywood and other shows around the
country, are reclaiming live sex shows that have been overly
commercialized--almost corporatized--by porn.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the real conflict: commercialism versus the arts of
seduction," says Legs McNeil. The author of "Please Kill Me: The Oral
History of Punk" is writing a book about the porn industry. "The
burlesque girls are pushing back against pornography, because
everybody knows that pornography isn't sexy."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Gopnik, writing last year in the New Yorker, was generally
unimpressed with the burlesque revival in that city, which he found
combined "elements of downtown art and uptown stripping--or,
according to certain skeptics, the tawdriness of topless dancing with
the tedium of performance art." In Rudolph Giuliani's smut-free New
York City, shows like the Va Va Voom Room, run by Miss Astrid in her
New York incarnation, take on more of a sly wink.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, however, there's less irony in the act. Porn is
exploding here, busting straight into youth culture, reducing the
mystery of seduction into a stultified formula. As stripping devolves
into a kind of mean-spirited, predatory shakedown and porn becomes
MTV, burlesque's timelessness offers a more fun, and female-friendly,
brand of sexy that's not so structured around body type or franchise
fantasies. As a result, these shows have become as popular with women
and couples as they are with men.</TE>
<TE>   The Velvet Hammer's three-hour production rolls by like a
delightful cavalcade of camp. Tall, blond Ming Dynatease escapes from
a tower by climbing down her own hair, then frees herself from her
clothes. The amply endowed World Famous *Bob* brings down the house
with her pendulous shimmying. Spiderwoman Valentina Violette comes on
with eight arms to hold you. Dirty comic Phil McCrackin' spouts a
stream of expletives so foul they're funny despite themselves. Film
and stage star Ann Magnuson puts on a special guest appearance
dressed in a space stewardess suit from the film "2001: A Space
Odyssey" and belts out an "only girl in space" rendition of
Ann-Margret's "13 Men." Through it all, the Millionaire and his
Maharajahs of Melody (including members of the band Combustible
Edison) hold the transgressive acts together with a type of old-timey
film-house music that reminds you when to laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, audience members lounge in their costume finery at
darkened tables, indulging in a slightly self-conscious reenactment
of club land. Under no pressure to even tip the dancers, the crowd
responds enthusiastically to the details of the tease, jumping to
their feet at an exposed length of thigh and howling for that final
flash.</TE>
<TE>   Farrah Lynch, 25, who's seen the Velvet Hammer twice here and once
in New Orleans, tries to explain the appeal. "Burlesque is like a
dance, like an art... almost more like performance art. It's about
costumes and the way they're presented as a whole character, not just
about taking your clothes off." But most of all, she says, burlesque
is "about leaving something to the imagination--which strippers don't
do."</TE>
<TE>   The new burlesque has come to mean a lot more than post-punk retro
fadism, but a visit to the Chinatown home of Velvet Hammer creator
and producer Michelle Carr reveals its thrift-store roots. The 1920s
Craftsman bungalow is a virtual museum of kitsch, with red-and-black
Chinese-motif walls and chandeliers, '50s furnishings, tiki masks and
dolls, and a dozen or so prints featuring the doe-eyed characters of
W. Keane, the artist who has come to define retro gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a big ol' thrift-store gal," says Carr with a chuckle. She's
playing her Cruella DeVil-as-beatnik look to the hilt, with Betty
Page bangs contained by a beret, intense black swooshes for eyebrows
and blood-red lipstick. A red and black striped jersey covers the
huge goat's head tattoo on her chest, which was revealed during her
strip as the spiderwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "This comes from the whole punk rock thing," says Carr about her
collection. "Which was about growing up broke, so you make up your
own style in the thrift stores."</TE>
<TE>   Though only 32, Carr was entrenched in the '80s L.A. punk scene,
working at La Luz de Jesus gallery on Melrose. La Luz featured shows
by popular artists who exist largely outside the fine-art world,
including Robert Williams and Zap! Comix artists like R. Crumb and
Spain, Rat Fink creator Big Daddy Roth, and painters Joe Coleman and
the Pizz (who illustrated the latest Velvet Hammer program). Along
with the B-movie aesthetic of slasher films and John Waters'
trailer-trash champions, this school of hot-rod and comics-inspired
work is often called "Lowbrow." Carr also co-owned a bar called
Jabberjaw, near the edge of Koreatown, that was a hit with indie
rockers. During the early '90s, she performed as a go-go dancer at a
trend-bending fetish dance club with an unmentionable name, and with
the band White Zombie.</TE>
<TE>   Carr and a cadre of like-minded gals, including fellow La Luz
employee Rita D'Albert, who now co-produces the Velvet Hammer,
fantasized about doing a show based on men's magazines from the '50s
and early '60s. Both had come across aged copies of Playboy, Nugget,
Modern Man, Monsieur and especially Cabaret in thrift stores and flea
markets. The mainstream porn of their day, these magazines featured
photos and bios of burlesque dancers. "I just fell in love," says
Carr. "The women in them looked very fierce and like they were having
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Between L.A. and Las Vegas lies a lot of burlesque history. Until
a few years ago, legendary dancer Lili St. Cyr had a lingerie store
on Santa Monica Boulevard. Dixie Evans holds an annual show at her
Burlesque Museum in Barstow, home to costumes and archives from
burlesque's most famous names, Gypsy Rose Lee and Tempest Storm.
Though there were plenty of links to the past, Carr found no one
doing a modern show.</TE>
<TE>   The update, really, came in treating the form as folk art,
celebrating the different eras of burlesque from '50s glamour girls
to turn-of-the-century carnival vaudeville to Paris floorshows, then
giving that form lavish production, with sets, music and supporting
actors. Each dancer essentially makes her own show. Since the
costumes range from balloons to ornate French gowns, many of the
dancers spend the last few weeks of rehearsals with empty bank
accounts and fingers ravaged from sewing. The spider costume that
Carr hand-sewed for the last show, for instance, cost more than
$1,000. Show proceeds go mostly toward paying hired professionals for
sound, lights, music and for theater rental.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these acts are only used once and then retired. Carr now
spends all year producing these shows for one or two nights of glory.
She's not a trained actor or production specialist; she donned her
first set of pasties in a performance piece by L.A. artist Vaginal
Davis. D'Albert fronts a band, the Buxotics, which plays regularly in
the area, and in 2000 produced and starred in the Andy Prieboy
production "White Trash Wins Lotto." Pleasant Gehman, a dancer with
the Flowers of the Desert, a popular belly dance troupe, is an actor
and writer and was in rock bands the Screaming Sirens and the
Ringling Sisters. The one thing none of them have been is a stripper.
This was the key to their vision: Being sexy had nothing to do with
looking or acting like a porn star.</TE>
<TE>   Carr had seen a version of what she wanted to do in the early '90s
at Jumbo's. This classic Los Feliz hangout, which opened in 1970, is
a small room that bartender Nancy Butterfly likes to call "'Cheers'
with strippers." The girls there strip to pasties and G-string,
choose great music like the Cramps or Nick Cave or the Clash, and put
more emphasis on tease than cheese. But even there, Carr says, "I
would fantasize about being up there doing a number, wondering,
'What's with the Day-Glo thongs and the white pumps?'"</TE>
<TE>   "The Velvet Hammer is like our dream club that we'd love to go
see," says D'Albert.</TE>
<TE>   For their first show, on Valentine's Day 1996, they brainstormed
together on character names like Dirty Martini and Starlet O'Hara.
Their band was composed of members of Royal Crown Revue. Then they
brought in a ringer, Kitten Natividad, as the headliner. The star of
Russ Meyer's cult classic film "Beneath the Valley of the
Ultravixens" and 1973 Miss Nude Universe, Natividad, who has a
60-plus-inch bust, was still a draw even at age 48.</TE>
<TE>   Their first show sold out Pedro's Bar &amp; Grill, a 400-seat
restaurant on Vermont Avenue. The crowd was composed of hot rodders,
indie rockers, vintage freaks, drag queens and hipsters--not your
usual sports fans and businessmen who pack the strip clubs waving
their dollar bills. A whole new sexy beast had been born."Fifties
B-girl, that's the aesthetic," says Ann Magnuson. "But it's also a
reaction against the notion of Barbie Doll perfect."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a couple of rules when I look for new recruits," says
Carr. "1. No professional strippers. 2. No fake breasts. 3. No porn
stars. 4. No bad attitude. It's a very simple formula, and it works."</TE>
<TE>   For the burlesque tease to work, a standardized erotic body type
has to be erased. In a way, it requires returning to a time when
shapes weren't so rigidly defined. Audiences seem to agree. The Pizz
says that, as he sat at the first show with Robert Williams, "We both
felt like our stag party pinup obsessions had come to life."</TE>
<TE>   "Today, that whole art, the subtlety and seduction is just cut out
to go to the chase," says Greg Escalante, editor of the outsider art
magazine Juxtapoz. "The [Velvet Hammer] is the thing that brought it
back."</TE>
<TE>   Carr says she's not trying to change what happens in the strip
clubs, "but we're doing our own thing." She also does not want to see
her show transformed into something mass-produced, but demand is
increasing. The Velvet Hammer was featured during 2001 Outfest and
the show went on the road for the first time in 2001, first to
headline a burlesque Tease-O-Rama in New Orleans in May and then to
play the Street Scene music festival in San Diego in September. A
documentary about the show, "Welcome Sinners," showed to standing
ovations at the 2001 Silver Lake Film Festival, and someone snapped
up the film rights. It seems the show could tour.</TE>
<TE>   "But part of what makes it sexy is that it's not polished," Carr
says. "What if it gets to be routine? I want it to stay fresh."</TE>
<TE>   At Moulin Rouge Mondays at Jumbo's, a version of the club
atmosphere fetishized by the Velvet Hammer show exists on a regular
basis. It's slightly downscale from a dinner-theater vibe, but
there's a friendly bar jammed with regulars who are not afraid to
participate in the show. On Moulin Rouge night--the next is
Monday--the room is alive with hooting and wadded-up dollar bills
flying past tattooed necks and a pair of tiki torches set up at the
front of the stage. Jumbo's thrives in a rollicking middle ground
between theater and strip club. It's a topless bar, but the dancers
aren't dangling the lure of sexual contact.</TE>
<TE>   At Jumbo's, when women do their Moulin Rouge show, it's really a
show. As the lights come up, four gorgeous gals named Lola, Pepper,
Coco and Gypsy come up in hot pants, bikini tops and feather boas.
They kick into a rendition of a song made famous by the late Peggy
Lee, "Hey Big Spender." All trained dancers and performers outside
their work at Jumbo's, their floorshow number devolves into a campy
bit of choreographed accident where they all pull off each other's
tops. Since life is a cabaret, old chum, they wear pasties. Hoots
ring out and the dollars rain down. Nudity's the punch line, but the
point is the tease.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there are so many nude clubs and they're so explicit, so it's
like, what new can you do?" says Jumbo's owner Karen Taylor, daughter
of the original Jumbo. "Everyone is interested in sex. We've got the
new angle." The night's funniest moment, by far, is a hillbilly feud

bluegrass hit "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow" from the film "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?"</TE>
<TE>   In a world of nude entertainment disdainful of the half
measure--where exotic dance and porn are now merging into new kinds
of sex work--the burlesque angle isn't just frustrating frottage. The
whole act may be an inside joke, a retro modern, an irony referencing
only itself, but the laughter is real and the payoff is a good night
out. The erotic resides in the imagination, and doesn't it seem like
a good idea to submit to a room full of women who aren't hounding you
for your money, but just want to massage your imagination for a
couple hours? As Carr put it, "This is fun for us. If it's not fun,
then what's the point?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You fell for the tease, and now you want more. Luckily, time hasn't
quite forgotten the golden age of real burlesque, an underworld
peopled with glamour girls, graft and secret arts thriving on the
edges of daylight society. A number of great resources can take you
deeper into the tale of the tease. From live revival shows to strange
desert gatherings to academic treatises, a whole noir culture lies
just behind that velvet curtain.</LD>
<LD>   Local Live Shows</LD>
<LD>   The Velvet Hammer. One night only, March 29, 9 p.m. El Rey
Theatre, 5515 Wilshire Blvd. (323) 936-6400. Featuring "Fifteen
Fellini-esque Females" (their quote) and special guest star Ann
Magnuson. Plus a vaudevillian cast of comics and jugglers, live music
by the Millionaire and his Maharajahs of Melody and DJ Senor Amor.
Tickets: Wacko, 4633 Hollywood Blvd., L.A.; Squaresville, 7312
Melrose Ave., L.A.; Meow, 2210 E. 4th St., Long Beach, or online at
www.theelrey.com. Get a sneak preview at
www.velvethammerburlesque.com.</LD>
<TE>   Moulin Rouge Mondays at Jumbo's Clown Room. Monday, 11 p.m. 5153
Hollywood Blvd., L.A. (323) 666-1187. Get there early, the last time
this monthly show went off, ladies and gentlemen were squeezing in
the door. And why not? With acts like a naughty "Boogie Woogie Bugle
Boy" by gals who can actually tap, cheap beer and no cover, you'll be
back. www.jumbos.com.</TE>
<TE>   Pussycat Dolls. Every Thursday in April at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset
Blvd., L.A. (310) 276-2222. Created as a regular feature for the
Viper Room, these model-looking dancers don't do real burlesque,
they're more like slumming strippers. But for those who need their
show glossy and pornified, this is your ticket.

<TE>   Burlesque Contests and Conventions</TE>
<TE>   The 46th Annual Striptease Reunion &amp; Miss Exotic World Contest.
June 1, 2 p.m. The true test of the devoted burlesque fan and
fan-dancer is whether or not she's made the pilgrimage to the Exotic
World/Burlesque Hall of Fame near Barstow. This freaky museum,
founded by famed peeler Jennie Lee and now owned by Dixie Evans, "the
Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque," is jammed with photos and memorabilia,
from costumes worn by Gypsy Rose Lee to Sally Rand's shoes. Dixie
herself will show you around and hosts the Miss Exotic World. Open
daily 10 a.m.-4 p.m. 29053 Wild Road, Helendale, Calif. 92342 (760)
243-5261. www.exoticworld.org.</TE>
<TE>   Books</TE>
<TE>   The following are all in print and available on Amazon.com or at
bookstores unless indicated.</TE>
<TE>   The Queens of Burlesque: Vintage Photographs of the 1940s and
1950s. By Len Rothe (Schiffer Publishing, 1998), $18.95. A nostalgic
pictorial essay made up of publicity stills and lobby card shots of
the top stars that, as one reviewer remarked, challenges the notion
that Doris Day was the ultimate 1950s woman. Rothe's second book,
"The Bare Truth: Stars of Burlesque From the '40s and '50s" (Schiffer
Publishing, 1998), $19.95, is more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   Horrible Prettiness: Burlesque and American Culture. By Robert
Clyde Allen, Alan Trachtenberg. (University of North Carolina Press,
1991) $49.95 in hardcover.</TE>
<TE>   This is a sociological study placing early strip acts in the
general evolution of American theater since the 1840s and its
patterns of gender representation. One of Michelle Carr's favorite
books.</TE>
<TE>   Girl Show: Into the Canvas World of Bump and Grind. By A. W.
Stencell (E C W Press, 2000), $23.95. A journey to the heart of
turn-of-the-century traveling carnival sideshow girls, with a lengthy
text and 200 photos, including such spinetinglers as "Tirza--The Wine
Bath Girl." It explores these acts' origins in Europe, first
appearances in the U.S. and post-World War II heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Va Va Voom!: Bombshells, Pin-Ups, Sexpots and Glamour Girls. By
Steve Sullivan (Unknown, 1995). A full review of the pinups,
strippers and Hollywood sexpots of the 1940s through the 1960s,
including Mamie Van Doren, Betty Brosmer, Jayne Mansfield and Blaze
Starr. Also see Sullivan's other, similar book "Bombshells."</TE>
<TE>   CDs/Music</TE>
<TE>   Take It Off!: Strip Tease Classics. (Rhino Records, 1997), $17.98.
A compilation of incredible jazz and big-band swing-era bump 'n'
grind classics by various artists, like "Lonely Little G-String" and
"Take It Off" by the Genteels.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas Grind, Pt. 1 (Crypt, 1995) $13.98. Faster-paced, more
go-go attack on stripper classics, like "The Strip" by the Upsetters
and the DynaSores' "Jungle Walk." With 31 songs packed onto this
disc, there's bound to be something for the strip connoisseur.</TE>
<TE>   Movies</TE>
<TE>   "It's Burlesque," A&amp;E documentary. Covers the history of burlesque
from late-1800s belly dancer Little Egypt to Josephine Baker, Tempest
Storm to the Velvet Hammer. Camille Paglia, who appeared in the
documentary, called it "one of the most well-crafted, historically
rich, limits-testing and fun shows about sex that has yet appeared on
mainstream American television."</TE>
<TE>   In the '50 and '60s, loads of burlesque movies were made, the
prehistoric forerunner to modern porn. Some notables include the
Bettie Page trilogy "Striporama" (1952) with Lily St. Cyr and Georgia
Southern, and "Variatease" and "Teaserama," both 1955 Irving Klaw
classics. The "Striporama" series by Jerald Intrator, Parts 1, 2 and
3, includes all the stars and even footage from as far back as 1911.
Infamous breast fanatic Russ Meyer made his burlesque movie "Mondo
Topless" in 1966. All of these and more can be found at Movies
Unlimited (www.moviesunlimited.com) for around 20 bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Something Weird (www.some thingweird.com) has a great 29-tape
series called "The Grindhouse Follies," featuring well-known stars
captured in the 1940s and 1950s doing their actual routines. They
also have some irresistibly demented features such as "B-Girl
Rhapsody" (1952, Lillian Hunt) and "Bagdad After Midnight," a 1954
Phil Tucker gem that was part of an "After Midnight" burlesque
series.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood also got into the act, turning out "Gypsy" (1962, Mervyn
LeRoy) starring Natalie Wood as Gypsy Rose Lee, and "Blaze" (1989,
Ron Shelton), featuring Paul Newman as Huey Long and co-starring
Lolita Davidovich as Blaze Starr.</TE>

<HD>The Springsteen of the Preschool Set Returns</HD>
<DH>Raffi pays tribute to Django Reinhardt on 'Let's Play!,'
his first album in seven years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, sure, little Elmo can win a Grammy, and celebrities can keep on
making those now almost obligatory children's albums, but there's
been only one bona fide superstar of children's music. Remember
Raffi?</LD>
<LD>   This week, the single-monikered, mellow-voiced, doe-eyed, neatly
bearded Canadian's first new album in seven years is being released
by Rounder Records. "I'd been away from it too long, and there were
some songs knocking on the door that I had to pay attention to,"
Raffi said from the offices of his Vancouver-based Troubadour Records
company.</LD>
<LD>   The deceptively simple songs on his new "Let's Play!" CD--a cozy
"Swing" song, a lyrical expansion of "Eensy Weensy Spider," a Tibetan
children's song--have a vintage Raffi feel, in the sweet and playful
mode of his 23-year-old signature anthem, "Baby Beluga." Renditions
of "Yellow Submarine" and "What a Wonderful World" are in the same
vein; so is the folk song "May There Always Be Sunshine," recorded at
Broadway's Gershwin Theatre in 1993, and included "partly as a
gesture to the people of New York," Raffi said.</LD>
<TE>   The title track's invitation to come and play "on this jazzy
Django day"--a nod to guitar legend Django Reinhardt--is the album's
primary message, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Many adults don't understand how busy children are making sense
of the world," Raffi said. "That is their work and they do it through
play, making sense of the world outside of them and the world of
feelings and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "We should never lose our playful side," he added. "I think we do
so at too great a cost."</TE>
<TE>   Raffi learned that lesson firsthand. He had to rediscover his own
playful spirit in the early 1990s, after a period of turmoil that
included a career misstep and the breakup of his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "the Springsteen" of the preschool set by Newsweek,
Cairo-born, Armenian Raffi, 53, had also been compared to Elvis, for
his phenomenal impact on the children's music scene in the 1970s and
'80s. In 1989, when he decided to take a break from touring, scalpers
sold tickets to his "farewell" concert at Carnegie Hall for as much
as $300.</TE>
<TE>   Critics and confused parents turned sour in 1990, though, when
Raffi attempted to express his growing, save-the-environment activism
in "Evergreen, Everblue," an ecology-themed MCA release for adults.
As a measure of his clout, however, he led the way in changing how
CDs were packaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people forget that he was the first artist to insist that
his stuff be released without a long box," said rock critic Moira
McCormick, who covers children's music for Billboard magazine. "They
like to think that it was Sting or Bono or somebody, but it was
Raffi."</TE>
<TE>   (Raffi, who refuses corporate sponsorships and product tie-ins,
now insists that paper used for his books and album liner notes be
printed on chlorine-free paper.)</TE>
<TE>   When a newly energized Raffi made a 50-city U.S. comeback tour in
1993, released new children's albums in 1994 and 1995, and toured the
U.S. again though the mid- and late 1990s, he and his music were
received with enthusiasm by new crops of young fans.</TE>
<TE>   And, despite the proliferation of children's music artists
swimming in his wake, Raffi's multiple gold and platinum albums
remain staple fare in preschools and kindergarten classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be no children's music industry as we know it without
him," McCormick said. "He was the one who instituted the major
changes in how kids' artists are perceived, by working with
sophisticated, professional musicians, using sophisticated adult pop
arrangements and the latest production techniques, so that his music
would be palatable to the discerning ears of parents."</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't been forgotten, said Paul Foley, Rounder Records'
general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of radio play, even on Radio Disney, with a play list
dominated by teen pop, is "disappointing," Foley said, but "Raffi has
been able to transcend that. It's been word-of-mouth and parents and
grandparents ... are still passing it on.</TE>
<TE>   "Raffi is always the most asked-about artist on Rounder's roster,"
he said. "People are always saying, 'Is there a new one this year? Is
there a new one this year?' Just on the sales side, Raffi has 10 out
of the top 25-selling children's catalog titles every week of the
year, despite the fact that he hasn't had a record in seven years."</TE>
<TE>   For Raffi, the break has meant time to "broaden the canvas." The
more relaxed, "inspired and awake" Raffi is very much in evidence in
"Arbutus Baby" (with noted fiddler Natalie MacMaster) and "It Takes a
Village," songs that reflect his activism without losing sight of his
young fan base.</TE>
<TE>   He also used the time between albums to write his autobiography.
"Raffi, The Life of a Children's Troubadour," published in 1999, is a
decidedly adult account of a life that spans a rigidly authoritarian
upbringing, his escape as a beaded, bearded hippie and the
consciousness-raising that led to his work in global forums as an
advocate for a healthy environment and the well-being of children.
His nonprofit Troubadour Institute supports worldwide efforts to
protect and nurture children.</TE>
<TE>   "If the idea of giving priority attention to young children's
needs was taken seriously," Raffi said, "it could [benefit] everyone.
There's a unifying principle in the fact that all young children have
the same irreducible needs--for love, for respect, for shelter--and
this can be a hopeful vision for the world. If we embrace it, a child
may truly lead us and bring us together."</TE>

<HD>'Go True West' Is a Mishmash of Fun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To call a play "indescribable" violates a primary mandate of
theatrical criticism. After all, a critic's function, besides the
obvious role of criticizing, is to describe, to give the reader some
sense of the work's content as well as its worth.</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Go True West," which recently reopened at the Lillian Theater
in Hollywood after receiving two Back Stage West Garland Awards for
comedy ensemble and direction, is as close to indescribable as any
show you're likely to see this year.</LD>
<LD>   But here goes: Superimpose an absurdist play on a tai chi lesson,
film the whole thing on Super 8, then play back the footage,
alternating between a speeded-up blur and super slo-mo.</LD>
<TE>   Still don't get the picture? Let's try again. Co-creators Joe Fria
and Ben Simonetti (who both star), Antony Sandoval (who directs) and
Mami Arizono (who contributes live "music" on kazoos, drums, bells,
whistles, tweeters and an accordion) base their show on the first 20
lines of Sam Shepard's "True West." Shepard's lines are repeated
throughout the evening, at various speeds, in various dialects, and
with wildly varying shades of emotion, from the manic to the morose.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, did we mention that the play also incorporates plenty of pure
slapstick, particularly vintage Buster Keaton routines? Keaton's "Go
West" and his early short "The Scarecrow" are prominent in the mix.
In fact, the famous dinner scene from "The Scarecrow," done to a
hilarious turn by Fria and Simonetti, rounds out the evening with a
comical flourish.</TE>
<TE>   Director Sandoval has worked extensively with world-renowned
theater maven Tadashi Suzuki, and that influence is obvious in the
gravity-defying, architectural rigor of his staging and in the pure
animalistic vitality of his actors' movements. There is not a moment
of imprecision or waste to be found, only streamlined, sleek
intention.</TE>
<TE>   As for the actors, Fria and Simonetti display the timing of
seasoned vaudevillians and the concentration of Zen masters in a
succession of challenging routines, the kind of muscular, purely
comical physical business that would have done Keaton proud.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a baffling theatrical mishmash. Call it deconstruction. Or
just call it funny. There's something for everyone, from kids to
grizzled academics. And whether or not you derive any great or
lasting insight from this production, you are almost certain to find
it entertaining. So rather than searching for meaning, accept "Go
True West" for what it is--an arcane and wacky exercise in the
possibilities of movement.</TE>
<TE>   "Go True West," Lillian Theater, 1076 N. Lillian Way, Hollywood.
Tuesdays only, 8 p.m. Ends April 16. $10. (323) 221-6656. Running
time: 50 minutes.</TE>

<HD>'Flashback' Travels in Time Too Briefly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two one-acts at the Players Space, "Flashback" is a brief, breezy
evening that puffs past you without disarranging your hair. Although
performed with a certain brio by the cast, this transitory and
thematically disjointed production fails to constitute a full-blown
evening of theater.</LD>
<LD>   David Avcollie directs both offerings, which clock in at about 15
minutes each, with an unnecessary intermission thrown in to stretch
things out a bit. The opener, "Cowboys #2," is an early Sam Shepard
snippet about two ersatz cowboys who face vultures and death in a
sun-baked desert, while the sounds of a modern-day freeway--artfully
reproduced by offstage actors--roar nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Before the playlet begins, four cast members draw names out of a
hat to determine who will play the two cowboys. (The other two are
relegated to mere walk-ons.) As stated in the press notes, John C.
Reilly used the same tactic in his Broadway production of "True
West." Here, the ploy seems arbitrary.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Shepard's absurdist curiosity, which wittily implodes the
cowboy archetype and the myth of the American West, holds our
interest, if only as an exercise in the themes that Shepard would
later explore at greater length.</TE>
<TE>   "Waiting for the Electrician (or Someone Like Him)," an early
radio play by the groundbreaking 1960s comedy team, the Firesign
Theatre, concerns a woman who goes on an overseas vacation and
stumbles into a preposterous and alarming new reality. Timely but
insubstantial, "Electrician" offers much befuddlement but few laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this is one of the Firesign Theatre's lesser works, or
maybe it's just that the group's druggy, cerebralized humor doesn't
time-travel very well. Avcollie and his actors fail to make much of
their meager material, which leaves us longing for a bracing dose of
"Long Day's Journey Into Night."</TE>
<TE>   "Flashback," the Players Space, 4934 Lankershim Blvd., North
Hollywood. Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 p.m. Ends March 23. $10.
(818) 508-6612. Running time: 50 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   "Cheyenne: A Transwestern"--Don't ask why this play works as well
as it does. In her "transwestern," playwright Liz Tuccillo inverts
the macho formula of the vintage Hollywood oater, making the
swaggering gunslingers female and the pouting saloon vamps male.</LD>
<LD>   If that sounds like a silly high concept that could wear thin in
about two minutes--it is, but it doesn't. There's synergy at work
here.</LD>
<TE>   Tuccillo and director Craig Carlisle have collaborated before, on
the off-Broadway run of "Joe Fearless." The ease of association is
evident in this production, a cheerful gender-bending shoot-'em-up
that is flat-out funny from start to finish.</TE>

<HD>Chef Molina Joins Forces With Party Goddess</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's Hugo: Many of you have been e-mailing and calling us to find
out the whereabouts of chef Hugo Molina, whose Pasadena restaurant of
the same name  closed in August last year. Molina, who has also
headed the kitchens at Arroyo Chop House and Parkway Grill in
Pasadena, has joined forces with the catering company-party planner
known as the Party Goddess. Marley Majcher, the party goddess
herself, had been running into Molina at fund-raisers for years.</LD>
<LD>   "We were both in the restaurant business and had parallel
existences in Pasadena," she tells us. In January, when she needed a
new executive chef of catering and Molina needed a new job, the two
attended the same Pasadena Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting.
Majcher thinks of it as serendipity. She hired Molina and his wife,
Aricia Alvarado, as chefs and menu planners.</LD>
<LD>   To book a party with them, call (626) 449-9932 or visit www.the
partygoddess.com.</LD>
<TE>   Very McCool: Gerri Gilliland has closed her Irish pub, Jake &amp;
Annie's, in order to make it even more Irish. Her stepfather in
Ireland recently retired from running his pub, so she had its carved
teak bar (at which she learned to pull pints of Guinness before she
was 10) shipped here via the Panama Canal. She also brought over the
pub's furniture, and hired Irish artists and craftsmen to install the
bar and paint Celtic murals on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the paint is dry, the doors have reopened (just in time
for St. Patrick's Day) on the former Jake &amp; Annie's, now renamed Finn
McCool's. The menu at McCool's has been tweaked too. There's Cashel
blue cheese salad ($7.95), corned beef and cabbage ($10.95), bangers
and mash ($9.50), fish and chips ($9.95), and calf's liver with Irish
bacon ($10.95). You'll also find "boxty dishes": Irish potato
pancakes with fillings ranging from seafood ($12.95) to Guinness beef
stew ($9.50). Of course, there are plenty of Irish brews on tap. Finn
McCool's is open for lunch and dinner daily. The phone number hasn't
changed from the Jake &amp; Annie's days.</TE>
<TE>   * Finn McCool's, 2700 Main St., Santa Monica; (310) 452-1734.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion Trend? Some waiters around town have added a new element
to their uniforms: the demi-tie. It's what might result if a necktie
and an ascot mated. Because it's shorter than a traditional tie, it
stays out of the customer's demiglace (or demitasse, for that
matter). Local guy Steve Valentine designed it and manufactures
demi-ties out of upholstery fabrics such as damasks and brocades to
match a restaurant's decor. Among those sporting them are waiters at
Chaya Venice, Confete and Latin Brasserie. So now you know.</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Vineyards Dinner: Did you know there are people
growing grapes and making wine in Palos Verdes? Here's your chance to
meet them. None of the ventures is commercial, but four guys are
making Nebbiolo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Tom
Anastaziu, Jim Labarba, Norm LaCaze and Don Thomas will bring a few
bottles of their wines to Too Chez at 6:30 tonight. After the wine
tasting will be appetizers and dinner matched with Santa Barbara
wines (because there aren't enough of the Palos Verdes wines to drink
with a meal). The price is $65.</TE>
<TE>   * Too Chez, 2325 Palos Verdes Drive West, Lunada Bay, Palos
Verdes; (310) 265-8677.</TE>
<TE>   Doing the Oscar Thing: Watching the Academy Awards on television
in public while eating dinner can be considered a sporting event in
this town. Here are a couple of places where you can find the action
on March 24.</TE>
<TE>   Expect ballots on which you can attempt to guess the Oscar
winners. Granita sits you down at 5:30 p.m. to watch the show on a
big-screen television from your table. You'll be eating things like
Hobbit steak and Lord of the Onion Rings, Gosford Pork, a Beautiful
Rind (of cheese) and Monster's Rum Balls. The price is $74 plus
beverage, tax and tip.</TE>
<TE>   * Granita, Malibu Colony Plaza, 23725 W. Malibu Road, Malibu;
(310) 456-0488.</TE>
<TE>   The site of the first Academy Awards show in 1929, the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel, is the host of an Oscar-viewing party in the Blossom
Room at 5 p.m. Each of the five courses is a nod to a best-picture
nominee. For instance, the "Moulin Rouge" course is filet mignon with
Port-truffle sauce. The $75 price tag includes two glasses of wine.</TE>
<TE>   *  Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood;
(323) 466-7000.</TE>

<LD>Whispered Media's "Boom --The Sound of Eviction," which screens
tonight at 7:30 at the Egyptian in the American Cinematheque's
Alternative Screen showcase, is a real eye-opener. San Francisco has
always been a magnet city with infinite attractions and a decidedly
finite amount of space. Even so, the city had managed to accommodate
all socioeconomic classes, until the dot-com boom of the 1990s
accelerated the escalation of property values and rents. The Mission
District, a longtime Latino working-class neighborhood that was also
hospitable to artists, was one of the first targets of
gentrification. Family after family and artist after artist were
displaced for the construction of pricey condos and new commercial
structures.</LD>
<TE>   Filmmakers Francine Cavanaugh, A. Mark Liiv and Adams Wood have
charted the ever-spreading gentrification and how the community
gradually organized as the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition to
protest. As the filmmakers track the struggles of several individuals
to victory and defeat, they intercut an interview with Mayor Willie
Brown, who comes across--through his own words--as the villain of the
plot. His indifference to the plight of Mission residents is
shocking. He glosses over the evictions as voluntary moves and says a
meeting of 500 concerned residents with the planning commission is
"not representative" of the district. Everything he says so smoothly
backs up the claims of the activists that he is a pawn of real estate
developers. Some 80% of Mission dwellers are renters, and 80% of
dot-comers have now gone bust, yet at last report the Bay Area's
economic slump has not returned rents to pre-boom days.</TE>
<TE>   "Boom" is a witty, poignant and impassioned cautionary tale with
implications that apply to every big city in the country. Playing
with it is Jeremiah Zagar's 12-minute "Delhi House," a documentary
about a nonprofit clinic-rehabilitation center-orphanage serving
Delhi's poorest inner-city community. "Boom" also starts Saturday and
Sunday screenings this weekend at the Sunset 5 at 11 a.m. The
filmmakers will appear at the Egyptian and opening weekend only at
the Sunset 5. American Cinematheque: (323) 466-FILM; Sunset 5: (323)
848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque's New Irish Cinema series, which
continues at the Egyptian through Wednesday, offers a strong lineup
Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. with Pat Murphy's captivating "Nora."
The film explores the tempestuous love between James Joyce and Nora
Barnacle, a hotel maid from Galway who transfixed the young writer at
first sight with her beauty and air of self-possession. "Nora," which
was shown in theaters last May, is a gorgeous period piece with rich,
vigorous portrayals of Joyce by Ewan McGregor (who co-produced) and
Barnacle by Susan Lynch. "Volcanic" seems too puny a word to describe
the passion that seared and enveloped Joyce and Barnacle, a woman
with the courage to cast her lot with him. Just as they begin to wear
each other--and us--down with their stormy relationship, the film
adroitly shifts gears as they struggle toward a new level of mutual
understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "Nora" will be followed at 7 p.m. by "How Harry Became a Tree" by
Goran Paskaljevic, one of the most original talents to flower in the
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. When Paskaljevic, director
of "The Powder Keg" and "Cabaret Balkan," was unable to re-set a
Chinese fable from the 1920s in Bosnia because of the war, he instead
shot it in rural Ireland. The result is a picture that is Irish in
spirit, yet enriched by Paskaljevic's darkly comic, surreal vision.</TE>
<TE>   The time is 1924, and cabbage farmer Harry Maloney (Colm Meaney)
has lost a son in the recent civil war with England and then his wife
to grief. This bitter man, in a state of constant apoplexy, is
tormented by a recurrent dream in which he turns into a tree, only to
be chopped down to supply wood for coffins. He focuses his rage on
the most successful man in the community, George Flaherty (Adrian
Dunbar), the local shopkeeper and pub owner. George has a habit of
hiring pretty young girls as servants, and he agrees to act as
matchmaker for Harry's hapless son Gus (Cillian Murphy), providing
his latest hire, the lovely Eileen (Kerry Condon), as a bride for Gus
in return for half of Harry's cabbage crop. Eileen is amenable, but
Gus is shy and Harry determined to look for an angle by which he can
somehow cheat George.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing clash between Harry and George builds in tension and
complexity, and for Paskaljevic it surely must symbolize the Bosnian
strife. The ever-reliable Meaney has probably never given so nuanced
a portrayal as Harry. Paskaljevic and Meaney will be on hand for a
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Film and Television Archive's venturesome and rewarding
six-film survey "Contemporary Latin American Films" concludes Sunday
with Flavio Frederico's "Urbania," which follows the 7:30 p.m.
screening of "La Libertad," an austere, 73-minute account of the
daily life of a young Argentine woodcutter. "Urbania" stars Turbirio
Ruiz as Mr. Edmundo, a blind octogenarian who arrives in Sao Paulo in
a long, vintage Plymouth convertible driven by Ze Carlos (Adriano
Stuart), a virile, craggy, leather-jacketed middle-aged man with dyed
hair. The imperious Mr. Edmundo, on a fool's errand, clearly has not
been to the city in decades and is visiting for a final meeting with
a lost love. As memories of the past flood over the old man, views of
the city as it was 40 to 50 years ago contrast sharply with the harsh
realities of today's metropolis with its shining skyscrapers,
substantial urban decay and vast number of young people struggling to
survive in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The place where Mr. Edmundo's long-lost Teresa lived is a
magnificent old structure now completely ravaged, its once-elegant
neighborhood grown dangerous; not surprisingly, there is no sign of
Teresa. After Ze Carlos puts up the exhausted Mr. Edmundo in a
fleabag hotel, he hits the streets in search of sex in an area
swarming with prostitutes, many of them transvestites and
transsexuals. At each step of the way, every person the two men
encounter stop to speak to the camera to tell their stark stories.
What emerges is a compelling portrait of a city grown bleak,
desperate and utterly heartless. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

Susie" (Sunday at 1 p.m.) and "Broken Blossoms" (Sunday at 4 p.m.).

<DH>Lieven Debrauwer values compactness, even he moves from
short films to long.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>"Pauline and Paulette," a delightful and affectionate Belgian tale of
elderly sisters of delicacy, humor and poignancy that opens Friday at
selected theaters, marks the feature directorial debut of Lieven
Debrauwer, a lanky Fleming with long hair who turns 33 next month but
looks a decade younger. Debrauwer, fluent in English, is also a
singer, and will be heard in an upcoming Elmo Aardvark cartoon. He is
a humorous man with a gentle demeanor who grew up in a small town,
where his parents owned and operated a cafe.</LD>
<LD>   "I must have been a very difficult kid to buy toys for, because I
didn't play with little trains and cars like my younger brother did,
but I loved those Viewmasters," he recalled in an interview earlier
this year at the Belgian consul-general's home in Hancock Park.
"Behind the cafe, there was this large place you could rent for
parties. We also had funerals there, and when it was empty I used it
as a theater. I had a projector, so whenever people came to our cafe
with their children, I asked them to come to that place when it was
empty and gave them a private screening of little movies, like seven
minutes I had from Walt Disney's 'Cinderella.' I showed it over and
over.</LD>
<TE>   "There was this man who filmed wedding parties at the cafe with
one of the first Super-8 cameras, and I wanted to try it out myself
and he let me use it. So for my 15th birthday, I had my own Super-8
film made. I and my friends invented our own version of 'Snow
White.'"</TE>
<TE>   After studying photography for three years in Ghent, Debrauwer
went on to film school in Brussels. "I graduated in '91, and while I
became an independent, I had to make a living," he said. "The first
year was really terrible. I had no work at all, I did some
photography stuff, and finally I worked for a one-hour photo lab."
Eventually, he landed a job in the video department of an advertising
agency and stayed for five years. "I did a lot of local television
commercials, low-budget, and also promotional films." said Debrauwer.
"I had fun, although I wasn't telling the stories I wanted to tell,
but I was working with these tools I wanted to work with, cameras,
lights and sound.</TE>
<TE>   "In my last year in film school, I had an idea for a short film,
but it took me five or six years to actually get to shoot it, because
I wanted to do it with a professional actress, and I thought of Dora
van der Groen, the one who plays Pauline. She's a legendary actress,
so I knew her from television since I was a kid. She's a wonderful
actress like Jessica Tandy or Dame Judi Dench or Maggie Smith. She
was that caliber, and, well, I just looked up her address, wrote her
a letter, saying I'm 22, I've only made short films so far, but I
really want to make this film with you. Exactly one day and a half
from when I posted my letter, she called me." Van der Groen agreed
instantly but said she would have to wind up a TV series first, which
allowed Debrauwer time to raise money for a budget.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really impressed that as a young person I wanted to tell
a story about an older woman who was starting to forget things. This
film, 'Leonie,' was an official selection in 1997 at Cannes, where it
won the jury prize [for short films]. Dora's really very
enthusiastic, and I felt I had to find another project for her, and I
thought of the idea of having her and another living legend, Ann
Petersen, together in a film.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking that they could be neighbors, or strangers that
get to know each other in the course of the film. They might be
sisters, and that reminded me of our neighbors. On the other side of
the street from our cafe, there was a ladies' shop on the corner, run
by two sisters. Since my mother was working in the cafe, she would
call, saying she needed a new pair of stockings and I had to go get
them. I had to ring the bell, enter the shop, and they would both be
behind the counter. I would be red-faced but had to get the order for
my mother. The atmosphere of the shop and that image of the sisters
stayed with me. I thought it would be wonderful if I could capture
that, and that is how the idea of 'Pauline and Paulette' started."</TE>
<TE>   At a party at Cannes, Dominique Janne, a producer of the Belgian
film "Farinelli," approached Debrauwer and asked him if he was
working on anything. Debrauwer handed him a one-page synopsis of
"Pauline and Paulette" and was on his way. "Of course, it took a long
time to get it financed; I think we lost about two years in the
financing of the film. Because, first of all, it's a Flemish film,
it's a foreign-language film, so even when we went to France, we had
to have the script translated even to have people read it for a
co-production. Then the two main characters are in their 70s, so that
isn't very commercial, and one of them is retarded.</TE>
<TE>   "But I was really happy that in the script the producer could
really read that it was meant to be a kind of miniature film. I
remember when I was in Sienna in Italy, I was in a church, and they
had big books, and they had miniatures, which I adored. They were
very small, but I could adore them as much as a painting on the wall,
and I thought, this is the kind of picture I want to make, a work of
art that should be appreciated as such. The producer understood
that."</TE>
<TE>   "Pauline and Paulette" evolved into a drama with humor involving
four sisters. The eldest has stayed on in the family home, a cottage
on the edge of town with a glorious garden--a luminous Thomas Kinkade
image come to life--caring for Pauline, who is somewhat mentally
retarded and requires constant supervision. When the eldest sister
dies, a crisis erupts. The youngest sister lives in Brussels with a
sophisticated, exacting lover, not a welcoming situation for the
childlike Pauline. Yet the plump Paulette, a frilly cabbage rose of a
woman, who has an apartment above her shop and lives and works in a
sea of reds and pinks, is about to retire as the prima donna of the
local operetta company and pack up her business and move to a seaside
retirement community. What is to happen to Pauline?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we miss a lot of tenderness in this world," Debrauwer
said of how his film plays out. "Although I don't like the word
'message' in regard to my film--and movies may be a business, a job,
entertainment, a form of art--if you cannot do them with love and
respect, then why bother doing them?"</TE>

<DH>The museum exhibition 'Smoke, Lies &amp; Videotape' reveals the
relationship between Big Tobacco and Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Dean, lean and long, a cigarette slipped almost as an
afterthought to the side of a lazy smile; Bogie coolly lighting one
up for Bacall; Marlene's platinum curls swathed in a halo of blue
smoke--Hollywood glamour and a slow-burning cigarette have gone hand
in hand since the early days of cinema, when audiences lighted up
Havanas in the orchestra pit and stars on the screen used cigarettes
as the ultimate prop.</LD>
<LD>   The movie and tobacco industries and their long-standing and
invariably uneasy relationship is the subject of the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum's newest exhibition, "Smoke, Lies &amp; Videotape."</LD>
<LD>   Moving chronologically through film, radio and television history,
the exhibition attempts to deconstruct the complicated give and take
involving cigarette manufacturers, Hollywood studios and an
impressionable public.</LD>
<TE>   "We want the visitor to move through the exhibit and to discover,
in the way that we discovered when researching the project, how
prevalent smoking is in the media and how that affects our own
choices," says Chris Horak, the museum's curator.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition represents a directional change for the museum,
which usually houses revolving art exhibitions and a host of
Hollywood memorabilia (an extensive collection of costumes,
photographs and vintage TVs and radios). But in the past two years,
efforts have been concentrated on preparation for the "Smoke, Lies &amp;
Videotape" exhibition, which was funded by a grant from Prop. 99 and
the Tobacco Control Section of the California Department of Health
Services, Horak said.</TE>
<TE>   Geared, according to museum President Phyllis Caskey, toward "a
primary target of 16- to 24-year-olds," the exhibition aims to
educate teens about the tobacco industry's long involvement in mass
media. To do so, the organization plans to involve local schools
through free tours and surveys.</TE>
<TE>   Using clips from early film classics and modern television
programs, as well as interactive touch screens (which offer trivia
games and smoking facts) and personal MP3 players (which provide a
running narration), the exhibition attempts to steer visitors through
a revealing history of on-screen smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the state's involvement and the obvious desire to dissuade
young people from taking up a bad habit, the curators were hesitant
to force-feed teens anti-smoking propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to push people's buttons in an obvious way," says
one of the show's main designers, Barry Howard. "We want kids to go
through the exhibit and come out having made their own decisions
about smoking."</TE>
<TE>   Caskey agrees: "We wanted to let the images speak for themselves
and allow you to draw your own conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition does do a good job of keeping off the soapbox, at
times perhaps too good. Watching Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly
taking a slow, elegant drag in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," or Jack
Nicholson and Faye Dunaway sharing the quintessential postcoital
smoke in "Chinatown," one can't help but feel that what Tobacco
Control might hope to demonize looks, well ... kinda cool
(particularly with the help of clever camera work, the right lighting
and a beautiful and glamorous star).</TE>
<TE>   The museum's negative stance on smoking, however, is more than
clear in the characterization of the exhibition's animated "host": RJ
"Lucky" Morris, a shady PR man who pops up throughout the tour with a
mischievous grin and an ever-present cigarette. The point is clear
that "Lucky" (whose not-so-subtle name is an amalgamation of the
country's largest tobacco companies) will do just about everything he
can--be it clever product placement or celebrity endorsements--to
give smoking a good name.</TE>
<TE>   While the exhibit provides some fascinating cultural
relics--Johnny Carson chain-smoking on "The Tonight Show," a
cigarette commercial featuring "The Flintstones"--the real issues,
such as the ways in which media directly influence society and the
moral complexities of corporate involvement with the arts, are left,
unfortunately, on the sidelines. The exhibition tends to shy away
from direct critique in favor of playful scrutiny, and, while it
remains entertaining, it's questionable how much of an effect this
kind of ambiguity will have on the show's prospective audience.</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, a few moments in "Smoke, Lies &amp; Videotape"
that may give teens pause, particularly the footage of a young Steve
McQueen happily hawking the very cigarettes that will eventually kill
him, and the exhibition's last stop, two tall plexiglass monuments
inscribed with the names of celebrities who have died from
tobacco-related illnesses. The list records the loss of talents such
as Gary Cooper, Lucille Ball and Walt Disney.</TE>
<TE>   It stands as a reminder of untimely death that illustrates, more
powerfully than any film clip or vintage movie poster, that
Hollywood's promise of glamour through the seductions of a lighted
cigarette is, in the end, all smoke and mirrors.</TE>

<HD>More Beast Than Sexy to Cast, Crew</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only did Ben Kingsley scare audiences with his raw-nerve
performance as gangster Don Logan in "Sexy Beast," he also frightened
the cast and crew. So reports producer Jeremy Thomas on the film
noir's DVD (Fox, $30).</LD>
<LD>   "Sexy Beast" stars Ray Winstone as a London gangster who has
retired with his wife and another couple to a villa in Spain. Their
quiet and happiness are disrupted suddenly and menacingly with the
arrival of the human pit bull Logan, who bullies Winstone into doing
one last job.</LD>
<LD>   The DVD of the art-house hit includes a nice wide-screen transfer,
a serviceable featurette about the making of the film and domestic
and international trailers. The highlight is the audio commentary
featuring Thomas and Kingsley, who is nominated for a supporting
actor Oscar for his role, which one critic described as the
"anti-Gandhi."</LD>
<TE>   The cast and crew were shooting "Sexy Beast" for two weeks in
Spain before Kingsley arrived. Everyone had bonded during those two
weeks, so when he arrived, he was--just as Logan in the film--the
outsider. Plus, playing such a volatile and crass character kept
everyone on edge, Thomas says.</TE>
<TE>   If at first you don't get the ending right, then try, try again.
That's exactly what director John Dahl did with his taut little
suspense thriller, "Joy Ride," which arrives this week on DVD (Fox,
$30). The nifty digital edition features four alternate endings,
including a 28-minute never-before-seen third act to the thriller
about two brothers (Steve Zahn and Paul Walker) and their friend
(Leelee Sobieski) who find themselves being pursued by a psychotic
trucker.</TE>
<TE>   Dahl did end up using a lot of the footage from the 28-minute
sequence, but none of the discarded endings has the emotional and
psychologically unnerving impact of the one in the final film.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also features the voice auditions for the film's villain,
including Eric Roberts and Ted Levine, who ended up getting the job.
There's also more deleted footage, a passable "making of" featurette
and three audio commentaries, including one with Dahl, one with
screenwriters Clay Traver and J.J. Abrams and another with Sobieski
and Zahn.</TE>
<TE>   "Say Anything," the charming 1989 romantic comedy-drama about
first love that marked Cameron Crowe's directorial debut, arrives
this week on DVD (Fox, $20). John Cusack gives one of his best
performances as an optimistic high school oddball who falls in love
with his class' most beautiful and brainy student (Ione Skye). John
Mahoney also stars as Skye's overly protective father.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD is packed with five alternate scenes, 10 deleted scenes,
13 extended scenes, an OK featurette and TV and theatrical trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe, Cusack and Skye, who had not been together in 12 years when
they met last August to participate in the DVD, supply the terrific
audio commentary. What makes it unusual is that the trio talk about
the inception of the film for 20 minutes before it actually starts.
Fox just runs stills over their perceptive discussion.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar-winning cat and mouse duo, Tom &amp; Jerry, star in a new
made-for-video adventure, "Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring" (Warners,
$15 for VHS; $20 for DVD). Though it's always fun to watch the pair
in action, this adventure is filled with a lot of rough-and-tumble
slapstick cartoon violence that some parents may not like. There also
are two vintage Tom and Jerry cartoons, a "making of" featurette and
two games.</TE>
<TE>   Criterion has just released the beautifully restored edition of
Federico Fellini's first color film, 1965's "Juliet of the Spirits"
($30). Featuring the evocative photography of cinematographer Gianni
di Venanzo, "Juliet of the Spirits" stars Fellini's wife, Giuletta
Masina, as an unhappy woman who learns that her husband is cheating
on her. When she can't cope with the reality, she enters into a
surreal voyage of the imagination and ends up finding herself.</TE>
<TE>   Though the movie it isn't as good as such Fellini films as "La
Strada" and "8 1/2," Masina--one of international cinema's greatest,
most subtle film stars--is always a joy to watch. The DVD includes
the trailer and a recently restored documentary short featuring
Fellini discussing the making of "Juliet."</TE>
<TE>   Also new on Criterion is the two-set DVD of Wong Kar-Wai's 2000
romantic drama "In the Mood for Love"($40). Tony Leung and Maggie
Cheung star in this sophisticated, atmospheric romance set in 1962
Hong Kong, playing married neighbors who discover their respective
spouses are having an affair.</TE>
<TE>   Beautifully shot, "In the Mood for Love" has won numerous awards,
including best actor for Leung at the Cannes Film Festival two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a nice wide-screen transfer and a documentary on
the making of the film, directed by Kar-Wai.</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Bay is offering a special "Book of the Dead Limited
Edition" of Sam Raimi's 1983 gore-athon cult classic, "The Evil Dead"
($50). The collection comes in a book wrapped in fake human skin,
which--at least in the case of the copy sent for review--smells like
rotting flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Made for peanuts in 1979, "Evil Dead" finds a group of friends
going to an isolated cabin for a vacation. While there, they find a
tape recorder filled with incantations relating to a book of the
dead.</TE>
<TE>   The incantations awaken evil forces and, one by one, the friends
are possessed. Bruce Campbell, a school friend of Raimi's, stars in
this film that is filled with humor, thrills and surprisingly
sophisticated visuals.</TE>
<TE>   This special digital edition includes commentary by Raimi and
producer Robert G. Tapert (who is married to Lucy Lawless),
commentary from Campbell, trailers, a new documentary on the history
of the film and a still gallery.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight is "Fanalysis," Campbell's 26-minute documentary in
which he has fun with--but doesn't make fun of--the die-hard fans of
the film, as well as "Star Wars" and "Star Trek."</TE>

<LD>   Mozart's "The Impresario" is a satire of the music business (a
ripe target even in the 18th century), about feuding divas. From a
more recent vintage and an odd corner of the music world comes
"Oedipus Tex," by P.D.Q. Bach--a.k.a. Peter Schickele--who recently
appeared in Thousand Oaks. The piece is described by the composer, in
his usual punning manner, as "the dramatic oratorio that demonstrates
that the only two sure things in life are death and Texas."</LD>
<LD>   The opera double-header is being directed by Dean Lundquist and
Marc Dana Williams, music director/conductor. Linda Ottsen is the
producer, Adena Patten the choreographer, and Elizabeth Helms the
chorusmaster.</LD>
<TE>   * Ventura College Opera Workshop presents Mozart's "The
Impresario" and P.D.Q. Bach's "Oedipus Tex," Friday and Saturday at 8
p.m., and Sunday at 3 p.m., Ventura College Theater on Loma Vista
Road between Ashwood Avenue and Day Road. $15 general; $12 senior
citizens, faculty and staff; $10 students and children (regardless of
age). (805) 654-6459.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put-Together Art: The act and mind-set of putting together
disparate parts is at the heart of the current show at Ventura
College's Gallery 2. Welcome to the "sequel" to last year's
collage/assemblage show, culled nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than in other corners of the fine art scene,
aesthetics in the collage/assemblage scene are particularly
subjective. For this viewer, certain artists manage the delicate
balance better than others. David Sellers' assemblage involves a
strangely seamless collection of elements, including piano hammers,
voyeuristic old snapshots and doll parts.</TE>
<TE>   A dream logic holds it all together, as it does in Ruth Terrill's
"The Time Is Always Now," a clean, joyful and utterly irrational
collage. A darker persona hums in John Selleck's "Waiting for Her to
Come Out," with its vague stalker theme accented by the black-painted
corrugated cardboard.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Woolway's "Another Day, Another Dollar" combines rusty metal,
rough wood slabs and folkish figures painted on in a disarmingly
natural way. Judi Birnberg's subtle, polyrhythmic design sense
includes forms, lines and letters corralled into a happy heap. The
fine art of heaping is what it's all about.</TE>
<TE>   * "Collage/Assemblage/USA--the Sequel," Gallery 2 at Ventura
College 2, 4667 Telegraph Road. Ends March 22. Call for viewing
hours. (805) 648-8974.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regional Rearview:  For anyone interested in a regional art
history lesson, proceed directly to the California Oil Museum in
Santa Paula. A small but rich sampling of works hangs as part of a
selection of winning artworks from the Santa Paula Art Shows over the
decades. The works have been collected by the city and can be seen
scattered around different public buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable are paintings by the co-founders of the art show,
back in 1937, who also went on to spearhead a genuine art scene in
this hidden jewel of a Southern California town. Cornelis Botke is
fittingly represented by his 1938 winner, simply called "Santa
Paula," an idyllic hilltop view of the town that has changed much
less than most on the West Coast. He won again in 1951 with another
nostalgic ode to fading rural life, "Old California," painted with a
charm akin to the WPA-era Regionalist style of Thomas Hart Benton.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Jessie Arms Botke, often set her sights and her fanciful
palette on bird life and fowl. "The Intrusion," which won a "best
oil" award, is a close-up portrait of ducks, an image charged with
tacit drama.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow art show founder Douglas Shively, another important figure
in Santa Paula's art scene of yore, captures arboreal splendor with a
simple flair with the 1969 winner, "Sycamores."</TE>
<TE>   * "And the Winner Is--Santa Paula Art Show Favorites Since 1937,"
California Oil Museum, 1001 E. Main St., Santa Paula. Ends March 24.
Wednesdays to Sundays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (805) 933-0076.</TE>

<HD>O'Reilly to Be a Factor at KABC</HD>
<DH>Radio* The cable host's new syndicated show will air
opposite KFI ratings leader Rush Limbaugh's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly is taking his controversial act to
syndicated radio and will duke it out for Southland listeners with
top-rated Rush Limbaugh.</LD>
<LD>   O'Reilly, who currently hosts "The O'Reilly Factor" on the Fox
cable channel, will be the host of "The Radio Factor With Bill
O'Reilly," a two-hour program that will premiere May 8 on KABC-AM
(790) and run Monday through Friday at 9 a.m. The show will originate
from New York and is being syndicated by Westwood One.</LD>
<LD>   "This show will be a natural extension of 'The O'Reilly Factor,'''
O'Reilly said Wednesday during a conference call with reporters. "We
will take the hottest topic from the previous night's 'Factor,' and
listeners will be able to call in and weigh in on whatever it is."</LD>
<TE>   The confrontational O'Reilly, who has clashed with a variety of
politicians and celebrities, including George Clooney, said his radio
show "will give me a chance to cause more trouble. George Clooney has
already taken out all the radio outlets in his house."</TE>
<TE>   At KABC, O'Reilly will precede his Fox News Channel colleague Sean
Hannity, whose syndicated show airs weekdays at noon. KABC executives
said they are in discussions with Gloria Allred and Mark Taylor, who
currently occupy the station's 9 a.m.-noon slot, to determine their
future role at the station.</TE>
<TE>   KABC is pitting "The Radio Factor" against the first two hours of
Limbaugh's three-hour program on KFI-AM (640). KABC once dominated
that morning block with talk-show host Michael Jackson but has
trailed Limbaugh for years.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly said he spoke with associates of the veteran Limbaugh and
told them, "'If Rush has any problems with this, let us know, because
we respect him.' We were told he likes the competition. He feels it's
good for everyone. And if we're half as successful as he is, we will
be very pleased."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to taking viewer calls, O'Reilly said he wants to
bring a feminine point of view to the show and is looking "to bring
in some bright women to be my foil. It's very important to have women
on the show. My first invitation has been to [New York Sen. and
former First Lady] Hillary Clinton."</TE>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The performance by the ensemble Equal Interest at the Skirball
Cultural Center on Tuesday night explored a largely undefined musical
territory. Appealing to avant-jazzers as well as edgy classicists, it
is a creative land in which musical definitions are determined on the
spot by individual practitioners.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing as part of CalArts' Musical Explorations Series 2002,
Equal Interest consisted of violinist Leroy Jenkins, woodwind player
Joseph Jarman and pianist Myra Melford, artists with considerable
experience in traversing new musical domains. But in this case, their
performance suffered from one of the more mundane musical failings:
an apparent lack of sufficient rehearsal time to do justice to the
often-thorny selections. Nor was the program aided by the fact that
many of the pieces were filled with darkly static passages, only
rarely energized by rhythmic excitement.</LD>
<LD>   In those moments when the music did suddenly come alive--a work
apparently titled "Various Mirrors" (the printed program was changed
at the last minute) was a good example--Jenkins displayed some of the
flash and fire he has revealed in other programs. And Melford, making
a rare Los Angeles appearance, affirmed the many laudatory reviews
she has received for her capacity to combine a strikingly facile
technique with a passionate, imaginative improvisational ability.</LD>
<TE>   Jarman, moving back and forth from alto saxophone to flute, bass
flute and frame drum, played a largely supportive role; a larger
sampling of the sort of work he has done with Chicago's Assn. for the
Advancement of Creative Musicians would have provided the performance
with a much needed asset.</TE>
<TE>   The more intriguing segments aside, however, Equal Interest never
fully lived up to expectations, never quite offered the sort of new
territory adventurousness one hoped for from these three fine
artists.</TE>

<HD>Lord of the First 'Ring'</HD>
<DH>Movies* Ralph Bakshi's 1978 film used animation over live
action. How much did it influence the current blockbuster?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid all the Oscar buzz surrounding Peter Jackson's blockbuster
adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
of the Ring," one fact has gone largely unnoticed: The film that has
garnered 13 Academy Award nominations has also joined "Cleopatra"
(1963), "Romeo and Juliet" (1968) and "Heaven Can Wait" (1978) in the
tiny category of best picture nominees that are new versions of
earlier films.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the term "remake" has rarely shown up in the list of
words used to describe Jackson's first installment in the
Middle-earth ring cycle. But the first film version of Tolkien's epic
was the 1978 animated adaptation, "The Lord of the Rings," scripted
by Tolkien scholar Chris Conkling and fantasy author Peter S. Beagle
and directed by Ralph Bakshi.</LD>
<LD>   That version was also the first one to be produced under a
grueling 11/2-year shooting schedule, the first that was designed to
break the Ring trilogy into multiple films and, in a sense, the first
attempt at filming Tolkien in live action.</LD>
<TE>   "I shot the entire film live, fully costumed," says Bakshi, who is
best known for the groundbreaking and controversial 1970s animated
features "Fritz the Cat," "Heavy Traffic" and "Coonskin" and for
"Cool World" (1992). "I was trying to get a hybrid form that was not
quite animation, not quite live, with a story that was so realistic."</TE>
<TE>   The director spent six months filming the live action on two
continents. Bakshi recorded the voice track in England with a cast of
British performers that included John Hurt, Andre Morrell and Anthony
Daniels ("Star Wars'" C3PO) and played it back while a new group of
actors, many of them "little people," acted the scenes against a
white cyclorama on a sound stage.</TE>
<TE>   For the battle sequences, Bakshi shot on location in Spain with a
small army of equestrian stuntmen in grotesque Orc makeup, filming at
the same castle that had been used in "El Cid" (1961). In the
process, he also managed to outrage the Spanish film lab technicians
developing the rushes, who did not understand that the cars,
equipment and airplanes that regularly showed up in the period
footage would be eliminated in the transfer to animation.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted me fired!" Bakshi says. "As far as they were
concerned, it was a live-action picture, but there were telephone
poles and shots where one camera picked up the other camera dollying
behind the horses. I didn't care because I was going to white them
out, but they sent their entire executive staff [to the set] and told
the producer I was out of my ... mind!"</TE>
<TE>   After the live footage was shot, Bakshi spent a year on the
animation process. For the lead characters, Bakshi's animators (who
included veteran studio cartoonists Irv Spence and Manny Perez), used
a Rotoscope on the live action, drawing over the top of the live
actors' performances. So in a sense, the character of Sam Gamgee was
"played" in the film by 3-foot-9-inch actor Billy Barty, whose
distinctive mannerisms and facial expressions are recognizable
through the animation, and Frodo Baggins was played by former
Mouseketeer Sharon Baird. "My Frodo was a little girl," Bakshi says.
"I wanted the Hobbits to be asexual, because that's obviously how
Tolkien wrote them."</TE>
<TE>   (Using live action as a basis for animation was not really new,
however; it goes back to "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) and
is still employed today.)</TE>
<TE>   The more fantastical creatures, such as Gollum, were animated from
scratch. For the nightmarish Ringwraiths and Orcs, the live-action
frames were transferred directly onto cels and painted. Not only did
this create a more realistic, if surreal, effect, in the pre-digital
era it was the only way to effectively animate a battle.</TE>
<TE>   Bakshi laments that he had only four weeks to edit the film, which
was rushed to meet a Christmas release date. But even more, he
regrets the elimination of two small but all-telling words from the
title. "The contract I signed with United Artists and the producer
read 'Lord of the Rings, Part 1,' because I thought audiences should
know they were coming in to see an incomplete movie," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-hour, 11-minute film covered all of Book One and part of
Book Two, but without any indication that the story would continue,
critics complained that the ending was jarringly abrupt. (The new
version has defused this problem by making clear that the full story
has been filmed as a trilogy.)</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Part 2? Bakshi, who says he "nearly died" trying
to shoot the film first in live action, then in animation, on an
18-month schedule and a budget of $12 million, declined to continue
when he was offered only half as much to do the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings" opened in November 1978 to mixed reviews
and went on to earn an estimated $27 million domestically. Though
some praised the film for its graphic imagery, many fans of the books
felt the story had been too simplified, and some animation buffs were
disturbed by use of the Rotoscope.</TE>
<TE>   The debate it sparked continues even now on the Internet, with
some Tolkien fans criticizing everything from the characters' word
pronunciations to their hairstyles, while others line up to buy
production cels. (Charles Champlin, The Times' former arts editor,
"found the film a very long, very loud disappointment, singularly
lacking the magical charm Tolkien's  readers obviously find in the
books.")</TE>
<TE>   Now 63 and working as a painter and animation teacher in New York
while completing an independent film, Bakshi still gets winded just
thinking about the ordeal. "I should have stopped and said, 'Look,
guys, I need another year.' It was really too much to ask one man to
do it in a year and a half."</TE>
<TE>   How much influence did Bakshi's version have on Jackson's much
longer, costlier, more meticulous adaptation? Officially, none.
Bakshi, who confesses he hasn't seen Jackson's film, says friends in
Hollywood have told him that the new production team repeatedly
screened and studied his version.</TE>
<TE>   Whether intentional or not, one sequence in Jackson's film, in
which Frodo and his companions hide in the woods from a Ringwraith,
is strikingly similar to Bakshi's version.</TE>
<TE>   Bakshi is content with the thousands of e-mails he says he has
received that "pretty much break out in my favor" regarding fidelity
to the book.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid to look at the new picture because it may bust that
bubble," he adds with a chuckle, "but right now I'm very happy with
the kind of responses I'm getting from fans."</TE>

<TE>   Study Reveals Movie-</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco Link in 1980s</TE>
<TE>   A British medical journal reports that tobacco companies pushed
hard to get as much movie screen time as possible in the 1980s in an
effort to increase sales.</TE>
<TE>   One company, R.J. Reynolds, supplied free cigarettes to at least
188 Hollywood personalities--among them Jerry Lewis, John Cassavetes,
Liv Ullman and Shelley Winters--in the hope that they would continue
their habit on camera.</TE>
<TE>   The article, published in Tobacco Control this week, was based on
more than 1,500 formerly secret tobacco industry documents, the New
York Times reported.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, it confirmed what we suspected all along," said
Curtis Mekemson, a consultant for the American Lung Assn. who was the
author of the study. "The tobacco companies were well aware of the
benefits of having audiences, especially young audiences, see their
favorite stars smoking on screen."</TE>
<TE>   The report concluded that such tactics played a role in the rise
of tobacco use in films and TV shows during the 1990s. Still, none of
its findings contradicted tobacco company assertions that they halted
product placement in movies more than a decade ago.</TE>

<TE>   Producers Line Up</TE>
<TE>   for Enron Projects</TE>
<TE>   When disaster strikes, can Hollywood be far behind? A handful of
producers, it seems, is convinced that the Enron debacle has all the
ingredients for success on the big and small screens.</TE>
<TE>   According to Variety, Paramount producer Scott Rudin has optioned
a piece on the energy company appearing in the April edition of
Vanity Fair. The article was written by Marie Brenner, whose previous
story on CBS and the tobacco industry was the basis for Michael
Mann's "The Insider." Meanwhile, producer Robert Greenwald is moving
ahead on a two-hour CBS movie based on "Anatomy of Greed," a book by
former Enron employee Brian Cruver to be published by Avalon in the
spring.</TE>
<TE>   The talent agency ICM is peddling film rights to Mimi Swartz's
"Power Failure," the story of Enron whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins
that Doubleday just bought for $500,000. And, as previously
announced, Artisan Television and FX Networks have hired former "60
Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman to develop an original TV movie on
the subject.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKE</TE>
<TE>   "Die Another Day" has been selected as the title of the 20th James
Bond installment, due for release Nov. 22.</TE>

<LD>Neal Benezra, deputy director and curator of modern and contemporary
art at the Art Institute of Chicago, has been appointed director of
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He will take charge on Aug.
1, succeeding David A. Ross, who resigned seven months ago.</LD>
<LD>   A Bay Area native who was educated at UC Berkeley, UC Davis and
Stanford University, Benezra, 48, says he has "a strong emotional
attachment to San Francisco" and looks forward to leading an
institution with "great ambitions."</LD>
<LD>   He started his curatorial career in 1983 at the Des Moines Art
Center in Iowa. Two years later he joined the department of 20th
century art at the Art Institute of Chicago. Benezra moved to the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., in 1991,
first as chief curator and later as assistant director. He assumed
his present position in Chicago in January 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Among his exhibition credits are retrospectives for Edward Ruscha,
Bruce Nauman and Martin Puryear.</TE>
<TE>   His traveling exhibition of the late Juan Munoz's sculptures will
open at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles on April 21.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undaunted by the tepid response to its pseudo-documentary series
about a pop group in the making ("Popstars"), the WB tonight
introduces a fictional approach to the same topic with the
lighthearted "My Guide to Becoming a Rock Star."</LD>
<LD>   Oliver Hudson--Kate's brother and Goldie Hawn's son--stars as an
unemployed twentysomething singer who lives with his parents in a
Seattle suburb and dreams of leading his rock band, SlipDog, from
rehearsals in his bedroom to the top of the charts. His character
provides voice-over narration as the story unfolds, explaining to
other would-be popsters the key steps toward success.</LD>
<LD>   At least as interesting a premise would be a "WB Guide to
Transforming a TV Series." The differences between the first two
half-hour episodes, airing back to back at 8 and 8:30 tonight, are
striking.</LD>
<TE>   The first installment has all the appeal of an amateur night for
garage bands, filled with disagreeable behavior, crude sexual
innuendo and a plentiful lack of humor.</TE>
<TE>   The make-over for the second includes much more than a change of
drummers. Gone is the vulgarity, replaced by a modicum of charm and
visual style. Hudson's bandmates--played by Lauren Hodges, Kevin
Rankin and Emmanuelle Vaugier--are much more appealing.</TE>
<TE>   This "Guide" still suffers for leading us through very familiar
territory, but at least, like SlipDog, it's moving in the right
direction.</TE>

<LD>Director Alfonso Cuaron wiped his brow. "I feel so blessed," he said,
beaming. "I'm so happy." It was very hot where Cuaron was standing:
in the thick of an adoring crowd at the Argyle on Sunset Boulevard on
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Cuaron had good reason to smile.</LD>
<LD>   At the West Coast premiere of his new movie, "Y Tu Mama Tambien"
(And Your Mama Too), at the Regent Showcase Theatre on La Brea Avenue
earlier Tuesday night, there were not enough seats to accommodate the
many guests who showed up (though if you were Gwyneth Paltrow or
Madonna's brother, Christopher Ciccone, seating was not a problem).
The after-party was equally crowded.</LD>
<TE>   "The reception of the movie has been amazing," Cuaron said. "I'm
so pleased by the support, everyone from the exhibitors to the
distributors. The community: Hollywood and also the Hispanic
community."</TE>
<TE>   Marquee Hollywood sent Paltrow, Sydney Pollack and Christina
Ricci, who were hosts of  the celebrations. On the outside terrace,
United Talent Agency suits milled around by the pool. Julie Delpy
breezed by, dressed in white.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, other kinds of talent were on display. On the crowded
dance floor, several couples showed their salsa prowess. Margaritas
and tequila shots were flowing. The party was getting very hot.</TE>
<TE>   Gael Garcia Bernal, who stars as one of the teenagers in the
coming-of-age movie, was getting a lot of attention from female
guests. "It's a universal story," Bernal said of the movie, before
two women snatched him away.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearby corner his co-star, Diego Luna, was sitting on a
couch, flanked by Edward Norton and Salma Hayek.</TE>
<TE>   Luna glowed. "This is a great party," he said, pushing locks away
from his eyes. He had been waiting for this moment, he said. "This is
a movie about life," Luna said. "I'm very proud of what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Everything's Coming</TE>
<TE>   Out Rosie</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think America knows what a gay parent looks like. I am
the gay parent," Rosie O'Donnell tells Diane Sawyer in an interview
airing tonight on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell on coming out:</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason why I've never, like, said that I was gay
until now was because I didn't want that adjective assigned to my
name for all of eternity. You know, gay Rosie O'Donnell. Because it's
never in the top-10 list of how I identify myself ....You know, my
childhood was much harder to get through than anything about my
sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   On Tom Cruise:</TE>
<TE>   "I want him to mow my lawn and get me a lemonade. He makes my
palms sweat. He makes my heart beat, and I adore him, gay, straight,
or somewhere in between, he is the perfect man that ever walked the
face of the Earth.... Some gay rights people, or gay activists have
said, 'Oh, you're trying to make people think that you're straight by
saying that Tom Cruise thing.' As if gay people cannot appreciate the
aesthetic beauty of somebody of the other gender. That is so untrue.
He's absolutely the most handsome, gorgeous, make-me-blotch man I've
ever met in my life. That doesn't mean that that's my sexuality or
that I'm going to end up marrying him or would want to."</TE>
<TE>   During the interview, O'Donnell also extends an invitation to
President Bush for a weekend visit at her house when Sawyer asks her
a question about Bush's past statement about gay adoption:</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer: "President Bush has said ... 'I believe children ought to
be adopted in families with a woman and a man who are married.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell: "Well, he's wrong ....And, you know, if he'd like, he
and his wife are invited to come spend a weekend at my house with my
children. And I'm sure his mind would change."</TE>
<TE>   She's Sticking</TE>
<TE>   by Her Gibes</TE>
<TE>   Touring the country after Sept. 11, comedian Elayne Boosler
noticed a "skittishness, a defensive attitude" when it came to
political jokes. "There's nothing you shouldn't do [in comedy],
especially now," she said by phone from her home in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Boosler lauded Aaron Sorkin, creator of "The West Wing," for his
recent comments that the country is "pretending" that President Bush
is competent and brave. Sorkin told the New Yorker that though the
country was correct in "laying off the bubblehead jokes" about its
president during the war in Afghanistan, the news media had gone too
far.</TE>
<TE>   "That illusion may be what we need right now," he said, "but the
truth is we're simply pretending to believe that Bush exhibited
unspeakable courage at the World Series by throwing out the first
pitch at Yankee Stadium...."</TE>
<TE>   Boosler concurs. "Someone needs to point out the emperor has no
clothes," she said, adding that comedy about politics, not politesse,
is her metier.</TE>
<TE>   So she's persisted with her political jokes, braving occasional
hostile responses. In Tulsa, Okla., recently, she was picketed for
her material on gun control. "If you need 100 rounds to kill a deer,
maybe hunting isn't your sport," is one of her lines on automatic
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But even the picketers, whom she had invited in to see the show,
laughed, she said. "I don't change their minds, but they see the
other side." Comedy and humor, she said, "is a way in."</TE>

<HD>Building a Name for Herself</HD>
<DH>For architect Barbara Bestor, experimentation and success
have gone hand in hand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 10 a.m. on a brisk winter morning, an hour after packing her two
kids off to preschool and the baby-sitter, architect Barbara Bestor
is on an Echo Park job site, multi-tasking with a vengeance. She
inspects a painter's touch-ups. She fields questions from a reporter.
She juggles phone calls with the finesse of a Hollywood producer. One
client wants to discuss her ideas for his Los Angeles sneaker store.
Another wants to fly her to Northern California where she's designing
his weekend retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Pretty heady stuff for someone who's been in town all of one week.
"It's weird," says Bestor, who has returned to L.A. after living in
Rhode Island for eight months. "It's like you go away, and people
want you more."</LD>
<TE>   At 35, Bestor is in the small vanguard of female architects
striving to succeed on their own terms. The old stereotype that put
men in charge of architecture and relegated women to interior design
is dead. Yet the vast majority of Bestor's female peers still labor
in obscurity at male-dominated practices, stake their claims in
academia or forsake the profession altogether. "There are very few
women with their own practices, the reason being that many choose not
to deal with the incredible demands," says architect Robert Mangurian
of Studio Works, who was director of the graduate program when Bestor
attended the Southern California Institute of Architecture. "In grad
school, the ratio of men to women is about 60-40, where women do as
good as men, sometimes better. But out in the field, it's hard.
Architects don't bill like lawyers. And some people opt to have
families." He added that there's enormous discrimination on the part
of clients, who tend to hire older men.</TE>
<TE>   As head of her own architectural firm, Bestor is a rare exception.
Less than 10 years out of school, she already has seen two
single-family houses built, not to mention about 60 home
renovations/additions and commercial projects, including the trendy
clothing stores Union on La Brea Avenue and X-Large in New York City
and Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Now that she's reestablishing her L.A. office, she's eager to
resume work as a California Modernist, following in the tradition of
the 1950s Case Study architects but pushing the envelope in terms of
a building's transparency and the use of mass-produced materials.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to build out of things that aren't pretending to be
something else," she explains. "I like to let the rawness of how
things are built hang out, to show traces of all the different
tradesmen who worked on them. To me, building is a collaborative
process, not just a piece of real estate for sale at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Bestor's clients share her enthusiasm for experimentation, but
most are involved in the arts and can't afford elaborate,
price-is-no-object architecture. "Right now, the aesthetics and
budgets of my projects are pretty much conjoined," she says,
chuckling. "But I don't know that I'd want to clad a whole building
in marble anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Her knack for producing what she calls high design at low cost may
be her strength.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, when you look at Frank Gehry, who works on a large scope on
projects with multimillion-dollar budgets, things are probably going
to turn out great," says architect Dagmar Richter, an associate
professor of architecture and urban design at UCLA. "But Barbara is
capable of taking a limited budget and getting a lot more out of it
for the money."</TE>
<TE>   As Bestor conducts an on-site tour, it's easy to imagine her as
the bookish Cambridge, Mass., girl who decided to become an
architect. She prowls around in a black zip-front jacket, black
cropped pants and black woven Nike slip-ons, but shaggy blond bangs
undermine the tidy ensemble. When her hair falls into her eyes, she
could easily pass for a student at least a decade younger.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 12, I used to baby-sit for a lot of architects, and I
remember their homes and libraries being different," says Bestor, the
first of two daughters born to an anthropologist father and college
administrator mother with a taste for Danish Modern. "It was the
first time I realized you could control your environment and that
your environment could be a form of self-expression."</TE>
<TE>   Following that epiphany, Bestor changed her bedroom to reflect her
preference for Marimekko linens and Joe Colombo stacking storage
units. In high school, she signed up for drafting classes and
interned at Cambridge Seven Associates, a prominent architectural
firm. As a student at Harvard University, she took lots of art and
film classes because the school has no undergraduate architecture
program. She continued to indulge her architectural curiosity
whenever she could, but finding inspiration wasn't easy.  "It was the
'80s, and there were no architects that I liked," she says. "I hated
the postmodernists because of their conservatism. I wasn't interested
in neoclassicism." She soon became a fan of Toyo Ito and other
avant-garde Japanese architects.</TE>
<TE>   During her junior year abroad, Bestor immersed herself in radical
theory at London's prestigious Architectural Association School of
Architecture, where design powerhouses such as Rem Koolhaas and Zaha
Hadid taught and fostered lively debate. She returned to Harvard
inspired but increasingly troubled by the lack of role models.</TE>
<TE>   "All my heroes were men," she says of Alvar Aalto, R.M. Schindler
and early Frank Gehry. "There were no women, except for Zaha Hadid.
The women I knew about were usually teachers who were the girlfriends
of architects. I wanted to make buildings, not just think about
them."</TE>
<TE>   After earning her degree, Bestor moved to the West Coast and
enrolled at Sci-Arc in 1988. As she recalls: "L.A. was becoming known
for people like Gehry, Eric Owen Moss and Thom Mayne at Morphosis
doing interesting work, and Sci-Arc was known for being the radical
hotbed of architecture schools. It's where I wanted to be."</TE>
<TE>   Here, Bestor finally found a role model in Richter, who balanced a
practice with teaching and raising a family. "At the time, I had four
women students who were all quite talented, but Barbara was
detail-oriented, highly educated and very mature and the only one of
the bunch who could combine the intellectual part with the design
ability," says Richter, who served as Bestor's thesis advisor.</TE>
<TE>   At Sci-Arc, Bestor explored domestic and industrial buildings in
an urban context and came to appreciate her field's wide-ranging
potential. "I love architecture because you can live with it. It's
not some installation in a gallery," she says. "Our relationship with
it is so complicated. On the one hand, it's a form of art with
amazing history and experiential qualities. But it's also a part of
our daily life that can influence the people living or working
there."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1992, Bestor opened her office and began
designing small residential, retail and music industry projects. She
married architect Adam Silverman, who helped launch the X-Large
fashion company. They had two children, Beatrice and Charlotte, now 3
years old and 22 months. Last year, the couple moved to Rhode Island,
where Silverman worked as a potter and Bestor taught at Harvard, but
they have since separated.</TE>
<TE>   During the early days of her practice, Bestor teamed with
architect Norman Millar on joint ventures that included a house in
Pacific Palisades and the Actors' Gang theater in Hollywood. "Barbara
didn't have the connections some people do," says Millar, chair of
the department of architecture at Woodbury University in Burbank.
"She's been able to meet people on her own and establish
relationships and earn their trust. She's a good collaborator and a
good leader."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, she produced two houses by herself that have more
in common with the cheap chic of Dwell magazine than the opulent
ostentation of Architectural Digest. Both were built for roughly $110
per square foot, about half the cost of a residential project
designed by a big-name architect. Still, Bestor was able to make them
feel sensuous and smart.</TE>
<TE>   When teacher Chuck Collings and artist Tine Haurum hired Bestor to
design a cliff-top Mount Washington home for them and their son, they
asked for a large, loft-like space that would take advantage of a
view of the L.A. skyline. They also wanted a place for their books
and a guest room that could double as a studio.</TE>
<TE>   Bestor came up with a rectangular box whose sides are covered in
inexpensive painted cement board. The city view at the rear of the
house is visible from the front door through the long central hall.
Windows and glass doors, plus a cantilevered deck, merge inside and
outside. A built-in bookcase of sanded and clear-coated
medium-density fiberboard provides plenty of storage. And to keep the
interiors as open as possible, curtains hung from hospital tracks in
the ceilings act as closet doors and room dividers. "It's the best
use of space. It's only 1,400 square feet but feels like so much
more," Collings says. "And we love the integrity of the materials. So
many people cover them up. We like that she didn't veneer
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Bestor's clients in Echo Park, another artist and her filmmaker
husband and daughter, needed their hillside house to provide living
space as well as a studio and office. Bestor again employed modest
materials--cement board left unpainted this time, plywood paneling
and exposed concrete--but she took the concept of a see-through house
a step further.</TE>
<TE>   For the three-story, 1,650-square-foot building, a two-car garage
can also function as living room, studio or gallery, depending on how
rolling walls connect it with or close it off from other rooms.
Upstairs in the sleeping quarters, more rolling walls create communal
space or privacy as needed. And inexpensive storefront windows and
doors not only frame garden scenes but also reveal construction
elements such as wood studs, batt insulation and floor joists that
are typically hidden from view.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Bestor puts the finishing touches on this house, which
she has sublet for her family to live in while her clients are out of
the country, she hopes to renovate and move into a house she's buying
nearby. The building stands half-demolished, but the prospect of
turning it into her dream home/personal design laboratory clearly
excites her: "It'll be really great because I can punch holes in the
walls with impunity and try out all sorts of unusual stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," she says, tongue not entirely in cheek, "it'll be a
simple shell with a skin of something strange, like one-way mirrored
glass."</TE>

<LD>CLAIRE MARVEL</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By John Burnham Schwartz</LD>
<TE>   Nan A. Talese/Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   304 pages; $25</TE>
<TE>   John Burnham Schwartz has made a habit of discussing the pitfalls
and pinnacles of love in his writing.  In his first novel, "Bicycle
Days," Schwartz tells the tale of a young American man  coming of age
in Japan. In "Reservation Road," the story is of a  family whose son
dies in a hit-and-run, detailing how the accident twists the
characters' life trajectories.</TE>
<TE>   With his new novel, "Claire Marvel," he continues his exploration
of love with a story of life's choices and the way things don't turn
out quite the way one would expect.</TE>
<TE>   The novel begins as most romances do--the fateful meeting.  In
front of a closed art museum  during a rainstorm, Julian Rose is
getting wet. Fellow Harvard grad student Claire Marvel has an
umbrella. They share. He's dumbstruck. She's charming. The romance
begins. There is ecstasy with the first kiss. The first mesmerizing
talks and looks. The first time they make love.</TE>
<TE>   But all is not OK. Claire's father is dying, and she leaves to
take care of him. Julian doesn't hear from her for quite a while, so
he buries himself in a dissertation on politics while assisting on a
book written by his professor. He tries without success to shake
Claire.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the hitch. She returns, and they suddenly go off
together to the French countryside, staying at a house where Claire's
father had lodged. They can't seem to say "I love you" to each other.
They come back to the States, and their relationship goes haywire,
developing into a love triangle among Julian, Claire and his
professor.</TE>
<TE>   They go their separate ways, Claire married to the professor,
Julian teaching at the school he used to attend and marrying someone
else. But even years later, Julian can't shake the love he has for
Claire, and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   In "Reservation Road," Schwartz deftly used different points of
view to lay out his tale, and one was left caring even for the man
whose actions tore a family apart. The characters here are not nearly
so well drawn. This novel has its moments of clear human observation,
reflective thought and wisdom, but these are lost under the dull thud
of cliche and predictability. From the first meeting to the woozy
feelings of joy to the wrench thrown in the works to the conclusion,
it feels all too familiar.</TE>
<TE>   The characters love each other, they want each other, they need
each other, yet they always skirt this way or that without facing the
issues,  hiding behind their trump cards--mysteriousness, missed
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   If Julian really wanted to be with Claire, he would have tried
harder. If Claire really loved Julian, she wouldn't have gone on with
the professor. But they don't do anything about it. They just live
their lives wondering, which renders them wishy-washy, however
thoughtful and emotionally honest Schwartz tries to make them.</TE>

<HD>Harlem Rallies 'Round Ex-President, Even if He's Often MIA</HD>
<DH>Politics* In the neighborhood where Clinton set up his
offices, he's treated like 'a rock star,' although actual sightings
are rare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALINA TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Like birders tracking a rare and exotic species, Bill Clinton
watchers in Harlem rarely see their quarry--but they talk about him
an awful lot.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard he was in there watching the Super Bowl," says Muhammad
Spencer, an outdoor incense vendor. "I saw a lot of trips from the
pizza place."</LD>
<LD>   Spencer, who has a prime observation post from his table across
from the 14-story building that houses Clinton's office, is not
bothered that he hasn't actually seen Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems like everybody appreciates him being in the
neighborhood," he says. "There's a reason he came down, a purpose.
You know, they say he's our first black president."</TE>
<TE>   Last July, when Clinton decided to move into his top floor 125th
Street offices, he was not only looking for a place to spend his days
as the second-youngest former U.S. president but also searching for a
refuge from the river of criticism that flowed after him when he
moved from Washington to New York.</TE>
<TE>   His questionable pardons in the last days of the presidency were
headline news. His choice of an office in a lavish midtown skyscraper
was being viewed as scandalous, with its rent of more than $700,000 a
year. The man was not at the height of his popularity.</TE>
<TE>   So Clinton abandoned his midtown plans and moved 68 blocks and a
world away, signing a 10-year lease for a $261,450-a-year office
space (not including utilities, improvements or Secret Service space)
in a building that also houses a Social Security office, a public
housing authority and an adoption agency. Instead of five-star
cuisine and sleek luxury goods, the surrounding businesses advertise
hair braiding and soul food.</TE>
<TE>   The move was greeted with a mixture of cynicism about his motives,
joy at the positive message it sent about Harlem (safe enough for an
ex-president!), and concern about the impact his presence might have
on the neighborhood (there goes low rent!). Local politicians
welcomed him with open arms, while some activists held a protest
before he even moved in.</TE>
<TE>   "There is great symbolism involved in the president choosing an
office in the heart of black America," says DeWayne Wickham, author
of the newly published book "Bill Clinton and Black America." "It was
a second choice ... but he also wanted to find a safe harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's been in Harlem more than seven months, and his
name--with the exception of the past few days--has rarely made
headlines. Lost among the tragedies and turmoil of the past year,
Clinton's transgressions and activities seem of little import.</TE>
<TE>   But the former president is always news in Harlem, where he "is
loved in this neighborhood," says Michael Eberstadt, a Harlem
restaurant owner. "He is a rock star."</TE>
<TE>   Observers received a small taste of that adulation when Clinton
emerged one recent evening from the Studio Museum in Harlem. Local
folks gathered around clamoring for autographs and photos.</TE>
<TE>   Very much at ease and with scant security, the former president
signed every scrap of paper handed to him. "He looked gorgeous," one
woman gushed as Clinton waved one last goodbye and climbed into his
limo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievably cool that he's here," Eberstadt says. "This is
where he chose to set up shop. That makes a statement that if he can
be here as a former president of the United States, then
theoretically, anyone else can set up here."</TE>
<TE>   Well, "here" is a somewhat loose term. Clinton's office
workers--10 staff and 15 interns and volunteers--do work out of the
Harlem office. But the ex-prez himself? An eager Clinton watcher
might wait many a day to see that famous gray plumage.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Payne, Clinton's spokeswoman, says his schedule is so fluid
that it's impossible to say how often he's in town. She did offer one
example--in February he traveled to Australia for two weeks, then was
in the office for a week, then off traveling again.</TE>
<TE>   Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency, which serves as
Clinton's lecture agent, has more specific numbers: In 2001 Clinton
gave 75 speeches--at $125,000-plus per speech--on every continent
except Antarctica. And this year, says Walker, is shaping up to be
"busier than ever."</TE>
<TE>   The office--no photos, please--is decorated with paintings from
the Studio Museum and offers sweeping views of Manhattan. Most of
Clinton's staff followed him there from Washington, but the interns
and volunteers are recruited from local colleges and universities.
His spokespeople maintain that they don't know if any of the interns
are Harlem natives. And Clinton's people, ever wary of loose lips,
declare that interns and volunteers aren't available to talk to the
press.</TE>
<TE>   But even if one can't catch a glimpse of the man himself,
photographs of the smiling president are as common as, well, pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   In restaurants like the famous "Sylvia's, Queen of Soul Food," a
photo of Clinton with Sylvia hangs in a place of prominence. As does
one of Bill cut out of the New York Daily News in Dee's Cards N
Wedding Service. Clinton declined to be interviewed, but his staff
insists that Bill Clinton in Harlem is much more than a symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he has a heavy lecture schedule and is involved in such
diverse projects as working with foundations that are helping to
rebuild earthquake-devastated communities in India, developing
service programs in South Africa and writing his own memoirs. But
Harlem is very much front and center, says Clyde E. Williams Jr.,
Clinton's domestic policy advisor, who moved from Washington to New
York with Clinton and works and lives in Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   Because one of the goals of his William J. Clinton Foundation is
"economic empowerment of poor people," he's held several meetings
with local community leaders to learn about the greatest needs in the
area. The result is a focus on after-school programs and those that
teach economic literacy (basic skills such as opening bank accounts)
to children in schools. The foundation also plans to team with an
as-yet-unnamed downtown company to provide technical assistance to
local small businesses, and it hopes to help bring employment
opportunities to Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   There's no money available yet--but Williams says the foundation
is developing partnerships to raise funds for the programs.</TE>
<TE>   When Clinton announced his uptown move, proponents optimistically
predicted that much-needed business would follow while opponents
foresaw a gentrification that would drive out the current residents.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, most agree, neither has come true.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably impossible to evaluate the Clinton effect," says
restaurant owner Eberstadt. "There was a lot of stuff in the pipeline
before he moved here." And some was set in motion by the former
president.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Clinton declared part of Harlem a federal empowerment
zone, which meant the area received millions of dollars in state and
federal aid for economic development.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past several years, Starbucks moved onto 125th Street.
Harlem USA, a 275,000-square-foot complex containing shops and Magic
Johnson theaters, opened nearby. It was a first step toward
revitalizing a neighborhood that still has blocks of abandoned
housing and boarded-up stores covered with graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   "Him coming here validates the renaissance that has already been
going on here," says R. Kenyatta Punter, who owns an area real estate
firm. "But by coming here, he shows other business leaders, who might
have been on the fence, that maybe they should move here."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Al Sharpton, leader of the Harlem-based National Action
Network, says it's too early to label Clinton's residency a success
or failure.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not seen rent skyrocketing, nor have I seen the major
influx some of his supporters said would happen," Sharpton says. "The
expectations, both negative and positive, were high and I think
they're leveling off now."</TE>
<TE>   Notes author Wickham: "Bill Clinton is a day tenant. What's really
changed is the [return] of the black middle class."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, many local residents are not looking for
concrete action from their most prominent day tenant, but simply
enjoy knowing he's in the neighborhood. Occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   He has "uplifted us with his presence," say Guy Willington, a
Harlem native who is selling watches, games and cards on the
sidewalk. Willington says he hopes Clinton and the changes he might
bring will be enough to get him a job "so I can get off the street."</TE>
<TE>   "Right now it's enough that he's here," he says. "Sooner or later,
we're going to say, 'What has he done for the community?'"</TE>

<HD>From the Grounds Up, an Idea Grows</HD>
<DH>Cafe owner creates a way to turn coffee waste into a new
type of plant fertilizer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last summer, Mike Theuer and his wife, Linda Brown, sold their coffee
shop in Bellefonte, Pa. It's not that the Cool Beans Coffee and Tea
shop flopped. This town of 7,000 is home to the county courthouse,
and there were any number of caffeine-seeking lawyers around.</LD>
<LD>   But the more customers Cool Beans attracted, the more the coffee
grounds piled up, and the more Theuer worried about how to dispose of
them. He began to see the coffee he served his customers less as a
drink and more as a fertilizer in waiting.</LD>
<LD>   The vision emerged gradually. Theuer's no gardener. He's not sure
how he grew a patch of ornamental gourds one year. Maybe it was from
the gourd he threw out in his backyard the year before. But what he
didn't know about coffee and plants, the former child counselor with
a master's degree in psychology would soon find out.</LD>
<TE>   He learned that coffee grounds have long gone into compost, where
the acid grains are neutralized to a benign and nutritious state by
busy microbes. But he had only heard of applying straight coffee
grounds to acid-loving plants, such as azaleas, and then only in
modest amounts.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend said, 'Why don't you use the grounds for growing
earthworms? Coffee grounds, earthworms, they go together, man.'"
Theuer considered it. He wasn't sure that he was ready for expansion
from caterer to wormery foreman.</TE>
<TE>   After a little more research, he decided to make a garden product
that didn't wriggle. He dried the grounds, mixed them with limestone
to cut the acidity, then added potash and bone meal to balance the
feed. Presto, fertilizer. He put 1.8 pounds in coffee bags and sold
them at his cafe for $4.99. "I just called it Gourmet Coffee Plant
Food at first," he says. "Then I thought of the name Grow Joe." He
liked it so well, he says, "I went and had labels made instead of
hand drawing it on the bag."</TE>
<TE>   Customers took to it. So did the press. The local paper, the
Centre Daily Times, reported it, followed by the Pittsburgh Tribune
Review. A mention in Horticulture magazine caught the attention of a
vice president in the instant-coffee division at Folgers coffee.
Theuer was sitting at his kitchen table when the executive called.
Did Theuer need grounds? he asked, because Folgers had plenty.</TE>
<TE>   Instant coffee, Theuer learned, is made in what he likens to a
"million-gallon Mr. Coffee maker." Coffee is brewed and freeze-dried,
and the grounds are carted off to landfill by the truckload. Folgers
faced huge coffee disposal bills. A person willing to remove it for
them would be welcomed as a beneficial scavenger.</TE>
<TE>   But Folgers' New Orleans freeze-drying plant produced more coffee
grounds than could be accommodated in little sacks on the home-made
shelves of Cool Beans. In a quick series of developments, Theuer
raised $48,000 from local investors. Don Bierly--a retired dairy
farmer and a Cool Beans customer--offered the use of his barn for a
plant. Grow Joe became Grow Joe Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Theuer and Bierly customized old grain equipment to dry and store
20 tons of grounds from Folgers. Marketing-wise, Theuer was riding
high. He sent 775 samples to members of the National Gardening Club,
based in Minnetonka, Minn. They tested the product.</TE>
<TE>   "His product did really well," says Bonnie Lofthus, the club's
product test coordinator. "I remember, though, that people didn't
like his packaging." But Theuer stuck with the old Cool Beans coffee
bags.</TE>
<TE>   Grow Joe did well in a Penn State University experimental trial
against a commercial fertilizer used on cauliflower, string beans and
beets. But for all the local enthusiasm, Theuer suddenly found he was
overwhelmed. He was about to turn 40. He and his wife had two young
sons. He was running a coffee shop, caring for the children while
Brown taught seventh-grade social studies, and making coffee
fertilizer in a friend's barn by night. He and Brown decided to sell
Cool Beans.</TE>
<TE>   There remained the 20 tons of grounds in the dairy farmer's barn.
Theuer had barely made a dent in it. He decided to diversify the Grow
Joe line. He invented liquid Grow Joe, along with stakes for trees
and training sticks for potted plants made of Grow Joe and, the
newest invention, Grow Joe seedling pots.</TE>
<TE>   These would be like peat pots, starter containers that would
dissolve into the earth on planting. But his version would deliver a
shot of Grow Joe to maturing plants.</TE>
<TE>   By last Thanksgiving, Theuer and Bierly had managed to rig a
contraption capable of making from four to six 4-inch pots per hour.
Theuer sent a sample to the garden chain Smith &amp; Hawken. He was not
prepared for the response. The chain immediately ordered 6,000 Grow
Joe pots.</TE>
<TE>   Without calculating production time, Theuer promised delivery by
January. "I was frantic," he says. He called in Jay Schenck, a
plastics technology extension specialist from Penn State, who recalls
finding Theuer in the barn cooking up liquid Grow Joe on an electric
stove and then feeding the stuff into the home-rigged press.</TE>
<TE>   Quirky, yes, but Schenck was impressed with this seat-of-the-pants
inventor. "He had basically put together a reasonable process," says
Schenck, "until he took on that enormous order for 6,000 pots. He
said, 'I can do one pot every 13 minutes.' I said, 'Six thousand of
these multiplied by 13 minutes--with your deadline, you ain't going
to make it.'"</TE>
<TE>   The search was on for a proper, and fast, plastics press. Plant
after plant rejected Theuer. "They said no way could I put my glucky
plastic-coffee-bone meal mix in their machines," he says. Finally a
plastics company in Akley, Pa., accepted the job. The engineer-owner,
Rick Caufman, liked the challenge. "It's quite a diversion from MRI
machine components and airplane phones," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He and Theuer can make about 60 Grow Joe pots per hour. The first
thousand or so pots of the "January" shipment of 6,000 went out to
Smith &amp; Hawken the last week in February.</TE>
<TE>   Theuer sugared the delays by giving the chain a discount and
charming the staff. "Even trying to explain the delays, he made me
laugh," says Tres Fontaine, Smith &amp; Hawken's merchandise manager for
tools and clothing. She took it in good humor. "He's an entrepreneur.
It's all part of launching a new product," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The pots, she says, are only just arriving in California stores. A
stack of six will cost $15.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Theuer has made a 12-ton dent in the 20 tons of Folgers
grounds. When and if it comes to needing a refill, as grateful as he
is to Folgers, Theuer says that next round, he'll probably switch
suppliers. "Now I could go to Taster's Choice," he says. "They're
closer. Their plant's in Freehold, N.J."</TE>

<LD>Program music is instrumental music that goes with a story, scene,
poem or idea. It tells a story. Many composers, such as Beethoven,
Berlioz and Tchaikovsky, used instruments to represent many different
things--from cuckoo birds, flowing rivers and howling wind to battle
scenes, thunder and scary witches. Composers also use music to
represent characters (such as Cinderella) and emotions (such as the
romantic love between Romeo and Juliet).</LD>
<LD>   Instruments produce a variety of sounds--high and low, soft and
loud. Each instrument has a unique sound quality. Some instruments
can sound sweet, light, or sprightly; others might sound melancholy,
nasally or cranky. Others can sound deep, booming, or powerful.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei Prokofiev, a famous Russian composer, wrote a piece of
program music especially for children titled "Peter and the Wolf." In
the music, the character of Peter is represented by lilting strings,
and his grandfather is represented by the bellowing bassoon. Other
characters include a bird played by the delicate flute; a duck,
represented by the honking oboe; the wolf, portrayed by the powerful
French horn; a cat, played by the sneaky clarinet; and the hunters,
represented by the booming timpani, a kind of drum. Why do you think
Prokofiev chose these particular instruments?</LD>
<TE>   If you were to compose music to tell your story, what instrument
would best represent you? Why? What instruments would you choose to
represent your best friend? Your teacher? Your favorite pet? Why?</TE>
<TE>   You can see and hear these instruments portraying the characters
from Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf" March 24, at the Alex Theatre
in Glendale. Preconcert activities begin at 1 p.m. For tickets and
more information, call the L.A. Chamber Orchestra at (213) 622-7001,

<LD>Ever wonder why every other car you see is silver? Or why we had
avocado green refrigerators in the 1960s and mauve hotel rooms in the
'80s? Part of the blame--or credit--can be given to the 1,700-member
international Color Marketing Group, a nonprofit, Virginia-based
association that has dictated color trends since 1962.</LD>
<LD>   "Our global membership studies demographics, lifestyles, age
groups, economics and politics to determine which colors will be
prominent in years to come," explains member Laraine Turner of Long
Beach-based Jolley-Turner Group Inc., a design and color-consulting
firm.</LD>
<LD>   At the Color Marketing Group's meeting last April, they decided on
the color trends for 2003. So what can we expect?</LD>
<TE>   Blue will be the dominant color in 2003, but not just one hue.
Among the choices will be "cinder blue" (gray-blue), "blue aire"
(retro '60s turquoise blue), "deep arctic" (conservative navy) and
"ocean cruise" (watery pastel blue). "Blues become important when
people spend more time at home because blue is calming," Turner says.
She predicts blue also will be pushed into other colors like green,
gray and red because of their soothing effect and our fascination
with air, light, space and water. A dusty-rose form of mauve will
return, as will violet, both on the blue side.</TE>
<TE>   Nature colors like tropical greens and copper-based browns will
also be popular. "Colors will be more subtle and complex in nature,"
she says. Color Marketing's "silger," a gold-silver special effect,
is a strong forecast for fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that one color drove everything," explains Turner,
citing the 1950s love of pink as an example. "That doesn't happen
anymore because the global culture has changed things. Now there are
groups of colors.</TE>
<TE>   "At our October meeting, we talked about the impact of 9/11," says
Turner, "and we felt that we'd continue to see a lot of red, white
and blue. That was happening even before 9/11, because of the
popularity of books like the John Adams biography."</TE>
<TE>   Turner thinks there will be fewer color choices because of
economic cutbacks. "Where maybe a manufacturer would offer eight
colors--four safe and four either trendy or extremely trendy--now
there will probably only be four or five," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the home, berry tones like raspberry, pink-reds and currant
(brown-violet) will be used. Accent colors include peach, orange and
lemon-golds. "It used to be that carpet colors ran the market because
the carpeting was the most expensive item, so it was done first and
everything was built around it," Turner says. "Today's designers are
using hard surfaced floors like tile and wood, so upholstery fabrics
now come first. This makes it easier to change colors, since you can
remove slipcovers, rotate pillows, add throw rugs without that much
expense.</TE>
<TE>   "For cars, the colors will be very conservative. It's almost a
back to the '70s time," Turner says. "Basically there will be red,
blue, gray, white, black. Some cars will feature pearlescent and
silver-tinted whites, as well as metallic golds."</TE>
<TE>   In public spaces like hotels and stores, colors will be muted.
Expect to see buttery yellows, soft limes, gold neutrals,
gold-greens. "The colors will not be edgy," Turner says. "Instead
they will be softer and more complex."</TE>
<TE>   The one area where bright colors will shine is in industry. Color
Marketing sees high-energy colors for high-tech companies. Turner
says that retro colors will still be popular in this area, so
sweetheart red, Victorian rose and bright turquoise with orange or
peach will be on items such as dishes and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   "A bright red mixer was the hit of the recent appliance expo in
Chicago," Turner says.</TE>
<TE>   "Color isn't just color," she adds. "Technology has allowed for a
lot of changes, so color is texture, finish, translucence,
pearlescence, metallic. There are also interference pigments where
the angle from which you view the object changes the color."</TE>
<TE>   What's next for Color Marketing? High-tech, pearlized crystal
balls?</TE>

<LD>Between writing and receiving letters, some students volunteered to
do research and give reports about St. Patrick's Day.</LD>
<LD>   David marched to the front of the room. "I'm going to tell you why
the Irish celebrate St. Patrick's Day. St. Patrick was born in
England about 1,600 years ago. When he was 16, he was kidnapped by
pirates and sold as a slave in Ireland. He herded sheep until he was
22, and then he figured out a way to escape and went home. After that
he went to France and studied to be a priest and a bishop. He went
back to Ireland as a missionary and founded churches and schools. A
legend says he drove all the snakes out of Ireland."</LD>
<LD>   Hillary reported: "Let me tell you about the shamrock. It's the
national flower and emblem of Ireland. You can use it in food like
watercress. It illustrates the Trinity from the Bible. Long ago some
guys called Druids lived in Ireland, and the shamrock was their
symbol of magic."</LD>
<TE>   Alex informed the class: "If we lived in Ireland we'd go to church
on St. Patrick's Day because it's a religious holiday. We'd watch
parades and listen to speeches. There would be a lot of music and
dancing. Maybe we'd eat pickled salmon and oaten bread the way the
wealthy people used to do. If we were old enough, we'd probably drink
ale."</TE>
<TE>   Some more answers to their letters arrived. Pinching on the toes,
not the arm, was something new learned from Colorado Springs, Colo.
Although most kids in Dover, N.H., do not pinch, the writer said she
usually does.</TE>
<TE>   A class in Austin, Minn., said they have many customs. If you're
Irish, you wear green and don't get pinched. If you're not Irish, you
wear orange and don't get pinched.</TE>

<TE>   Friday: Will the class ever hear from Ireland?</TE>

<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. She still has the booklet her
students compiled after doing a similar survey. This story will be on

<LD>Customers who bought and sold goods at auctions held overseas by
Christie's International and Sotheby's Holdings Inc. can pursue
commission price-fixing claims in the United States, an appeals court
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers said the decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals
was an important development in American antitrust law and how it can
be used to recover damages for activities that take place in foreign
countries.</LD>
<LD>   In its decision, the three-member panel reversed a trial judge's
decision dismissing class-action litigation brought on behalf of
those who claimed they paid inflated commissions when they bought or
sold goods in auctions held overseas.</LD>
<TE>   The trial judge had found that U.S. antitrust laws do not apply to
activities abroad unless it can be shown that the conduct intended to
have or had significant effects within the United States.</TE>
<TE>   However, the appeals panel found that U.S. antitrust laws do apply
to the alleged price-fixing scheme because it affected domestic
commerce. It vacated the trial judge's ruling and remanded the case
to the district court for further proceedings.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grocery chain Albertson's Inc. posted a 32% rise in fiscal
fourth-quarter profit, saying cost cutting helped offset weaker sales
and competition led by discounting giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The company is leaving the Houston, San Antonio, Nashville and
Memphis, Tenn., markets as part of a cost-cutting program.
Albertson's stock rose 29 cents to $31.69 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The Boise, Idaho-based retailer said net income for the quarter
ended Jan. 31 rose to $290 million, or 71 cents a diluted share, from
$220 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings
were unchanged at $246 million, or 60 cents a share. Analysts polled
by Thomson Financial/First Call expected earnings of 56 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Overall sales rose 1.2% to $9.7billion, while sales at
supermarkets open at least two years fell 0.5%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>RCA Records President Jack Rovner was ousted in a surprise management
shake-up at Bertelsmann Music Group.</LD>
<LD>   The move is part of a restructuring in which the German record
corporation will dissolve its North American sector, removing a
corporate layer between its American labels and its global operation.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Jamieson, who ran the North American division, will take over
as chairman of the newly formed RCA Music Group, overseeing such
labels as RCA Records, RCA Nashville, Heritage, RCA Victor and RCA
Canada. Sources say Jamieson wanted a more hands-on creative role at
the company and will oversee the start-up of new imprint labels at
BMG.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new structure, distribution and other back-office
divisions will report to Michael Smellie, BMG's new chief operating
officer. Rovner, who had more than three years left on his contract,
was informed of his ousting late Tuesday in New York.</TE>

<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. must improve management at Newport News
Shipbuilding so aircraft carriers under construction or overhaul stay
on schedule and within cost, said the Navy's assistant secretary for
acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman in December assumed management
of Newport News, the country's sole builder of nuclear aircraft
carriers and a co-producer of nuclear submarines. John R. Young, the
Navy's top civilian acquisition official, said Northrop has not shown
promised results at Newport News.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop disagreed with Young's assessment, saying it is "making
excellent progress and is actually ahead of our schedule in
integrating Newport News."</LD>

filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing to raise the capital to
build those costly networks. The company operates only in Sacramento,

<LD>* Worldwide shipments of personal computers will rise 3% in 2002
because of strong demand from U.S. consumers, market researcher IDC
said in a revised forecast. IDC increased its estimate from a 1.8%
rise forecast in December. Shipments will jump 11% in 2003, IDC
analyst Roger Kay said.</LD>
<LD>   * In a major advance for Microsoft Corp.'s expansion into
wireless, German phone giant Deutsche Telekom will use the company's
Microsoft software in cell phones and mobile data services. Deutsche
Telekom said it would use Microsoft.NET software to offer business
customers wireless access to databases, e-mail and other corporate
information.</LD>
<LD>   * Motorola Inc., the second-largest mobile phone maker, said sales
of handsets may top its forecast of 420 million units this year.
Mobile phone sales fell for the first time last year, to about 400
million handsets, forcing companies to slash jobs.</LD>
<TE>   * Computer Associates International Inc., faced with two
government probes and a recent credit rating cut, plans to sell $500
million of notes convertible into company stock to help pay off debt.
Computer Associates announced the sale of the stock-bond hybrids
after having decided Feb. 7 to cancel a $1-billion bond sale when
Moody's Investors Service threatened to cut its credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   * Yahoo Inc. said it's opening an office in the L.A. area to sell
more advertising to film studios and television networks. The Santa
Monica office opening Monday will employ about 150 people, who will

<LD>A Global Crossing Ltd. bankruptcy hearing was postponed until March
19 as creditors and lenders haggle over the procedures for accepting
and reviewing buyout bids for the ailing telecommunications company.
The rules were slated for discussion at a Bankruptcy Court hearing.
In addition, attorneys for the creditors, shareholders and banks said
they still have questions about the bid from two Asian firms that
offered to buy 80% of Global Crossing for $750 million.</LD>

<HD>Petition for Cost-Based Power Rates Rejected</HD>
<DH>Energy: Federal regulators say request by Consumers Union
already has been addressed by price limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ SKINNER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Energy regulators rejected a request by the publisher of Consumer
Reports magazine that they revoke the rights of power suppliers in
the western U.S. to charge market rates and require sales based on
costs.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the petition by the
Consumers Union of the United States, which claimed western power
prices during the first half of 2001 were "far above what is
reasonable" to encourage the building of new power plants, was moot.</LD>
<LD>   "The issues have already been addressed" by other orders such as
the price limits issued for California in April and 10 other western
states in June, the commission said.</LD>
<TE>   A power shortage in California sent prices soaring among all
states on the western power grid during the first six months of last
year. Some buyers in the Northwest sought $2 billion in refunds,
saying the prices paid weren't reasonable, as defined by the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   FERC also said Wednesday that regional transmission groups should
operate voluntary markets for last-minute electricity sales and allow
customers to sell back power they decide not to use.</TE>
<TE>   The commission laid out some of the jobs that the transmission
groups should be required to perform as the beginnings of a standard
design for wholesale power markets. The commission said it will
complete work on specific market rules by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The commission wants the nation's power lines run by a small
number of independent groups instead of utilities, saying bigger
networks will reduce costs, increase investment and expand
competition in the $226-billion U.S. power market.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said the standards will help ensure that power flows
efficiently from region to region.</TE>
<TE>   An outline of issues to be included in  new rules will be released
by Friday, the commission said.</TE>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., the fourth-biggest U.S.
local-phone company, blocked employees from selling company stock in
their 401(k) plans during a four-week period when the shares fell
5.6%. The blackout affected 8,000 of Qwest's 63,000 employees from
Dec. 21 to Jan. 22, a spokesman said. Qwest notified employees of the
restriction, caused by a switch in plan administrators, in June.
During the lockdown, Qwest slashed 7,000 jobs and had its credit
rating put on review for a possible downgrade. Quest shares fell 25
cents to $8.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<HD>Clubs Dropped Telecoms for Blue Chips in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America's investment clubs hung up on several telecom stocks last
year while raising their holdings of some old-fashioned blue-chip
names, a new survey shows.</LD>
<LD>   More clubs said they owned blue chips General Electric Co. and
Pfizer Inc. as of Dec. 31, sharply boosting their rank on the top-10
list of club-held stocks. Meanwhile, telecom firms Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Avaya Inc. fell out of the top 10, according to
the April issue of Better Investing, a publication of the National
Assn. of Investors Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Each year the NAIC, a Madison Heights, Mich.-based group that is
an umbrella organization for clubs, highlights the 100 most popular
stocks among its members. About 32,300 clubs belong to the NAIC.</LD>
<TE>   In an investment club, individuals such as co-workers or friends
pool their money and research efforts to build stock portfolios,
meeting regularly to vote on what to buy, sell or hold.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, whose value plunged 53% last year during the telecom
sector's collapse, tumbled from the third-favorite club stock at the
end of 2000 to No. 14 last year, and Avaya, whose shares were spun
off from Lucent in October 2000, slid to No. 19 from No. 8 a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent stock was owned by 4,813 clubs at year-end, compared with
13,460 at the end of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent's former parent, AT&amp;T Corp., fell to No. 35 among clubs
from No. 17 in 2000, even though the shares gained 35% last year
after diving 66% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As telecom stocks fell out of favor with club members, more clubs
bought conglomerate GE: Nearly 13,400 clubs owned the stock as of
Dec. 31, up from 9,774 a year earlier. Drug firm Pfizer also became a
big favorite. It was owned by 13,424 clubs at year-end, up from
10,581 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Also moving up the list was retail king Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
whose stock rallied 8% in 2001. It ranked as the No. 8 stock with
clubs, up from No. 12 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Among other "old economy" names gaining popularity, Johnson &amp;
Johnson climbed to No. 12 from No. 19 in 2000, Citigroup Inc. surged
to No. 20 from No. 38, and fast-food giant Tricon Global Restaurants
Inc. advanced to No. 23 from No. 33.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, many clubs appear to have kept faith in major technology
stocks, said Kenneth Janke, chairman of the NAIC. Intel Corp., Cisco
Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp. stayed in the top 10 even as the
number of clubs owning the stocks declined.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis is still on tech," Janke said. "Our members tend to
be long-term investors who are slow to sell stocks."</TE>

<HD>Small Gain in Retail Sales in February</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in February, signaling that
the economy probably is moving forward but not at a runaway pace.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales edged up a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month to
$296.41 billion, the Commerce Department said, reversing a matching
0.3% drop in January. Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a
0.9% gain for February.</LD>
<LD>   "We are on line for modest consumer spending in positive territory
in the first quarter, but not the 6% we saw in the fourth quarter,"
said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in
Toronto. "Consumers are not on holiday, but we are not seeing a
continuation of that very strong surge from the fourth quarter."</LD>
<TE>   Sales excluding automobiles rose 0.2% in February after a 1.2%
surge in the prior month. Sales of vehicles and parts rose 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic
group that dates recessions, signaled it may be moving closer to
formally declaring that a recovery is underway in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The NBER, in a memo on its Web site, cited signs that the decline
in economic activity that began last year "may be coming to an end."</TE>
<TE>   The NBER ruled in November that a recession began in the economy
last March. Its decisions on the dates of business cycles usually
occur with a time lag of several months.</TE>
<TE>   Many private economists, joined by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, believe that the recession is over. Greenspan said
Wednesday that he saw signs the economy was "beginning to firm." But
he forecast only a gradual recovery in business investment, which has
been hit much harder during the recent downturn than consumer
spending.</TE>
<TE>   One of the strongest categories in the retail sales report was
sales at furniture and home-furnishing stores, which climbed 1.5% in
February after a 0.3% rise in January. The gain was consistent with a
trend of robust home sales as new home buyers typically spend heavily
on furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at electronics and appliance stores were up 1.1%, bouncing
back from a 3.2% drop in the prior month.</TE>
<TE>   The slight 0.4% rise in vehicles and parts sales in February came
after a plunge of 4.6% the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp January decline came on the heels of a huge car-buying
spree in late 2001 which had been fueled by zero-percent financing
incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing sales slowed from the heady pace they saw in January.
Purchases at clothing stores eased 0.1% in February after a 1.4% rise
in January.</TE>
<TE>   Three retailers reported earnings Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Stores Inc.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 10% as the
retailer of low-price clothing and accessories sold more merchandise
to customers looking for bargains in the recession. Net income rose
to $50 million, or 62 cents a share, as sales rose 8.9% to $848.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   Ross was among U.S. retailers that benefited as the recession and
job cuts drove consumers to shop for holiday and winter goods at
stores with lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Michael Balmuth added more brand names, a better
balance of women's career and casual clothes and a wider variety of
home goods, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Talbots Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit fell 1.5% as the women's and
children's clothing retailer sold less merchandise at full price. Net
income dropped to $32.5 million, or 53 cents a share; sales declined
8.4% to $433.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Foot Locker Inc., the biggest U.S. athletic-shoe and clothing
retailer, reported fourth-quarter profit of $36 million, or 24 cents
a share, compared with a loss of $288 million, or $2.06, a year
earlier. Sales fell 8% to $1.16 billion.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Drop on Profit Concerns</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Lowered earnings estimate for Intel sends chip
makers, Nasdaq tumbling. Dow, S&amp;P 500 also end lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks tumbled Wednesday amid news of slack retail sales and worries
about sagging profits at key technology firms.</LD>
<LD>   Tech stocks got off to a bad start after investment bank J.P.
Morgan trimmed its earnings estimates on semiconductor giant Intel.
That sent Intel shares down 5% and slammed computer chip shares amid
concerns that better earnings could be further off than hoped.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, shares of General Electric fell $1.10 to $40 after its
finance arm sold $11 billion of bonds--the second-largest U.S.
corporate debt sale ever. GE Capital, which provides half of GE's
revenue, almost doubled its planned sale of $6 billion in bonds to
take advantage of interest costs at "historic lows" and strong demand
for top-rated bonds, said a GE spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average surrendered 130.5 points, or
1.2%, to 10,501.85 after hitting its highest close since June on
Tuesday and climbing about 9% in the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.09 points, or 1.9%,
to 1,862.03, while the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 11.49
points, or 1%, to 1,154.09.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the market's glum mood were remarks by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said U.S. economic activity is firming,
but he sees only a gradual recovery in business investment.</TE>
<TE>   The remarks, though not drastically different from views he
expressed in recent weeks, were seen as less optimistic than some on
Wall Street had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "The chairman is saying things are good but not great," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales edged up 0.3% in February, falling short of forecasts
of a 0.9% gain. The news provided more evidence that the economy is
emerging from the recession that began last March, but signaled the
possibility of only a moderate level of consumer demand, raising
questions about the strength of the expected rebound in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The retail data helped push bond yields lower: The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 5.29% from 5.31% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Following Intel's lead, the SOX semiconductor index sank 4%. KLA
Tencor lost $2.86 to $63.25 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the chip
equipment firm, saying the stock was too expensive. Chip maker Cree
fell $2.09 to $14.16, a loss of nearly 13%. The firm cut its
quarterly sales and earnings forecasts, citing product delays and
weak short-term demand.</TE>
<TE>   * Lucent Technologies fell 73 cents to an all-time low of $4.92,
leading many telecom stocks lower again. The company on Tuesday said
its return to profitability would be delayed by the tech-spending
slump.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Lucent said it raised $1.75 billion through the
sale of convertible preferred shares.</TE>
<TE>   * Among other telecom stocks, Nortel Networks fell 44 cents to
$5.21, WorldCom slid 54 cents to $7.39 and Sprint PCS slid 97 cents
to $11.08. Also, Comverse Technology lost $2.71 to $13.14 after
warning it will post a loss this quarter. Goldman Sachs removed the
stock from its recommended list.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's and Wendy's International fell after state and
federal officials said a small number of cattle in Kansas showing
symptoms similar to foot-and-mouth disease were being tested, but
there was no evidence yet of the disease. McDonald's lost 45 cents to
$27.90 and Wendy's dropped 7 cents to $31.56.</TE>

<HD>Expo to Focus on Funding Small Firms</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helping small-business owners figure out where they fit in the
financing food chain is the aim of an access-to-capital expo today.</LD>
<LD>   The event, funded by Wells Fargo and co-sponsored by the Los
Angeles Minority Business Opportunity Committee, is expected to
attract more than 300 small- and minority-business owners to the Los
Angeles Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   More than 200 of those small firms have appointments with lenders
at the expo, said Sharon D. Evans, president and chief executive of
the nonprofit Business Resource Group and organizer of the event.</LD>
<TE>   "A small business could be turned down for a commercial loan at
one bank, but had they gone across the hall to apply for a different
[loan] product they might have been approved by the same financial
institution," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of credit available varies widely. What we're doing is
matching business owners with the type of credit they need," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said she hopes to see at least 50 loans made to attending
business owners within the 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   More than 15 financial institutions, including Bank of America and
California Federal Bank, have agreed to participate.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup includes just one venture capital firm, Oakland-based
National Monetary Fund. Evans said the lenders on board represent a
better fit for most small firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone would prefer venture capital to debt," Evans said. "But
we didn't want hordes of people looking for venture capital who can
barely qualify for [Small Business Administration] loans."</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies, including one released last month by the Los
Angeles-based Community Development Technologies Center, identify
access to capital as the No. 1 hurdle facing many minority-business
owners.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the businesses that serve our community," said Los
Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. "Without some assistance
or lifeline, many of these small businesses won't survive."</TE>

<HD>Group Rates Kia Sedona 'Poor' in Its Crash Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kia Motors Corp.'s Sedona minivan suffered more than $4,000 in damage
during a low-speed bumper crash test because its air bags deployed,
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Sedona had a total of $9,747 in damage in four crash tests, a
performance the insurance industry-sponsored group rated "poor."</LD>
<LD>   The insurance institute said the air bags went off when the
Sedona's front end was crashed into a flat barrier at 5 mph. Both
driver- and passenger-side air bags deployed, and the passenger-side
air bag cracked the front windshield. The cost of repair was $4,305.</LD>
<TE>   Kia is investigating why the air bags deployed at such a low
speed, the institute said. Air bags normally go off only above speeds
of 12 to 14 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Kia spokesman Geno Effler said the maker's engineers studied the
results and ruled them an anomaly. He also said the firm had no
reports of Sedona air bags deploying during low-speed collisions.</TE>
<TE>   In another test, in which vehicles are backed into a pole at 5
mph, the Sedona's tailgate and rear body panels had to be replaced,
with damage at $2,971.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the worst performance of any minivan we've tested," Adrian
Lund, the institute's chief operating officer, said. "The worst
result was the air bag deployment in the flat-barrier test. This
shouldn't happen."</TE>

<HD>Investor Wins $593,125 in Case Against Broker</HD>
<DH>Securities: Panel finds that Mark Augusta misled a retired
engineer through bond sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arbitrators ordered a San Diego County broker to pay $593,125 to an
84-year-old man who claimed he was duped into buying risky and
ultimately worthless bonds instead of the safe, income-producing
investments he expected.</LD>
<LD>   A National Assn. of Securities Dealers panel ruled March 6 that
Mark F. Augusta misled and defrauded Robert H. Lundquist of Joshua
Tree, a retired chemical engineer. The panel awarded $243,125 in
compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages, plus $240,000
in attorney's fees.</LD>
<LD>   Lundquist purchased investments in the late 1990s including bonds
of Heritage Healthcare of America, underwritten by Augusta's employer
at the time, Miller &amp; Schroeder Financial Inc. The bonds, which were
supposed to finance nursing homes for Alzheimer's patients,
eventually went into default.</LD>
<TE>   Lundquist's wife "had been institutionalized for 10 years" with
Alzheimer's, said his attorney, Bradd L. Milove of San Diego. "The
pitch was that it was a safe investment that also would help other
Alzheimer's victims."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta, who had worked in Miller &amp; Schroeder's Solana Beach
office, is now employed at the La Jolla office of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray Inc. He didn't return a call to that office Wednesday and his
attorney, Steven M. Green of San Diego, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case is part of a cluster of complaints by investors who
bought Heritage Healthcare bonds from Miller &amp; Schroeder, a
Minneapolis investment firm that is liquidating its assets in
bankruptcy proceedings. Henry H. Rossbacher, a Los Angeles-based
lawyer for Miller &amp; Schroeder, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits on behalf of the bondholders seek damages from Miller &amp;
Schroeder and dozens of firms and individuals affiliated with it and
Encino-based Heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims, alleging the defendants overstated assets, lied
about their personal histories and shifted funds among Heritage
properties in violation of bond covenants, have been incorporated
into the Miller &amp; Schroeder bankruptcy proceedings, Milove said.</TE>

<HD>Former Head of Pacific Genesis to Settle Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS WALTERS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>David Fitzgerald, former head of underwriter Pacific Genesis Group
Inc., has agreed to pay $300,000 to settle securities fraud charges
concerning municipal bond sales for a Southern California housing
development, a lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission
said.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC in December 2000 sued Fitzgerald and Alameda, Calif.-based
Pacific Genesis, charging they misled investors with an inflated
appraisal and other improper disclosures in selling about $70 million
of bonds for the project.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Fitzgerald is barred for five years from
working with brokerage firms, said James Howell, an SEC trial
attorney in San Francisco who handled the case.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco still "has to
sign off" on the proposed settlement, Howell said. The parties all
have agreed to the terms, including Pacific Genesis, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds were sold in eight offerings from 1996 to 2000 for a
1,375-acre development known as Rancho Lucerne, which is on the edge
of the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Genesis also sold other municipal bonds for proposed real
estate projects throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald will pay a $55,000 civil penalty for the Rancho Lucerne
deals and disgorge an additional $245,000 in gains, including about
$30,000 in interest, according to documents filed with Breyer. Alvin
Fishman, a lawyer for Fitzgerald, couldn't be reached to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds generated controversy from the time they were first
sold, in part because the financing authorities used to offer the
debt didn't include local government oversight. The state attorney
general and treasurer scrutinized the transactions, and Gov. Gray
Davis in 2000 signed a law giving the state more power to monitor
tax-exempt bonds sold for speculative real estate development.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Corporations in June banned Pacific
Genesis from doing business in the state, saying it violated an
earlier order to improve securities disclosure.</TE>

<HD>Big Shareholders Divided on HP Deal</HD>
<DH>Merger: Putnam Investment says yes to Compaq union, while
Banc of America will vote against it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two big Hewlett-Packard Co. shareholders announced opposite
conclusions on the merits of the company's $22-billion acquisition of
Compaq Computer Corp. on Wednesday, with HP's management gaining the
most ground.</LD>
<LD>   Putnam Investment Management, which has about 46 million shares,
or about 2.4%, said it would vote for the acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe the merger enhances the combined companies' strategic
and competitive positions and offers financial benefits to
shareholders," Putnam said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the investment arm of Bank of America added
its name and 6.4 million HP shares to the list of those opposed to
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America Capital Management will vote its shares against
the merger because "overall, we think there might be dilution" of HP
profits, said spokesman Joe Fazzino.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's investment arm has about 0.3% of HP's outstanding
shares, bringing the announced opposition close to 25%, including the
18% controlled by heirs of HP founders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
Hewlett's son Walter, an HP director, is leading the proxy fight
leading up to the March 19 voting deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Banc of America's stand could be greater than
reflected by the number of shares it controls directly.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America customers own an additional 47 million shares, and
the bank's portfolio managers and private bankers will advise clients
who ask for guidance about the  group's decision, Fazzino said.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam's support brought those announced in favor of the merger to
about 8%. The firm also controls 69 million shares of Compaq, which
Walter Hewlett's side said could have colored its thinking.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 45 cents to $20.11. Compaq dipped 12 cents to $11,
both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   For the merger to go through, HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina
needs a majority of the shares that are actually voted by Tuesday.
The company can't vote on behalf of those who don't turn in proxy
cards.</TE>
<TE>   HP employees and retirees also are voting their own shares,
including those held in retirement plans, a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Some 6% of HP shares are held by current or former workers,
according to Walter Hewlett's proxy solicitation firm.</TE>

<HD>Risk of Meteorites Is Assessed</HD>

<LD>Munich Re, trying to gauge insurers' potential exposure to risks
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said a meteorite crash on Earth
could lead to bigger-than-expected costs for the industry.</LD>
<LD>   "The effects of a 'bombardment from space' are to be carried by
the insurance industry to a larger degree than has hitherto been
assumed," Munich Re said. "This is because meteorite crashes will
probably lead to explosions and fires which are covered in many
insurance contracts nowadays."</LD>
<LD>   Munich Re said it started assessing meteorite risks after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Insurers stand to lose as
much as $58 billion from the terrorist assault, Swiss Reinsurance
Co., the world's No. 2 reinsurer, said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "No one ever believed two planes would crash into a skyscraper, so
we have started looking at what's at all possible instead of what's
likely," said Thomas Loster, Munich Re's head of climate and natural
disaster research.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers may have to pay for meteorite-related damage because
they're defined as flying objects, like airplanes are, in most
policies, Loster said. A flooding caused by a meteorite crashing into
the sea also most likely would be covered.</TE>
<TE>   There have been more than 100 cases of meteorites hitting Earth
during the 20th century.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Nomura Superstar Joins Kennedy-Wilson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ethan Penner, a former Wall Street superstar whose powerful real
estate finance operation came crashing down after massive losses, has
been named president of Kennedy-Wilson Inc., the Beverly Hills firm
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The real estate services and investment company said Penner, in
the newly created position of president, will be responsible for
planning, developing and directing the company's various businesses,
including property management and managing investment funds.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy-Wilson executives have "built an excellent,
entrepreneurial platform to which I look forward to making a
significant contribution," Penner said in a statement. He was not
available for additional comment.</LD>
<TE>   People familiar with Penner, who reportedly once earned an
estimated $45 million a year when he worked for Japanese financial
giant Nomura Securities Co., were surprised that he had accepted a
post at such a relatively small and low-key firm as Kennedy-Wilson.
Company officials declined to reveal his salary.</TE>
<TE>   During the early 1990s, Penner emerged as a key player on Wall
Street and in real estate finance by aggressively expanding the use
of commercial mortgage-backed real estate securities, essentially
pools of real estate loans that were resold to investors as
high-yielding securities. The securities proved popular and provided
real estate developers and investors with a major new source of
capital.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his financial savvy, Penner also was known for
throwing huge and costly parties modeled on the Predators' Ball
hosted by junk bond financier Michael Milken during the 1980s. Penner
hired such well-known music stars as Don Henley and Joni Mitchell to
perform at his events.</TE>
<TE>   The market for Penner's securities suddenly collapsed in mid-1998
as a result of a worldwide financial crisis. Nomura was stuck with
real estate loans that it couldn't resell as securities and that were
plunging in value. Penner resigned in September 1998. Soon after,
Nomura Holding America Inc., the company's U.S. subsidiary, reported
a loss before taxes of nearly $1 billion, much of it stemming from
its real estate operations.</TE>
<TE>   Penner has since been involved in a variety of ventures, including
Silicon Valley Internet firms and investment advisory work.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy-Wilson Chairman and Chief Executive Bill McMorrow said the
former Nomura executive will prove valuable in expanding the company,
which recently completed an initial public offering involving its
Japanese operations. Penner also could play a key role in growing the
company's fund management business, which teams the company with
institutional investors to buy property as well as distressed debt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kennedy-Wilson rose 37 cents to $5.87 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Sued Over Fairy Toys Concept</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. has been accused of stealing the concept for fairy-based
toys for its Cabbage Patch dolls from an animation group,
Gunther-Wahl Productions Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Gunther-Wahl said it pitched its "Flutter Faeries" television show
and toy line to Mattel in 1993. Mattel passed on the idea and kept
copies of the materials, the company said in a lawsuit filed in Los
Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Gunther-Wahl claimed that Mattel in 2000 released a series of
Cabbage Patch Butterfly Fairies and Garden Fairies dolls that
incorporated "significant elements" of the "Flutter Faeries" idea. It
seeks unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   A Mattel spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on pending
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the El Segundo-based toy maker rose 24 cents to $19.04
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Awards Stock, Bonuses to Top Execs</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Firm says rewards, including $1.18 million for
CEO, reflect healthy 2001 earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eliciting protests from consumer activists, PG&amp;E Corp. said it paid
Chairman and Chief Executive Robert D. Glynn Jr. a $1.18-million
bonus for 2001, a year that saw the company's utility tumble into
bankruptcy while the parent earned $1.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In all, PG&amp;E's top 11 executives received $4.68 million in 2001
bonuses tied to operating profit for the year, PG&amp;E Corp. said
Wednesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
PG&amp;E executives also received $13.5 million in restricted stock.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E spokeswoman Renee Parnell said the bonuses reflect healthy
earnings for 2001, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion for 2000,
when electricity prices first soared but the utility, Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co., could not pass those costs along to its customers. But
last year, customer rate increases and sharply lower electricity
costs helped put PG&amp;E into the black.</LD>
<TE>   "That portion of Mr. Glynn's compensation is based solely on
corporate operating earnings per share," Parnell said. "If we don't
meet those targets, executive pay is reduced dramatically. Case in
point, 2000."</TE>
<TE>   For that year, Glynn and six other PG&amp;E executives received no
bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer groups argued that PG&amp;E is inflating its earnings by
including the extra cash generated by higher customer rates and lower
electricity costs.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison is using that so-called headroom to
repay its creditors; PG&amp;E is still trying to get a reorganization
plan approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court while state regulators
craft a plan of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "They are basing their bonuses on phantom earnings," said Doug
Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights. "This is
money that we believe belongs back in ratepayer hands."</TE>
<TE>   Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, called
the bonuses "obscene."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company that is in Bankruptcy Court claiming it can't
pay its bills and needs to raise electricity rates so it can throw
money at the executives that ran it into bankruptcy," Spatt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric sought bankruptcy-court protection from its
creditors in April after piling up $9 billion in electricity debts.
Not included in the bankruptcy were the parent company and a sister
subsidiary, National Energy Group, that builds power plants and
trades energy.</TE>
<TE>   Glynn's base salary for 2001 was $900,000, unchanged from the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his $1.18-million bonus, Glynn received $3 million
in stock with selling restrictions attached. Glynn got a
$1.22-million bonus in 1999 and no restricted stock.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon R. Smith, president of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, received a
salary of $630,000, a bonus of $664,808 and restricted stock worth
$1.23 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another executive, Thomas G. Boren, chief executive of National
Energy Group, was paid more. Boren received a salary of $690,000, a
bonus of $679,478 and restricted stock worth $1.75 million.</TE>

<HD>Recovery Plan Boosts Tourism</HD>
<DH>Economy: Regional measures to mitigate 9/11 are working,
city and county officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A regional recovery plan crafted to keep the Los Angeles-area economy
on track appears to be working, especially in attracting more
tourists than anticipated in the aftermath of Sept. 11, county and
city officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Since Sept. 11, we have been working hard to change the predicted
direction for travel to Los Angeles, and we are making some headway,"
said George Kirkland, president and chief executive of the Los
Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   He said industry analysts expected international visitors to Los
Angeles would drop in 2001 by 800,000, but the actual number was
closer to 650,000. Domestic tourism was forecast to decline 5%, "and
in fact, the year ended with a 1.2% increase."</LD>
<TE>   On the downside, Kirkland said "spending was down due to a soft
economy, shorter stays and smaller travel-party sizes."</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland and others attributed the better-than-expected results to
a regional recovery plan crafted last fall at an economic summit of
more than 400 business, city, county and community leaders. Among its
priorities were accelerating public works projects and launching a
marketing campaign to help travel and tourism. The plan also
addressed a prolonged slump in manufacturing and the Internet
industry and rising energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Actions on the federal, state and through the [local level] are
healing an economy that is more resilient than we first thought,"
said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the tourism and hospitality industry was injected
with $300,000 in countywide promotional funds, and three months later
has helped bring in more than $3.7 million in spending by visitors,
including nearly $1 million in hotel room revenues. The campaign
targeted local tourists who planned to travel to the region by car,
rather than fly-in travelers coming from greater distances. The
result was about 7,800 room-nights sold during January and February.</TE>
<TE>   Such a proactive approach to stave off more dire economic
consequences was the real value of the recovery plan, Kyser said.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing their plan three months later, local leaders pointed to
a number of initiatives that appear to be gaining momentum,
particularly cross-agency cooperation to better respond to economic
downturns.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is a WorkSource facility at the downtown Chicana
Service Action Center. WorkSource is the name given to the new
regionwide effort to help employees, such as immigrant Eng Wong, find
jobs and employers find workers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wong, 57, was a chemist in Macao for 31 years, he found
himself selling work clothes in Huntington Park for a year before
finding his current job through WorkSource five months ago. He is now
a chemist receiving training at Bocchi Laboratories in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to workers' aid, the Economic Action Summit plan calls
for green-lighting private sector and public works projects, and
creating business assistance and retention programs.</TE>

<DH>Probe: Potential suitors pull out of talks as accounting

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Fearing an imminent criminal indictment for its role in the Enron
Corp. debacle, Andersen raced late Wednesday to reach a plea
agreement with federal prosecutors and sell all or part of its
operations to a rival.</LD>
<LD>   But options for the accounting firm appeared to be narrowing, and
company executives were considering filing for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Two potential merger partners, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, announced they were dropping out of contention.</LD>
<TE>   Deloitte said that although "our first preference for the capital
markets and for the profession is for Andersen to continue as a
free-standing firm," it was unable to continue discussions because of
Andersen's unresolved legal issues.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young issued a similar statement, saying that "as long as
Enron and other Andersen litigation matters are unresolved, it is not
in the best interests of our people, clients and our firm to pursue
such a combination."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department could file criminal obstruction-of-justice
charges as early as today. Andersen has acknowledged shredding
thousands of Enron-related documents after learning that the
Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the Houston
energy giant last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department sources insisted Wednesday that prosecutors had
not set a deadline for reaching a plea. But top officials were
scheduled to meet today in Washington to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   One former Justice Department official said prosecutors probably
are trying to "turn up the heat" on Andersen to pressure the
accounting firm to cooperate more fully in the larger investigation
into Enron. The department also may be eager to wrap up its inquiry
into Andersen to focus more fully on Enron and its top officers,
another former prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   The former Justice official said prosecutors also may face another
nettlesome issue, because Andersen is a partnership of individual
executives, not a corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals are charged every day and corporations can be
charged. But in a partnership like Arthur Andersen, it raises a lot
of questions," said the former official. "Could just some partners be
charged and not others? It is very unclear."</TE>
<TE>   The former official also said Andersen may be cooperating in
investigations of other firms that also used such financial practices
and off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen executives, who fear an indictment will come today, were
huddling late Wednesday to work out a plea with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen also is considering filing for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, possibly to pave the way for an orderly sale
of assets or as a strategy to cope with rising Enron-related claims,
a source said. But a bankruptcy filing won't stop an indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges against Andersen certainly wouldn't be the first
corporate indictment by the Justice Department, but it's potentially
one of the most devastating, scarring the auditor's reputation and
putting thousands of jobs at risk. Although dozens of other large
corporations have survived criminal indictments or guilty pleas, a
criminal case against Andersen, which trades on its reputation, could
be a death knell for the company, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "One way or the other, this time next year Arthur Andersen as an
entity will no longer exist," said Thomas Ajamie, a Houston attorney
who is advising an insurance company involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The potential effect has put federal prosecutors in the unusual
position of deciding whether one of America's most venerable
corporate names will live or die.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff, who is heading the
department's criminal probe, will need to weigh a variety of factors,
balancing the imperative to punish Andersen with a reluctance to
deliver a death blow to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "There are human consequences here," said Eric Holder Jr., former
deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. "Generally [in
corporate indictments], you're not talking about a company
disappearing."</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen collapses, its ability to fund settlements with Enron
investors, employees and the Securities and Exchange Commission will
diminish substantially. The firm has offered to pay $750 million to
pay such claims, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Andersen is losing big-name clients daily. On Wednesday,
consumer finance lender Household International Inc. joined the
growing list of defectors, citing the "uncertainty about the future
direction" of Andersen. If Andersen is indicted or pleads guilty,
more clients are certain to bolt.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment or a plea deal also could disrupt financial markets
by potentially delaying or distracting Andersen from completing its
auditing work for remaining clients, one analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "The financial markets have demonstrated over and over again that
they are so skittish about any kind of accounting issues," said Mark
Cheffers, chief of the AccountingMalpractice.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even if Andersen manages to stop the flight of clients, a guilty
plea could prevent it from reviewing the books of its remaining
customers. SEC rules provide that anyone who is convicted of a crime
of "moral turpitude" is to be suspended from practicing business
before the commission, which includes signing off on the audits of
public companies.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials noted that such a penalty is not necessarily
automatic and may be waived under a plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the SEC officially censured Andersen last year
for its handling of Waste Management's book and may be less willing
to let the accounting firm escape a harsher punishment in the Enron
case.</TE>
<TE>   One option for Andersen would be to convince prosecutors to press
charges against individual employees, rather than the company itself.
Andersen has admitted that senior executives ordered the destruction
of Enron-related documents. The firm has shared the results of its
internal investigation with prosecutors, but has not released it
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way a prosecutor would accept such a plea would be if
the company provides evidence to convict individuals in the
organization," said Joseph DiGenova, former U.S. Attorney for the
District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Others predicted that the Justice Department will show little
sympathy for Andersen's plight.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department is not known for sympathy when they've got
you on the ropes," said Stephen Ryan, former federal prosecutor and
attorney at Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. "I don't think the department
is going to pull any punches on a case like this. It's so politicized
and subject to scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, failing to press charges against Andersen would
diminish the seriousness of Andersen's misconduct, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of rising criminal conduct by corporations, the
Justice Department issued internal guidelines in 1999 to clarify the
factors that prosecutors should weigh when considering criminal
charges against companies.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, issued by Holder, urged prosecutors not to shy
away from pursuing criminal cases against corporations and stressed
that indictments can serve the public by deterring similar bad acts
throughout an industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Indicting corporations for wrongdoing enables the government to
address and be a force for positive change of corporate culture,
alter corporate behavior, and prevent, discover and punish
white-collar crime," the guidelines state.</TE>
<TE>   But the guidelines also recommend that prosecutors consider the
larger effect of an indictment, such as loss of jobs or damage to
shareholders and other innocent parties who "played no role in the
criminal conduct, have been completely unaware of it, or have been
wholly unable to prevent it."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Andersen, that may include thousands of workers
worldwide, as well as employees and investors of Enron who are suing
Andersen to recoup losses.</TE>

<HD>Job 1 at Global Crossing: Hanging On to Customers</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The ailing fiber-optic firm has managed to keep
its systems running--and revenue coming in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creditors, shareholders and employees of Global Crossing Ltd. all
have suffered since the company filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy
in U.S. history. But customers of the struggling telecommunications
provider say it has been business as usual since the financial
meltdown in January.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything's running the same as it was," said Paul Pitts, senior
vice president of operations, planning and engineering for Nuvox
Inc., a Missouri company that buys communications services from
Global Crossing and other vendors and resells them to small and
medium-sized businesses.</LD>
<LD>   KB Toys hired Global Crossing last year to build a frame relay
network so that 1,250 of its stores could authorize credit card
purchases and communicate with the company's headquarters in
Pittsfield, Mass. The network went live before the holiday shopping
season and has operated smoothly ever since.</LD>
<TE>   "It has not missed a beat since they filed" for bankruptcy, said
Steve Raimer, KB's director of network services and emerging
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping customers such as Nuvox and KB Toys satisfied is more
crucial than ever for Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Angry creditors, who are owed about $12 billion, and disgruntled
shareholders, whose stock now is essentially worthless, can't inflict
much harm on Global Crossing, because it is operating under the
protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York while it attempts
to restructure.</TE>
<TE>   But customers could complicate that task if they abandon the
company now, when it needs to cling to all the revenue it can.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to create a self-fulfilling prophesy by having
visible cases of customers defecting," said Roger Wery, director of
the communications group at PRTM, a technology consulting firm in
Mountain View, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of high-profile customers--even just a handful of
them--could encourage others to abandon Global Crossing, triggering
the telecom equivalent of a run on the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Steep staffing cuts also could spook customers, because it takes a
small cadre of engineers and technicians to tend the network and keep
it running. Analysts and customers say that so far, the company has
protected the ranks of its technical employees even as it slashes
jobs in sales and administration.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Global Crossing said it would eliminate an additional
1,600 positions and close 71 offices in an attempt to reduce its
operating expenses by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere said the cuts were
targeted to preserve its relationships with current customers and
encourage them to stay on board.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to focus much more on retention and growth of our
existing customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives also are lobbying customers to keep them on
board. Legere himself has made as many as 20 calls a day to reassure
worried customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the mere communicating constantly with your customers,
taking away the uncertainty, has given us a retention rate that is in
line with our business plan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gregor, manager of voice communications in the information
services division at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,
said Global Crossing called within 30 minutes of the bankruptcy
filing Jan. 28 to make sure the hospital's network backbone and long-
distance service were working properly.</TE>
<TE>   "They offered to set up a call with John Legere and our chief
information officer," Gregor said. "Their regional V.P. came out and
met with our people. I was totally shocked about how open they were."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing executives also called NBC News Channel President
Bob Horner to assure him that the company's digital transport network
would be capable of transmitting daily video programming of the
Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City to stations around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolutely business as usual," Horner said. "Everything
went exactly as planned."</TE>
<TE>   The ease with which Global Crossing's infrastructure has operated
during bankruptcy comes as little surprise to those who understand
how networks work.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult part is getting them built. But once all the thin
strands of glass that make up Global Crossing's worldwide fiber-optic
network are in the ground or underneath the ocean floor, the expense
of keeping it running is comparatively minor.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than them shutting off the electricity, it'll run," Gregor
said. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has boosted the
amount of services it buys from Global Crossing since the bankruptcy
filing, Gregor said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the hospital is drafting a plan in case the
company is unable to provide service in the future. Gregor has
stepped up talks with other vendors to make sure they could quickly
fill any gap created by a potential Global Crossing meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Should the network fail, KB Toys would revert to the analog
dial-up network it just replaced. That would mean credit card
approvals would take 18 to 20 seconds each, three to five times
longer than they now take, Raimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the Associated Communications Cos. of America,
which buy services from Global Crossing at wholesale rates and resell
them to their customers, are thinking about switching to other, less
risky suppliers, said President Mike Newkirk.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to not wait until the last minute and
cause disruption to our customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Switching providers is more of a hassle than a technical challenge
and could tie up half a dozen people for two or more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to redo something that's already been done," said
Newkirk, who also is president of BTI Telecom Corp. in Raleigh, N.C.
"It's an administrative burden on our part to absorb that
time-consuming task of writing orders and testing and accepting
circuits."</TE>
<TE>   Such hassles may be less likely now that financiers are expressing
interest in Global Crossing. A bidding war could reassure customers
that the company's network will remain intact. Indeed, two Los
Angeles-based buyout firms--Gores Technology Group and Platinum
Equity--said last week that they planned to make offers.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 40 potential suitors also have been examining the
company's books, Legere said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a robust infusion of capital, that will probably
reassure the customers," analyst Wery said. Otherwise, he said, "you
may have another Excite@Home," a reference to the high-speed Internet
service provider that shut down this year. "The signals sent to the
market will be critical."</TE>

<HD>SEC Seeks to Take Exec's Stock Options</HD>
<DH>Regulator: Lawsuit against former COO of IGI, alleging
fraudulent financial statements, is precedent-setting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued a New Jersey businessman
Wednesday, aiming to strip him of bonuses and stock options that the
agency alleges were granted as the result of fraudulently inflated
financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time in a securities fraud case that the SEC has
tried to take away an executive's stock options, although the agency
has previously gone after executive bonuses and profits from stock
sales, said Christopher Conte, the SEC's assistant director of
enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes only days after President Bush demanded more
accountability of corporate executives in a speech that outlined a
10-point plan to deal with executives who mislead investors. Bush's
plan would strip these executives of bonus payments and bar them from
running a public company, but it stops short of making them liable
for investor losses.</LD>
<TE>   "If officers of a public company participate in financial fraud
and are rewarded through compensation, we will seek to have that
profit returned to the company," said Conte, who added that the SEC
is receiving considerably more complaints about financial fraud in
the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say what the cause is, but relative to the number of
matters we were aware of, the numbers this year are bigger," he said.
"We are hearing about more and more possible problems at companies."</TE>
<TE>   Conte declined to comment on whether the agency is planning to
take similar action in cases in which executive compensation has been
an issue, including Enron and Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   In its suit, the SEC alleges John P. Gallo, the former president
and chief operating officer of IGI Inc., a Buena, N.J., maker of
poultry vaccines, inflated the company's earnings over three years.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleged Gallo, in an effort to exceed earnings and revenue
targets, instructed the company's chief financial officer not to
write off destroyed or defective inventory, as would be required
under generally accepted accounting standards.</TE>
<TE>   He also instructed the company's former vice president of
operations to backdate sales documents to manipulate earnings,
according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Gallo's attorney, Edwin Jacobs, said he hadn't seen the suit and
couldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC seeks to permanently bar Gallo from acting as an officer
or director of any public firm. The agency also wants Gallo to
prepare an accounting of all compensation and "other remuneration" he
received as a result of "fraudulently misrepresenting that IGI had
exceeded any revenue, net income or other performance targets for
fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC wants Gallo to return his salary, bonus and stock sale
profits and any unexercised stock options to the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said it had settled related actions against the
company's chief financial officer and former vice president of
operations, as well as two other IGI executives.</TE>
<TE>   Without admitting or denying guilt, these executives settled with
the SEC by agreeing not to violate securities laws in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of IGI rose 2 cents to 72 cents Wednesday on the American
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>TRW to Fight Northrop Overture by Divesting</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Takeover target's chairman says per-share offer
of $47 is 'grossly inadequate.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. launched a counterattack to Northrop Grumman Corp.'s hostile
takeover bid Wednesday, announcing plans to break up the company
itself by spinning off or selling both its automotive and aircraft
parts businesses.</LD>
<LD>   TRW executives said the company's board unanimously agreed to
accelerate long-held strategic plans to divest itself of non-
defense-related businesses while urging shareholders to reject
Northrop's proposal to acquire the company for $47 a share, or $5.9
billion.</LD>
<LD>   In its offer, Century City-based Northrop has said it would spin
off or sell TRW's debt-ridden auto parts business and keep only the
space and defense electronics operations, most of which are based in
Southern California and poised for significant growth as the Pentagon
budget increases.</LD>
<TE>   "Our board continues to believe that $47 is grossly inadequate and
does not reflect the value of TRW's advanced portfolio of technology
and unique market positions," Philip A. Odeen, TRW's chairman and
interim chief executive, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "We
believe our plan will add significant value in excess of Northrop's
offer."</TE>
<TE>   Odeen declined to say how much more the company would be worth if
TRW were to implement its plan, though some analysts said the breakup
value could be as low as $49 a share or as high as $60.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's move, which had been expected because it rejected the same
offer last week, came before the market opened and fueled speculation
among investors that Northrop would increase its bid or withdraw the
offer. TRW shares rose 89 cents to $51.17 on the New York Stock
Exchange; Northrop gained 43 cents to $109.90, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   But Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said in an interview that he had
no such plans and that for now he would stick with the initial offer:
a stock exchange of $47 in Northrop's shares for each share of TRW
stock. The offer could rise if TRW executives would allow Northrop to
conduct due diligence, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fully committed to the tender offer," Kresa said. "We have
no further information than what is publicly available and until we
do there is no mechanism or rationale to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment
Partners Inc., a defense industry investment bank, said Northrop had
no reason to respond differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Northrop started this by being opportunistic," Kutler said,
noting that Northrop made the bid for TRW just two days after TRW's
chief executive quit. The resignation precipitated a 26% plunge in
TRW stock. "There is no pressure on them to raise the offer. They're
not going to get pressured into making a bad deal."</TE>
<TE>   If TRW successfully spins off the auto parts business, a feat it
has unable to pull off in the past, Northrop could still come back
with a hostile acquisition offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Northrop could take another bite of the apple," Kutler said.</TE>
<TE>   With neither side budging at the moment,  TRW's fate will rest
with shareholders, who have until April 22 to evaluate and choose
between Northrop's offer or the divestiture proposal.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, analysts were scrambling Wednesday to evaluate both
options, but there appeared to be little consensus as to which
provided better value to TRW shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Under the TRW plan, company executives said they hoped to spin off
the auto business as an independent, publicly traded company within
the next six to nine months.</TE>
<TE>   But first, the company would sell the aeronautical systems unit,
proceeds of which would be used to pay down debt. TRW has about $5.5
billion in debt, making it one of the highest-leveraged companies in
the industry. Odeen said that with the sale of the aeronautical
business and other smaller, non-core operations, the company could
reduce its debt level by $1.6billion to $2 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's automotive parts business makes components including air
bags, seat belts and steering systems; its aeronautical division
makes a wide variety of airplane parts, from cargo rollers and jet
engine valves to hydraulic systems and fuel pumps.</TE>
<TE>   "TRW has been examining a potential separation of our automotive
business for some time," Odeen said. "We believe that our strategic
plan ... will create two 'pure play' independent businesses, each
positioned to deliver superior growth and returns."</TE>
<TE>   Odeen said the company has begun preliminary talks with a
potential buyer for the aeronautical systems business, though he
declined to provide details. He also said he was talking to several
companies that indicated interest in other operations.</TE>
<TE>   In a note to investors Wednesday, Prudential Securities analyst
Andrew Casey called TRW's plan a "credible alternative" to Northrop's
bid, noting that the auto business could be worth about $25 a share
while the defense electronics would be valued at $27 a share, for a
total breakup value of $52 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line of this analysis," he wrote, "is that the TRW
plan gives shareholders the promise of higher value" than Northrop's
$47 bid.</TE>
<TE>   But Ken Blaschke, analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown,  was
less sure. He said he could not see the auto business fetching more
than $20 a share because of the unit's heavy debt load, and he
recommended that shareholders sell TRW's stock.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if TRW does enact a spin, there is little further upside
from current price levels," he said. "Bottom line is that we believe
investors should sell the stock at current levels."</TE>
<TE>   In either case, there already appears to be a potential loser: the
city of Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   There is strong potential that it no longer would be home to TRW's
headquarters, culminating a decades-long exodus of major companies
from a city that during its heyday in the 1960s had one of the
largest concentrations of Fortune 500 companies.</TE>

<HD>Vinson &amp; Elkins' Turn in the Enron Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just six weeks after Enron Corp. directed its lawyers at Vinson &amp;
Elkins to investigate allegations about its secret partnerships, a
report came back Oct. 15 saying everything was just fine. No need for
"further widespread investigation," the lawyers added.</LD>
<LD>   The very next day, Enron delivered the first in a series of shocks
when it slashed shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, partly due to the
partnerships. Sixteen days later the board of directors launched
their own inquiry, which quickly found massive improprieties. And on
Dec. 2, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   "Even as the Titanic was sinking, there were certain rooms that
were perfectly dry," said Matthew Spitzer, USC Law School dean. "If
you asked someone in one of those rooms, 'See any water?,' they'd say
no. That's the sort of investigation Vinson &amp; Elkins did."</LD>
<TE>   The law firm, one of the biggest and most highly regarded in the
country, says it had no clue about the real nature of Enron's
problems. The two versions of reality will be debated this morning in
Washington as the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight
and investigations grills Vinson &amp; Elkins' top management.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that Enron did not collapse in a vacuum of advice," said
subcommittee Chairman James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.). "Even if the
attorneys recommended Enron follow a perfectly legal course of
action, maybe the laws need to be reformed."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood also said he was curious why Enron's own investigation,
run by Enron board member and University of Texas Law School Dean
William Powers, "was able to determine things after the fact that
Vinson &amp; Elkins was either unable or unwilling or not directed to
discover."</TE>
<TE>   The Powers report was critical of V&amp;E, saying Enron "relied
heavily" on the law firm's perceived approval on "the structure and
disclosure" of the partnerships. V&amp;E "should have brought a stronger,
more objective and more critical voice to the disclosure process."</TE>
<TE>   Testifying for V&amp;E will be managing partner Joe Dilg and partner
Ronald Astin, who worked directly with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Four current and former Enron lawyers also will testify, including
former general counsel James Derrick. Before joining Enron, Derrick
worked at V&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Harry Reasoner, former Vinson &amp; Elkins
managing partner and the firm's designated spokesman for Enron
issues, said the energy company's collapse was a tragedy for the
people who worked there and a sad event for him personally.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like that happens," he noted, "all of us say,
'What could have been done differently?'"</TE>
<TE>   The answer, at least as far as the 860-lawyer Vinson &amp; Elkins is
concerned: nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Using a metaphor that also has been employed by former Enron Chief
Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, Reasoner said Enron fell apart in "a
perfect storm" of events: A loss of confidence in the company's
accounting resulted in a downgrade of debt which caused a liquidity
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe, if you look at it in perspective, that you can
say we or any other lawyer had anything to do with it," Reasoner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some people sharply disagree with this. One Enron lawyer, speaking
anonymously, put it this way: "Where was the oversight? Where was the
counsel saying, 'Even if this is technically legal, should we be
doing it?' That's where the senior people at V&amp;E failed, and that's
where Enron's own senior counsel failed."</TE>
<TE>   If V&amp;E had strayed from purely legal advice, people would have
said, "You're lawyers who work by the hour, and you don't know
anything about this," Reasoner said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, at least, Enron's legal counsel is suffering much less
than its accounting firm. While Andersen is hemorrhaging clients and
desperately trying to ward off an indictment, Vinson &amp; Elkins is
largely unscathed. Headhunters are calling its lawyers, Reasoner
said, but none are fleeing. Neither are clients.</TE>
<TE>   One reason that V&amp;E is getting off lightly: accountants are
vouchsafing the accuracy of documents for the investing public, while
a law firm is only responsible to its client. So everyone can sue
Andersen, and just about everyone is. But under Texas law V&amp;E can be
easily sued only by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "In 20 years of suing lawyers, I've never done it on behalf of a
third party," said Randy Johnston, a legal malpractice attorney in
Dallas. "Whoever decides to take V&amp;E on is taking on a huge task."</TE>
<TE>   To successfully mount a suit against a lawyer, a shareholder must
prove that the lawyer fraudulently misrepresented certain facts or
conditions, and that the lawyer "had reason to expect" the
shareholder would rely on those misrepresentations.</TE>
<TE>   But even this wouldn't be easy, as the Texas Supreme Court
demonstrated in June in a misrepresentation case involving the
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. Such cases, the court ruled, applied
in only very specific circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Early in Enron's collapse, two law firms did name Vinson &amp; Elkins
in class-action suits. But after talking with V&amp;E's outside counsel,
legendary Texas lawyer Joe Jamail, the firms dropped the suits. Since
then, V&amp;E has largely stood outside the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "For me to be interested in suing V&amp;E, I would want some type of a
representation by them in a publicly distributed document which I
could demonstrate that either they knew was false or should have
known was false," said Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't know of any such documents. Nor apparently does anyone
else. "The fact that they haven't been sued yet suggests they don't
exist," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Enron as a potential plaintiff. The new chief
executive, Stephen F. Cooper, has made noises about looking for cash
anywhere he can find it, but no suit has yet been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, V&amp;E is rapidly distancing itself from its former top
client, which provided $35 million, or nearly 8% of its $455 million
in 2001 revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have terminated our representation of Enron," Reasoner wrote
to clients last month.</TE>
<TE>   The letter stressed that the law firm and the client had never
been that close in the first place. "Enron was represented by an
extremely able legal department of some 250 lawyers," Reasoner wrote.
Furthermore, he noted, all V&amp;E lawyers worked through Enron's legal
department, a standard practice at large corporations.</TE>
<TE>   But the Enron lawyer remembers a more intimate relationship. "V&amp;E
developed social relationships with the businesspeople at Enron. They
would play golf together, gossip together," this lawyer said. "Once
you have that sort of personal relationship with your outside
counsel, it's a little more difficult for them to tell you the bad
news."</TE>
<TE>   Both V&amp;E and Enron are home-grown Houston entities, although the
law firm is much older. James Elkins was a former county judge who
joined up with William Vinson in 1917 to start a two-man practice.
Judge, as Elkins was simply called, was the dominant partner whose
influence lingered for decades.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Vinson &amp; Elkins lawyers are on the boring, arrogant side, not the
roll the dice and take a shot side," said Gerald Treece, South Texas
College of Law dean. "They say, 'Go slow.' They play hard, but fair."</TE>
<TE>   It's a reputation that is helping them as their work for Enron
comes under scrutiny. When Enron Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president
in the company, first alerted Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August to
the accounting improprieties, she warned against using Vinson &amp;
Elkins to examine them. "Can't use V&amp;E due to conflict," she wrote,
noting the firm had provided some so-called true-sale opinions on
several deals.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, V&amp;E did the review. "In retrospect, they probably
should have suggested an outside counsel," said Spitzer of USC. "The
allegations required them to review, in part, the propriety of their
own actions. But when you ask someone. 'Did you do anything wrong?,'
the answer is almost always 'I don't think so.'"</TE>

<HD>'Living Wage' Laws Reducing Poverty Levels, Study Shows</HD>
<DH>Labor: Battle between advocates and business opponents over
the issue has intensified in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Living wage" laws, adopted in dozens of cities and counties in
recent years, reduce overall poverty levels despite causing some job
loss, according to a cautiously worded study from a conservative
economist.</LD>
<LD>   David Neumark, a Michigan State University economist known for his
opposition to minimum-wage hikes, said the findings--to be released
today by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of
California--surprised him.</LD>
<LD>   "Going into this, I would have been pretty negative," Neumark
said. "But I come away saying these things work reasonably well, and
there's no reason to condemn them on empirical grounds."</LD>
<TE>   The electoral fight between advocates and business opponents has
intensified in recent years over living wage laws. The laws raise
hourly wages beyond the minimums for select workers, generally those
with some connection to government. About 80 such laws have been
enacted since the first was adopted in Baltimore in 1994, and dozens
more are pending. The city and county of Los Angeles have adopted
living wage laws, as have at least 10 other California cities and
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Neumark is still no fan of an increase in the minimum wage, which
he maintains won't reduce poverty and could even exacerbate it.
Living wage laws have the opposite effect, he said, because they are
more targeted. Beneficiaries are more likely to be adults heading
poor households rather than those in middle-class homes, such as
suburban teenagers in part-time jobs. "It's a distributional
question," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Policy Institute said the 145-page study is the first
comprehensive look at the outcomes of living wage legislation.
Neumark collected income data from 40 cities that have living wage
laws and compared trends with other cities where no such laws exist.</TE>
<TE>   He cautioned that his study should not be taken as a prescription
for the living wage approach. "There are two themes that come out of
this," he said. "One is if you simply ask the question, 'Do these
things tend to help the poor?' It looks like they do, at least the
broader ones. The more subtle question is, 'Is this the best way [to
reduce poverty]?' That's not so clear-cut."</TE>
<TE>   The findings were questioned by the Employment Policies Institute
in Washington, which is an organization of restaurants and other
employers of low-wage workers and a prominent voice against living
wage laws.</TE>
<TE>   Chief economist Richard Toikka said it may be too early to reach
conclusions about costs and benefits. And because the laws vary
greatly, it is difficult to generalize about them. More
significantly, Toikka said, there are more efficient ways to reduce
poverty, such as with earned income tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, living wage proponents said the study backs up
what they've maintained all along.</TE>
<TE>   "These laws are running straight at some of the most dire economic
realities that poor people face," said Jen Kern, director of the
Living Wage Resource Center at ACORN, a national coalition of
anti-poverty community groups that has been a leading voice for the
living wage movement. "It's fundamental: If you work, you shouldn't
be poor. People in America believe that."</TE>
<TE>   The living wage campaigns have been championed by groups ranging
from labor unions to affordable-housing advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The laws vary widely as well. Nearly all set wage floors for
employees of government contractors, such as janitors, food service
workers and security guards. Many also cover employers that receive
any government subsidies or benefits, or who lease space from the
government, such as airport concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by success, proponents have been raising the living
wage floor--from an average of $9 an hour in the late 1990s to about
$12 now--and broadening the definition of covered employees.</TE>
<TE>   And private employers are increasingly being targeted. One example
is Santa Monica's recently adopted coastal zone living wage of $10.50
an hour, which covers private employers near the beach and is being
challenged by a hotel-sponsored ballot initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, voters in New Orleans approved a landmark living
wage that covers all workers in the city. It immediately was met with
a business-sponsored legal challenge, and even proponents concede
that it may not survive.</TE>
<TE>   Employer groups have fought each new wrinkle with lawsuits, rival
ballot initiatives and lobbying in state capitals. In response, seven
states have adopted preemptive laws prohibiting local living wages,
and more are considering them.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the Santa Monica ordinance has been particularly
fierce. As the City Council was considering it, major hotels and
restaurant chains funded a rival ordinance that offered a
"traditional" living wage law but prohibited the city from raising
wages paid by private employers.</TE>
<TE>   That failed and the council adopted the law, but the same
coalition is now backing an initiative to kill it. If that fails,
they have pledged to fight it in court.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which proposed the
ordinance, estimates that opponents have spent more than $1 million
so far, and may end up more than doubling that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been intimidating and overwhelming, the amount of opposition
and money in particular," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, alliance
director. "But it's not unanticipated. In some ways, it's validating
that we're asking for real change."</TE>

<HD>Auditor Balks at Guilty Plea in Enron Case</HD>
<DH>Probe: Andersen says its destruction of papers does not
warrant a plea bargain that could be firm's death sentence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH, EDMUND SANDERS and JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm told the Justice Department late
Wednesday that it would not plead guilty to felony charges of
obstruction of justice.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff, lawyers for
the troubled firm said government threats intended to get Andersen to
reach a plea agreement or face a felony indictment represented "an
unprecedented exercise of prosecutorial discretion and a gross abuse
of governmental power."</LD>
<LD>   A copy of the letter obtained by The Times states that the
government action would probably destroy the accounting firm, which
became a target of multiple federal probes because of its work for
Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen, which earlier in the week had negotiated with the
Justice Department, apparently reversed its strategy as the
government's deadline of 9 a.m. today for a plea agreement neared and
as rival firms dropped out of merger talks.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte &amp; Touche Tohmatsu and Ernst &amp; Young earlier announced
that they had decided against a merger with Andersen because they
feared its liability in the Enron case was too large and complex.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte said that although "our first preference for the capital
markets and for the profession is for Andersen to continue as a
free-standing firm," it was unable to continue discussions because of
Andersen's unresolved legal issues.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young issued a similar statement, saying that "as long as
Enron and other Andersen litigation matters are unresolved, it is not
in the best interests of our people, clients and our firm to pursue
such a combination."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department could file criminal obstruction-of-justice
charges as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department sources insisted Wednesday that prosecutors had
not set a deadline for reaching a plea. But top officials were
scheduled to meet today in Washington to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the probe is Andersen's admitted destruction of
documents sought by the government in its probe of Enron's collapse.
Andersen served as Enron's auditor and business consultant, earning
as much as $1 million a week for its work for the Houston energy
trader.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Andersen complained that it had been denied the
chance to "tell its story to the grand jury," which it claimed was a
violation of government policy.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm contends that the document destruction "was
confined to relatively few partners and employees of the firm and was
almost entirely limited to the Houston office."</TE>
<TE>   And even then, Andersen argued, there was no "willfull criminal
intent to obstruct a governmental investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the attorneys for the firm told the Justice
Department that Andersen's actions do not warrant a plea bargain that
would amount to a death sentence for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen is considering filing for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, possibly to pave the way for an orderly sale
of assets or as a strategy to cope with rising Enron-related claims,
a source said. But a bankruptcy filing wouldn't stop an indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges against Andersen certainly wouldn't be the first
corporate indictment by the Justice Department, but it is potentially
one of the most devastating, scarring the auditor's reputation and
putting thousands of jobs at risk. Although dozens of other large
corporations have survived criminal indictments or guilty pleas, a
criminal case against Andersen, which trades on its reputation, could
be a death knell for the company, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "One way or the other, this time next year Arthur Andersen as an
entity will no longer exist," said Thomas Ajamie, a Houston attorney
who is advising an insurance company involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The potential effects have put federal prosecutors in the unusual
position of deciding whether one of America's most venerable
corporate names will live or die.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Chertoff, who is heading the department's
criminal probe, will need to weigh a variety of factors, balancing
the imperative to punish Andersen with a reluctance to deliver a
death blow to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "There are human consequences here," said Eric Holder Jr., former
deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. "Generally [in
corporate indictments], you're not talking about a company
disappearing."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said in its letter to Chertoff that the firm audits 17%
of the nation's public companies and that its death not only would
put thousands of accountants and staff out of work but also would
create a disruption in financial reporting as those businesses
scrambled to find new auditors.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm said it had agreed to institute a series of
reforms recommended by a special panel headed by former Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. The attorneys said those
reforms would result in "greater centralization and control of audit
teams," a critical change that would prevent the kind of document
destruction that occurred last fall in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The firm proposed a joint settlement with the Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which also is
investigating the firm's work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   That proposal included:</TE>
<TE>   * Deferred prosecution of the firm and the appointment of a
special monitor to oversee reforms.</TE>
<TE>   * An agreement with the SEC on how to handle the problems that
plagued Andersen's Houston office.</TE>
<TE>   * Other discipline, such as the firing of anyone associated with
the document destruction "or whose failure of oversight and
negligence made that destruction possible."</TE>
<TE>   Richard J. Favretto, the Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw attorney who
signed the letter on behalf of Andersen, asked that senior Justice
Department officials meet with Andersen one more time "before
deciding to impose the death penalty on the firm."</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen collapses, its ability to fund settlements with Enron
investors, employees and the SEC would diminish substantially. The
firm has offered to pay $750 million to pay such claims, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Andersen is losing big-name clients daily. On Wednesday,
consumer finance lender Household International Inc. joined the
growing list of defectors, citing the "uncertainty about the future
direction" of Andersen. If Andersen is indicted, more clients are
certain to bolt.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment also could disrupt financial markets by potentially
delaying or distracting Andersen from completing its auditing work
for remaining clients, one analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "The financial markets have demonstrated over and over again that
they are so skittish about any kind of accounting issues," said Mark
Cheffers, chief of the AccountingMalpractice.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even if Andersen manages to stop the flight of clients, a guilty
plea would have prevented it from reviewing the books of its
remaining customers. SEC rules provide that anyone convicted of a
crime of "moral turpitude" is to be suspended from practicing
business before the commission, which includes signing off on the
audits of public companies.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials noted that such a penalty is not necessarily
automatic and may be waived under a plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the SEC officially censured Andersen last year
for its handling of Waste Management's books and may be less willing
to let the accounting firm escape a harsher punishment in the Enron
case.</TE>
<TE>   One option for Andersen would be to persuade prosecutors to press
charges against individual employees, rather than the company itself.
Andersen has admitted that senior executives ordered the destruction
of Enron-related documents. The firm has shared the results of its
internal investigation with prosecutors but has not released it
publicly.</TE>

Washington. Times staff writers Robert L. Jackson and Josh Meyer in

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With seven tattoos adorning his body, Jerry Dupree is USC's
Illustrated Man.</LD>
<LD>   None of the artwork tells the full story for the Trojans, however.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tale about Dupree and teammate Desmon Farmer throwing a
joint coming-out party for themselves at Staples Center last week, a
get-together that did more than pull them out of their respective
funks and massage their damaged psyches.</LD>
<TE>   Their performances in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament as
emotional sparkplugs also lengthened USC's bench, a key component for
success in the NCAA tournament, which begins today for the
18th-ranked Trojans with a South Regional game against North Carolina
Wilmington in Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're a lot deeper now because we've got D-Farm finally
playing like he should have been all year," All-American forward Sam
Clancy said. "And Jerry, same thing with him too. Those guys are
finally starting to step up and do what coach wants them to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes us a real good team because [opposing teams] can't just
focus on just me or someone else because now we've got other guys
coming off the bench who are providing too."</TE>
<TE>   During USC's run to the Elite Eight last year, the Trojans got an
average of 22.3 minutes off the bench in four NCAA tournament games.</TE>
<TE>   In last week's Pac-10 tournament, in which USC advanced to the
title game against Arizona, the USC bench contributed 49.3 minutes
per game. And that was with Dupree starting twice.</TE>
<TE>   "They've really helped us and Desmon Farmer should have probably
been all-tournament the way he played," Coach Henry Bibby said. "He
won those games for us. The bench won those games for us. They
stepped in and gave us a whole different look."</TE>
<TE>   Despite coming off the bench, Farmer was USC's second-leading
scorer in the tournament, averaging 17.0 points in 26.7 minutes. He
was more electric than erratic in making 58.1% of his shots, 40% (six
of 15) of his three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   This was even more impressive after he averaged 7.5 points in
conference games.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, meanwhile, averaged 10.3 points and blocked a team-high
six shots while shooting 73.7% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   He was averaging 3.0 points before the league tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We're real deep now," Farmer said. "Last year, we only went six
or seven deep. This year, we're up to about nine players."</TE>
<TE>   With Bibby figuring to start Dupree today and Farmer one of the
first off the bench, USC also has viable substitute options in
Derrick Craven, Robert Hutchinson and Rory O'Neil, who should see
more time today against the half-court-oriented Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the emergence of the high-flying Dupree and Farmer that
makes USC such a different team.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives us another great shot-blocker," Bibby said of Dupree.
"We struggle a little offensively with Jerry because he's [still]
kind of learning what we're doing, but defensively he just adds
another dimension to us.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons I didn't play him as much the second half [of
the tournament title game against Arizona] is because we needed to
run [offensive] stuff and he wasn't really running what we wanted to
run and I had to go to guys that were running the offense for us.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get to the best teams, you have to execute your offense.
You can't just go out and run and play and outjump people. You have
to have a game plan, you have to stick to that game plan and you have
to execute."</TE>
<TE>   There were times this year when it looked as though Bibby was
ready to execute both Dupree and Farmer, what with them often being
lost in practice and in half-court sets and looking uninterested
during team huddles. Dupree was, after all, kicked out of a team film
session two weeks ago after skipping an optional shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   But that all changed last week, along with the face of the Trojans
entering the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been riches to rags to riches," said Dupree, who started the
Trojans' first three games of the year before entering Bibby's
perpetually occupied doghouse, a stay that included a two-minute
outing at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "But I guess everything was meant to happen for a reason."</TE>
<TE>   USC assistant coach Damon Archibald confirmed Wednesday that he
had been contacted in an unofficial capacity regarding the head
coaching vacancy at Boise State, his alma mater, and fellow assistant
Kurtis Townsend also said that he has an interest in the Long Beach
State job. But both said their immediate concerns were with the
Trojans and would not actively pursue other jobs while USC is still
playing ....USC moved to a different hotel for the second year in a
row during the NCAA tournament. The Trojans, who were staying at a
Holiday Inn, set up shop at a Doubletree Inn on Wednesday. Bibby said
he didn't make the switch out of superstition. "Two elevators weren't
working and with more people coming in I wanted to get out. Same
thing as last year," he said.</TE>

<HD>Glaus, Spiezio and Sele Are on Watson's List</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus is virtually certain to be suspended for several
regular-season games, and Scott Spiezio and Aaron Sele could be, for
their roles in Saturday's brawls between the Angels and San Diego
Padres.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Watson, baseball's dean of discipline, met Wednesday with
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia and General Manager Bill Stoneman and
viewed video footage of the incidents with them. Watson met with San
Diego Manager Bruce Bochy and General Manager Kevin Towers Tuesday
and got the Padres' video of the fights.</LD>
<LD>   Watson said he plans to meet with involved players from each team
today. He said he would announce suspensions and fines "in a timely
manner" but has no timetable for ending his investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Sele was not among the six players ejected Saturday, but Watson
said a player need not be ejected to be suspended. Sele hit  Ryan
Klesko, prompting him to charge the mound and trigger the first
brawl. Klesko and teammate Phil Nevin said that Sele promised last
year to hit Klesko in retaliation for perceived showboating after a
home run, a charge Sele denied.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing at a batter intentionally is cause for suspension, and
Watson could suspend Sele if he believes Klesko and Nevin.</TE>
<TE>   Charging the mound also is cause for suspension. After Sele hit
Klesko, San Diego pitcher Bobby Jones nearly hit Glaus, prompting him
to charge the mound and trigger another brawl. Klesko faces an
additional penalty for returning to the field for the second
fight--in street clothes--after being ejected following the first
one.</TE>
<TE>   "We will ask him the question why," Watson said, "but I don't
think there's any good answer."</TE>
<TE>   The Padres want Spiezio severely punished for wildly throwing
punches, one of which connected with the face of San Diego coach Tim
Flannery. The Padres also want Watson to review whether Spiezio
kicked anyone. "Whoever said I did is seeing things or lying,"
Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels want Jones severely punished, for admitting to a
retaliatory pitch and for throwing a fastball that sailed near Glaus'
head. The Angels also want Watson to review a skirmish in which San
Diego's Ron Gant yanked the shirt off the Angels' Shawn Wooten.</TE>
<TE>   Said Watson: "There were allegations of kicking. Somebody was
supposedly using hockey tactics by pulling shirts over heads."</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he would stagger suspensions so that neither team lost
more than one position player at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cook, who has pitched only two innings this spring, has not
appeared in a game in 10 days and could sit out several more days
recovering from a bruised rib cage suffered during one of the
brawls.... The Angels played split-squad games, beating the San
Francisco Giants, 11-10, and losing to the Padres, 11-6....There were
no incidents in the first meeting between the Angels and Padres since
the fights--the Padres sent a JV team to Tempe anyway--but Tim Salmon
left the game after being hit by a pitch. He was diagnosed with a
bruised right knee and is expected to sit out a few days....Starter
Kevin Appier was "bad" by his own admission, giving up five runs in
two innings, walking three and hitting one. In seven innings this
spring, he has given up 12 hits and eight walks and has an 11.57
earned-run average.</TE>

<LD>The accident report on San Diego Padre outfielder Mike Darr's fatal
one-vehicle crash revealed Wednesday that he was legally drunk at the
time.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona Department of Public Safety officials have said since the
early morning Feb. 15 crash on a Phoenix highway that alcohol played
a role in the death of Darr.</LD>
<LD>   Darr's blood-alcohol level was 0.11, which is 0.03 above Arizona's
legal limit and 0.04 shy of classification as a felony. The report
also estimated his vehicle was traveling at the speed limit of 65 mph
when it left the fast lane of Loop 101 and veered onto a gravel
median.</LD>

<TE>   Baseball players showed no interest in owners' proposals for a
luxury tax and vastly increased revenue sharing, offering a far
different view Wednesday night of what the sport's labor contract
should include.</TE>
<TE>   In its first response to plans offered by management on Jan. 9 and
Feb. 26, the players' union declined to accept the owners' luxury-tax
proposal and made only a small change to its revenue-sharing system.</TE>
<TE>   "My expectation is that we'll study this," management negotiator
Bob DuPuy said after the session in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. "Because
of the players still being in Florida and Arizona, and the fact that
the [Players' Assn.] has players at these sessions, my guess is that
we will not resume negotiations until after opening day."</TE>

<LD>Gene Frenette of the Florida Times-Union on the daunting task of
handicapping the NCAA basketball tournament: "There's no fail-proof
method of picking which unheralded school possibly makes a Final Four
run from which No. 1 seed might tank in the second round.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like trying to figure out between Kentucky and UCLA who gets
the Jerry Springer guest spot as Dysfunctional Team of the Year.</LD>

<TE>   "I had a manager one time who told 'em that I had the quickest bat
in baseball," he said. "I looked at him like he was crazy. He said,
'You can get the bat out of the rack and make an out and get it back

<TE>   Discrimination: William C. Rhoden in the New York Times: "You know
the sinking feeling you get when your child comes home in tears
because of not receiving an invitation to a classmate's party? That

<TE>   "There are few noble priorities in life: eliminating poverty,

<HD>Odom Might Need Surgery</HD>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers expect to send Lamar Odom to a specialist to determine
whether his sprained right wrist will require season-ending surgery.
Odom has been on the injured list since Jan. 24. He also has a
sprained right ankle, which would prevent him from playing even if
his wrist were sound.</LD>
<LD>   "If it's not responding, there's a possibility of surgery," Coach
Alvin Gentry said of Odom, who was injured when he fell during the
Clippers' victory Dec. 16 against the Detroit Pistons. "His wrist
hasn't been right since he fell on it."</LD>
<LD>   Odom played several games, then sat out three before returning
Jan. 2. He was far from effective, however, and it was decided later
that month that he should go on the injured list.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette's recovery from two dislocated bones in his right
hand is progressing faster than expected and he might be fit to play
before the end of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, who went on the injured list Feb. 22, had arthroscopic
surgery on his sore left knee in the hope that his knee would mend
faster than his wrist. At present, it appears the Clippers' plan has
worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about Steve Austin here," Gentry said, referring to
the lead character from the old TV series, "The Six Million Dollar
Man."</TE>
<TE>   "There's an outside chance he could be ready .... We talked today
at the shoot-around, though, and I told him, 'If you're supposed to
rehab for 90 minutes, going for three hours isn't going to make it
better twice as fast.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said an earlier prediction that Keyon Dooling would not
play again this season was close to becoming a reality. Dooling
sprained his left ankle Nov. 14 and played only six games before
returning to the injured list March 4.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry is as pleased as anyone that Washington Coach Doug Collins
has landed another NBA gig after the Detroit Pistons let him go
during the 1997-98 season. Gentry took over after Collins was fired
and they remain close friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like he was unappreciated there," Gentry said.
"He's a really passionate guy, an unbelievably loyal guy. There's not
one thing I could need that I couldn't call him up and get."</TE>

<HD>Playoff Spot Is a Little Closer</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers have an easy time against Wizards,
96-75, and pull within a game of Utah for No. 8 in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one phoned Staples Center and demanded a refund because Michael
Jordan wasn't playing Wednesday for the Washington Wizards against
the Clippers. And that's another sign that something special is going
on in Clipperdom this late in the season.</LD>
<LD>   A sellout crowd of 20,282 watched the Clippers wear down and,
ultimately, thump the Jordan-less Wizards, 96-75, as six players
scored 10 points or more. The victory moved the Clippers within one
game of the idle Utah Jazz in the battle for the eighth and final
Western Conference playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the battle isn't for only one precious spot at this
point. The ninth-place Clippers, holders of a season-high four-game
winning streak, also trail the seventh-place Seattle SuperSonics by
two games.</LD>
<TE>   So, if Jordan had to sit out his ninth game because of a bum knee,
the seventh consecutive Staples sellout was pleased enough to watch
Darius Miles soar for acrobatic dunks and Quentin Richardson and Eric
Piatkowski swish jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   The fans also got an eyeful of Michael Olowokandi's new and
improved touch around the basket. Olowokandi led the Clippers with 22
points, less than a week after going for a career-best 30 against the
Chicago Bulls. He also had 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Miles had 12, Richardson and Piatkowski 11 apiece. Elton Brand
scored 19 points and took 15 rebounds, his 45th double-double this
season and his 10th in a row. Jeff McInnis added 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   "All things considered, I like the way we're playing," Clipper
Coach Alvin Gentry said, referring to injuries to guard Keyon Dooling
and forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom. "I think we're playing
well. It's our best basketball considering the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Glancing at the final box score, Brand noticed that six Clippers
scored in double figures and two had double-doubles. "Cool," he said,
handing the sheet of paper back to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very exciting to be playing for something more than just
pride," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Clippers (34-31) can improve in their final 17 games,
Olowokandi said, "Yeah. We stepped up our defense in the fourth
quarter tonight and if we can maintain that intensity throughout the
game, we'll be better. We had turnovers tonight and didn't run back
on defense a few times. If we can correct that, we'll be better."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, this wasn't much of a surprise. After all, take away
M.J. from Washington, and what do you have?</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards (29-35) are just another poor Eastern Conference team.
They can't run, can't defend the post and struggle to score for
stretches that border on painful to watch. In fact, the Wizards with
Jordan were no lock to gain a playoff berth. Without them, they
resemble the same bumbling crew that won only 19 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers beat the Wizards to almost every loose ball in the
first half, outrebounded them, 20-10, and took a 53-38 lead. The
Clippers had 30 points in the paint by halftime to only 20 for
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Clippers helped to make the Wizards look bad by making
22 of 38 shots (57.9%) in the first half. But because nobody in a
Washington uniform could defend them, particularly down low, the
Clippers took full advantage and led by as many as 17 points in the
first half. The Clippers never trailed.</TE>
<TE>   The first home game after a lengthy trip can often be difficult
for a team. The Clippers certainly showed no signs of slowing after
going 3-1 on their recently completed trip to play Milwaukee,
Chicago, Cleveland and Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards simply looked lost early in the first game of a
six-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that Jordan gives Washington a sense of
legitimacy. But he's out indefinitely after undergoing arthroscopic
knee surgery Feb. 27. The Wizards have lost five in a row and seven
of nine while he has been sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Clippers] were tremendous defensively in the first six
minutes of the game, and they knocked us backward and we never
recovered," Washington Coach Doug Collins said. "This team, I am so
impressed with how good they are defensively. ...</TE>
<TE>   "I am just happy for Alvin. He has done a terrific, terrific job."</TE>
<TE>   The best Washington could offer Wednesday was Richard Hamilton, a
crafty small forward with smooth moves around the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton led the Wizards with 21 points, but he isn't the sort of
player to get the fans up on the edge of their seats.</TE>
<TE>   And now the Clippers, with their best record at this point in the
season since 1991-92, are on the edge of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing spectacular," Miles said of the Clippers' game Wednesday.
"Just trying to make the playoffs. We've been back and forth around
.500, but we're playing our best ball now.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I wouldn't call it our absolute best because we don't have
Lamar, Corey and Keyon."</TE>

<HD>Marlin Closer Being Eyed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have expressed interest in Florida closer Antonio
Alfonseca, the 29-year-old right-hander who led the National League
in saves in 2000 but is being shopped by the Marlins this spring.</LD>
<LD>   A trade could hinge on the Dodgers' willingness to deal one of
their young starting pitchers, but General Manager Dan Evans is
reluctant to part with right-hander Eric Gagne or left-hander Odalis
Perez.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonseca, a sinker-ball specialist, has an 18-24 career record,
3.77 earned-run average and 102 saves, 45 of them in 2000, but he is
the third-highest paid player ($3.55 million) on a team looking to
trim its $44-million payroll. The emergence of Braden Looper as a
potential closer also makes Alfonseca expendable.</LD>
<TE>   Florida scouted Gagne, who hasn't allowed an earned run in 12
spring innings, Wednesday against Baltimore. Alfonseca, who had
surgery to repair a herniated disk in October, was scratched from
Wednesday night's game against Atlanta after suffering a minor cut on
his right hand while cleaning a glass Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins would like to add a left-hander to a rotation that
consists of five right-handers, and the Dodgers would like to trade
left-hander Omar Daal, but they would have to eat a large chunk of
Daal's $5-million salary. Outfielders Marquis Grissom and Tom Goodwin
have also been mentioned in trade talks with Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Dodgers have an excess of starting pitchers, Evans
wants to be sure Kevin Brown, who experienced arm stiffness after
Sunday's start, and Andy Ashby have recovered fully from elbow
surgery before making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who inquired about Boston's Ugueth Urbina and the
White Sox's Bob Howry, also must determine whether Alfonseca would be
an upgrade to their potential closer-by-committee of Matt Herges,
Paul Quantrill and Giovanni Carrara.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonseca went 4-4 with a 3.06 ERA and 28 saves in 34
opportunities, but opponents hit .281 against him, the fourth-highest
average among NL relievers. And he has never had what Stats Inc.
calls a "tough save," where a pitcher enters a game with the tying
run on base and records the save.</TE>
<TE>   Herges was roughed up again Wednesday, giving up four runs--three
earned--on five hits and retiring one batter in the seventh inning of
the Dodgers' 6-5 exhibition loss to the Orioles in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla. Herges gave up three runs against the Mets on Monday and has a
14.54 ERA in five spring games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned, because that's two outings in a row like this,"
Herges said. "It's no time to panic, but there's two weeks left [in
spring training], let's turn it around. The positive thing is my arm
feels great, my [surgically repaired left] knee feels great.
[Wednesday] was one of those days where I felt great, and I don't
know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Herges has been experimenting with a cut fastball but decided to
stop it Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When things started happening for me, it was because I kept
things simple; I just used a fastball, curve and changeup," Herges
said. "I don't know if this whole closer thing made me think I have
to be better than I am, but that may be why I felt I needed another
pitch. I love the pitch, but I don't know if now is the time to add
it."</TE>
<TE>   Carrara taught Herges the pitch, and veteran reliever Jesse Orosco
showed him the grip, but Orosco advised Herges not to use it if he
wasn't fully confident in it. The cutter, a Mariano Rivera specialty,
has the appearance of a fastball but breaks away from right-handed
hitters and onto the hands of left-handed hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK to try, but as you get close to the season, you've got to
let it go," Orosco said. "You don't want to get away from pitching
your game, because when you win 20 games the last two years [like
Herges did] you don't need to mess around that much."</TE>
<TE>   Though Brown suffered a slight setback this week, he threw a
vigorous bullpen session Wednesday morning. The ace was scheduled to
pitch today, but he will be pushed back to Friday as long as he comes
out of Wednesday's workout OK.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to err on the side of caution, because we're looking
at the long term, not the short term," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He's
still projected to be our opening-day starter, but if that's not in
our best interests, we won't do it. We're not going to lock ourselves
into something just to prove a point."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gagne gave up one unearned run on two hits against Baltimore,
striking out five and walking none. Goodwin, Grissom and Phil Hiatt
each had two hits for the Dodgers.... Second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek experienced stiffness in his right hamstring but said it
was "nothing major" and shouldn't prevent him from playing today.</TE>

<HD>Cullen Making a Gigantic Leap</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Center scores two goals for third time this season
as Ducks beat Penguins, 4-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His quirky leap into the glass Wednesday aside, there is much that
center Matt Cullen can feel good about as another Mighty Duck season
meanders toward a merciful finish.</LD>
<LD>   Cullen's abilities on the ice--which are far greater than his
ability to leap off the ice--are being demonstrated over the long
haul. His two-goal game in the Ducks' 4-2 victory over the Pittsburgh
Penguins is another example.</LD>
<LD>   This was the third two-goal game of the season for Cullen, two of
which have been against the Penguins. His first goal, which gave the
Ducks a 1-0 lead, was followed by a boyish leap into the boards. His
second, which broke a 1-1 tie with 39.5 seconds left in the first
period, quieted the large Penguin segment in an announced crowd of
12,536 at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   This was definite progress. After all, Cullen had only two goals
in the Ducks' final 42 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've taken a different mind-set this season. I've been
attacking more," Cullen said. "But part of it is I feel I have a
little something to prove. A lot of people said I faded down the
stretch last year."</TE>
<TE>   His two goals put a rare Duck game in motion.</TE>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei scored his first goal since Nov. 14, a span of 48
games. Steve Rucchin scored his first since returning from a 44-game
absence due to a stress fracture in his ankle. Timo Parssinen,
playing with a broken bone in his right wrist, had two assists.</TE>
<TE>   True this came against an injury-plagued Penguin team that is
4-9-1-2 in its last 16 games. But there have been few of these games
for the Ducks, who have won 10 of 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It wears on all of us," Murray said. "I don't like the fact that
we only have [57] points and we're not going to be in playoffs at
this point in time."</TE>
<TE>   Things haven't always been rosy for Cullen. In December, he was
benched for three games. In January, his name was included on a list
of Duck players available for trades.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with 14 goals in the 35 games since returning from his
three-game benching, Cullen can pretty much count on maintaining this
zip code.</TE>
<TE>   With 18 goals this season, he can expect a boost in pay from the
$484,000 he is making this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring 20 goals would mean a lot this year," Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   That shouldn't be a problem, if his two goals Wednesday are
indications.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen picked up a loose puck at center ice, danced around two
Penguins at the blue line, then used defenseman Billy Tibbetts to
give the Ducks a 1-0 lead 15 minutes into the first period.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks found themselves in a bind up front Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Center Samuel Pahlsson was too sick to play. Right wing Timo
Parssinen was discovered to have a broken bone in his right wrist.
Right wing Jonas Ronnqvist had been shipped back to minor league
Cincinnati on Monday. That left the Ducks with a hole at forward.</LD>
<LD>   So Parssinen, who learned of his broken wrist late Monday, was
pressed into service against Pittsburgh. He played despite the
injury, which occurred against Ottawa on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I really can't shoot pretty much at all, otherwise it's pretty
good," Parssinen said Wednesday morning. "I can pass and handle the
puck a little bit. Shooting is the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Parssinen's shooting ability looked just fine in the first period.
He had a quality attempt from the slot four minutes in, then assisted
on Matt Cullen's goal with 39.5 seconds left in the period.</TE>
<TE>   It was Parssinen's second assist in 11 games with the Ducks this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can show what I can do, even with the wrist," Parssinen
said.</TE>

<HD>Murray Looks Ahead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray came up with a positive spin on Bryan
Smolinski's goal-scoring drought, which at 18 games is the longest of
his career.</LD>
<LD>   "He's been a fairly consistent 20-goal scorer in his career,"
Murray said of his second-line center, who averaged more than 22
goals in his first eight NHL seasons. "He's got 12 now, so I'm
looking forward to the next 16 games because, based on his past, he
should score eight more goals.</LD>
<LD>   "What he's done is, he's just put them off until the end of the
season. That's the way I'd like to look at it, and that's the way I
want him to look at it because it doesn't help him to look back. He's
got to look ahead."</LD>
<TE>   Smolinski last scored a goal Jan. 17 against the Buffalo Sabres.
Steve Heinze, who last scored Jan. 15, has gone 19 games without a
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, recovering from post-concussion syndrome and other
injuries suffered in a Feb. 15 auto accident, has been ordered off
his skates and out of his car by team physician Michael Mellman. The
coach watched Wednesday's practice from a perch above the west end of
the Kings' training rink in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want me out there because of the head [injury],"
Murray said. "When you have a concussion, if you have another blow to
the head--from getting hit, or a puck--it could be fatal. That's what
they tell me."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said Mellman also told him he should not be driving.</TE>

Palffy--have combined for 37 points, nearly one-fourth of their
season total, in eight games since the Olympic break.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>West Prepared to Go Elsewhere</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not yet two years since resigning under the strain of operating an
NBA organization, Jerry West is prepared to leave Los Angeles and his
reduced role with the Lakers for a general manager-type position
elsewhere in the league, according to those close to him.</LD>
<LD>   West, who will be 64 in May, has served his successor, Mitch
Kupchak, as a $1 million-a-year consultant since the summer of 2001,
after the first of consecutive NBA titles for the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   While rumors of him jumping to one of several organizations
followed him through his semi-retirement, West maintained that he was
not emotionally ready for the trials of building a franchise and then
living with the nightly result.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, according to friends, he began to talk of returning to
the challenge of it, however, and the frequent telephone calls from
other franchises have grown more serious.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry's going to be talking to people," a friend said. "If the
situation presents itself, he's going to run a team again."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Hawks, Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks,
among others, seem likely or possible suitors, though only the Hawks
are confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   One source said a meeting between Hawk President Stan Kasten and
West was imminent, though another denied it. Agreed upon, however,
was that a recharged West would all but have his pick of NBA jobs.</TE>
<TE>   West on Wednesday evening resisted the notion he is on the verge
of a comeback, though without the authority of previous conversations
on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   He loathes the publicity his perceived availability sometimes
draws, and the frequency with which his name is linked to jobs not
vacant.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone who's competitive, and I think of myself as
competitive, sometimes gets the urge," West said. "For me, it can go
away. I'm not actively looking for anything.</TE>
<TE>   "If I feel like working, then I'll work. But I've got a great
situation. It's not something I'd be willing to jeopardize. My
well-being is more important to me than another job."</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Surgery No Certainty</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Doctor calls it a worst-case scenario after
options, including new footwear, are exhausted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the trial and intrigue phase of Laker center Shaquille O'Neal's
fragile right big toe, the prospect of human error hardly arose.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal sat Wednesday in a Philadelphia Warrior jersey with Wilt
Chamberlain's No. 13 on it, sheepish that his offensive contribution
to a 41-point win over the Charlotte Hornets the night before was
nine points in 26 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson was forced to rest O'Neal after his center
complained his pain was more acute than usual, despite Monday's day
off.</LD>
<TE>   "I forgot my medication," said O'Neal, who is on a steady
anti-inflammatory prescription. "I forgot to take it and I was
struggling [Tuesday] night. Won't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   In the throes of that raw ache, O'Neal said he was fairly certain
he would submit to the postseason surgery he hoped would dull the
pain in the arthritic toe, stricken with what doctors call hallux
limitus, and restore his mobility. And while there are a handful of
procedures that could eventually relieve O'Neal of his digital woes,
his podiatrist, Dr. Robert Mohr, said Wednesday that predictions of
surgery were premature.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as the Lakers packed for their one-day trip to play the
Golden State Warriors, O'Neal awaited the arrival of representatives
from his shoe company, Starter, who would deliver another modified
sneaker. New orthotics were expected soon, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I really am confident that it's going to make a big improvement
in his comfort level," said Mohr, the chief of podiatric surgery at
UCLA Medical Center. "So, surgery may not be the answer. I understand
where he's coming from. He just wants this pain to stop. He
understands there are surgical options that will eliminate his pain.
I'm sure that sounds pretty attractive right now, because he's
hurting. But if we could stop him from hurting, non-surgically, I'm
sure he'd be overjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could get him pain-free, and allow him to play the rest of
his career without any surgery, that would be wonderful. That's our
goal first."</TE>
<TE>   Mohr said he would like a resolution quickly; for one thing, the
playoffs begin in five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain things just take time," he said. "Shoe development takes
time. Believe me, I have to tell you, the people who are making his
shoes could not be more cooperative. I'm working directly with their
design people. But Shaq's needs are a lot different than yours or
mine. This is his career here. So, it's extremely important."</TE>
<TE>   That said, there are a few procedures that could help O'Neal, the
least drastic of which could have him back by next training camp.</TE>
<TE>   In the best scenario for the Lakers and O'Neal, the surgery would
amount to a cleanup around the joint and require only four to six
weeks for the primary healing, according to Mohr.</TE>
<TE>   In the worst, doctors would shave the cartilage from the bone and
insert screws across the joint that would promote fusing. He would be
on crutches for at least two months, and not be on a basketball court
for three or four months "Surgery, especially these more drastic
procedures, are salvage procedures," Mohr said. "Once the joint is
fused, nothing else can be done for it. If all we need to do is clean
up the joint, that may buy him a number of years, and then later on
he may require a joint fusion or another procedure."</TE>
<TE>   There are other surgical possibilities, Mohr said, but he could
not predict where O'Neal's treatment would lead, particularly not if
surgery were required.</TE>
<TE>   "These are conditions where, with all the scans and all the
X-rays, there's really no way to determine exactly what the condition
of the cartilage is prior to looking at it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Webber Carries Kings Despite Finger Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber doesn't know if he'll play the next two games. His
teammates are glad he finished this one.</LD>
<LD>   Webber, playing with a dislocated right index finger, had 22
points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sacramento Kings to a 92-88
victory over the 76ers on Wednesday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "It was bad," said Webber, injured diving for a loose ball. "I
don't know if I'll be able to play against New York and Toronto. What
we did tonight is what Philly is known for, playing through injuries.
That's what we're trying to be known for."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings won their fourth in a row and improved the NBA's best
record to 46-17.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was hurt at the end of the first quarter, but returned
midway through the second. The injury seemed to affect his shooting.
He missed 11 of 13 shots in one span before scoring 11 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 32 points for the 76ers, who had won four in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about moral victories," said Iverson, who was seven
for 10 in the first quarter, but missed 15 of his last 21 shots.
"We're a better team than those guys. We had it and gave it away."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia's Derrick Coleman had to be restrained from going
after Webber afterward. Both players got technical fouls with 32
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "He's from Detroit, man," said Webber, a fellow Michigan native
who has known Coleman since he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 96, Minnesota 95--Steve Francis scored 21 points,
including the game-winning free throw with 9.7 seconds left at
Minneapolis, as the Rockets closed the game with a 19-7 run to send
the Timberwolves to their fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey Billups led the Timberwolves with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 119, Phoenix 114--Troy Hudson had a career-high 34 points
and Tracy McGrady scored all 10 of the Magic's points in overtime at
Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady finished with 35 points, going four for six from the field
and two for four from the foul line in overtime. He also had eight
rebounds, eight assists, three steals and two blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Suns were led by Stephon Marbury with 31 points and 10 assists</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 97 New Jersey 89--Paul Pierce scored 23 of his 32 points in
the second half, making six three-pointers to help pull the Celtics
within three games of the Eastern Conference-leading Nets at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker added 30 as Boston won its sixth in a row. New
Jersey lost its seventh consecutive road game.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd had 23 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists for the
Nets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 85, Cleveland 84--Corliss Williamson scored 11 of his 16
points in the fourth quarter as the Pistons overcame the absence of
Jerry Stackhouse at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse was sidelined by nagging shoulder and hip problems.</TE>
<TE>   Chucky Atkins led the Pistons with 19 points. Andre Miller had 16
points for the Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 105, Denver 102--Jason Terry scored 31 points as the Hawks
earned their 12th consecutive home victory over the Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle SuperSonic Coach Nate McMillan and forward Rashard Lewis
were fined $7,500 apiece by the NBA for their actions after a recent
loss to the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   The league also fined New Jersey Net Coach Byron Scott $7,500 for
publicly criticizing officials after a 96-90 loss at Seattle last
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   McMillan was fined for publicly criticizing officials, and Lewis
for verbally abusing officials and failing to leave the court fast
enough after the SuperSonics' 119-108 loss at Dallas on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Officials Will Tuck Into Rule</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Among subjects to be discussed at NFL
meetings will be controversial call in Patriot-Raider game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "tuck rule" will be a subject of discussion at next week's NFL
meetings, although that's of little consolation to the Oakland
Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   Their playoff loss at New England hinged on a play that was
initially ruled a fumble by quarterback Tom Brady, then was
overturned after a replay review. Brady was saved by the tuck rule,
which says a quarterback who stops in the act of throwing can only be
said to have fumbled if the ball is completely tucked into his body.</LD>
<LD>   "We think about [the play] every day," Raider executive Bruce
Allen said. "It was a fumble."</LD>
<TE>   Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay, chairman of the league's
competition committee, said in a conference call Wednesday that the
rule will be discussed but change is not in the offing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even close to a consensus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings, which begin Sunday at Orlando, Fla., will be
attended by owners, general managers and coaches--except Tampa Bay's
Jon Gruden (busy assembling his coaching staff) and San Diego's Marty
Schottenheimer (scouting players).</TE>
<TE>   Among the other issues to be examined:</TE>
<TE>   * Sportsmanship, the focal point of the meetings last spring,
again will be emphasized because of a rash of unnecessary roughness
penalties. McKay said the league has done a much better job enforcing
rules that protect the quarterback. Only 41 quarterbacks were injured
last season, down from 86 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * The league plans to crack down on music and artificial crowd
noise piped through stadium speakers when the visiting offense is in
the huddle. The practice will be outlawed when the visiting team has
the ball and the clock is running.</TE>
<TE>   * Instant replay will be discussed, but only minor changes such as
making sure officials immediately put a halt to the action when a
play is challenged. It was a delayed response that triggered the
crowd's bottle-throwing reaction during a game at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Although there will be no Super Bowls awarded at these meetings,
the subject of staging future Super Bowls in New York and Washington
will be discussed. Currently, the league rule mandates the average
January temperature for a host city must be 50 degrees or warmer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two schools of thought about that," said Joe Browne,
one of the league's senior vice presidents. "Either we change that
[50-degree rule] or we consider Washington and New York separately."</TE>

<HD>Hearst Stays With 49ers for $20 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running back Garrison Hearst agreed Wednesday to a $20-million,
six-year contract to remain with the San Francisco 49ers.</LD>
<LD>   Hearst, 31, rushed for 1,206 yards in an amazing return to the NFL
last season after sitting out the previous two years because of
complications from a broken ankle.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers never released Hearst after his injury in a January 1999
playoff game, and Hearst acknowledged their loyalty by returning
despite interest from several teams.</LD>
<TE>   "I consider myself a 49er, and this means I'll probably finish my
career there, which is a great thing," Hearst said. "The team
supported me through some tough times. They've been very good to me,
and I'm thrilled to be able to stay."</TE>
<TE>   In a comeback that surprised almost everyone, Hearst was the NFL's
10th-leading rusher last season, with four 100-yard games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Callahan, promoted from offensive coordinator to coach by the
Oakland Raiders, said he doesn't plan to change much of the system
Jon Gruden presided over during the last four years as Raider coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Jon and I are very similar in a lot of respects--our work ethic,
our intensity," said Callahan, who has never been a head coach at any
level. "The system itself will not change. The day-to-day functions
will not change."</TE>
<TE>   As a sign of who holds the real power on the Raiders, team owner
Al Davis sat on a silver and black armchair--which looked very much
like a throne--during the news conference announcing Callahan's
promotion. Callahan sat on a black and white folding chair.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan defensive tackle Josh Evans will be suspended
indefinitely by the NFL for his fourth violation of the league's
substance abuse policy, a league source said</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent guard Larry Moore, who lost his starting job last
season with the Indianapolis Colts, was signed by the Washington
Redskins.... Free-agent linebacker Brad Jackson signed with the
Carolina Panthers.... Jacksonville re-signed center John Wade....

<LD>   The win ended a three-game losing streak for the Blues, who are
fighting to maintain their playoff position in the Western
Conference. They were the only team without a win after the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Brent Johnson stopped 18 shots in his fifth shutout of the season
for St. Louis, still playing without top forwards Keith Tkachuk and
Doug Weight.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Edmonton 3--Chris Chelios' goal four minutes into
overtime gave the Red Wings a victory at Detroit. The win was the
ninth in 10 games for Detroit.</TE>

<TE>   Boston 3, New York Rangers 1--Byron Dafoe made 33 saves at Boston
as the Bruins moved into second place in the East.</TE>
<TE>   New York right wing Radek Dvorak is out for the season after
colliding with Boston's Gord Murphy in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Florida 3--Jason Wiemer and Pavel Bure scored 45
seconds apart in the third period as the Panthers rallied at Sunrise,
Fla.</TE>

<TE>   New Jersey 3, New York Islanders 2--Brian Gionta and Jim McKenzie
scored early on consecutive shots and Martin Brodeur held off the
Islanders at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>

<LD>The games will be on at Michael Jordan's 23 restaurant and the Top of
the Hill brewery in Chapel Hill, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The patrons, however, will have to find a new rooting interest.</LD>
<LD>   What was long obvious has finally come to pass: The NCAA
tournament begins today without North Carolina for the first time
since 1974, ending the longest streak in NCAA history at 27 years.</LD>
<TE>   The state of North Carolina is doing fine with six teams in the
field. That ties the record held by California--reached three times,
including this season--and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the new Four Corners, even if the geography isn't exact.</TE>
<TE>   From North Carolina Wilmington on the coast--USC's first-round
opponent today--to the metropolis of Charlotte and nearby Davidson
College to the Piedmont homes of Wake Forest, North Carolina State
and Duke, the Tar Heel State is in the tournament, even if the Tar
Heels aren't.</TE>
<TE>   Duke is more of a national phenomenon, sometimes considered to be
in North Carolina but not of it. There are only two players from the
state on Duke's roster--both walk-ons, and more North Carolina alumni
in Durham County than Duke alumni in the state.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State won the 1974 championship with David Thompson
and the 1983 title on the famous last-second dunk by Lorenzo Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest gave us/is responsible for Billy Packer, who played on
the 1962 Final Four team.</TE>
<TE>   But many people don't realize all the history at Charlotte and
Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte made the Final Four in 1977 with Cedric "Cornbread"
Maxwell, losing to eventual champion Marquette on Jerome Whitehead's
game-winning shot in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson twice reached the Elite Eight when Lefty Driesell was
coach--only to lose each time to North Carolina, later his rival when
he became Maryland's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Driesell was on a bus headed for a National Invitation Tournament
game with his Georgia State team this week, but stopped to recall
1968 and '69.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time, they beat us but it was a close game, and we had
some key players out.</TE>
<TE>   "The next year, the game was at Cole Field House. We were up one,
holding the ball, and they called a charge. Then they hit a shot to
win it. Charlie Scott hit what would have been a three-pointer today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a North Carolina fan, but whether it's North Carolina,
Maryland, South Carolina, if you're No. 1 in anything, people are
shooting at you. They've been No. 1 so long with the program that
Dean [Smith] built."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selection Process Needs Reform</TE>
<TE>   Butler and Bowling Green--those snubbed mid-majors--meet tonight
in the NIT.</TE>
<TE>   The nickname "Not In Tournament" was never more apt.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga begins its NCAA road as a No. 6-seeded team--one that
could meet Arizona in a second-round game between teams ranked in the
top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Holland and Carroll Williams are two former NCAA selection
committee members who have sat in that room.</TE>
<TE>   They have stared at RPIs until their eyes drooped.</TE>
<TE>   They agree on two things:</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA selection committee has a hard job.</TE>
<TE>   And there are serious shortcomings with the system.</TE>
<TE>   "I can honestly say, you cannot walk out of that room and say you
picked the best 64 teams," said Holland, the former Virginia coach
and athletic director who was on the committee for six years in the
1990s. "You can only say you did your best."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the so-called mid-majors, the NCAA is not doing
well enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They present a problem because it's not a fair RPI," Williams
said, citing the drag a conference such as the West Coast puts on a
team's RPI, and the contrasting boost a team from a league such as
the Big East gets.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one thing we'd say: You can't do much about your family.
You don't like your family, you're stuck with them. But your friends
are who you choose. Gonzaga certainly did everything the committee
asked."</TE>
<TE>   It's no great surprise Williams feels that way. He coached at
Santa Clara for 22 seasons, taking the Broncos to the tournament in
1987, and served on the committee for five years, ending last season
after he retired as athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   What might surprise you is that Holland's and Williams'
convictions cross the lines of their presumed major/mid-major
loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   Williams wouldn't have argued for a No. 3 for Gonzaga, as some
have.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably would have felt they might have been a fifth seed," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And Holland--brace yourself--is ready to consider limiting the
number of teams from one conference.</TE>
<TE>   He heard Dick Vitale suggest limiting leagues to five teams, and
the more he thought about it, the less outrageous it sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We're grasping at straws for some kind of line in the sand, but
if the committee determines that, I can't honestly say I believe the
sixth-place team in a league has earned a shot at the national
championship," Holland said.</TE>
<TE>   He says that even though some didn't think his 1984 Virginia team
should have made it, and the Cavaliers went all the way to the Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   And as a committee member, he noticed something about the
mid-majors.</TE>
<TE>   "The teams we thought were really a stretch to give them a chance
often seemed to do well, and certainly added a lot more flavor to
things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue that has arisen is the role of conference
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga Coach Mark Few might have sounded petulant when he said
his team had nothing to gain by playing in the WCC tournament, but he
was right.</TE>
<TE>   And when the selection committee admitted it decided the No. 1
seedings without waiting to see if Oklahoma beat Kansas in the Big 12
title game, it sent another message about conference tournaments.
(Why was a loss in the Big 12 title game just another game, and
Butler's quarterfinal loss in the Horizon League a knell?)</TE>
<TE>   Holland tossed out an idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd almost like to see something like saying you can't have a No.
1 seed unless you won your conference tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Holland sees too much potential for a team not to try
its hardest to win, instead conserving energy for the next week.</TE>
<TE>   Off the cuff, he said maybe the top four seedings in each region
should go to tournament winners.</TE>
<TE>   "If you knew the only way to get even a top 16 seed was to win
your tournament, that would keep you pretty motivated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much motivation not to take them seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem remains evaluating teams from conferences
other than the big six football conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Some people talk about a nonconference-only RPI.</TE>
<TE>   "But the numbers are too small," Holland said. "They tend to be
skewered by one or two results."</TE>
<TE>   The answer seems to be for more committee members to see more
games--especially in those difficult-to-evaluate leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you see Bowling Green play? They're not on television,"
Williams said. "And each committee member has another job."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the answers seem to be more mandatory tape-viewings, and
more judgment calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to make a scientific process out of a very
nonscientific competition," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, one last thing about Williams and Holland.</TE>
<TE>   Both of them figured Butler--a team that beat Wake Forest in the
first round last year--was in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wooden Award Intrigue</TE>
<TE>   Jason Williams' status as a runaway favorite for the Wooden Award
as national player of the year slipped a little this week.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't even player of the year in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The award, selected by the media, went to Maryland's Juan Dixon,
who led the Terrapins to the regular-season championship.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, first on 41 of 84 ballots, averaged 19.3 points and led the
ACC in steals at 2.7 a game and free-throw shooting at 90.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, first on 38 ballots, led the league in scoring at 21.7
points a game, was sixth in assists at 5.38, fourth in three-point
percentage at 38.4%--and well down the list in free-throw shooting at
67.9%.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected to win it," Dixon said. "There are so many guys
out there, and everyone always said it was going to go to Jason
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Either one of us could have won it....If Duke would have won the
league, maybe he would have won the award."</TE>
<TE>   The vote was taken before Maryland was upset by North Carolina
State in the ACC tournament, won by Duke for the fourth consecutive
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Juan Dixon," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski. "He's just a
terrific player. Competing against him for the last four years, I've
found him to be as good and as competitive player as we've played
against. It's a well-earned honor, and I wish him the best."</TE>

<DH>Pepperdine, Wake Forest Getting Up to Speed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>On the eve of his team's first-round NCAA tournament game against
Pepperdine, Wake Forest Coach Skip Prosser sounded more prepared for
baseball's opening day.</LD>
<LD>   "I doubt this will be a pitcher's duel," Prosser said. "You know,
a 1-0 game. I think it will be relatively up-tempo."</LD>
<LD>   The Demon Deacons couldn't stop talking about athletes.</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine has lots of them. Wake Forest's best one is hurting.</TE>
<TE>   "They really harken to mind Arkansas in terms of how athletic they
are," Prosser said. "Although I think their post guys are better than
Arkansas' post guys. I think that we have problems when we throw the
ball to the other team and they're the kind of team that can take the
basketball away from you. So I think it behooves us to take care of
the ball because when we take care of the ball we score a lot of
baskets. And they score a lot of baskets."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal was of the same mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team is quick and versatile," he said. "Our strength is our
aggressiveness. Early in the year, we were more a three-point team.
Since mid-December, we've been more balanced and versatile."</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest junior forward Josh Howard, the team's second-leading
scorer and rebounder and its most athletic player, is still bothered
by a high left ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not practice yesterday," Prosser said. "We'll see how he
runs around [Wednesday] afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a game that really lends itself well to Josh's abilities,
because it should be an open-court game. Lacking Josh Howard and
Steve Lepore [a backup guard who ruptured the tendon in his left knee
in the ACC tournament], that really limits our options. Especially on
the perimeter."</TE>
<TE>   The Waves are more concerned with Wake Forest's inside game,
especially when it comes to rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   "Wake Forest looks really tough on the boards," guard Craig Lewis
said. "The key will be for us to crash the boards. We know they have
a powerful rebounding team."</TE>
<TE>   The Deacons outrebounded opponents by an average of three a game.
Pepperdine was outrebounded by an average of 39.4 to 37.9, but in
their eight losses, the Waves were outrebounded by 11.4 per game.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest is the No. 7 seed and Pepperdine is the No. 10 seed.
Wake Forest knows all too well that the seedings won't matter once
play begins. As the No. 7 seed last year, the Demon Deacons lost to
10th-seeded Butler in the opening round of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual statistic, Pepperdine's Cedric Suitt had as many
blocked shots (92) as points.</TE>
<TE>   "I take pride in guarding my man and stopping anybody else who
comes to the basket," the 6-foot-11 senior said. "I don't feel the
need to go out and score. We have five guys on the team who average
double figures [in points]."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect Darius Songaila, Wake Forest's leading scorer, to be
intimidated.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to attack," he said. "You can't back off, you can't back
down. If you're gonna be scared, thinking about if the other guy is
gonna block your shot every time you go up there, then that's what's
gonna happen."</TE>
<TE>   After traveling to Buffalo for its NCAA tournament appearances in
2000, Pepperdine got to stay closer to Malibu this time.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest had to make the cross-country trip, to a state that
has not been kind to it. The Demon Deacons have lost their last three
games in California.</TE>
<TE>   But Pepperdine never has beaten a team from the Atlantic Coast
Conference in 11 tries.</TE>

<HD>USC Run Could Take Bibby Out of Town</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Contrary to the preachings of the nerd who runs your office pool, the
lucky number for the USC basketball team this month is not a Sweet 16
or an Elite Eight or even a Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   It's a Fabulous Five.</LD>
<LD>   That's the number of years on the standard secure college
basketball coaching contract.</LD>
<TE>   That's two more years than USC Coach Henry Bibby has on his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   That means the Trojans are playing with fire.</TE>
<TE>   Today at Arco Arena marks not only the beginning of what could be
his finest USC moments, but also his final USC moments.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan officials, who took a chance on Bibby six years ago when
nobody would touch him, say they will take care of him.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, who says he is forever grateful for that chance, says he
has no worries.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to both parties say an extension is in the works and
will be signed after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody is happy. Everybody loves everybody. Occasionally, Bibby
even smiles.</TE>
<TE>   But now come an event that changes coaching careers at the drop of
a Cinderella.</TE>
<TE>   In today's first round, I have USC beating NC Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's second round, I have USC beating Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday morning, I have left the third round blank.</TE>
<TE>   That is when the Trojans could play top-ranked Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The same team they scared last season before losing by 10 points
in a regional final played on one day's rest.</TE>
<TE>   A team they could be playing, this time, on four days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   A team that they will have played three times in three years,
making the Blue Devils no more intimidating than a red-faced Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are one of the few teams in the tournament that can
beat Duke. And do you know what happens to Henry Bibby if they beat
Duke?</TE>
<TE>   Florida State happens.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles, looking for a coach, could promise lots of money
and more chances to play, well, Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Or, DePaul happens.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Demons, also looking for a coach, would love to have a
former NBA star recruiting the Chicago playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Or, maybe a top NBA top assistant coaching job happens, returning
Bibby to his first love.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of things could happen to Bibby if the Trojans beat Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Heck, lots of thing could happen if they make the Sweet 16 for
consecutive years and even get close to Duke.</TE>
<TE>   None of those things are good for USC.</TE>
<TE>   They need to lock up their coach before some March-mad booster at
some distant college decides to unlock his safe.</TE>
<TE>   Said Daryl Gross, associate athletic director: "We're elated with
Henry Bibby."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "I love it here, and don't plan on going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Can we get that on paper?</TE>
<TE>   In six years, Henry Bibby has become like that curmudgeonly gas
station attendant working in the middle of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Losing him would be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a replacement would be harder.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine trying to hire a top coach for a basketball team with no
on-campus gym, with no championships, at a school known for football,
located down the road from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the best of years, a bad situation.</TE>
<TE>   The sort which Bibby loves.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my element, man," he said. "Struggling. Building
something. Being the underdog."</TE>
<TE>   Is there a better fit anywhere?</TE>
<TE>   The hard-luck coach pounds his hard-luck players into believing
they can own the city.</TE>
<TE>   They struggle, he throws them out of practice, they improve. They
get blase, he makes them shoot at 6 a.m. on their day off, and now
they really improve.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day you are watching once-gawky Brian Scalabrine take the
floor for the New Jersey Nets and you're thinking, where did he learn
that?</TE>
<TE>   The next day you are watching once-hesitant Sam Clancy soar to
Pac-10 Player of the Year honors and you're wondering, how did that
happen?</TE>
<TE>   Then, this week, a time when you have traditionally filled the top
of this sports section with stories about UCLA, you find yourself
sitting in a press room at a regional with USC instead.</TE>
<TE>   The first time anyone at the newspaper can remember when the
beginning of March belonged to the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Bibby is like that. He sneaks up on you.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't do that across town. He couldn't do that amid the huge
expectations of a new town.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of Trojan basketball, he can do that forever. His
scowl and their shadow were made for each other.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike [Garrett] took a lot of criticism for hiring Henry, but we
believed in it," said Gross.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism? Gross is assuming anybody was even paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1996, and Charlie Parker had just been canned, and Bibby
was given the job for the last nine games, and remember what he did?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you don't. It was the year after UCLA's national
championship. Nobody in town was watching Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   If they were, they would have seen him suspending his center, and
watching his point guard quit, and benching guys as if he just signed
a lifetime deal.</TE>
<TE>   The contract, of course, was for only those nine games.</TE>
<TE>   All of which he lost.</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for Garrett to make him the permanent boss.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism? If anybody was paying attention, they would have called
for the disbanding of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Here was a guy who had been publicly disowned by his
basketball-star son Mike. A guy who had left his last college job a
decade earlier under the cloud of a recruiting scandal. A guy who
didn't care that his players thought he was a tyrant and the media
thought he was a jerk.</TE>
<TE>   Meet your new coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never forget that Mike Garrett gave me a chance, and
loyalty to that means more to me than money," said Bibby, who
reportedly makes around $500,000, ranking him around the upper-middle
of the Pac-10. "Everybody might say I'm full of bull, but I'm loyal
to him for that chance."</TE>
<TE>   It was, most certainly, a last chance.</TE>
<TE>   But, six years later, he has turned it into the opportunity of a
lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, lost most of the baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble with his son? Henry and Mike, a guard with the Sacramento
Kings, now talk regularly, a fact which has been acknowledged by both
parties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like night and day," said Henry. "It's tremendous. I really
missed it."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting scandal? The Trojan program has been clean and
attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard all the stuff about Coach Bibby, but now, lots of my
buddies from other Pac-10 teams are coming up to me and saying, 'Man,
I'd like to play for you guys,'" said forward Jerry Dupree. "They see
that we get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   Tough on his players?</TE>
<TE>   Well, yeah, the former Bruin is still a bear. But his players are
buying it, even ones like Desmon Farmer, the Midwesterner benched in
front of family and friends during a game at Bradley in Peoria, Ill.,
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach told me what he was doing, and why he was doing it," Farmer
said. "I didn't like it, but it's the past, and I learned from it.
We're cool."</TE>
<TE>   Many thought the most amazing thing about USC basketball last
spring was not that Sam Clancy stayed, but that Henry Bibby stayed.</TE>
<TE>   There was an opening at Nevada-Las Vegas, another perfect fit, but
nobody from there called him.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed a guy with a nice image and no past," said a source,
referring to the Rebels' hiring of Charlie Spoonhour.</TE>
<TE>   With a second consecutive impressive tournament run, renovated
Henry Bibby will be viewed as that sort of guy.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have too much invested to fold now.</TE>

<HD>Boy, What Are the Odds She'd End Up Like This?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I received one of those late-night calls every father dreads from his
daughter.</LD>
<LD>   "Who do you like--Valpo or Kentucky?"</LD>
<LD>   You know how fast they grow up. One day they're crawling, the next
they're walking and before you know it they have their own bookie.</LD>
<TE>   It's an adjustment, and it still takes me by surprise when one of
my kids calls to talk about a nag, and I catch myself telling them to
talk nicer about their mother before I realize they're only studying
the Daily Racing Form.</TE>
<TE>   I'm happy they're doing their homework, of course, because I don't
ever remember them studying as kids, but I wonder now if their
burning curiosity about who might be a first-time Lasix user is a
little misguided.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question the younger daughter is a serious gambler,
because she has everything riding on a grocery store bagger, but it's
the older one who surprises me.</TE>
<TE>   She's an accountant, and yet I still don't mind talking with her.
I realize that's because she has an interest in sports, which keeps
her from being dull, but recently I've noticed she has had questions
about how the weather might affect the over-and-under. I talk about
who might win, and she wants to know what's the point spread?</TE>
<TE>   I'm almost willing to bet I have something to do with this, the
way I raised her, and now I worry she might lose everything and move
back in with us.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly are responsible for your daughter's gambling," said
Joelle Greene, visiting associate professor of psychology at Pomona
College. "You probably took her to games when she was just a kid and
asked her, 'Who do you think is going to win?' and then praised her
when she picked the winning team."</TE>
<TE>   I'm willing to lay 3-1 odds this is one visiting associate
professor of psychology who has never read Page Two, because when I
took the little whippersnapper to games and she didn't pick the
winner, I made fun of her.</TE>
<TE>   "B.S. Skinner," Greene said, and I barely knew the woman and she
was already swearing at me. "No, no, it's B.F. Skinner, and Pavlov's
dog."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't really care whose dog it was, but it seemed pretty
important to her that I knew whose dog it was. "It's Pavlov's dog,"
she said. "You know--psychology 101? You show some reinforcement, and
the behavior is going to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Las Vegas and the slot machines--the intermittent
reinforcement schedule," Greene said, and I think if I talked that
way I'd enter a monastery, take a vow of silence and never annoy
another person. "There's no predictable path--you put the first
nickel in and you might win and that becomes very motivating. You
give your daughter an inside tip, she wins, and you're reinforcing
her behavior."</TE>
<TE>   When I asked the professor if she ever finds herself telling her
own child, like I did my daughter during her formative years: "I
betcha I can throw Barbie farther than you can," she said she has a
3-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't intimidated: "I betcha I can throw Barbie farther than
your son," I said, and she tried changing the subject, starting in on
this theory about "learned helplessness." I told her I'd get back to
her later to talk about the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Now I know some people have a real problem with gambling that
requires professional help, but we're just talking here about little
girls all of a sudden growing up, leaning on the craps table, and
yelling, "Bring it home to Momma!"</TE>
<TE>   How was I supposed to know I was doing something wrong as a young
father when I was telling my kid, "I bet you can't pass first grade."
Hey, if I knew what I know now, I'd have named my dog Pavlov.</TE>
<TE>   All I can do is my best, and so before I took off for Las Vegas to
watch the NCAA tournament in the comfort of a sports book, I stopped
by Staples Center on Wednesday night and checked with Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "Valpo or Kentucky?"</TE>
<TE>   "Valpo," Gentry said, and a father can't do much more for his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS WOULD have been his second year at St. John's, which means
Darius Miles would have been taking on Wisconsin on Friday in the
first round of the NCAA tournament in Washington D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it all the time," Miles said before the Clippers'
game against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. "I feel like
I'm a part of that team; they sent me a St. John's jersey with my
number on it and I have it hanging in my house."</TE>
<TE>   Miles is making $3.54 million playing for the Clippers this year;
there's no telling what he'd be getting from St. John's, but probably
not as much.</TE>
<TE>   "The college game is so fast-paced, and that's my game and that's
the way they play in the Big East," Miles said. "I have to slow my
game down for the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Miles, who not only has the game but the personality and demeanor
to become one of the NBA's top stars, signed in November of his
senior year in high school with St. John's--making the decision to
play in the NBA only after dazzling scouts in later all-star games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm picking Wisconsin to beat St. John's in the tournament,"
Gentry said. "If Miles was playing for St. John's, I'd have them in
the Final Four."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Matt von Kroeker:</TE>
<TE>   "Your pretentious effort in caring about Coach Andy Murray's
well-being was laughable, and the thought of you being in the
building for a Kings' game makes my skin crawl."</TE>
<TE>   That reminds me--the Kings have us sitting together for the next
game.</TE>

<HD>Image Is Not Everything for the Gauchos</HD>
<DH>West Regional: UC Santa Barbara is trying to get past
reputation as party school as it heads for first-round game against
third-seeded Arizona tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>It has been about shaking the image. Not that the image of Santa
Barbara is anything at which to sneer.</LD>
<LD>   Palm trees. Blue skies. Sandy beaches. It is an area that treats
partying as a sport.</LD>
<LD>   But at UC Santa Barbara, that party image didn't translate well to
the basketball court. When things got tough, the nice, laid-back
Gauchos could be pushed around.</LD>
<TE>   "Sure, we have that reputation as a party school," said Santa
Barbara swingman Branduinn Fullove. "We've had to show people that
we're not a bunch of punk boys from Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   It has been 12 years since the Gauchos took part in March Madness.
Back then, they didn't need to rely on winning the Big West
Conference tournament to get in. They never reached the tournament
final but the league was so highly regarded that they received
at-large berths in 1988 and 1990 after 20-win seasons.</TE>
<TE>   These days, in a weaker Big West, only the conference tournament
winner gets an NCAA berth. And on Saturday night, Utah State erased
Santa Barbara's nine-point lead in the second half and looked as if
it was ready to claim a third consecutive conference title.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos then showed some traits not normally associated with
Santa Barbara basketball--grit and determination.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Jones helped them regain the lead with a three-point play.
Mike Vukovich, a senior who had struggled all season, had two key
baskets. After Utah State tied the score with 2:33 left on Ronnie
Ross' three-point basket, Mark Hull responded with a baseline move
for a layup that gave the Gauchos the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   After Jacoby Atako and Fullove teamed to make five of six free
throws, the Gauchos (20-10) were back in the spotlight. They play
third-seeded Arizona in an NCAA West Regional first-round game
tonight at Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   "The road could not have been sweeter," Santa Barbara Coach Bob
Williams said. "You want to prove yourself against the best and we
did that."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, in his fourth season, has told his players in recent
weeks to "enjoy the fight." They've rallied around that theme.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a game at Long Beach State three weeks ago, the
teams got into a brief melee. It was broken up quickly and no players
were suspended.</TE>
<TE>   But it did something for the Santa Barbara psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they just stood up for their team," Williams said. "We
have been pushed around a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fullove: "We're a family. We showed we were going to stick up
for each other. We weren't going to back down to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos lost that game. Two days later, they were playing UC
Irvine, a team that had dominated them in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Williams saw a transformation that occurred over those two days.
As a tight game drew to an end, he took the time to note the change
during a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "With two minutes to go, I sat the guys down in a huddle," he
said. "I put the clipboard down and just told them how proud I was
about how they had grown up."</TE>
<TE>   They also lost that game, but they haven't lost since.</TE>
<TE>   There are no true stars on this team, unlike the days of Eric
McArthur, Lucius Davis and Carrick DeHart; Hull and Fullove are the
leading scorers at just over 14 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But this team made its mark with defense.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara has been among the nation's leaders in field-goal
percentage defense this season. Teams are shooting only 38% against
them and only once did a team make more than half of its attempts.</TE>
<TE>   That may be what keeps the Gauchos--who haven't beaten a Pacific
10 Conference team since 1989--in the game against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   This team also has a symbiotic relationship with its dapper coach.
Williams put it together by getting players from Southern California
that often were considered second- or third-tier recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and reserve B.J. Ward were teammates at Oxnard Santa Clara
High. Fullove is from Simi Valley. Vukovich played at Santa Ana Mater
Dei. Atako is from Santa Monica High and Hull went to Glendale
Hoover. Reserve J.J. Todd is from West Hills Chaminade. Chrismen
Oliver, a walk-on who had two key baskets against Utah State, is from
Playa del Rey St. Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that you don't have to have top-notch recruits from out
of state to be a good team," Jones said. The 48-year-old Williams
relates to this group because he has been an underdog for much of his
career. He was cut from his high school's freshman team.</TE>
<TE>   A former high school coach in San Jose, he spent eight seasons as
a coach on the junior college level before becoming an assistant at
Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was eight seasons at UC Davis culminating in a Division II
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Now Williams has developed a team in his image. Smooth and likable
on the outside, tough and gritty on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of have a choir-boy look," he said. "All of a sudden,
we've developed a backdoor alley mentality."</TE>
<TE>   That's the new image of UC Santa Barbara basketball.</TE>

<LD>Miami vs. Missouri--Once ranked No. 2 in the country, Missouri
squeaked into the field as a No. 12-seeded team--the Tigers' lowest
seeding ever. "We weren't [worthy of] No. 2," Coach Quin Snyder said.
"To hold us accountable is ludicrous.... We are a better club than
our fall from grace would indicate." Kareem Rush, the younger brother
of former UCLA player JaRon Rush, is coming off a career-high,
33-point performance against Texas in the Big 12 tournament. The
Tigers face a defensive challenge against Miami. Darius Rice, a
6-foot-10 sophomore forward and the nephew of NFL receiver Jerry
Rice, is a problem because of his inside-outside ability, and point
guard John Salmons--at 6-7--is another difficult matchup.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Ohio State vs. Davidson--Both teams have had success in the NCAA
tournament. It's just that Davidson last won a game in 1969, when the
Wildcats beat St. John's to advance to the East Regional final
against North Carolina--falling a step short of the Final Four in a
two-point loss. Davidson avenged that loss this season by beating
North Carolina, 58-54. Ohio State last made the Final Four in 1999,
and starting guards Brian Brown and Boban Savovic were part of that
team. Brown acknowledged he didn't know anything about Davidson when
the pairings were announced--but said after last year's first-round
loss to Utah State, he has a lot more respect for lesser-known teams.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga vs. Wyoming--There's great anticipation of a potential
Gonzaga-Arizona game, but the Bulldogs' first-round game is no cinch.
They're facing a Wyoming team that plays its home games at 7,220 feet
in a first-round game at the Pit, notorious for its mile-high
altitude. Gonzaga is familiar with the Pit, however: The Zags won
there in January, defeating New Mexico in overtime, 95-90. (Wyoming
lost at New Mexico in February, 74-65.) Guard Dan Dickau seemed in a
faint slump until the second half of the West Coast Conference final
against Pepperdine, when he scored 27 of his 29 points and made four
of nine three-point shots. Wyoming forward Marcus Bailey is coming
off a big game too: He scored 31 against San Diego State in the
Mountain West tournament semifinals, making four of four from
three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona vs. UC Santa Barbara--Arizona Coach Lute Olson expects the
Gauchos to play a deliberate pace, but not as extreme as South
Alabama played in a slow-down game against Arizona in 1997. Arizona
trailed by 10 in the second half before winning. Like Olson, Santa
Barbara's Bob Williams has won a national title, guiding UC Davis to
the 1998 NCAA Division II title. Forward Mark Hull, the Gauchos'
stalwart, will be playing with a broken nose he injured in the
semifinals of the Big West tournament--and he won't wear a mask. The
Pit hasn't been the kindest venue to Olson: He is 2-6 in the building
as Arizona's coach, and no favorite of New Mexico fans after he said
following a 1999 loss that he'd never return to play New Mexico
because he felt the operation of the clock had been unfair. He's
back--but it's for the NCAA tournament. Olson's opposition to the
Pac-10 tournament hasn't wavered, but he acknowledges winning it
helped prepare his freshmen for the NCAA tournament, especially after
Salim Stoudamire scored 29 points in the final.</TE>

<HD>Accused Judge's Withdrawal Opposed</HD>
<DH>Election: Lead write-in says he will fight O.C. jurist's
attempt to quit runoff--an exit legal experts say is unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leading write-in candidate in the race to unseat an Orange County
judge charged with child molestation and possessing child pornography
said he opposes the jurist's efforts to withdraw from the race.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly half the write-in ballots counted as of late
Wednesday, Dana Point attorney John Adams had garnered 55%, Orange
County Registrar of Voters Rosalyn A. Lever said. Should that trend
continue, Adams will oppose Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline in a
November runoff.</LD>
<LD>   Kline's lawyers today are expected to ask a Superior Court judge
to take the unusual step of allowing Kline to bow out of the race,
nine days after he won a meager 33% of votes in the primary election
despite being the only name on the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Adams said Wednesday he is prepared--if allowed--to argue in court
against Kline's attempts to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline fails in his attempt to drop out of the election, his
name will appear on the ballot along with the top vote-getter among
write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But if Kline succeeds, Adams would face the next highest
vote-getter among the write-in candidates, election officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But county election officials and legal experts said Kline's
request has little chance of succeeding. Election law bars candidates
from withdrawing their names unless they are appointed to another
office or die well before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be quite an uphill battle," said Frederic
Woocher, a Santa Monica attorney who specializes in election issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws are pretty clear that you cannot withdraw at this
time.... He'd have to prove that he died."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the legal hurdles, some of Kline's other opponents
announced unwavering support for the judge's effort to end his
reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle. That's what I had hoped for all along. That's why
I started all this in the first place," said Gay Sandoval, a Costa
Mesa lawyer who launched the first write-in effort against Kline.</TE>
<TE>   On the first floor of the registrar's Santa Ana offices, four
dozen election volunteers are working to determine the write-in
leader. Earning only $50 a day, the volunteers are laboring over more
than 230,000 ballots cast for write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The work is tedious. The counters, many of them retirees and
homemakers, complain of numerous paper cuts suffered in the name of
democracy. But morale remains high.</TE>
<TE>   "This here election is real history, let me tell you," said Joe
Folske, 76, who said he has worked in every county election since
1956.</TE>
<TE>   County election officials Wednesday released the first results of
the massive hand count of write-in ballots. With nearly half of the
votes tallied, Adams has established a clear lead over rivals with
55%. Sandoval was in second place, with 17%, and Costa Mesa
Councilwoman Karen Robinson was third, with 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials said the hand count could be completed as early
as next week.</TE>
<TE>   At the registrar's office, Adams was overjoyed by news of his
early lead. He acknowledged that if he remains first when all votes
are counted, he will stand a better chance in November's election if
his opponent is Kline rather than another write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But Adams said he also opposes on moral and legal grounds any
attempt by the judge to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like Kline is asking the judge to circumvent the law,
and that is the last thing I want to be promoting," Adams said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Willie Williams, former Los Angeles police chief, was named federal
security director of Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport on
Wednesday, one of the first directors appointed by U.S.
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta.</LD>
<LD>   In response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the federal
government is assuming control of security at 429 civilian airports.</LD>
<LD>   The directors will have responsibility for making risk
assessments, supervising all federal law enforcement activity on
airport property, and supervising employees assigned to screen
airline baggage, passengers and employees.</LD>
<TE>   ''We have promised world-class security and world-class customer
service,'' Mineta said in swearing in the first seven airport
security directors. "These men and women personify that promise.''</TE>
<TE>   Among the seven was Michael J. Aguilar, a retired Marine Corps
brigadier general, who will become security director at San Diego's
Lindbergh Field. Aguilar, a helicopter pilot, spent 30 years in the
Marine Corps, including service in Operation Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Atlanta and San Diego, directors were named for
Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport, Denver International Airport, O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago and Ronald Reagan-Washington
National Airport.</TE>
<TE>   If the seven appointments are any indicator, Mineta favors retired
military brass, former police chiefs and commissioners, and Secret
Service officials. Depending on the size of the airport, the job pays
between $104,800 and $150,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Zotto, currently on the Secret Service detail for Vice
President Dick Cheney, was named to the Ronald Reagan-Washington
National Airport post. More than 9,500 applications have been
received by the Department of Transportation for the directorships at
the 429 airports.</TE>
<TE>   Just how the new directors will work with the myriad public and
private security personnel at the airports has yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Unified Port District of San Diego, which runs
Lindbergh Field, said port officials hope to meet soon with Aguilar
to develop a security strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 58, was a police officer in Philadelphia from 1964 to
1988 and then police commissioner from 1988 to 1992. He was chief in
Los Angeles from 1992 to 1997, when his bid for a second five-year
term was rejected by the Police Commission amid opposition to
Williams from then-Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, Williams has lived in Dallas and been chief operating
officer of a medical auditing company founded by his sister. He has
also been on the governing board of the Greater Dallas Crime
Commission, a group dedicated to fighting police corruption and
improving the relationship between police and the public.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Williams unsuccessfully sought the police chief job in
Washington, D.C. A year later he was quoted as saying he was
permanently retired from law enforcement.</TE>

<DH>Medicine: Board vows to discipline colleagues who aided
Saldivar or stood by as he killed patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after former hospital worker Efren Saldivar pleaded guilty to
killing six patients at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, the head
of the state board that oversees respiratory therapists said its
highest priority now is to pursue disciplinary cases against former
co-workers who may have aided him, or who knew what he was doing but
did not report it.</LD>
<LD>   Saldivar's license as a respiratory care practitioner was
suspended immediately after he told authorities in 1998 that he had
injected paralyzing drugs into the intravenous lines of dozens of
patients. In the four years since, however, there has been almost no
action taken against the co-workers who kept quiet about their
suspicions that he was killing patients.</LD>
<LD>   According to court records unsealed last year, Saldivar's frequent
partner on the graveyard shift told Glendale police that she stood
outside one patient's room while he went in "for the purpose of
injecting the patient," once got him a vial of a potentially deadly
muscle relaxer and heard him confide that he had injected such a drug
into a woman by mistake. She still has her state license.</LD>
<TE>   Other co-workers admitted seeing unauthorized drugs in Saldivar's
locker but did not inform hospital officials.</TE>
<TE>   The only co-worker disciplined by the state--with a reprimand--was
the one who alerted the hospital's respiratory supervisor to rumors
that Saldivar wielded a "magic syringe" and who then cooperated most
readily with police. That worker was one of those who saw potentially
lethal drugs in Saldivar's locker but did not tell hospital
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the California Respiratory Care Board said Wednesday
that other potential disciplinary cases were stalled by the
difficulty of obtaining police records and a desire not to interfere
with the criminal prosecution of Saldivar--or, potentially, of other
therapists.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely have this case as our highest priority now," said
Stephanie Nunez, the board's executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   Merely failing to report an isolated incident of seeing drugs in a
co-worker's locker might not be enough grounds for a disciplinary
action, Nunez said, but "I would say we definitely are looking at all
those individuals."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to implicating himself in "40-something" killings,
Saldivar told Glendale police in his 1998 confession, "I wasn't the
only one." He then named two other respiratory therapists, according
to a transcript unsealed last year.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar later recanted that confession, though, and prosecutors
said Tuesday that they do not anticipate filing criminal charges
against any of his former colleagues. Several were given limited
immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony against
Saldivar, but that would not prohibit the licensing board from
pursuing disciplinary actions against them.</TE>
<TE>   Some did lose their jobs, even as they kept their licenses. After
Saldivar's 1998 confession, he and four other respiratory therapists
were fired by Glendale Adventist, which conducted its own internal
investigation. Those fired included Saldivar's frequent companion on
the graveyard shift and the pair he accused of following his lead in
killing patients.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Adventist officials said they could not voluntarily turn
over their internal records to the state licensing board, but invited
it to subpoena the records. "At the time it was a big concern of
ours," said hospital spokesman Mark Newmyer. "Any of our former
employees that we let go, [state officials] had access to and knew
who they were. We were concerned about them following up."</TE>
<TE>   Nunez said the state board has at least been monitoring those
therapists in new jobs they obtained after being fired.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar finally was arrested in January 2001 after authorities
exhumed 20 bodies of former Glendale Adventist patients and found the
drug Pavulon in the tissue of six of them. Prosecutors and police
officials disclosed this week that Saldivar gave a second confession
at that time, in which he said he had killed 60 patients by 1994 and
then lost count.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such shocking revelations, the dearth of disciplinary
cases is not the only way that the murder case has had limited
impact.</TE>
<TE>   After Saldivar confessed in 1998, Glendale Adventist sent some of
its officials to Indiana to see how a hospital there was handling its
own "Angel of Death" scandal.</TE>
<TE>   One of the consequences for  Vermillion County Hospital was a
torrent of lawsuits. One of its nurses was eventually found guilty of
murdering six patients, but the hospital was swamped with 80 wrongful
death actions brought by patients' families. A year after the nurse's
1999 conviction, the state's Patient's Compensation Fund had already
paid out $5.8 million to 17 families. In addition, the hospital was
under new management.</TE>
<TE>   At Glendale Adventist, in contrast, officials said business was up
by about 20 patients a day from the time the investigation was made
public in 1998 to the time of Saldivar's arrest last year. The
hospital said Wednesday that its census was up an additional 15
patients this year, to 300 on an average day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Newmyer said the hospital had paid settlements to the
families of only three of Saldivar's six documented murder victims.
Though the terms are sealed, one family said last year that it
received $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   Newmyer said Glendale Adventist also paid settlements to two
families of patients whose bodies were exhumed during the police
investigation, but whose deaths did not produce murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The hospital has fared very well through this on all fronts,"
Newmyer said, "and we're extremely grateful."</TE>
<TE>   In all, perhaps only about a dozen suits have been filed. The long
delay between the onset of the investigation and the filing of
charges clearly helped the hospital on the civil front--relatives of
deceased patients who waited for Saldivar's arrest found their suits
dismissed by a county judge on grounds that they were filed too late,
after the one-year statute of limitations had lapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of another of Saldivar's victims, Jean Coyle--the
only one known to have survived one of his injections--said she was
told by lawyers "there was nothing they could do ... it was past the
statute." Saldivar also pleaded guilty this week to an attempted
murder charge in the case of Coyle.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank Superior Court Judge Carl J. West, who presided over the
hospital cases, similarly told the son of Eleanora Schlegel, 77, that
he should have filed suit within one year of March 1998, when
Saldivar was first identified as a suspect--and when the son phoned a
police hotline to report his suspicions of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The son, Larry Schlegel, eventually gained a settlement rather
than appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But he complained earlier this year that the ruling encouraged
people to go to court before they had real evidence that malpractice,
or in this case, murder, had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice to anyone is that if someone dies in a hospital, sue
'em," said Schlegel. "Tie up the courtroom with a lawsuit over every
death."</TE>
<TE>   Only one suit is pending, filed in January on behalf of the
estates of three victims--one of whose relatives already have settled
with the hospital. The suit alleges that they were victims of elder
abuse, an offense with a three-year statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney who brought it, Chris Nicoll, said he has not yet
served the legal papers on the hospital and is waiting to get records
from the Saldivar grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was named as a defendant in all the suits and under the
terms of his plea agreement, any victims have another year to sue
him. But he has minimal assets, noted the civil lawyer, Terry
Goldberg, who has handled his cases for free. "He doesn't have
anything," Goldberg said of Saldivar, who will be sentenced next
month to six terms of life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said there was a simple explanation for the relative lack
of suits in the case: "Litigation is very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Parties in the civil cases several times tried to force Glendale
police to turn over their findings during the investigation, only to
be rebuffed. That meant some families had to exhume their relatives'
bodies--if police had not done so--and duplicate the elaborate work
done for authorities by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which
devised new tests to find Pavulon in buried bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Since Saldivar, unlike the hospital, did not settle any cases, he
has so far suffered no civil judgments at all, Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "None. Zero. Not one."</TE>

<LD>Two men who obtained a stolen $161,171 tax refund check intended for
Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss and then tried to cash it pleaded
guilty to fraud charges in federal court Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dwayne Kellum, 38, and Kenneth Reeves, 42, both of Long Beach,
admitted taking part in a scheme to cash the check by opening an
account in the name of ''Jerry Buss Jr.'' at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.</LD>
<LD>   The California state refund check had been stolen from the mail,
apparently by someone else, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory
Weingart.</LD>
<TE>   Kellum was convicted in a separate case last month of cashing
$141,000 worth of stolen checks. They included $36,000 in checks
belonging to a trust set up by actor Fred MacMurray and his wife,
actress June Haver.</TE>

<LD>County prosecutors on Wednesday dropped criminal-threat charges
against a former City of Hope research scientist, citing a lack of
evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Balon, 50, had been accused by a colleague of making death
threats against three other scientists at the City of Hope National
Medical Center in Duarte. Prosecutors determined they could not prove
that Balon intended for the alleged threats to be communicated to the
other scientists.</LD>
<LD>   Balon, who maintains he never made any threats, left City of Hope
in November shortly after his arrest and is looking for a new

<HD>Jim Brown Rejects Judge's Offer, Is Jailed in Domestic
Violence Case</HD>

<LD>Retired Hall of Fame pro football player Jim Brown began serving a
180-day jail term Wednesday in what Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo hailed as a precedent-setting domestic-violence case.</LD>
<LD>   A defiant Brown chose to go to jail rather than accept conditions
imposed by Superior Court Judge Dale Fischer that he complete a
domestic violence counseling program, pay a fine and make a payment
to a battered women's shelter. Had he done so, he would have been
placed on probation.</LD>
<LD>   "I took no deal," Brown told reporters at a court appearance
Tuesday. "I'm not going to take a deal, and I'll fight as long as I
have breath in my body. That's who I am. That's who I've always
been." On Wednesday morning, he went stoically into custody.</LD>
<TE>   Brown, 66, has faced domestic violence charges five times since
the 1960s but was never convicted of anything until he was found
guilty in 1999 of misdemeanor vandalism for smashing the windows of
his wife's car.</TE>
<TE>   More than two years of appeals led to a recent state Court of
Appeal decision that Delgadillo said Wednesday validated the
principle that vandalism in the context of a domestic dispute is
domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great day for family victims," said Delgadillo at a
news conference an hour after Fischer denied pleas by Brown's
attorney, Milton Grimes, to delay the jail sentence. An angry Grimes
later vowed to pursue an emergency writ of habeas corpus that would
free Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's wife, Monique, was in court Wednesday to support the
former football star, but Delgadillo contended that it is important
to pursue domestic violence cases even if victims eventually excuse
the perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   All five of the women Brown has been alleged to have threatened or
assaulted in the last four decades have refused to testify against
him.</TE>
<TE>   There are 40,000 complaints of domestic violence in Los Angeles
County every year, and the Brown case is important because it has
focused attention on the problem, the city attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, unrepentant, said during a news conference at his home
Tuesday that only the car, not his wife, had been assaulted. "These
laws are basically unfair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and his wife have a 4-month-old child, and Grimes argued in
court that this, and Brown's work with young gang members to
straighten out their lives, made it wrong to send him to jail.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge said she believed that after two years of appeals,
it was time for Brown to begin serving the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said that in order to avoid any conflict with Brown's
efforts to stem gang activity and ethnic discord in the Los Angeles
County Jail, he would be sent to Ventura County to serve his
sentence.</TE>

<HD>Council's Plan for Cable Competition Goes Bust</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A day after WinFirst files for bankruptcy, Holden
vows to revoke franchise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prospects of ending long-standing cable television monopolies in
Los Angeles dimmed Wednesday as City Council members vowed to revoke
a franchise granted in July to Western Integrated Networks, one day
after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old Denver-based company, also known as WinFirst, had
promised to give the city's 3.4million residents lower prices and
improved service by building a fiber-optic network for delivering
television, Internet access and telephone services in competition
with incumbents including AT&amp;T Broadband, Adelphia Communications and
Time Warner Cable.</LD>
<LD>   Companies such as WinFirst, known as "overbuilders," have cropped
up to duplicate cable networks, attempting to capitalize on new
digital technologies that improve the economics of constructing these
expensive networks.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the enormous capital required and the uncertain
returns, Wall Street has been reluctant to fund overbuilders. As a
result, fewer than 5% of the nation's 100million households have a
choice of more than one cable operator today, according to the
Consumer Federation.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the company's financial difficulties, Councilman
Nate Holden said Wednesday that he would propose nullifying the
company's cable franchise at Friday's City Council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In a heated debate last summer before WinFirst won the franchise
in a 12-2 vote of the council, Holden questioned the financial
solvency of the Denver concern and asked for provisions in the
contract to protect the city in the event of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is 'I told you so,'" said Holden, who voted against
WinFirst. "The [other council members] voted with full knowledge that
these guys were not financially sound. Now we've got to make this
contract null and void before the bankruptcy court claims it has an
asset of the company."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, chairman of the city's Information
Technology and General Services Committee, which oversees cable
franchises, also called for action against WinFirst at a hearing
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   City officials told Ridley-Thomas that WinFirst had been
"unresponsive" to their telephone calls since November and that the
company had closed its only business office in Los Angeles County and
terminated construction of a fiber-optic network in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Liza Lowery, the Information Technology Agency's
chief information officer, said WinFirst had fulfilled its obligation
to pay the city some $650,000 for access facilities and equipment,
but had not provided an engineering report by the December deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Lowery said it was too early to know the impact on the city of the
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   WinFirst officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas ordered Assistant City Atty. Edward Perez to present
him with a plan of attack within a week. "We'll pursue this
aggressively," said Ridley-Thomas after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Holden, who was not at the hearing Wednesday,
said waiting a week was not acceptable. "We need to move on it right
away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that WinFirst's financial difficulties are a black mark
on the record of Councilman Alex Padilla, who as chairman of the
Information Technology Committee last year pushed through the
measure. "Alex put his whole reputation on the line for this," Holden
said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla would not comment Wednesday. But when the measure passed
last fall, he said that he understood the financial risk of trying to
provide residents with competition and that WinFirst could run out of
money before the end of its 15-year contract, leaving city streets
and sidewalks disrupted.</TE>

<LD>   Maybe the airlines with their incompetence and klutziness at
security checkpoints are doing us a big favor. They're prodding us
into alternative modes of travel, at least in California.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, you can't even take a fingernail clip on board a
plane, or a small screwdriver to repair reading glasses when a lens
falls out.</LD>
<TE>   Lines are ludicrously long. And the other day, I had to stand in
an extra line to be patted down and take my shoes off. My sin was
forgetting to remove one ballpoint pen from a pocket. Buzzzz. No, I
couldn't go through again. "You only get one chance."</TE>
<TE>   I don't care about the rationale. I'm also tired of walking around
those scarecrows propped up in their camouflage National Guard
uniforms with Arnold Schwarzenegger guns. Don't want to hear about
it.</TE>
<TE>   I just want out of there. Any airport.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, driving 400 miles in my own car--or even rented
wheels--doesn't seem so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, voters just passed Proposition 42, which will pump
$36 billion from the gasoline sales tax into transportation projects
over 20 years, mostly for major highways and local roads.</TE>
<TE>   And it's definitely time to revive reliable north-south train
travel.</TE>
<TE>   State Treasurer Phil Angelides and Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno)
Tuesday proposed a $6-billion bond issue to help build a high-speed
rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Travel time: 2 1/2 hours, with a couple of stops in the San
Joaquin Valley. Fare: $42. Project cost: $11 billion, with the
federal government also kicking in.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate goal: A 700-mile system of 200-mph trains from
Sacramento and the Bay Area to San Diego. Total cost: $25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "If we'd had a high-speed rail system after the terrorist
attacks," Costa notes, "thousands of passengers could have traveled
without anxiety and inconvenience."</TE>
<TE>   It's long past the time to rebuild California's infrastructure--an
uninspiring, bureaucratic word that means highways, rail, airports,
water, classrooms ... All the stuff that used to make California No.
1.</TE>
<TE>   We're poking along on water, seemingly waiting for the next flood
or drought. That shouldn't take very long, given history.</TE>
<TE>   Progress is being made on schools, generally, but we're barely
keeping ahead of population growth--and in some cities, not even
doing that.</TE>
<TE>   Passage in November 2000 of a ballot measure lowering the vote
requirement for local school bonds from 67% to 55% has helped a lot.
Since then, 86% of local bond proposals have passed--compared with
roughly half before--raising $11.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But the state's matching-fund kitty is dry. So education interests
are negotiating a proposed new state bond issue of roughly $13
billion for November.</TE>
<TE>   That won't go far either.</TE>
<TE>   California's infrastructure needs over the next 10 years have been
estimated at around $175 billion--$117 billion for transportation,
$42 billion for education (K-12 and college), $9 billion for adult
and juvenile prisons and $7 billion for parks and other resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Those numbers are pretty solid," says Jesse Huff, former state
finance director and current policy advisor for GOP gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon. "They're not pie in the sky or fanciful."</TE>
<TE>   Just once again, it would be uplifting to see a gubernatorial
candidate run--a la Pat Brown--on the need to rebuild California. He
could project substance, commitment, leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be out there running on infrastructure as one of my key
planks," says veteran GOP strategist Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente
lawyer. "I'd be busting [Gov.] Gray Davis' chops ...</TE>
<TE>   "The state is going to grow. You can't let it grow and fall apart.
It has become increasingly unlivable [in Southern California]."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan began his campaign speaking loftily of restoring
California to No. 1. But he quickly detoured into other areas--like
abortion rights. He planned to return to infrastructure in the
general election. That was one of many miscalculations.</TE>
<TE>   Simon mentions infrastructure daily and agrees that $175 billion
is needed. But he says taxpayers can't afford the entire bill.
Entrepreneurs will have to be invited in to seek profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians aren't going to let Bill Simon turn this state into
one giant New Jersey Turnpike," responds Davis strategist Garry
South. He adds: "Gray Davis has done more for infrastructure than any
governor since Pat Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "And incidentally, for all his trouble, Pat Brown got defeated
running for a third term. Californians overwhelmingly voted him out
of office."</TE>
<TE>   A Builder Brown today, however, might find a winning issue in
promising voters he'd upgrade rail and roads to the point they could
avoid in-state air travel.</TE>

<HD>Controller Rejects DWP Bills as Extravagant</HD>
<DH>Spending: Laura Chick refuses to pay for such expenses as a
$100,000 black-tie dinner. She calls for council review and revamped
policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Department of Water and Power ratepayers have been asked to foot a
$100,000 bill for a black-tie dinner celebrating the reopening of Los
Angeles City Hall and a $75,000 sponsorship that provides the agency
with VIP tickets for USC basketball games, ice shows and the circus,
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Those are among the $601,293 in DWP bills that City Controller
Laura Chick refused to pay Wednesday, sending them to the City
Council for review and action. Chick said she will reject all similar
bills until the department revamps what she calls vague policies that
allow extravagant spending.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot in good conscience approve multiple millions of dollars
for party time and VIP receptions," she said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's beginning to look like the DWP is the Department of Wasteful
Practices," Chick said. "They are behaving, quite frankly, as if they
are an Enron, with no accountability to the ratepayers."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the Los Angeles City Council, Chick said the DWP
has failed to provide adequate documentation to show that 24 separate
expenses are warranted.</TE>
<TE>   DWP General Manager David Wiggs said he is aware of Chick's
concerns and he is taking steps to better regulate spending on
promotional activities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working on a policy that would tighten this up a little
bit," Wiggs said. "I'm still pretty confident that all of these
expenditures are going to qualify under the new policies."</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs said he did not have time Wednesday to review all the
expenses questioned but said the agency should be given some latitude
in deciding what advances its mission.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, we have to make judgments about what is
important and what is not," he said. "I think these expenses can be
justified for business reasons, environmental reasons or educational
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal, head of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., applauded
Chick, saying, "We absolutely support her cracking down on the DWP's
profligate spending."</TE>
<TE>   As a semiautonomous city agency with its own governing board, the
DWP has a history of running afoul of audits, including a 1993
controversy in which it spent $800,000 on catering for managers and
other workers during a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said Wednesday that she had been asking department officials
since September to provide guidelines and policies to help her
determine if expenses are justified.</TE>
<TE>   The billings that Chick refused to pay include $100,000 to
co-sponsor an April 27 dinner to celebrate the completion of the
$300-million renovation of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   For $100,000, the DWP would receive 24 dinner tickets for DWP
executives and their guests.</TE>
<TE>   The $500-per-person dinner is expected to draw 900, and officials
said much of the ticket cost goes to restoration of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said the DWP should instead provide the money for a public
celebration planned by the city the day before the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs said the event promotes "a better business atmosphere" for
the city.</TE>
<TE>   The controller also refused to approve the DWP's $75,000 annual
sponsorship of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. As part of the
deal, the DWP gets advertising at the Sports Arena and on a freeway
video sign, as well as VIP suite tickets for USC basketball, Disney
on Ice and the Ringling Bros. Circus at the Sports Arena. "I don't
see how paying thousands and thousands of public dollars for VIP
sports tickets benefits the customers or the ratepayers of the DWP,"
Chick said.</TE>
<TE>   The event tickets, according to the agency, are offered to key
customers "to acknowledge their value" to the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   John Lee, a spokesman for the Coliseum, estimated the value of the
tickets at less than $3,000, saying most of the sponsorship payment
goes toward advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The controller also rejected a $15,000 catering bill for a
ceremony that renamed the DWP headquarters for former City Council
President John Ferraro; $4,747 spent on catering for DWP's
highest-paying customers and some employees at Dodger Stadium; and
$6,002 for an employee safety recognition lunch.</TE>

act," Chick said.</TE>

<HD>Schools Are Rethinking Traffic Safety</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Some parents walked their kids to an Anaheim
school for a little extra peace of mind a day after two girls were
killed while waiting for a ride.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents clutched their children's hands a little tighter Wednesday,
many streaming by Centralia Elementary School to light candles and
say tearful goodbyes to two little girls who were killed in the
school parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Some said their children were afraid to return to the Anaheim
campus Wednesday, but once there, they were greeted with hugs from
teachers and a team of 40 crisis counselors.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim police said they plan an investigation that could take
weeks, but released no additional details to explain why a car driven
by Maria Juarez, 50, of Anaheim jumped the curb at a pickup and
drop-off zone and fatally struck two girls, ages 6 and 7, pinning
them against the building.</LD>
<TE>   Juarez, who was picking up her grandchild at the school Tuesday,
was questioned after the accident, but police stopped the interview
because she was too distraught to continue, Sgt. Rick Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe Juarez accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of
the brake. Police also are considering mechanical failure and whether
Juarez might have been distracted when she hit Bianca Perez, 7, and
Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez has not been arrested. Bianca's aunt, Martha Herrera, said
she was angry at first. "Then I thought about it," she said. "God
knows why this happened. He's the only one that has a right to
judge."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, some parents walked their kids to school for a
little extra peace of mind. Many had to urge their children to go in
an effort to maintain their daily routine.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera took her two daughters to school despite their protests.
It was important for the girls to talk to grief counselors. They were
next to their cousin when she was hit, Herrera said.</TE>
<TE>   They stopped in front of the campus where the Centralia Elementary
School sign had been converted into a memorial. It was covered with
votive candles, stuffed animals, flowers, balloons and notes to the
girls.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me happy in a way," Herrera said. "I know people are
giving comfort to the families. They're letting us know they're with
us."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bianca's relatives gathered at the Santa Ana home of Cointa
Nunez, 74, the girl's grandmother. "I loved her a lot," Nunez said as
she wept. "She was everything to us."</TE>
<TE>   Bianca's aunts recalled the way she would greet them by leaping
into their arms with a huge smile, a hug and declarations of love.
They remember her dancing and jumping around the house, singing her
favorite Britney Spears songs.</TE>
<TE>   At the school, county educators and grief counselors rallied
around the neighborhood school. District principals were at the
school Wednesday morning, as were the trustees. Police were out in
force, directing traffic. A crew from the Anaheim fire station that
responded to the call delivered a bouquet of daisies.</TE>
<TE>   The school sent home a letter with each student, urging parents to
take advantage of the psychologists on hand and informing them of an
account set up to receive donations for the girls' families through
the Centralia PTA/Perez-Curiel Fund, 195 N. Western Ave., Anaheim, CA
92801. Supt. Bobbi Mahler sent letters to parents at the other
district campuses with a list of symptoms their children might
experience as a result of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We will provide an open door for as long as it takes to heal our
community," Mahler said.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Lynn walked her daughter to school and hugged her
youngest, 4-year-old Erin, who saw the accident. "She just keeps
crying and crying," Lynn said. "She's so sad. I just tell her,
'They're with God right now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Kramp hopped on her bike to chase after her 12-year-old
daughter, Katrina, because she left the house without their daily
"finger kiss."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to tell her I love her because you never know," Kramp
said.</TE>

<DH>Accidents: Two girls' deaths show the growing risk of trips

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 8:15 a.m. Wednesday in front of Golden Hill Elementary School in
Fullerton. As cars pull up to a yellow loading zone, a boy races into
the street after a basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Other children cross Barris Avenue outside the crosswalk or play
tag on the sidewalk near arriving automobiles. There are no crossing
guards or school staff members on duty to supervise.</LD>
<LD>   Some parents make U-turns in front of the campus while others
unload their children from the driver's side into the middle of the
street. In their haste, a few drivers drop off their young charges in
a "No Parking" zone.</LD>
<TE>   The tragic deaths of two girls at an Anaheim elementary school a
day earlier underscores a stark reality: Trips to and from school are
among the riskiest times of the day for young students.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's accident at Centralia Elementary School, parents
complained that the combination driveway/parking lot at the school
was too narrow for the many cars that come to pick up and drop off
students, and that parents often drive too quickly, double-park or
try to maneuver around other cars.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known, however, whether such problems were in any way
responsible for the accident, in which police said they believe Maria
Juarez, 50, of Anaheim mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of
the brake, killing Bianca Perez, 7, and Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a terrible arrangement," mother Bobbie Kramp said of
the driveway after a parent meeting Wednesday at the school. "But I
don't know, maybe it was just a matter of time. Cars pull up. People
get impatient."</TE>
<TE>   Some parents suggested more parking spots; others wanted more
crossing guards and parking lot supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic safety at schools has become a bigger concern across the
Southland in recent years as enrollments grow and more students come
to school in cars instead of buses, law enforcement and education
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, state figures show that the number of students
enrolled in public school in Orange County has grown from 402,314 in
1993 to 500,079 last fall--an increase of almost 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic has been increasing for us," said Nancy Malone,
transportation director for the Newport-Mesa Unified School District.
"Schools have been growing, and charges for bus service have forced
parents to carpool or take their kids to school themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Though schools typically put portable buildings on campus to house
extra students, seldom are they in a position to expand small
driveways and parking lots built for a much smaller population.</TE>
<TE>   "There usually is not enough room around schools for all the
cars," said Lt. Joe Klein, head of community services for the
Fullerton Police Department. "There are hundreds of children, and
parents can be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Schools have tried to make safety improvements, including loading
areas for motorists, safety brochures, and adding staff to direct
traffic during morning and afternoon rushes. Though some parents
believe the drop-off and pickup routines are safe at their schools,
others say the situation is more risky than people think.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to grab kids in two incidents and pull them away to keep
them from getting hit by a car," said Gary Adamson, whose son attends
second grade at Golden Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The school has tried unsuccessfully to get the city to provide a
crossing guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I've complained to the police numerous times," Adamson said.
"They send someone when they can, but their resources are limited. It
is absolutely unsafe."</TE>
<TE>   Where cars come into contact with hundreds of children, it can be
a hazardous undertaking even under the best circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   National surveys show that Orange County motorists are among the
worst offenders when it comes to driving irresponsibly in school
zones.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of county motorists clocked for the study exceeded the
speed limits by 5 mph or more around schools. Nationwide, the average
is 65%.</TE>
<TE>   Federal statistics reveal that car accidents involving child
pedestrians are the second leading cause of death for those ages 5 to
14. Each year across the country an average of 675 children die from
vehicle-related pedestrian incidents and 20,000 are injured.</TE>
<TE>   Though there have been near misses and minor traffic accidents
while dropping off and picking up students around the Southland,
police and school district officials in many systems had difficulty
recalling any serious injuries or fatalities at local schools except
for the Anaheim deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But in Santa Ana, authorities say half of pedestrian-related
traffic accidents involve children walking within a few blocks of a
campus--about 50 in the year 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Unified School District began a safety program two
years ago after a couple of children were hurt in traffic accidents,
said Charles Clark, chief of school safety. The district's Student
Valet Parking uses traffic cones and student volunteers to block off
a safe area and get children out of cars and onto campus.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the program has been implemented at about a third of Long
Beach schools.</TE>
<TE>   The potential risks have prompted many police departments and
school districts to put restrictions on traffic flow around campuses.
Some districts have separated the loading areas for school buses and
cars to eliminate the long lines of motorists that used to develop
behind buses.</TE>
<TE>   "People get excited in and around school areas," said Clarence
Hutchison, transportation services manager for the Los Angeles
Unified School District. "Parents are picking up their children,
they're happy to see them, and sometimes they're more interested in
their child's day than in the traffic all around them."</TE>

Unified School District. "Parents are picking up their children,
they're happy to see them, and sometimes they're more interested in
their child's day than in the traffic all around them."</TE>
<TE>   The district does not allow parents to bring their cars on campus
to pick up or drop off students, said Willie Crittendon, director of
safety in schools.</TE>
<TE>   At Wild Rose Elementary in Monrovia, police have been warning
parents who double-park while waiting for class to get out that they
are putting children who might walk between the cars at risk.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Police Department has received a $200,000 state grant
to help develop traffic plans for schools. Among other things,
officers have stepped up patrols around schools and created
no-parking zones</TE>
<TE>   At Top of the World Elementary School in Laguna Beach, Principal
Ron LaMotte goes to great lengths to move traffic through a narrow
driveway/parking lot. The previous principal had banned parents' cars
from the campus because of safety concerns, a policy that led to a
raft of complaints from parents and school neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic now moves in a single lane in one direction through the
parking lot, which has one entrance and one exit. Three adult
monitors open car doors to make sure children step onto the sidewalk
and do not walk between cars or buses.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, the rules are a little different when students
are let out during three staggered shifts. When the biggest wave of
students leaves at 1:40, students who ride the bus are sent home
first.</TE>
<TE>   Others waiting to be picked up gather in an area that is cordoned
off by 175 traffic cones. Their parents, who must wait until all the
buses leave, then drive up one by one to pick up their children. No
traffic is allowed in any areas where children line up.</TE>
<TE>   LaMotte, who often supervises the school's crosswalk himself, said
there have not been any problems with the system. But every time he
hears about a tragedy like the one in Anaheim, he can't help but
wonder whether the loading zones are safe enough for the 695 students
who come and go in shifts.</TE>
<TE>   "I replay everything we do in my mind," LaMotte said Wednesday. "I
came away saying that I think we do a pretty good job."</TE>
<TE>   Like LaMotte, many educators across the county said they will
probably reevaluate their traffic safety plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we need to move forward to see what can be done," said
Sandy Fiddler, a transportation analyst for the Orange County

<HD>Drug Discount Often Unused, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: Many pharmacies do not inform senior citizens about
the state benefit, the report shows. Far more low-income people are
affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a state law that allows Medicare recipients to save up to 20%
on retail drug prices, many pharmacies are not giving the discounts
unless senior citizens show their Medicare card and specifically ask
for the reduced rate, according to a study published today in the New
England Journal of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   That means that the discounts often do not reach those low-income
senior citizens who need them most, researchers from RAND Health and
the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Health Care System found.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers trained a team of Medicare beneficiaries and sent
them to 494 pharmacies in Los Angeles County and the San Francisco
Bay Area between April and May 2001.</LD>
<TE>   They found that although 75% of the pharmacies offered the
discount, most waited for the customer to show a Medicare card and
ask for the discount before reducing the price.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the study determined that patients who visited
independent pharmacies, which tend to be in low-income neighborhoods,
were less likely to receive the discount. Ninety-one percent of the
chain pharmacies visited gave the discount, compared with 58% of
independent pharmacies. Compliance was higher in the Bay Area than in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who could most benefit from this, people with low
incomes, are the ones who are not getting the discount because they
are located in lower income neighborhoods," said Dr. Joy H. Lewis,
lead author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires pharmacies that participate in the Medi-Cal
program for the poor to offer discounts to Medicare beneficiaries. To
obtain the savings, patients must by law show their Medicare
cards--which many are not used to doing. Also, many senior citizens
are simply unaware of the discount program, and the study showed that
45% of the pharmacies are not informing them.</TE>
<TE>   "The more educated the patient, the more likely they are to
receive the discount," Lewis said. "I hope the study raises awareness
about the law."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Na, a pharmacist at Siloam Pharmacy in Koreatown, said
the law has been in place long enough for people to know about it.
She added that if they don't bring their Medicare cards, she cannot
make exceptions. "It doesn't make sense because if I don't have a
card, I don't know if the patient is really in Medicare."</TE>
<TE>   But Anna Scheybeler, a 64-year-old cancer survivor from El Monte
who lives on $660 a month and will become eligible for Medicare in
June, said pharmacists should make it easier for low-income patients
to take advantage of the discounts. "I think that is terrible," she
said, referring to pharmacies that are not informing patients of the
discount.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't care about us old people. All they care about is their
own pocket."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) sponsored the
prescription-drug discount program, which passed in 1999, a year in
which spending for prescription drugs soared by 17%.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sixth consecutive year with a double-digit increase.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which took effect in February 2000, gives patients a
substantial discount on certain drugs on the list for Medi-Cal
recipients.</TE>
<TE>   The law will expire next year, but Speier is sponsoring another
bill that will extend the discount program and will require
pharmacies to post signs informing beneficiaries about the discounts.</TE>

<HD>Issa Plan Uses El Toro to Build at Pendleton</HD>
<DH>Military: A developer who adds housing at the San Diego
base would get land in O.C. under his proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A south Orange County congressman Wednesday urged the Navy to
consider offering land at the former El Toro Marine base to a private
developer in exchange for building much-needed military housing at
Camp Pendleton.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) sent a letter to the secretary of
the Navy, citing a section in federal law that permits the secretary
of Defense to transfer land to "an entity that constructs military
family housing."</LD>
<LD>   "The housing situation at Camp Pendleton has reached a point of
crisis," Issa said, adding that Pendleton has a waiting list of more
than 1,500 families.</LD>
<TE>   Those families wait 13 to 15 months for units, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Orange County voters overwhelmingly approved Measure W,
an initiative that changes El Toro's zoning from an airport to a
park. However, the Navy subsequently announced its intent to put the
land up for public sale, even as it considers possible local plans to
create a park and other compatible uses on the base.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has said it plans to decide by April 23.</TE>
<TE>   It is Issa's second attempt to use El Toro to help ease the
housing crunch at the base, in northern San Diego County. Last year,
he proposed reopening housing at El Toro for Camp Pendleton families
in need of low-cost units.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials turned him down, citing the rising cost of gasoline
and the distance involved, which would have crimped household
budgets. Issa said the developments after passage of Measure W
prompted him to try again.</TE>
<TE>   "The train had left the station on that idea, but with the Navy's
announcement [on the possible auction of El Toro land], it's come
back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Issa, who would like to see at least 1,000 units built at
Pendleton, said the Navy hasn't reaped the expected financial
benefits from base closures. Any proceeds from the closure of El Toro
should go "where the Marines are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The military has given up important base property and valuable
tracts of land but has yet to realize the benefits they should expect
as a result," Issa told Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England in
the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Fund's 9/11 Contributions Stolen</HD>
<DH>Crime: Times publisher says $65,000 for terrorism victims
didn't go to relief agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Times has told police that $65,000 was stolen from
the newspaper's Disaster Relief Fund, set up after Sept. 11 for the
victims, their families and relief workers.</LD>
<LD>   In a full-page letter to readers today, Times publisher John P.
Puerner said the newspaper learned recently that some contributions
made by credit card, not personal check, were not turned over to
disaster relief agencies. "Instead some of these donations were
misdirected and fraudulently processed," Puerner says in the letter.</LD>
<LD>   The relief effort, a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation,
collected a total of $2.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We deeply regret that this has happened," the letter states. "Be
assured that the Los Angeles Times will make corporate contributions
to the Disaster Relief Fund to replace all funds misdirected by the
fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Puerner also says the paper will cover any funds that it may later
discover stolen.</TE>
<TE>   He concludes: "We recognize that the public trust between our
readers and The Times is a sacred one, and we will work diligently to
protect that trust."</TE>
<TE>   Puerner declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   According to Martha Goldstein, vice president of communications
for The Times, two donors brought the credit card irregularities to
the newspaper's attention, "and we immediately put together a team"
to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "When we began to gather the facts, we discovered there was
misappropriation and we decided it was very, very important to inform
our readers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the campaign was sometimes advertised as a joint campaign
with the Los Angeles Times and KTLA-TV Channel 5, only donations sent
to The Times were discovered stolen. KTLA, which like The Times is
owned by the Tribune Co., is not involved, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times letter advises donors of several indicators of fraud: a
transaction from "LATF-Real Estate" or "LATF" on a credit card
statement or an acknowledgment letter from the Los Angeles Times Fund
with no return address or telephone number. Anyone who receives these
should call (800) 252-4000.</TE>
<TE>   The Times turned over its information regarding the fraud to Los
Angeles police Tuesday, according to Capt. Al Michelena of the LAPD
financial crimes division.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, during the month of January was when it happened,"
Michelena said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the police captain nor Goldstein would discuss possible
suspects or other details.</TE>
<TE>   "These paper trails usually lead to somebody," Michelena said.</TE>

<HD>Jury Convicts Man in Arleta Triple-Slaying</HD>
<DH>Verdict: Juan Guillen, 26, is also found guilty of
attempted murder. He faces life without parole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury convicted a gang member Wednesday of murdering three men and
wounding another at a birthday party in Arleta last year.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Guillen, 26, of Palmdale was found guilty of first-degree
murder in the Jan. 14, 2001, deaths of alleged gang members Joel
Gonzalez, 27, of Arleta; Jesse Abel, 24, of Pacoima; and Jack
Loutsios, 17, of North Hills.</LD>
<LD>   He was also found guilty in the attempted murder of German Lopez,
21.</LD>
<TE>   Family members of the slain victims wept in the back of the San
Fernando courtroom as the clerk read the verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night I was thinking, Jack would have been 19 on March 2,"
said Loutsios' mother, Donna. "I wonder what he would have looked
like? What would he have been doing?"</TE>
<TE>   During the three-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels
presented a ballistics expert who linked 15 of the 16 shell casings
found at the scene to the same gun, and three witnesses who testified
that Guillen was the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen's attorney, Nancy Mazza, argued that a Los Angeles police
detective coerced and threatened witnesses, and she questioned the
credibility of prosecution witnesses who are gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen continued to insist he is innocent in a brief interview
after the verdict from a cell near the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it, it was too quick," he said of the one-day
deliberation by the jury of six men and six women. "They didn't look
into everything."</TE>
<TE>   Guillen said he wanted to tell family members he was sorry. "I
feel as bad as they do," he said. "Nobody expected anything like that
at the party. But they shouldn't assume I was guilty."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors testified that they heard shots coming from different
directions, which Mazza said meant there was more than one assailant
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Mazza said she would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the victims said their relatives were innocent
bystanders and not part of a gang.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen is to be sentenced by Judge Charles Peven on April 8. He
faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Co. Plan Would Strain Schools, Roads, Residents Say</HD>
<DH>Land use: City Council and public get first look at project
calling for 12,350 homes in villages and 7 million square feet of
space for businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 12,350-home community the Irvine Co. wants to build near the
retired El Toro Marine base would be in keeping with Irvine's
existing village theme, with parks, schools and shopping centers
clustered near neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine City Council members Tuesday got a first look at the plan,
which outlines the developer's vision for 3,600 acres of bean fields
and raw land north of the city and next to the closed base.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to residential villages, the plan calls for 7 million
square feet of research, industrial and commercial development and a
"spine" of open space that would stretch the length of the
development along Jeffrey Road.</LD>
<TE>   The project area, referred to by developers as the Northern
Sphere, is owned by the Irvine Co. City officials have long planned
to annex the land.</TE>
<TE>   If they do, it would increase the city's size by about a third and
effectively complete the Irvine Co.'s development plans in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who attended the public hearing expressed concerns about
traffic, the future of the nearby military base and the strain the
new community would put on the city's financially troubled school
district.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Fred Judd said he was worried that families moving into
the new homes would be a burden on the Irvine Unified School
District, which is cutting science and music programs, closing an
elementary school and eliminating class-size reduction programs in
some grades to reduce a projected $5.2-million shortfall in next
year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if you're operating a conveyor belt that's pushing out
widgets without giving any forethought as to what's going to happen
when those widgets come out," Judd said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics Say Traffic Will Affect Neighborhoods</TE>
<TE>   While the Irvine Co. proposes widening stretches of Portola
Parkway, Sand Canyon Road, Irvine Avenue and Portola Parkway, some
residents said that road work won't be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When traffic gets congested along those roads, the cars are going
to move into our neighborhood streets," said Richard Deskin, a north
Irvine resident who served on a task force that reviewed the Irvine
Co.'s plans.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said last week's countywide vote on
Measure W should ease the fear of future gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W blocks the county's plan for an airport at the Marine
base and rezones it for parkland and other uses.</TE>
<TE>   But the Navy, which still owns the base, has since indicated it
might sell off the land, giving rise to suspicions the land might
eventually give way to homes and commercial uses, not a giant urban
park.</TE>
<TE>   Agran believes otherwise, though.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the decision on Measure W will likely make things much,
much easier for everybody because, of course, a Great Park generates
far, far less traffic than an international airport," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will discuss the project again April 9.</TE>

<HD>Kline's Bow Out of Race Opposed</HD>
<DH>Election: The lead write-in, Dana Point attorney John
Adams, says he will fight accused O.C. jurist's effort to quit
runoff--an exit legal experts call unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leading write-in candidate in the race to unseat an Orange County
judge charged with child molestation and possessing child pornography
said he opposes the jurist's efforts to withdraw from the race.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly half the write-in ballots counted as of late
Wednesday, Dana Point attorney John Adams had garnered 55%, Orange
County Registrar of Voters Rosalyn A. Lever said. Should that trend
continue, Adams will oppose Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline in a
November runoff.</LD>
<LD>   Kline's lawyers today are expected to ask a Superior Court judge
to take the unusual step of allowing Kline to bow out of the race,
nine days after he won a meager 33% of votes in the primary election
despite being the only name on the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Adams said Wednesday he is prepared--if allowed--to argue in court
against Kline's attempts to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline fails in his attempt to drop out of the election, his
name will appear on the ballot along with the top vote-getter among
write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But if Kline succeeds, Adams would face the next highest
vote-getter among the write-in candidates, election officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But county election officials and legal experts said Kline's
request has little chance of succeeding. Election law prevents
candidates from withdrawing their names unless they are appointed to
another office or die well before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be quite an uphill battle," said Frederic
Woocher, a Santa Monica attorney who specializes in election issues.
"The laws are pretty clear that you cannot withdraw at this time....
He'd have to prove that he died."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the legal hurdles, some of Kline's other opponents
announced unwavering support for the judge's effort to end his
reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle. That's what I had hoped for all along. That's why
I started all this in the first place," said Gay Sandoval, a Costa
Mesa lawyer who launched the first write-in effort against Kline.</TE>
<TE>   On the first floor of the registrar's Santa Ana offices, four
dozen election volunteers are working to determine the write-in
leader. Earning only $50 a day, the volunteers are laboring over more
than 230,000 ballots cast for write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The work is tedious. The counters, many of them retirees and
homemakers, complain of numerous paper cuts suffered in the name of
democracy. But morale remains high.</TE>
<TE>   "This here election is real history, let me tell you," said Joe
Folske, 76, who said he has worked in every county election since
1956.</TE>
<TE>   County election officials Wednesday released the first results of
the massive hand count of write-in ballots. With nearly half of the
votes tallied, Adams has established a clear lead over rivals with
55%. Sandoval was in second place, with 17%, and Costa Mesa
Councilwoman Karen Robinson was third, with 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials said the hand count could be completed as early
as next week.</TE>
<TE>   At the registrar's office, Adams was overjoyed by news of his
early lead. He acknowledged that if he remains first when all votes
are counted, he will stand a better chance in November's election if
his opponent is Kline rather than another write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But Adams said he also opposes on moral and legal grounds any
attempt by the judge to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like Kline is asking the judge to circumvent the law,
and that is the last thing I want to be promoting," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Lever said she believes the law would prohibit Kline from removing
his name. Still, she said her office will not oppose or support
Kline's request to withdraw but will carry out any court ruling.</TE>

<HD>In Reversal, Laguna Beach Delays Flood Project</HD>
<DH>Cities: Channel digging has to wait because utility lines
can't be moved before tourist season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing a previous decision, the Laguna Beach City Council voted
this week to put off a $10-million flood-control project for another
year because utility lines cannot be moved in time for the digging.</LD>
<LD>   Widening of the underground channel was supposed to start in
September. But public works engineers told the council Tuesday that
sewer, cable and telephone lines cannot be moved before the busy
summer tourist season, when work would have to be suspended. They
suggested relocating the lines beginning in September and starting
the project itself in September 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the only thing that's practical," City Manager Kenneth C.
Frank said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The project has been plagued by delays since its inception nearly
10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted in November to move forward despite requests by
city staffers that they be given more time to work out the logistics
and inform residents about the plumes of toxins that had pooled
beneath the construction site.</TE>
<TE>   But at that time, council members argued they could not afford
more postponements. They expressed concerns about losing $8.6 million
in county and federal funds and said lives and livelihoods would be
at stake if the channel is not widened before the next flood season.</TE>

<HD>LAX Foes OK With Hahn Vow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles International Airport expansion foes said Wednesday they
were satisfied with Mayor James K. Hahn's response to a letter they
sent last month conveying their concern about his new plan to
modernize the 40-year-old facility.</LD>
<LD>   A group of federal and local lawmakers had told the mayor they
were worried that he would complete his airport plans without
consulting residents. They urged him to reconsider pushing ahead with
his plan using old environmental studies, completed for predecessor
Richard Riordan's controversial $12-billion expansion plan.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn responded last week to the lawmakers, insisting that previous
environmental reports will be adequate. He said the LAX plan, to be
released this spring, will emphasize safety and security over growth.
It will limit the airport to 78 million passengers a year.</LD>
<TE>   "We're all very encouraged by the tone and the content of the
letter," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). The others were: Rep.
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), county Supervisor Don Knabe, Los
Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon
and Inglewood City Councilman Lawrence A. Kirkley.</TE>

<HD>Megan's Law Gets an Update</HD>
<DH>Crime: Information on sex offenders can now be provided
faster, attorney general tells law enforcement chiefs meeting in
Oxnard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public information on the identity and location of registered sex
offenders is being updated more frequently and is now available in 13
languages, the state's top prosecutor told a gathering of law
enforcement officials in Oxnard on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The improvements to Megan's Law, rolled out earlier this month,
mean people can learn more quickly about registered sex offenders who
may have moved into their neighborhood, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Information is now available in several languages, including
Spanish, Chinese and Korean.</LD>
<TE>   As 75 law enforcement chiefs from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San
Luis Obispo counties watched, Lockyer demonstrated how a computer
program instantly translates information with the touch of a
keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks, who attended the program, said
the changes will help parents who use Megan's Law to shield their
children from contact with sexual offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to rely on an occasional CD-ROM being sent to
jurisdictions," Brooks said. "Now, as soon as the Department of
Justice enters information into the system, it's accessible locally.
You will get immediate information on someone who you might be
concerned about in your neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The information is now on a Web site that can be accessed by
members of the public only under supervision by their local law
enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer outlined the changes to Megan's Law during a morning
session with regional law enforcement officials. The attorney general
periodically holds such briefings to learn about local public safety
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The last time he met with the tri-county group was about three
years ago, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Megan's Law was enacted in 1996 to provide public information on
the identity and whereabouts of 77,000 serious and high-risk,
registered sex offenders in the state.</TE>
<TE>   People can review the information, with supervision, at most
sheriff's stations and police departments in Ventura County, Brooks
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the state attorney general's office, there are 1,147
registered sex offenders living in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement awards also were announced at the meeting, held at
the Mandalay Beach Resort hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Salvation Army and Ward Jenssen of Malibu, a
psychologist who heads a volunteer research unit for the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department, were honored for exemplary public
service.</TE>

<HD>Migrant Student of Year a Study in Determination</HD>
<DH>Fillmore: Her mother's death devastated Mayra Magana. But
it also motivated her to succeed in school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Education has always been a top priority for 17-year-old Mayra
Magana. But when the Fillmore High School senior suddenly lost her
mother last year to liver failure, she felt her focus on academics
slipping.</LD>
<LD>   "It was really hard," Mayra said. "Not just because I have more
responsibility around the house and helping with my little sisters,
but the whole trauma of me needing her. But I know she wanted me to
do well in school; that was my motivation to study."</LD>
<LD>   Her hard work has not only earned her a 3.8 grade-point average,
but the title of migrant student of the year for both Fillmore
Unified School District and Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   "I was in shock," Mayra said. "I'm sure there were a lot of people
who deserved this as much as me, but it shows that all of my hard
work is paying off."</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the award, created through the state's migrant
education program, is to recognize the academic achievement of a
student whose migrant parents have worked in agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   When Mayra's family moved to Ventura County from a small farm in
Puruandiro, Mexico, 12 years ago, the only work her parents knew was
in the fields.</TE>
<TE>   As director of migrant education for Fillmore Unified, John
Zermeno seeks nominations from teachers and counselors. The student
with the most nominations wins.</TE>
<TE>   The winner from each school district then competes for top honors
in Ventura County. In addition to giving her a plaque honoring her
achievement, the county is sending Mayra and her father, Alfonso, to
the state migrant parent conference Friday through Sunday in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd annual conference will feature speakers and more than 100
workshops, many in Spanish, geared toward migrant parents. Topics
will include workers' rights, education and hazards in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We always have very distinguished speakers who support migrant
education and are able to communicate the importance of education to
the parents," said Frank Uribe, a state consultant with the migrant
education program.</TE>
<TE>   The students' portion of the conference includes a trip to the
Getty Museum, a workshop in which they learn about filling out
college applications and financial aid forms, and a banquet in which
they all receive medals for academic achievement.</TE>
<TE>   All 22 regional winners are guaranteed a minimum scholarship of
$500 through the state migrant education program.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no state winner," Uribe said. "We honor them all. To be
among the top 22 out of 250,000 migrant students identified in the
state is pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno said Mayra stands out because of her seriousness about
school.</TE>
<TE>   "Her whole family was undereducated," Zermeno said. "But Mayra is
a really hard worker, just like her sister."</TE>
<TE>   Mayra's sister Maleny earned the county's migrant student honor in
2000. She is studying at Pepperdine University in Malibu to become a
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Perez-Sandford, Fillmore Unified's migrant community
liaison, said Maleny Magana is receiving more than $110,000 in
scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents thought education was very important," Perez-Sandford
said. "It's so appropriate for both of these girls to get this award.
Especially for Mayra, though. She has such inner strength, and I know
she is missing her mom a lot."</TE>
<TE>   With graduation looming, Mayra is setting her sights on college,
with UC Berkeley heading up her list.</TE>
<TE>   She became interested after hearing a professor speak of the
school while she attended a migrant leadership conference at UCLA
last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to afford a campus visit, Mayra likes what she has seen on
the school's Web site. She plans to study international business and
then go on to law school.</TE>
<TE>   "There comes a time when you have to move on," Mayra said.
"College is a good way for me to become more independent. I just hope
I'm ready.</TE>
<TE>   "My father has already given me his blessing, so now all I need
are scholarships," she added.</TE>
<TE>   She said her father has continued to be a dedicated parent after
her mom's death and remains very involved in his children's
education.</TE>
<TE>   The family recently moved to Santa Paula to be closer to relatives
who will help raise Mayra's 9- and 10-year-old sisters after she goes
to college.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Mayra said she is thankful for the ride to school from a
neighbor, enabling her to finish her senior year at Fillmore. After
school, she helps around the house and takes care of her younger
sisters until her father gets home from his construction job.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what she does for fun, Mayra paused for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of time for me to go out and have fun right
now, but I know all of my hard work will be worth it in the end," she
said. "My mom would be really proud of me."</TE>

<HD>Council Closes Troubled Motel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday revoked the operating
permit of the Sunset Pacific Motel in Silver Lake, which police
called one of the most dangerous properties in the city.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-0 council vote came after a 20-year community effort to
shut down the motel. Police and neighbors have complained that the
three-story, 37-room building at 4301 Sunset Blvd. is a den of drug
use, shootings and prostitution.</LD>
<LD>   Owner Edward Eng, who had insisted that the motel was safe, said
in an interview before the council vote that he realized the motel
had become rundown. He said he wanted to apologize to the community.</LD>
<TE>   Eng said he was influenced by last week's City Council planning
and land use committee hearing, in which community members and police
officers spoke of how neighbors felt unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "I now realize there's a problem," said Eng, a lawyer and
accountant who lives in Los Feliz. "I'm not even going to object to
this."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti said before the vote that it was too late
for apologies from Eng.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a history of using every last legal avenue he has," said
Garcetti, whose district includes the motel. "He realized he was
backed into a corner and decided to turn a new face."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Eng argued that Los Angeles Police Department
officers paid homeless people to hang around his motel to scare
people into thinking it was a dangerous location--an accusation
police called ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   The property at Sunset Boulevard and Bates Avenue is in escrow for
sale to Balubhai and Sardaben Patel, who plan to convert it into a
national franchise motel.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Patel, a spokesman for the buyers, said the deal is expected
to be finalized in April. Eng reduced the price from $1.5 million to
$1.1 million, Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he plans to live at the motel while managing it to ensure
that drug dealers, gang members and prostitutes are no longer common
fixtures.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Projecting a $5.2-million budget shortfall for the next school year,
the Irvine Unified School District mailed more than 130 notices
Wednesday telling teachers they may not be rehired.</LD>
<LD>   State law requires school districts to give notice to teachers
whose continued employment is not guaranteed.</LD>
<LD>   Temporary staff usually receive such notices each year because
their jobs are contingent on funding, school board Trustee Steven
Choi said. This year many full-time teachers also are on the list.</LD>
<TE>   The number of layoffs will be determined later.</TE>
<TE>   The board voted in January to cut more than $5 million from
programs, such as science and arts instruction and class-size
reduction initiatives.</TE>

<LD>The Irvine Ranch Water District and the city of Irvine have voted to
oppose renewal of a federal waiver that allows the Orange County
Sanitation District to discharge sewage that is dirtier than allowed
by nearly all of the nation's 16,000 public water-treatment agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The waiver expires in 2003. The sanitation district's 25-member
board must decide this year whether to seek renewal from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   The water district and the city adopted the joint resolution
Tuesday, joining a handful of Orange County cities that have adopted

<LD>"Islam and Violence" is the topic for a free public conference at
Chapman University tonight.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of Sept. 11, "a lot of people have been taking it upon
themselves to comment on this topic," said Sabiha Khan, a spokeswoman
for the Southern California chapter of The Council on
American-Islamic Relations. The group is co-sponsoring the event with
the university and the California Council for the Humanities.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly, there has been a lot of incorrect information," she
said, "and we felt that the best way to correct these misconceptions
is for people who are knowledgeable on the subject to speak for
themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Included on the panel will be Sadullah Khan, executive director
and imam of the Islamic Center of Irvine; James Gelvin, a history
professor at UCLA; and Lina Kreidie, a political science professor at
UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The conference begins at 7 p.m. in the university's Beckman Hall,

<LD>The item here about the suspect who inadvertently gave away his
location by dialing 911 reminded John Bellah of a case he handled.</LD>
<LD>   Bellah, a police officer at Cal State Long Beach, said the
dispatch center there "received a series of 911 hang-up calls from
one of our dormitories. The dispatcher called the room and the
occupant answered, 'You just gotta send someone over here to help me
smoke this stuff.'"</LD>
<LD>   Bellah and another officer were sent to the location, all right,
and found the caller in the hall. The student not only repeated his
plea for help in smoking his stuff but reached into his pocket,
pulled out a container of marijuana, and handed it to Bellah's
partner.</LD>
<TE>   And, by the way, this was no undercover operation. The zonked-out
student apparently didn't notice that his visitors were wearing
police uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   We don't need a menu, thanks: On a visit to northern England,
Bruce Thompson found a bed-and-breakfast place in a town whose name
wouldn't translate well for Yanks (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Alphabet soup (cont.): I've talked about BLTs and various
offshoots--BLATs (avocado added) and BELTs (egg added). Another
reader spoke fondly of BLOATs (onion added).</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, Steve Gray of Mar Vista veered off in another
direction, declaring I had forgotten about his favorite: SLATs (Spam,
instead of bacon).</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and by the way: The recycling company's box that Michael Bird
of Calabasas spotted was not for sandwiches (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Maybe her husband gets the assignment: John Stevenson of
Chatsworth saw an ad for an outfit owned by someone who obviously
didn't like working in the garden (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Stabling would be a challenge: Perhaps the horse in another ad is
good-natured. But as F. Douglas of Morongo points out, you have to
wonder how much a 33-foot-tall creature could eat (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Razzing Reseda: After I mentioned how moviemakers seldom take note
of Reseda, Lance Robinson phoned and played me an excerpt of the song
"Screenwriter's Blues" by a group called Soul Coughing. Follow the
bouncing ball:</TE>
<TE>   And the radioman said that it's a beautiful night out there in Los
Angeles/You live in Los Angeles and you are going to Reseda/We are
all in someway or another going to Reseda to someday die/The radioman
laughed....</TE>
<TE>   Which makes another Reseda-centered ditty by Tom Petty sound
positively uplifting. As Jenifer Divine and several other readers
noted, Petty's "Free Fallin'" includes these lines:</TE>
<TE>   It's a long day living in Reseda/There's a freeway running through
the yard/All the vampires walking through the Valley/Move west down
Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   I think I'll fix myself a SLAT and go to bed.</TE>

they omitted my favorite part of the celebrity experience.

<HD>Panel Criticizes L.A. Officials' Role in Drug Dealer's
Pardon</HD>
<DH>Probe: A congressional report faults sheriff and lawmakers
for not looking more closely at the facts of the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional committee concludes that key Los Angeles leaders
helped a businessman's son--convicted drug dealer Carlos Vignali--win
early release from prison after they reaped political contributions
and other support from his father, according to a congressional
report to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The document by the House Government Reform Committee describes a
system in Los Angeles that permitted Vignali's well-heeled father not
only to gain access to civic leaders, but to get letters from them on
his son's behalf, "even though they knew little about the case and
had mixed motives" in helping the felon.</LD>
<LD>   The 476-page report is the committee's final and most
comprehensive account of its yearlong investigation into the pardons
scandal that erupted as President Clinton left the White House.</LD>
<TE>   It reveals for the first time that law enforcement authorities
were investigating the father, Vignali, for drug dealing as well, and
that an aide to former Rep. Esteban Torres of Los Angeles was the
go-between for the Vignali family and Clinton's brother-in-law in
securing the commutation.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali could not be reached for comment on the report's
allegations. Two attorneys who have represented the senior Vignali
said they had not seen the report and could not respond.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional report also says Clinton and his White House, in
the last moments of their administration, took at face value the word
of Los Angeles officials without hearing from the prosecutors and
judge who strongly opposed any early release of Carlos Vignali from
his lengthy prison term.</TE>
<TE>   "In his rush to grant pardons and commutations in the waning hours
of his presidency, Bill Clinton ignored almost every applicable
standard governing the exercise of the clemency power," the report
concludes. "Carlos Vignali satisfies none of the appropriate grounds
for commutation.... As a large-scale drug dealer, Vignali was not
eligible for clemency."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton has maintained that he did nothing improper in granting
177 pardons and commutations on his last day in office. Indeed, he
has said that he was striking out against a federal judicial system
that he claimed harshly punishes young drug offenders with long
prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is very explosive, and the Burton committee is very
partisan," Julia Payne, spokeswoman for Clinton, said Wednesday about
Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, the Republican chairman of the committee.
"It's a vicious partisan attack, and they never found any quid pro
quos."</TE>
<TE>   The report ends one of the final political squabbles over ethics
in the Clinton White House. The Burton committee went into great
detail about the Vignali case to show how easily someone could
ultimately succeed in getting what he wanted from the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali began a seven-year campaign to free his son in
1994, giving and raising money for a host of California politicians.
The campaign ended in 2001 with a payment of $204,200 to Clinton's
brother-in-law Hugh Rodham, a lawyer, who successfully convinced the
president that Carlos Vignali had served enough time: five years of a
15-year sentence, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Vignali was arrested in Los Angeles in 1994 and tried in
Minneapolis as the prime defendant in one of the largest cocaine
rings in Minnesota. He was convicted in December 1994.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, the report says, "Horacio Vignali, a successful Los
Angeles-area businessman, apparently used every tool at his disposal
to see that his son would not fully serve out his prison sentence."</TE>
<TE>   He "cultivated political contacts over time through substantial
campaign donations, fund-raising activity and civic involvement, and
directed his considerable resources to a concerted effort to lobby
President Clinton for an 11th-hour pardon of his son."</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali, in an interview with The Times when the scandal
first broke, suggested that he was merely a small businessman eager
to help his wrongly accused and unfairly sentenced son.</TE>
<TE>   The committee report, however, portrays him as a puppeteer getting
everything he wanted for his son.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali contributed more than $160,000 to state and
federal officeholders after his son was incarcerated, and many of
them also lobbied the White House for his son. They included
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, cardinal of the Catholic archdiocese of
Los Angeles, former U.S. Atty. Alejandro Mayorkas, former California
Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles Councilman
Richard Alatorre and Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca--many of
whom rued the negative press they received for their roles in
supporting Vignali.</TE>
<TE>   The report singles out Baca as instrumental in securing the
commutation, and says he "took a number of actions that could be seen
by the White House as supporting a grant of clemency."</TE>
<TE>   Report Strongly Criticizes Baca</TE>
<TE>   An internal White House note indicates that Rodham told White
House assistant Dawn Woollen that Baca "is more than happy to speak
with you about [Vignali] but is uncomfortable writing a letter
offering his full support."</TE>
<TE>   The congressional report adds that the White House note "supports
the conclusion that Sheriff Baca's actions have the effect of
assisting Horacio Vignali's effort to get his son out of prison but
[he] did not want to create a paper trail showing that he helped a
convicted cocaine dealer get out of prison."</TE>
<TE>   The report strongly criticizes Baca for continuing to insist he
opposed the commutation once the letter-writing campaign became
public.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's actions--including a letter and a telephone call to
Washington--made it "difficult to conceive what he thought he was
doing, if not assisting in the effort to get Carlos Vignali out of
prison," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   In one letter he drafted, Baca wrote that this "will confirm my
support for [Horacio] as a man of the highest integrity and
trustworthiness."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, other law enforcement officials were learning that
Horacio Vignali allegedly had drug problems of his own.</TE>
<TE>   The committee cited reports from the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration dating back to 1976 that Horacio "smuggled heroin into
the United States utilizing automobiles," and that in 1993, he was
"the source of supply for his son and functioned as a financial
partner" in a local drug organization.</TE>
<TE>   The report adds: "These charges have never been formally made in
court, or substantiated by physical evidence. However, the mere
existence of such allegations should have precluded senior law
enforcement and political officials from supporting a commutation for
Carlos Vignali on the strength of his father's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "However, it appears that no one checked with the DEA prior to
granting the commutation."</TE>
<TE>   Baca reacted sharply to the report Wednesday, saying that he is
being scapegoated by the former White House administration and
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing stinks. Vignali stinks. The White House stinks,
this report stinks," Baca said. "I basically am not happy with the
way this whole thing has evolved."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was told at the end of last month that federal
authorities had allegations of wrongdoing by Horacio Vignali. As a
result, Baca said, he returned $11,000 in campaign contributions from
the elder Vignali earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting With Rodham Described</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali's efforts to get his son pardoned were going
nowhere until 1999, when the son-in-law of former Rep. Torres, James
Casso, introduced the Vignalis to Rodham, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   The report says the introduction occurred at the Barrangas
restaurant in Los Angeles, where Rodham brought along others he was
trying to get pardons for "as a way of marketing his services."</TE>
<TE>   Casso declined to talk to the committee, and he could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali paid Rodham $4,200 at the outset. He handed Rodham
a binder of materials regarding the case, and the president's
brother-in-law "indicated that he would review the matter, make some
calls and get back to Horacio Vignali," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Rodham was paid the other $200,000 when Carlos Vignali was freed.</TE>
<TE>   But the committee said Rodham provided false information to the
White House about Vignali, most critically that the prosecutors in
Minnesota favored mercy for the young man.</TE>
<TE>   "This was completely false," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, who received campaign funds from Horacio Vignali,
later said he regretted not fully backgrounding the Vignali family.
"I went with my heart ... not my head," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report says Villaraigosa was apparently unaware that Vignali
had a criminal record and had dropped out of military school.</TE>
<TE>   Under those circumstances, Villaraigosa's characterization of
Vignali's resume as "'superior' was, at best, hyperbole and, at
worst, misleading."</TE>
<TE>   The episode eventually helped cost him the mayor's race in Los
Angeles last year, many believe, as fallout from the Clinton pardon
scandal rocked all the way from Washington to the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Alatorre also went to bat for Carlos Vignali, but he declined
Wednesday to discuss his involvement. "I'm a private citizen now," he
said. "This is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Mayorkas, in an interview Wednesday, said his "telephone call, as
limited and peripheral as it was, could in no way have been a factor
in a fair evaluation of the merits of the pardon application."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the report faults the Clinton White House for accepting
the opinion of "powerful Los Angeles political figures" and yet
failing to consult the Minnesota prosecutors or judge.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears," the report concludes, "that key White House staff
gave great weight to the input provided by Rodham, Baca and Mayorkas,
even though they knew little about the case and had mixed motives."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Rich Connell, Robert Lopez, Josh Meyer, Beth
Shuster and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.</TE>

pardons is available on The Times' Web site. Go to

<HD>Conviction for Murder Reversed</HD>
<DH>Appeal: Justices find in favor of ex-law student who has
served 16 years of her sentence for plotting robbery, slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 16 years, Gloria Killian has been serving state prison time for
being the mastermind behind a 1981 robbery and murder in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Killian had denied any wrongdoing, but testimony from an alleged
accomplice sealed her conviction. Although she had been a law school
student without any criminal record, she could find no way to prove
her innocence. Until Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As an inmate, she had become a law clerk at the California
Institute for Women in Frontera. She helped other women--particularly
those who had been battered--prepare appeals of their convictions.</LD>
<TE>   Now her own appeal has gone her way. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco on Wednesday reversed her conviction, saying
it was based on false testimony by a convict who was hoping for a
lighter sentence in return for helping prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Killian's bid for freedom was helped by Joyce Ride of Pasadena,
the mother of America's first woman astronaut, Sally Ride. After
Killian met Joyce Ride at the prison, Ride became convinced Killian
was not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Ride, who has been an activist on behalf of women
inmates for years, personally financed an investigation of the murder
and hired an appellate lawyer for Killian.  "I am deliriously happy;
I am having trouble coming off the ceiling," Ride said after hearing
about the 3-0 decision by the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Ride said she has visited Killian every other weekend for the last
eight years and considers her a good friend.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court ruled that Killian must be freed or given a new
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Trying Killian again would be difficult, given that the sole
witness against her is Gary Masse, who was described by 9th Circuit
Judge Michael D. Hawkins, a former prosecutor, as a "thoroughly
discredited" perjurer in Wednesday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said that Masse had lied to the jury both in
describing Killian as the "mastermind" of a robbery plot that led to
murder and about the fact that he had made a deal for leniency in
return for his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said
Wednesday that attorneys in that office are reviewing the decision to
determine their next move. "It is a difficult case," Barankin
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Masse's testimony in a separate trial stemming from the same
murder played a key role in sending another man, Stephen DeSantis, to
death row in San Quentin. Appellate lawyers for DeSantis were
challenging that sentence until last week when he died of natural
causes, according to Warden Jeanne Woodford.</TE>
<TE>   If Killian, now 56, secures her freedom, she wants to finish law
school and continue to help other inmates, according to her appellate
lawyer, William J. Genego of Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Killian's troubles started in December 1981 after DeSantis and
Masse broke into the home of a Sacramento couple, Ed and Grace
Davies, hogtied them and robbed them of six suitcases full of silver.
During the crime, Ed Davies was shot and killed; his wife was also
shot, but survived.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the murder, an anonymous phone call to Sacramento
authorities identified DeSantis and Masse, who are cousins, as the
perpetrators. When police went looking for Masse, his wife told them
"a woman named Gloria" had planned the robbery. A few days later,
Masse surrendered to the police and Killian was arrested. But after a
preliminary hearing, charges against her were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Masse was convicted of first degree felony murder in May 1983 and
sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Soon after being
sentenced, he contacted the Sacramento sheriff's office "to see if
any deals could be struck," according to the 9th Circuit decision.</TE>
<TE>   After being told that prosecutors would help him obtain a sentence
reduction, Masse implicated his cousin, DeSantis, and Killian, who
was a casual acquaintance. After he agreed to help the prosecutors,
Masse's sentence was recalled at the request of the prosecution and
he remained in custody without a sentence for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Killian was rearrested in June 1983 and charged, along with
DeSantis. DeSantis was tried first and testified that Killian was not
involved in the planning or commission of the crime and that he had
never met her or heard of her.</TE>
<TE>   DeSantis also testified that Masse had told him about a prior
aborted attempt to rob the Davies family in which Masse's wife tried
to get into the home by telling the Davies she needed to make a phone
call.</TE>
<TE>   Masse was the key witness against Killian at her 1986 trial. In
addition to testifying that she dreamed up the plot, Masse said that
Killian accompanied him to the Davies home during the earlier robbery
attempt. He also testified that after the robbery, she called to
demand a share of the proceeds. Masse also swore that he had no
leniency deal with the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Killian was convicted of first degree felony murder, robbery and
conspiracy and received a sentence of 32 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit decision emphasized that Masse was the "make or
break witness" against her.</TE>
<TE>   After Killian exhausted her state court appeals, Genego raised
perjury allegations at a hearing before federal Magistrate Judge
Gregory Hollows in Sacramento in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, Masse admitted that he had told several lies in
the crucial elements of his testimony. Among them were that in
reality he had a leniency deal, that Killian was not the "master
planner" of the robbery and that she had not called demanding a share
of the robbery proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Masse's disregard for the truth is best revealed by a letter he
wrote to the prosecutor shortly after Killian's trial [while awaiting
his own resentencing] in which he emphasized that he 'lied [his] ass
off on the stand' for the government," Hawkins noted in his opinion
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That letter was never disclosed to Killian; nor was one that
prosecutors sent under seal to a Sacramento trial judge stating its
intention to support Masse's resentencing as a result of his
cooperation. Masse subsequently had his sentence reduced to life with
possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   The letters were discovered years later in DeSantis' challenge to
his death sentence and were given to Genego by DeSantis' attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Masse also admitted at the hearing before Hollows that if he had
told the truth at Killian's trial, "it would have taken Killian out
of participating in the crime," the 9th Circuit decision noted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Masse's admissions, Hollows recommended to U.S. District
Judge Garland E. Burrell that the conviction be upheld; Burrell
accepted the recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell ruled that the level of prejudice Killian suffered as a
result of each perjurious statement was insufficient to conclude that
reasonable jurors would have doubts about the verdict they rendered.</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals court said that Burrell had interpreted the
relevant cases too narrowly.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Masse perjured himself several times and because he was
the 'make or break witness' for the state, there is a reasonable
probability that, without all the perjury, the result of the [trial]
would have been different," Judge Hawkins wrote. His decision was
joined by Judges Procter Hug Jr. and Dorothy W. Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate judges also emphasized that the prosecutors "took
advantage of Masse's perjury, regarding his deal, arguing at closing
that 'we have nothing to do with how much time Gary Masse serves.'"</TE>
<TE>   Christopher T. Cleland, the Sacramento deputy district attorney
who prosecuted the case, said he had not yet read the decision, but
characterized it as "a gross miscarriage."</TE>
<TE>   Cleland said he still believes that Masse told the truth at trial.
"The 9th Circuit isn't going to tell me [otherwise]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the letter in which Masse admitted lying, Cleland said
it was simply "an attempt to get our attention" while Masse was
awaiting resentencing. "It is much ado about nothing."</TE>
<TE>   But veteran defense lawyer Genego described the case "as one
of the most egregious and serious violations of a person's right to a
fair trial that I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Genego said, "There is no question that the prosecutors had an
ethical obligation to bring that letter to the attention of the court
and Killian or her lawyer."</TE>

<HD>Officials Clash Over Adult Literacy Plan</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified chief denounces Polanco for pushing
program privately with board, which OKd contract. Probe is launched.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND and SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Senate majority leader Richard Polanco has waged a
behind-the-scenes campaign for a $6.3-million adult literacy program
in Los Angeles schools, sparking a public clash with district Supt.
Roy Romer.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts by Polanco (D-Los Angeles) also raised questions about
whether he violated the state's open meeting law in pitching the
program to school board members.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Unified School District's inspector general said
Wednesday that he would launch an investigation into that.</LD>
<TE>   Polanco, who had met privately with school board members on the
issue over the last year, announced Tuesday that he "was counting
votes" for a contract with Reality Based Learning, a Redmond, Wash.,
company that sells Internet educational programs.</TE>
<TE>   His statement at the school board meeting and the board's 4-3
approval of the contract set off political shock waves in the
district. Romer denounced Polanco's actions, and Polanco responded
angrily.</TE>
<TE>   Their exchange raised concerns among some in the district that the
episode could hurt L.A. Unified's relationships in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the contract said that its supporters on the school
board wanted to curry favor with Polanco, whose influence is
important in many of Los Angeles' heavily Latino communities and in
the current redrawing of board members' district boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Board members who voted yes said Polanco's political power played
no role in their decisions. The senator denied that his actions broke
any rules.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the contract to institute the program at seven
adult schools even though district lawyers warned them that Polanco's
private meetings might have violated the state Brown Act's
regulations on how a public agency can develop a consensus on a
policy. Those meetings may have been the type of serial sessions the
law prohibits, the attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he was amazed by Polanco's "gall" and accused the
senator of trying to muscle a single company past competitive
bidding.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the way to do business," Romer told Polanco at
Tuesday's meeting. "There is nobody in this staff recommending that
we buy into this program."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco said the district was not spending enough on adult
literacy in immigrant communities and that the Internet program would
offer a valuable service for parents trying to learn English.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not interested to have a public fight with you, but you chose
the public fight," he told Romer. Polanco later said that he has no
financial interest in the program and that his main concern is to
help immigrant families better themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the contentious hearing, Romer told Polanco to
sit down. The senator complied but then returned to the lectern and
refused to cede it.</TE>
<TE>   The vote spotlighted weaknesses in the district's procurement
operation that allows contractors direct access to board members,
Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not just worried about the money, I'm worried about what this
does to the ethics of this district," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco said he learned about the literacy program from its chief
executive, Gary Anderson, last year in Sacramento. The senator said
40,000 schoolchildren in Washington and Canada use the program.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other contractor that has this technology," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But school district staff found several problems with the Reality
Based Learning program and recommended against it.</TE>
<TE>   In a report to Romer, staffers said the literacy materials were
not geared to adults, and would have to be retooled at district
expense. They also determined that the materials did not fit the
state's academic standards for students who speak limited English.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Genethia Hayes, who introduced the motion for the
contract, said she considered the proposal in part to patch up a
rocky relationship with Polanco. But Hayes said she voted for it on
its merits.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it holds great promise for Latino parents, Korean
parents, any parents trying to transition themselves into English,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hayes, board members David Tokofsky, Julie
Korenstein and Jose Huizar voted for the materials. Board President
Caprice Young and board members Marlene Canter and Mike Lansing voted
no.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco began visiting the school board members about a year ago,
taking Anderson along.</TE>
<TE>   The senator said he did not pressure anyone to vote for the
contract, and he insisted that the meetings did not violate the Brown
Act because he never met with more than one board member at a time.</TE>
<TE>   But L.A. Unified lawyers say the meetings could pose a legal
problem. The law prohibits officials from a series of individual
meetings with "personal intermediaries" to develop a consensus on a
measure before them.</TE>
<TE>   "What raises concerns is that Polanco was collecting votes on a
specific motion that was pending before the board," said Hal
Kwalwasser, the district's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Several district officials questioned why Polanco was so
aggressive in pitching the program from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Canter, who ran a teacher training business for several years
before she joined the board, said she was unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like the program from the beginning," she said.</TE>

<HD>Officers' Gun Buys Probed</HD>
<DH>Documents: Letters authorizing police personnel to purchase
assault rifles may have been faked, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT  and SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police officers are under investigation for allegedly
using fraudulent documents to purchase law-enforcement-only versions
of assault rifles before the weapons were banned, according to law
enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The precise number of officers whose actions are being
investigated is unclear, but as many as 40 suspect letters were
seized from one gun dealer and many others are under review.</LD>
<LD>   Any officer who faked a letter to obtain an assault weapon could
be guilty of a felony and could also face LAPD discipline, according
to state laws and Police Department guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   State and local investigators are scrutinizing letters the
officers were required to provide from police superiors stating that
they had been given departmental permission to buy the weapons.
Investigators suspect that the signatures on many of the letters were
forged or that the names of the supervisors were not accurate,
according to sources familiar with the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general's
office, confirmed Wednesday that her agency had an ongoing
investigation regarding the illegal sale and purchase of assault
weapons and that some of the transactions may involve police
officers.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who heads that department's Internal
Affairs Division, said the Police Department was conducting an
investigation of its officers in conjunction with the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. As of now, he said, no action has
been taken against any officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're examining the conditions under which the purchases were
made," Lorenzen said. He added that if any documents were forged,
that could violate federal law as well as LAPD policy.</TE>
<TE>   One law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said a search warrant served on one gun dealer yielded as many as 40
letters on Police Department letterhead stating that the officers had
permission to buy the firearms. Some investigators have indicated
that they believe some or all of those letters may be fraudulent.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, a specific allowance for the sale of assault
weapons was made for any police officer "authorized by his or her
employer to possess or receive the assault weapon."</TE>
<TE>   The law defined that authorization as a written certification from
the head of the officer's agency and said it must identify the
officer and the weapon that the officer was permitted to possess. The
law does not specify whether the "head of the agency" would mean that
only the top officer, in this case the chief of police, would have
the power to issue such an authorization or whether "agency" might be
construed as an individual police station or division.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has long been a supporter of strong
gun control laws. Early in his tenure as chief, Parks advocated the
collection and destruction of all assault rifles in circulation, a
position that earned him praise and scorn among police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' stance on assault weapons may have led some officers to
conclude that department supervisors would not have approved their
requests to purchase the guns, some officials suggested.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the probe, state and federal investigators have seized
documents from gun dealers who sold the weapons to officers.  "If the
letters were forged, that's not a good thing," said Lawrence Wolff,
an Encino gun dealer whose records were seized by investigators from
the ATF and the state Department of Justice. "It's like any other
forgery. It's pretty rotten."</TE>
<TE>   Wolff said he sold 200 to 300 assault rifles to police officers
from several Southland agencies before the ban. Among the records
seized from Wolff, he said, were letters that officers said were
signed by supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff said he had no idea whether any of those letters were
forged.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons that officers purchased from dealers before the ban
went into effect were discounted. Wolff said he sold assault rifles
to officers at $800 apiece, although a private citizen would have
paid as much as $2,500 for a similarly equipped weapon. Such
discounts were common among dealers who were selling to police, Wolff
said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI and Justice Department are investigating letters received by
Latino attorneys and community organizations across the nation over
the last four days containing hateful ranting and a white powder.</LD>
<LD>   Samples of the powder, which have tested negative for anthrax in
at least 40 incidents from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., have been
sent to FBI laboratories for further analysis, U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Perpetrators of criminal acts, targeting Americans because of
their race or heritage, will not be permitted," Ashcroft said.</LD>
<TE>   One of the single-page, single-spaced letters was opened Monday by
a staffer at the California Chicano News Media Assn. in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Moran, the association's executive director, said, "She
didn't notice the powder until she was preparing to make a photocopy
of the letter, which tilted, spilling the stuff on the machine and
her pant leg," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a generic letter, full of ranting and raving that was not
addressed to us specifically--except for the envelope," he said. "It
was postmarked Oakland."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland attorney Robert Salinas said he was doused with a white
mist when he opened a letter in his office Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It only took the Fire Department a few minutes to determine that
it wasn't anthrax, but it ruined my day," Salinas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The anger expressed in the letter was so intense. I'm concerned
about what other steps might the person or people who did this take."</TE>
<TE>   Other letters were received by 30 Latino lawyers in the East Bay
and by offices of La Pena Cultural Center in Berkeley; the National
Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials; the La Raza Lawyers
Assn. of California; the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund; the League of United Latin American Citizens; the
National Council of La Raza, and the National Assn. of Hispanic
Journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Five deaths were linked to anthrax-laced letters mailed to
journalists, politicians and government officials in Florida,
Washington and New York last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I do civil rights work," Salinas said. "These letters indicate
there's a lot more work to be done."</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Accused of Stalling Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Five congressional Republicans accused Democratic Gov. Gray Davis on
Wednesday of ''stonewalling'' their investigation of California's
electricity troubles, saying he failed to deliver requested documents
and fully answer questions.</LD>
<LD>   Given that California is seeking federal help to resolve its power
problems, five members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
wrote to Davis, ''The inadequacy of your response leads us to believe
that you may be stonewalling the Committee's review of the energy
crisis.''</LD>
<LD>   Davis fired back, accusing the congressmen of trying to embarrass
him politically.</LD>
<TE>   ''We sent them thousands of pages of documents,'' said Davis press
secretary Steve Maviglio. ''Many of the things they asked for, a
sixth-grader on the Internet could find. Many of the things they
asked for don't exist.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is another one of these Republican investigations on
Capitol Hill that are designed to embarrass and not solve problems,''
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was signed by committee Chairman W.J. ''Billy'' Tauzin
of Louisiana and Reps. Joe Barton of Texas, James Greenwood of
Pennsylvania, Richard Burr of North Carolina and George Radanovich,
the committee vice chairman who is from Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall Tauzin's committee held hearings on California's
electricity crisis and in November asked for documents and written
responses to dozens of questions. Many related to alleged conflicts
of interest by some consultants hired by the Department of Water
Resources. The department took over the job of buying power for three
major utilities on the verge of bankruptcy in January 2001 as
blackouts threatened the state.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Davis asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to void or modify 22 of the long-term power contracts signed by the
state last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The state argues that it was forced to pay unjust and unreasonable
prices in those contracts to ensure that the lights stayed on in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin demanded full responses to all questions by March 26.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Police Investigate Church Sex Dismissals</HD>
<DH>Religion: Cardinal Mahony's ouster of priests triggers
'general inquiries' by LAPD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department is reviewing whether any cases of
child sexual abuse in the Los Angeles Archdiocese require criminal
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The probe was begun in response to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's
recent dismissal of as many as a dozen priests alleged to have
sexually abused minors.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony has declined to publicly discuss the dismissals, and the
archdiocese has been unwilling to comment on whether it reported
those abuse cases to law enforcement authorities. Church authorities
also have declined to say whether the priests were moved to other
parts of the archdiocese after the cases came to their attention.
Sources familiar with the dismissals have said the priests had
received psychological counseling and were believed to have been
rehabilitated.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD Lt. Daniel Mulrenin said the department's Sexually Exploited
Child Unit is conducting "general inquiries" into those dismissals.
The archdiocese  is "cooperating ... there is an open dialogue," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulrenin said the inquiries were initiated in response to a March
4 Times story that quoted church sources as saying that between six
and 12 priests accused of sexual abuse had been ousted from the
archdiocese in the preceding two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires teachers, clergy and members of other
professions to report suspicions of child abuse to authorities in
most cases.</TE>
<TE>   The priests' dismissals stem from incidents that occurred as long
as a decade ago, according to church sources. But since a scandal
over the sexual abuse of minors erupted in the Boston Archdiocese in
January, dioceses nationwide have come under increasing pressure to
address sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Mulrenin said the police probe is in its "very early stages." So
far, he said, the archdiocese has not handed over any documents
because that issue is "still being discussed." There are no named
suspects, he said, and he did not know if any allegations had been
previously reported to law enforcement. Under the law, prosecutors
have a year to file charges after such crimes are reported to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mahony, Tod Tamberg, said the archdiocese would
not comment on reports of discussions with police.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a popular Orange County priest accused of
sexual molestation was forced to resign by the bishop of Orange, the
Most Rev. Tod D. Brown.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the publicity involving the dismissals, priests
last Sunday across the Los Angeles archdiocese read a statement from
Mahony that denounced the "scandalous evil of child abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The church, the cardinal said, will not hire or employ priests
when an individual has been shown to have engaged in sexual abuse.
The state law classifies clergy as "mandated reporters" required to
report to police or a child protective services agency suspicions of
child abuse. If, however, the claim of sexual abuse is made during a
confession, a priest does not have to disclose it.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, prosecutors said, there is an exception for adults
who tell a mandated reporter that they suffered abuse as a child.
Prosecutors said the law presumes the adult victim can call police.
This exception does not apply, however, when the adult is reporting
on behalf of another victim.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony last week ordered that an informational brochure on clergy
sex abuse be sent to all parishes and schools in the archdiocese. The
brochure, "Respecting the Boundaries: Keeping Ministerial
Relationships Healthy and Holy," was first posted on the
archdiocese's Web site in August.</TE>
<TE>   The brochure and the sex abuse hotline telephone number listed
within it were required of the Los Angeles Archdiocese and the
Diocese of Orange as part of a $5.2-million settlement. The agreement
stemmed from a lawsuit involving sexual molestation allegations
against an Orange County priest.</TE>
<TE>   That settlement also required the church to remove any employee
found guilty of sexual abuse. That position was reflected in a Feb.
22 pastoral statement by Mahony vowing that any priest or deacon
found to have abused a minor "will never return to active ministry."</TE>
<TE>   An earlier policy, adopted by the archdiocese in 1988, allowed the
possibility of treating the guilty party and eventually returning him
to ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese with 292 parishes in Los Angeles, Ventura and
Santa Barbara counties has received six child molestation complaints
in the last five years, said its attorney, John P. McNicholas.</TE>

<HD>City Leaders Praise Passage of Prop. Q</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-ranking city, police and fire officials gathered in North
Hollywood on Wednesday to celebrate the passage of Proposition Q, a
$600-million bond measure to upgrade emergency facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The general-obligation bond will pay for the replacement of the
city's emergency operations center and four aging police stations. It
also will pay for two new stations--in the Valley and
Mid-Wilshire--two bomb squad facilities and a downtown jail, as well
as for repairs at other police and fire stations.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the North Hollywood police station, the city's newest,
City Council President Alex Padilla joined Mayor James K. Hahn,
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Fire Chief William Bamattre and others
to thank voters for supporting the measure.</LD>
<TE>   "Investing in public safety is an investment in the city," said
Padilla, suggesting that support "from every corner" indicated that
Valley voters don't want to secede.</TE>
<TE>   Praising the City Council for its leadership on the issue, Hahn
said it was "time to support the men and women who are our first
responders" to emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said that Proposition Q would benefit the entire city,
because "most of our stations will have upgrades."</TE>
<TE>   The measure needed two-thirds of the vote to pass. About 15,000
votes have yet to be counted, but it now has 66.79% of the vote, said
Grace Chavez, a spokeswoman for the registrar-recorder's office.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Afriat, campaign manager for the Yes on Proposition Q
Campaign, said the uncounted ballots were unlikely to change the
results.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, who headed a group of
secessionists and taxpayer groups in opposing the proposition, said
he thinks voters were confused.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, a lot of people thought they were voting for more
officers, but all they're getting is more buildings," Close said.</TE>

<HD>No Injuries in Collapse of Store Roof</HD>
<DH>Accident: Authorities estimate damage at $250,0000 at
Hannam Super in La Palma.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of the roof collapsed Wednesday at a supermarket in La Palma,
causing about $250,000 in damage, authorities said. No one was
injured.</LD>
<LD>   About a fourth of the roof fell in on the 25,000-square-foot
Hannam Super on La Palma Avenue, said Capt. Stephen Miller, a
spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority. The collapse, which
occurred about 8:30 a.m., triggered a sprinkler system that
automatically alerted fire departments, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "It collapsed just as the first employees were arriving," Miller
said. "If it had happened a little later, there could have been a lot
of injuries."</LD>
<TE>   Miller said it is common for market roofs to bear thousands of
pounds of weight from air-conditioning systems and compressors for
refrigeration units inside the stores. Investigators said that weight
may have caused the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the damage estimate could rise as the debris is
cleared and the store's owners determine how much merchandise was
destroyed.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco to Drop Local Runoff Elections</HD>
<DH>Ballots: Voters will rank candidates by preference in
primaries. Critics call process too complicated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>This progressive city recently became the country's first to allow
voters to rank candidates by preference in local primaries,
eliminating the need for costly runoff elections.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition A, approved last week by 55% of city voters, is
expected to save $2 million a year in election costs, draw more
voters to the polls and possibly become a national model that helps
third-party candidates, say its supporters.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the confusing system will be bungled by elections
officials already under investigation by the secretary of state for
losing and miscounting ballots.</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to be a disaster," said James Stearns, a San
Francisco political consultant who opposed the measure. "This system
is far too complex to be implemented by the San Francisco Department
of Elections, which has been trying very hard to provide quality
elections but which has consistently come up short."</TE>
<TE>   But proponents say that instant runoff elections are long overdue
and are being considered in other Bay Area cities such as Oakland and
Berkeley and as far away as Vermont and Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one-stop shopping, and it just makes things so much
easier for voters," said Caleb Kleppner, a San Francisco project
director for the Center for Voting and Democracy. "The way things are
run now, people go to the polls in November and then turn around and
return again in another five weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, only 15% of registered voters turned up at
the polls in the December runoff for local district attorney. In
previous years, the December turnout dropped as much as 50% from the
previous month. "It's outrageous," Kleppner said. "That December 2000
runoff cost the city $29 per voter--triple what it should. It's
obvious things weren't working."</TE>
<TE>   The old system required the two top vote recipients in a
multi-candidate race to enter a runoff election five weeks later if
no one received more than 50% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition A, voters rank their first, second and third
choices. If no one gets at least 50%, the candidate with the fewest
first-place votes is eliminated. All the people who voted for that
losing candidate then see their votes recast in favor of their second
choice. The lowest-tallying candidate in each round is eliminated,
and the process repeats until a majority is won.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Eshelman, a legislative aide for Supervisor Matt Gonzalez, the
new system's lead supporter, said saving money wasn't the only
consideration: "We think this system goes a long way to cut out the
negative campaigning that goes on before each runoff election."</TE>
<TE>   In primary races with more than two candidates, most political
advertising deals with issues rather than personal attacks, Eshelman
said. But once the battle narrows to two hopefuls, "the gloves come
off and the voters end up losing under a barrage of nasty campaign
ads," he said. Many lesser-funded candidates also run out of money to
pay for TV ads before runoffs, which favors the better-bankrolled
candidates, advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   If a runoff had been used in the 2000 presidential election,
advocates say, voters who preferred Ralph Nader could have listed
George W. Bush, Al Gore or another candidate as their second choice.
"This way, people like Ralph Nader and the Green Party won't get
blamed for spoiling any more elections," Eshelman said. "We hope this
is going to be used as a national model."</TE>
<TE>   Ross Mirkarimi, a spokesman for the California Green Party, called
the new system "more considerate of a multi-party system."</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond the Democrats and Republicans, third parties are often
locked out of many elections," he said. "This has been tried and
tested in many foreign countries, and it works. It's an issue of
equity against machine politics."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco City Administrator Bill Lee said the new system
could be used as early as November, depending on how quickly
elections officials can install the necessary computer software.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns said the system will spell trouble for the city because it
will not be applied to statewide races on the same ballot.</TE>

<LD>Authorities Wednesday identified some of the 13 people shot to death
in the Los Angeles area since Friday, as the death toll continued to
grow.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators have brief or no descriptions of the more than a
dozen men involved in the 11 unrelated shootings. Nor have they
determined the killers' motives, although at least one shooting was
gang-related and another appeared to be a robbery attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The latest attack occurred Wednesday evening at East 8th and Wall
streets in southeast Los Angeles when someone in a car opened fire on
a man and a teenager before fleeing. The man was dead on arrival at
the hospital, and the youth, 17, was in stable condition.</LD>
<TE>   Two Los Angeles men, Julius James Jefferson, 20, and Eric
Beverett, 21, were fatally wounded in a drive-by attack Friday
outside a mini-mart in South Los Angeles. A stray bullet fired by the
killers critically wounded a 62-year-old woman near 47th Street and
Vermont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, 48-year-old Roberto Chamale and his son were
shot outside their apartment building on Dobbs Street near Cal State
Los Angeles by someone who had asked their gang affiliation, police
said. Chamale died.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of eight shootings occurred Monday and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Drive-by shooters Monday night killed Ruby Ceasar, 54, of San
Bernardino as she talked with a group at South Figueroa and 84th
streets. Also shot was 41-year-old Derrick Brooks of Los Angeles, who
died. The gunmen, in a white, Chevy Caprice, wounded three others.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, a 34-year-old father of two was killed while
sitting in a car in the 140 block of 111th Place in southeast Los
Angeles. The coroner identified him as Michael Anthony Gilmore, a
local resident.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even know why he was there," said Los Angeles Police
Det. Bill Smith. "We're at the beginning stages of this. Right now,
it's real sketchy."</TE>
<TE>   David George Drew, 47, of Compton has been identified as the man
found shot outside a Carson grocery store. He was killed at 8:20p.m.
Monday near the loading dock of Notrica's Supermarket on South Avalon
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Police also are continuing their search for the two men who killed
20-year-old Ruben Atilano, a reputed Boyle Heights gang member who
was shot Monday evening while warming up his car in front of his home
in the 500 block of Brittania Street.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Scott Smith said investigators have interviewed several
witnesses, all of whom were reluctant to give detailed descriptions
of the gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe that the shooters were members of a rival gang
and that Atilano's death was the continuation of an ongoing turf war.</TE>
<TE>   Still at large are three men, all ages 20 to 25, who had been
chasing others when they killed a 42-year-old man standing in the
1200 block of South Lake Street on Tuesday, police said. The killers
drove a blue Chevy Suburban.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are withholding the man's name until his family is
notified, Det. John Motto said.</TE>
<TE>   A 38-year-old man who died of multiple gunshot wounds on a Compton
sidewalk was apparently the victim of a robbery attempt, police said.
He was found at 3:30a.m. Tuesday in the 500 block of Matthisen
Avenue. Police have no suspects, and withheld his name until they
could notify his family.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police are hoping for tips from the public regarding the
fatal shooting Monday of Leo B. Payne III, 25, in the parking lot of
a 7-Eleven at Centinela and Eucalyptus avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Officials still have no suspects in the shooting of Javier Ibarra,
18, who was killed while walking in the 1700 block of West 96th
Street.</TE>

<HD>Slow-Growth Activists Seek Stricter Limits on Simi Valley
Development</HD>
<DH>SOAR: New campaign would cut two canyons and ranches from
the city's expansion zone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after pushing through a local growth-control ordinance,
activists announced a new campaign Wednesday that would further rein
in Simi Valley's plans for expansion.</LD>
<LD>   If the latest bid by the slow-growth group SOAR is successful, it
would clip Alamos and Brea canyons and Marr and Runkle Canyon ranches
from the city's expansion zone.</LD>
<LD>   That effectively would require voter approval for any project
outside the city's current boundaries.</LD>
<TE>   The measure could cripple developer Unocal's plans for The
Canyons, a major business park and 1,600-home development northwest
of the city, which City Council members have identified as the
primary venue for new job creation over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   It also could jeopardize other developers' plans to build more
than 500 additional homes in areas the city had planned to annex in
coming years. Unocal consultant Elaine Freeman said the company has
yet to decide how it will proceed but is frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters approved a SOAR line and that should be honored," she
said. "If you set rules and the voters approve them, you should
respect the voters' wishes."</TE>
<TE>   City officials who agreed to back SOAR in 1998--with the caveat
that the canyon areas would be included in growth boundaries--also
are angry about the latest plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We had an agreement," said Mayor Bill Davis. "We said, 'We'll let
it go to the ballot.' I said, 'Heck I'll even endorse it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Endorsements such as his convinced 70% of voters to enact a
slow-growth policy that year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now [SOAR is] saying, 'You know what, that agreement was OK in
1998 but it's not today,'" he said. "If I'd known that, I would have
fought them right then and there.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose, if SOAR gets their way and we bring our line back to
the city boundary, we lose 20 years of industrial growth," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only area left in the city to grow jobs. That means
everybody who moves to Simi Valley is going to have to leave town to
work. And that's something that we've been trying to avert for the
last 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   However, SOAR activists remain unapologetic.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Conville, a school equipment salesman and longtime Simi
Valley resident, said he and others cut the agreement they did with
city leaders because they were strapped for time.</TE>
<TE>   SOAR's push in 1998 was countywide, he said, and the feeling then
was that it was best to get something passed by Simi Valley voters
right away and save the fine-tuning for later.</TE>
<TE>   "We conceded too much," Conville said. "We knew the line was
larger than many of us wanted. We discussed in 1998 that we would
very likely be revisiting this issue."</TE>
<TE>   He also disagreed that jobs in a new business park would be filled
by local residents.</TE>
<TE>   It's just as likely, according to Conville, that residents from
the San Fernando Valley will go after those jobs, resulting in
traffic jams each morning and evening as commuters head into and out
of Simi Valley.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / HOLLYWOOD</KH>
<HD>Landmark Beckons, but Stands Out of Reach</HD>
<DH>The Hollywood sign symbolizes the glamour of the film
capital for visitors, and many are not satisfied with a view, or
pictures, from afar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They had come 3,000 miles to clamber up a steep dirt ridge and pose
for pictures. With upturned palms, David Rothman and Kathy Mamo tried
to create the illusion that they were holding up the Hollywood sign.</LD>
<LD>   "The sign has a lot of meaning to me because of all the
celebrities," said Rothman, 49, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who was
treating his fiancee to her first tour of the film capital. "Where
did all the stars originate? Hollywood. Hollywood is the theme, the
word. If you dissect the word, it would tell us: It's glamour, it's
shine, it's drama, the names, the people, the past and present.
Everything revolves around the word."</LD>
<LD>   Mamo laughed. She joked that they had come up the mountain to talk
to God, and finally pick a wedding date.</LD>
<TE>   "He thinks it's to see the sign," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But, yes, it was about the sign. Like millions of tourists, Mamo
was drawn here by a force she found difficult to fully explain: to
see the sign, get close to it, feel the strength of its aura.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked her, 'Is there anything you really want to do?'" said
Cynthia Price, a friend who was showing the couple around Los
Angeles. "She said, 'I want to get a picture of the Hollywood sign.'"</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1920s, the sign has been one of the world's most
photographed landmarks. When Price has guests in town, she takes them
on a circuit that includes the Sunset Strip, Melrose Avenue,
Hollywood Boulevard, Santa Monica Beach, Malibu and Rodeo Drive--and
the sign. Seeing the Hollywood sign is always special to them, like
visiting the Eiffel Tower.</TE>
<TE>   "People always talk about trying to get near it--trying to touch
it," Price said. "When you come to L.A., what other monument do we
have like this?"</TE>
<TE>   The sign's bold block letters--each one 45 feet tall--are somehow
perfect for conveying the power and grandeur of the film world.
Stripped across the summit of 1,700-foot Mt. Lee, like a banner
heralding the gods of Olympus, it's the trademark for a culture of
limousines and sex and tragedy. The sign also conceals: It is the
dream you see but can never quite reach.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks, the Hollywood sign
cannot be directly experienced. You cannot touch it, much less ride
to the top. You cannot run your hands across it, examine the broad
pieces of sheet metal, explore the scaffolding that holds it in
place. The rugged ridges and canyons below are laced with trails, but
the streets leading to them are posted with no-hiking signs.
Trespassing carries a fine of $283.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of fans feel a certain torment when they drive up
Beachwood Drive into the cluster of looping residential roads a
quarter-mile below the sign. They park and ask themselves: Do they
risk a penalty to go higher? How far dare they climb?</TE>
<TE>   Chris Keywood was facing that dilemma. The 20-year-old from
Oceanside was living a bachelor's dream--sightseeing in his '91
Mustang convertible with two young women he had met recently. Keywood
had bought a map of the stars' homes and squired his new friends
around Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the mansions of Bel-Air before
following the map up the hillside.</TE>
<TE>   "It says 'no access to the Hollywood sign,' but you've got to
ignore it," Keywood said. He had parked near the end of Tyrolean
Drive and hiked up a narrow service road into forbidden territory
near a Los Angeles municipal water tank. With the sign just above
them to the west, the visitors were thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool," said Amanda Teregis, 16, sporting star-spangled
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Jennalee McCaslin, 18, showed off star-stenciled fingernails and
was more effusive: "I didn't know you could get so close. I want to
go touch it. I want to go sit in the 'L.'"</TE>
<TE>   Keywood talked about the sign's history. He recalled the
despondent actress--Lillian "Peg" Entwistle--who committed suicide by
jumping off the "H" in 1932. The sign, originally constructed to
promote the residential development of "Hollywoodland" in 1923, was
meant to last only a year or so. It had fallen into disrepair when it
was sold, along with surrounding land, to the city of Los Angeles
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of Hollywood's leading ladies, it has had several face
lifts since.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a historic spot," Keywood said. "Look how close we
are."</TE>
<TE>   But they would get no closer. A tiny fenced enclosure near the
water tank holds pole-mounted cameras and loudspeakers. As they got
near it, a tape-recorded message began to ask that they leave the
restricted area. A helicopter passed overhead, flying toward the top
of the sign.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's probably trying to do what I wanted to do," McCaslin
said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 cameras and infrared monitors in several locations
maintain a 24-hour watch on the landmark, protected by an elaborate
security system installed in the mid-1990s. If you hike the trails
toward the base of the sign, the brushy terrain becomes so steep you
occasionally have to travel on hands and knees. Steps are gouged in
places to ease the ascent, but get close enough and eventually you
will be noticed in the rangers station at Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We have you on video camera," a voice will announce. "Remove
yourself immediately or you will be subject to citation or arrest."</TE>
<TE>   The security is designed to shield the city from liability for
hiking injuries and to protect a landmark worth millions in tourism
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which helped save the sign from
removal in 1978, owns a trademark and reaps licensing fees from key
chains, mugs, T-shirts, lines of apparel, advertising and film
rights. Though chamber officials won't divulge the exact figures, the
revenue exceeds seven figures and helps pay for planning studies,
social services and historical preservation in Hollywood, including
maintenance of the sign itself.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to be hard-nosed about dealing with starry-eyed
tourists, said Gary Newton, chief park ranger for the city. Only
three trespassing citations have been issued in the past year--when
visitors have refused to obey orders to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's realistic to think people will ever stop"
trying to go up there, Newton said.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Warrillowa made it well up the forbidden hillside. The
20-year-old from Birmingham, England, was escorted by James Hill, 23,
a hometown friend now running a Los Angeles music production company.
Their daunting climb took them to a clearing in the brush directly
below the "D," overlooking the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be easier if they built a walkway," Warrillowa said,
"but [the hike] makes it a bit special. Hollywood ... we're really
here!"</TE>

<HD>Pope Asked to Call Sea Turtles 'Meat'</HD>
<DH>Animals: Group cites Mexican tradition of eating the
threatened reptiles during Lent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of conservationists from the United States and Mexico on
Wednesday asked Pope John Paul II to declare sea turtles to be
"meat," as opposed to "fish," in an effort to halt the Mexican
tradition of eating endangered turtles during Lent.</LD>
<LD>   Wildcoast, a conservation group, estimates that as many as 35,000
sea turtles are slaughtered each year by poachers in Baja California
to feed a black-market demand for turtle meat in Mexico and the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   At a downtown Los Angeles news conference, the team made a public
plea to the Vatican, and to the Latino community in California, to
discourage sea turtle barbecues; they reach a high point in
celebrations leading up to Easter.</LD>
<TE>   "Please don't harvest these turtles and don't eat them," said Adan
Hernandez, a student and part-time fisherman from Magdalena Bay in
Baja California. "We know it's crossing the border. We know that some
[Southern California] restaurants offer it and it's reaching this
area."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was one of three members of a Catholic fishing group,
called Grupo Tortuguero de las Californias, who signed a letter
asking the pope to "officially clarify that sea turtle flesh is meat
and inappropriate for consumption during Lent."</TE>
<TE>   Turtles are reptiles.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also requested that the pope "ask members of the
Catholic Church to abide by the many worthy laws forbidding turtle
capture and consumption in Mexico and the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The killing of sea turtles has been prohibited by the U.S.
Endangered Species Act since 1973 and by Mexican law since 1990. The
penalties for turtle poaching in Mexico were raised in February from
three years to a maximum of 12 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   But Homero Aridjis, an acclaimed Mexican writer and
environmentalist who lobbied for the ban on turtle harvests in the
1980s, said poaching continues, often with the complicity of Mexican
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Aridjis said, officials confiscate illegal turtle
products, such as the 15,000 sea turtle eggs seized in a market in
Mexico City earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Aridjis suggested that a few words from the pope during a Mass
scheduled for June in Mexico City would go a long way to bolster
protection of the animals. The Mass is expected to draw 5 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   "In a Catholic country like Mexico, a statement could be very
important," Aridjis said.</TE>
<TE>   Wildcoast officials said sympathetic biologists in Italy are
presenting the matter to a scientific committee at the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Navarro-Valls, director of the Holy See Press Office in
Rome, did not respond to a faxed request for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, conservation groups and U.S. officials have tried to
enforce a crackdown on the illegal harvest of sea turtle eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The eggs, stolen from sand-covered nests on beaches, are
considered an aphrodisiac by some people in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Some Mexicans believe sea turtle flesh has medicinal qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now say the ongoing consumption of turtle flesh also is
hampering the recovery of turtle populations--which still amount to a
tiny fraction of their historic numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Turtle meat isn't a staple of subsistence diets.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it is a food featured at special occasions and holiday
feasts. Turtle meat fetches much higher prices than fish, driving a
black-market industry that ships turtle flesh to Mexico's urban
centers and to parts of the United States, according to Wildcoast.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials, who investigate
illegal importation of animals, said neither they nor U.S. Customs
Service officers see much illegal trafficking of turtle flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "We see small, noncommercial quantities occasionally," said
Special Agent Lisa Nichols of the Fish and Wildlife Service in San
Diego. "We don't have any indication that there are huge commercial
quantities coming in right now."</TE>
<TE>   Marie Palladini, a special agent with the Fish and Wildlife
Service who works out of Torrance, said she recently made an
undercover purchase of "sea turtle soup" from the back of a truck in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I sent it to the lab, and it turned out to be alligator," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   East Pacific green sea turtles, one of five species that feed or
nest along the Baja California peninsula, are reputed to have the
best-tasting flesh, according to fishermen and Wildcoast officials.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace J. Nichols, a sea turtle expert, was tracking a 250-pound
green turtle via satellite when it disappeared at Magdalena Bay. He
later was horrified to learn that the animal ended up as the main
course at a feast for 100 people.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols, a biologist and co-director of Wildcoast, said that
university researchers surveying fishermen and checking piles of
discarded carapaces in dumps estimate that as many as 35,000 turtles
are slaughtered each year along the Baja California peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to work together as Americans and Mexicans to save the
sea turtles," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gangs' Members United to Kill Activist, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Violence: James Richards was viewed as a snitch who was
harming the lucrative drug trade, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two gang members who authorities say killed Venice-area newsletter
publisher James Richards were involved in a unique partnership that
brought together a local black gang and a Latino one against a man
whom both gangs perceived as a common foe, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "They felt Mr. Richards was a threat to their narcotics dealings,"
Det. Bernard Rogers said. "The motive was that they believed Mr.
Richards was a snitch."</LD>
<LD>   Authorities announced earlier this week that they had made several
arrests related to the 2000 case, which prompted a strong public
response.</LD>
<TE>   Police have also connected one of the suspects in Richards'
slaying to the robbery and killing of Juan Martinez, 21, in the
Venice area later that year.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, 55, a Neighborhood Watch captain and anti-crime
advocate, was gunned down in front of his home in the Oakwood area of
Venice after being threatened by gangs for his efforts to combat the
narcotics trade in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Venice on Wednesday, investigators offered
new details on the case, which triggered an investigation into a
nationwide narcotics ring.</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspects in Richards' slaying, Byron Lopez, 23, was
arrested Feb. 26. Lopez is also being held on suspicion of killing
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The other suspected gunman, Antwon Jones, was killed April 24 in
an unrelated shooting in West Los Angeles, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' mother, Verna Childress, came to Wednesday's news
conference to confront investigators, saying that her son had been
slandered and was innocent of the crime. "He was a positive-type
person," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Gary Brennan, a police spokesman, defended the Police
Department's allegations against Jones, saying he had been
"legitimately identified as a suspect based on a thorough
investigation done by robbery-homicide" detectives.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the Oakwood killing involved numerous
agencies, including the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
Twenty-two suspects have been named in a federal indictment, which
also connects the drug ring to Richards' killing.</TE>
<TE>   Members are alleged to have set up a cocaine transportation
network extending to St. Louis, Atlanta, Baltimore and Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the suspects facing federal charges, detectives
said Wednesday that they had arrested more than 40 other people in
narcotics and gang-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   These suspects have faced state charges over the course of the
nearly 17-month investigation and helped provide information to crack
the drug ring, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests of so many gang members have helped bring down crime
in the area, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the neighbors concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changed for the better," said Oakwood resident Gary
Marshall, 49. "There used to be a drive-by at least two times a
week."</TE>
<TE>   The probe focused on suspected drug trade by the Venice Shoreline
Crips, a predominantly black gang that police said shares drug
territory in the Oakwood area with the Venice-based V13 gang, whose
members are mostly Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The two gangs were once at odds but had more recently co-existed
peacefully to share profits from the street-level cocaine trade in
the area, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, said Rogers, it was unusual for them to collaborate as
they are alleged to have done in Richards' killing.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said police believe members of the two gangs had discussed
harming Richards some time before.</TE>
<TE>   But the crime was somewhat spontaneous, occurring after the two
suspects happened to meet and decided to lie in wait for Richards on
the morning of Oct. 18, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One of the prime suspects in the cocaine ring, Maurice Brown, has
also been connected to Richards' killing on conspiracy-related
charges, according to the federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was arrested in early September as part of a sweep, and is
being held in federal custody. Investigators also seized about
$300,000 in cash, said Gregory N. Korniloff, associate special agent
in charge with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's news conference, representatives from the community
and several law enforcement agencies, including Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks and City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, hailed
the cooperative efforts that led to the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big one," Galanter said. "This is one that is really
worth remembering. We didn't give up, and when you don't give up, you
win."</TE>
<TE>   The news conference was disrupted near the end by a group of about
half a dozen residents, among them Childress, who called out for
authorities to address her challenge to the allegations about her
son.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents, including John Edwards, said they were offended
that the death of Richards, who was white, was getting so much
attention compared to those of several black youths who had died in
the area, and the din at one point threatened to drown out Galanter.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Galanter, however, reacted sharply in defense of
Richards when some in the crowd expressed hostility toward him.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials tried to halt the news conference. But the tumult
continued. Parks stepped up to the podium holding one hand in the
air.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people in our city are victimized," Parks said, adding that
Wednesday's event, "does not mean one crime gets more attention than
any other."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd quieted briefly, then grew noisy again as people left.
Standing to one side of the podium and saying nothing was Juan
Martinez, the father of the murder victim.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who is from El Salvador, dressed in a crisp blue suit
for the occasion. His son was studying psychology at Santa Monica
College and worked at Blockbuster Video, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying had ruined his life, he said. "I am following the
case, you know, all the time. I have been following the case."</TE>

<LD>Concerned that her life remains in danger, slaying suspect Bridget
Callahan obtained a court order Wednesday to ensure that authorities
keep her in a solitary jail cell while her case is pending.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old Ventura resident is accused of helping two
skinheads kill a teenage girl 3 1/2 years ago. She has been held
without bail on first-degree murder charges since August 2000.</LD>
<LD>   During that time, Callahan has been housed in a single cell at a
women's jail to protect her from retaliation from gang associates.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives say they became concerned for her safety after learning
that a male co-defendant had allegedly taken out a contract on
Callahan's life because she provided police with detailed information
about the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's hearing, Callahan's lawyer expressed concern
that jail officials might relax their protections and sought a court
order mandating that his client remain in a one-person cell. Superior
Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. granted the request.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan had been scheduled to be arraigned on a new criminal
complaint, but the matter was postponed until April 5.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors won't be the first to review a follow-up
environmental report on the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch housing
project.</LD>
<LD>   The board this week refused to consider Supervisor Steve Bennett's
recommendation that the environmental report go directly to the board
for review. His colleagues said the report should follow the usual
process of review by county staff and the Planning Commission before
reaching them.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the project wanted supervisors to weigh in on any
concerns they had on the study sooner rather than later. The study,
the second ordered for the housing project near the county's eastern
edge, outlines how developers can protect a threatened frog and
wildflower found on the property.</LD>
<TE>   The project was approved in 1992 but has been delayed by 18
lawsuits filed by opponents.</TE>

<HD>Actors Admit Sex With Minor, Get 5 Years' Probation</HD>
<DH>Court: The two men express remorse while pleading guilty to
felony. Director of shelter where the victim lived says they deserved
to go to jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two actors on television's "America's Most Wanted" program pleaded
guilty Wednesday to having sex with a 14-year-old girl living at an
abused children's shelter in Van Nuys while the show was on location
nearby in January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Cristian Saliadarre, 28, and Anthony Alvarez, 27, were sentenced
to probation after entering pleas to single felony counts of having
unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16. In
exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of
unlawful sodomy and oral copulation with a person under the age of
16.</LD>
<LD>   Before their sentencing, which took place shortly after they
entered the pleas, both men addressed the court and expressed remorse
for their actions, their lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronni B. MacLaren sentenced each
defendant to five years' probation and ordered each to pay $5,000 to
a victims restitution fund, perform 1,000 hours of community service
and attend sex offender counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had sought six-month jail terms for the defendants,
but the judge declined, citing their lack of criminal histories,
their remorse and the consensual nature of the sexual encounters,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Melinda Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, who is now 15, broke down in tears as she told the
court how she was traumatized by the incident, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Lee, executive director of Children of the Night, the shelter
for abused teens and former prostitutes where the victim resided,
said she had hoped the defendants would get jail time or be required
to register as sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just real disappointed and we feel unprotected," she said,
noting that 14-year-olds should "be protected by the law."</TE>
<TE>   Sammy M. Weiss, Saliadarre's attorney, said after the sentencing
that his client did not know the nature of the shelter or how young
the teenager was and has been "extremely remorseful from Day One."
Weiss added, "All I can say is that the victim contributed a great
deal to this problem."</TE>
<TE>   "My client was also, in a way, a victim," said Alvarez's lawyer,
Gilbert Moret.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, who appeared somber as they left the courtroom,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   They encountered the victim after a day of shooting a reenactment
segment for the popular crime program in an alley next to the
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   After talking with the girl through her window, Saliadarre removed
the screen, climbed inside and had sex with her, authorities said.
Later, the girl climbed out of her window and had sex with Alvarez in
the alley, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said that the shelter, which is privately funded, installed
security cameras and stronger window screens after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The director criticized police and the district attorney's office
for taking nearly four months to secure arrest warrants against the
men, saying she believed there was a "special relationship between
the LAPD, 'America's Most Wanted' and the D.A.'s office."</TE>
<TE>   Lee also said that after she complained about the length of the
investigation, a detective suggested that her complaints might
interfere with an award "America's Most Wanted" was about to receive.
That detective could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, the prosecutor, denied that the TV show's involvement had
any effect on the progress of the case.</TE>

<LD>High winds wreaked havoc across Southern California on Wednesday,
knocking down power lines, impairing motorists' vision, and hurtling
trees into at least three cars and two houses, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   No serious injuries were reported.</LD>
<LD>   Winds blowing generally from 30 to 40 mph knocked down power lines
from the San Fernando Valley to San Pedro, leaving more than 8,000
customers temporarily without power, said Darlene Battle of the
Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<TE>   About 12:50 p.m., a 50-foot tree landed on a van at 2nd and
Alameda streets in downtown Los Angeles, said Bob Collis of the city
Fire Department. About half an hour later, a tree landed on a United
Parcel Service truck in the 13400 block of Ventura Boulevard in
Studio City, Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   Just before 3 p.m., a tree fell on a car in the 900 block of North
Poinsettia Place in Hollywood, briefly trapping the driver, he said.
Less than two hours later, city firefighters responded to a tree
falling on a house in the 2300 block of South Cloverdale Avenue in
Mid-City, Collis said. Later in the evening, a tree slammed into a
house in the 9500 block of Grape Street in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, high winds about 6 p.m. forced a 16-foot boat into
the breakwater, causing it to capsize, Coast Guard Petty Officer
William Davidson said. Three men were rescued by Long Beach
lifeguards, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stretches of Interstate 15 in San Bernardino County were closed
after two seven-car pileups caused by blowing dust, California
Highway Patrol Officer Matt Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Zanto Peabody and the Associated Press
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Waves Put Westphal Into a New Basketball Region</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Paul Westphal is a novice. A rookie. New to the game.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to believe he could be up to new tricks at 51, after
almost three decades in basketball spent playing at an all-star
level, competing in what some consider the best NBA championship game
ever, and coaching some of the league's most colorful players.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA tournament is different territory. He never reached the
tournament playing for USC, because in the early 1970s the only team
from the Pacific 8 that went to the NCAAs was the champion, which
meant UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   But in his first year coaching at Pepperdine, his Waves gave him
his first crack at it, thanks to a 22-8 season. How long they stick
around could have a lot to do with how well Westphal can make the
adjustment to coaching a tournament instead of a series.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal quickly acknowledges that this one-loss-and-done world is
different. It's even different from a conference tournament, where at
least he has the experience of playing those opponents earlier in the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Can he come up with a game plan for a team he doesn't know? If the
Waves win their first-round game against seventh-seeded Wake Forest
today, how quickly can he whip up a scheme for the Oregon-Montana
winner? Can he have his team ready for such pressure-packed
situations?</TE>
<TE>   "Every game it's like a seventh game," Westphal said, "only you
don't have the six games to draw on, you don't have all the
experience to draw from. It's an exciting thing."</TE>
<TE>   When he coached the Phoenix Suns, Westphal was usually at his best
in the latter stages of the series. In 1993, they lost the first two
games in a best-of-five first round but won the last three. The Suns
dropped the first two games of the best-of-seven Finals at home
against the Chicago Bulls that year, came back to win two of three in
Chicago and came within a John Paxson basket of pushing the series to
seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal was known for trying different--even daring--matchups. A
key switch in the 1993 Finals was assigning Kevin Johnson to guard
Michael Jordan in Game 3. Johnson bothered Jordan with his quickness,
Jordan and the Bulls focused on posting up KJ and they got away from
what won the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see if he is so willing to experiment in an NCAA tournament
game.</TE>
<TE>   One successful element of Westphal's style that you know will stay
the same: He won't worry.</TE>
<TE>   When the Bulls were on the verge of wrapping up the series in five
games, Chicagoans boarded up storefronts and taxis deserted the
streets in anticipation of a repeat of the previous year's
post-championship violence. Westphal developed a simple, whimsical
rallying cry for his squad: "Save the City."</TE>
<TE>   They won the game and peace prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal's so mellow he wouldn't look out of place if he wore
sandals while coaching. I've read haiku poems with more words than
Westphal spoke to his players during the last 30 minutes of
Pepperdine's open practice at Arco Arena on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It worked perfectly with Charles Barkley in Phoenix, but sometimes
Westphal's laid-back approach backfires. It cost him his job last
season in Seattle, when he rescinded Gary Payton's suspension for
insubordination and lost the rest of the players in the process.</TE>
<TE>   His style is working with the college guys in Pepperdine. He lets
the players play, and everybody's OK.</TE>
<TE>   "He allows us to open up our game," senior guard Craig Lewis said.
"He doesn't really worry about the quick shots. He just lets us play
our game. If you feel like you can take your man, go on and take him.
It just creates a loose atmosphere to your whole game. That really
helps you out as a player."</TE>
<TE>   Westphal even engages in some trash-talking with his players. He
also likes to show he still has some skills, such as when he
reenacted a turnaround jump shot from the corner that he made while
playing for the Phoenix Suns in the triple-overtime Game 5 of the
1976 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "He hits a few trick shots now and then and makes you ooh and ah a
little bit," said Cedric Suitt, the team's defensive force in the
middle. "He tries to shoot a few threes. But he doesn't get out there
with us and go up and down.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he won't bring it to the hole on me. He knows better than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Westphal sat down behind the microphone as his players left and
said: "I would take it to the hoop on you."</TE>
<TE>   Even if his players don't think Westphal could score on them, they
respect him.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a player, you have that experience," Westphal said. "Being
a coach you can see both sides of the game."</TE>
<TE>   With that two-sided experience he can bring a lot to the table,
more so than a lot of the other NBA coaches. He's played and coached
in the NBA, as well as the college level, so he knows the ins and
outs of the game.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament has its own ins and outs. As in, win and stay in,
lose and you're out.</TE>

<LD>UC Santa Barbara might be the beneficiary of anti-Arizona sentiment
from New Mexico fans who resented Coach Lute Olson complaining about
the operation of the clock after a 1999 loss in the Pit, saying he'd
never return to play New Mexico again.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard a couple of people on the plane on the way here talking
about how they don't appreciate Lute Olson too much and they're
behind us all the way," guard Branduinn Fullove said.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona figures to have plenty of fans, but the Wildcats are
braced for whatever happens.</LD>
<TE>   "I hear the crowd's not going to be on our side," Jason Gardner
said. "But I think we've played through that in all the road games
that we have. So I think it's just like another road game, people
saying things about you, heckling you."</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara's players say they won't be in awe of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any intimidation at all," forward Mark Hull
said. "We've played USC, UCLA and Stanford since I was a freshman.
We've played the Pac-10 schools and watch them on TV all the time,
especially being on the West Coast. There's no intimidation
involved."</TE>

<TE>   Indiana President Myles Brand disputes accusations in Bob Knight's
autobiography that he was unfair in deciding Knight's fate and
reneged on a deal involving disciplinary action.</TE>
<TE>   The book "Knight: My Story," due on shelves March 26, states that
Brand did not fully consider Knight's contributions to the university
before Brand fired him in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Knight says in the book that Brand agreed to a one-game suspension
and $10,000 fine in May 2000 after a videotape showed Knight grabbing
former player Neil Reed by the throat during a practice. The next
day, Knight says, Brand imposed a three-game suspension and a $30,000
fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I am particularly dismayed by the personal attacks directed by
Knight at other longtime university employees and trustees, many of
whom have devoted their lives to Indiana University and continue to
serve this university well," Brand said in a statement.</TE>

<TE>   The NCAA's plan to keep teams closer to home for March Madness
worked out well for Pittsburgh, Maryland, Illinois and Texas--unless
the home fans happened to be looking for tickets.</TE>
<TE>   All four teams are playing in subregionals near their campuses,
but they were treated no differently for ticket allotments than other
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh got the same 450 tickets for its games at nearby Mellon
Arena as California and Central Connecticut. And Maryland got the
same 450 tickets for its games at the MCI Center as Wisconsin and
Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California will play Georgia and USC will play Missouri in the
John R. Wooden Classic on Dec. 7 at the Arrowhead Pond.... Henry
Dickerson was dismissed as coach at Chattanooga.... Will Brown was
hired as the coach at Albany after a season in which he was the
team's interim coach for the last 20 games.</TE>

<LD>Kentucky vs. Valparaiso--The Wildcats make their record 43rd NCAA
tournament appearance. Valparaiso is making its sixth. Kentucky has
stumbled down the stretch, winning only five of its last nine games.
The Wildcats have been plagued by off-the-court troubles all season;
five players have missed 11 games because of team suspensions and
Marvin Stone was dismissed when he failed to return to the team after
a Christmas break. In 1998, Valparaiso's Sweet 16 run ended in St.
Louis. The Crusaders hope another run will begin there this year.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Marquette vs. Tulsa--Marquette depends mightily on its defense,
which held opponents to 60.4 points, 40% overall shooting and 31.9%
three-point shooting. The Golden Hurricane can counter with guard
Dante Swanson, the nation's most-accurate three-point shooter during
the regular season (55.1%), and with three other players who average
in double figures. Another difference? None of Marquette's players
has appeared in an NCAA tournament game while the Golden Hurricane is
making its third appearance in four years.</LD>

<LD>Remember all the way back to last month when Scott McCarron was
playing better than anyone? A three-putt bogey on the 72nd hole cost
him at least a playoff at Riviera and a week later he was runner-up
again in the $5.5-million match play event at La Costa.</LD>
<LD>   Remember back to a couple of weeks ago when Chris DiMarco was
playing better than anyone? He won at Phoenix, won the West Coast
swing, opened with a 65 at Doral and then finished 79-75-73 to tie
for 67th. Last week at the Honda Classic, he tied for 58th.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, of course, was also when Ernie Els proved he is playing
better than anyone. He won the European Tour event at Dubai to make
it back-to-back wins, following his two-shot victory over Tiger Woods
at Doral. Since the middle of January, Els has three victories (he
won the Heineken Classic in Australia), and two other top 10s
worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   This week, it's Bay Hill and its redesigned greens where Els runs
into Woods again. The point is that the only thing longer than the
golf season is the new 18th hole at Augusta National, and even though
there's always a fixation about who the best player in the world is,
all we ever find out is who the best player is in one particular
week.</TE>
<TE>   Els has a fairly strong case for something more than that right
now. Here is his record in stroke-play events worldwide since Jan.
20--ninth at the Dunhill Championship, fourth at the Johnnie Walker
Classic, first at the Heineken Classic, first at Doral, first at
Dubai. He's up to No. 3 in the Official World Ranking and closing in
on Phil Mickelson ... but there's always Woods, isn't there?</TE>
<TE>   Tiger could have won his first tournament of the year at Doral if
Els hadn't gone off the deep end with a 17-under-par score the first
three days.</TE>
<TE>   At Bay Hill, Woods will be trying to win for the third consecutive
year and then he defends his titles at the Players Championship and
the Masters. So you have to say that Woods has plenty of chances to
prove he's playing better than anyone. Again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Summit News</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA broke new ground last weekend with its first so-called
Player Summit, in Phoenix, where Commissioner Ty Votaw laid out a
five-year strategic business plan that included a goal of increasing
television viewership 10% each year. It remains to be seen whether a
50% increase at the end of five years is realistic, but give Votaw
credit for thinking big.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA has never had a strategic business plan, for five years
or five weeks, so this may require some time for the players to get
used to it. By the way, attendance was mandatory--either show up or
be fined $10,000. Votaw called for the players, among other things,
to do a better job of marketing themselves and their golf. He said
that one of the ways to accomplish that was to improve their
appearance and to be more fan-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Said Votaw: "We have to do more to sell ourselves off the golf
course. Then it becomes this circle of life: More fans means more
sponsor interest means more value means higher ratings means more ad
dollars and more money in players' pockets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calling Mr. Blackwell</TE>
<TE>   And while we're on the subject of who looks good (and bad), the
April issue of Golf Magazine lists its picks--alphabetically, of
course--for the best and worst-dressed players on the PGA Tour and
the LPGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The best-dressed include Woods ("Rarely goes out on a limb, but he
is perfectly put together. Although we suggest he go down a size or
two in the shirts"); Grace Park ("Would shine on the runaway as well
as the fairway--especially when the belly button is covered"); and
Mickelson ("He does it right, even with the visor"). The dreaded
worst-dressed list includes Scott Hoch ("Is he wearing clothing or
upholstery?"), Mardi Lunn ("She's too fond of ill-fitting pants and
tablecloth shirts") and Jumbo Ozaki ("How does he get those shirts
through customs?").</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wine Enthusiast</TE>
<TE>   News item: Following the success of fellow enologist Greg Norman,
David Frost founds his own wine company and calls it (naturally)
David Frost Wines. He dedicates his latest vintages to Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Good choice. There's nothing like vintage Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Survey Says</TE>
<TE>   News item: In a golfdigest.com survey of more than 2000 readers,
51% said they would amputate the little toe on their left foot to
become a member of Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: What if Augusta National was more of a right foot place?</TE>

<TE>   Ice Ace</TE>
<TE>   News item: The fourth Drambuie World Ice Golf Championship will be

<TE>   Charles in Charge</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III, who is playing at Bay Hill, has made 23
consecutive cuts and he's a combined 203 under par since last year's
U.S. Open at Southern Hills. In other Howell news, he says he will
answer to Charles, Charlie and even Dude, but he doesn't like Chuck
... and don't even think about calling him Thurston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jose Knows the Way</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal is driving the ball
a lot straighter. He admits to being directionally challenged in the
past, but he sounds like he's in a good mood now that he has
corrected that flaw.</TE>
<TE>   Said Olazabal: "I'm hitting it a little bit longer, mainly because
I am hitting more times in the middle of the club face."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Casey Update</TE>
<TE>   He had a scare in January when infection set in after surgery on
his right leg, but Casey Martin is feeling well enough to play golf.
He missed the cut last week in Adelaide, Australia, in the first
Buy.com tournament, but he's playing this week in Christchurch,
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was invited to play both events by the Australasian Tour,
which co-sanctions the tournaments with the Buy.com Tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of Course</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fazio, who directed the dramatic course changes at Augusta, is
also having a big impact in Southern California. Fazio designed
Pelican Hill at Newport Coast and the new layout at Shady Canyon in
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Pelican Hill is an ocean venue, and Shady Canyon is laid out in
rugged terrain behind outcroppings of boulders. "It's got a great
feel and it's about as different as you can get from an oceanfront
course," Fazio said. "It looks like it's been there forever. That's
the job, to make it look that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back in Business</TE>
<TE>   Located at the corner of Broadway and Dey St. in lower Manhattan,
a golf retailer called World of Golf was heavily damaged during the
attacks on the World Trade Center. On Friday, the store will reopen.
"Where golf fit in, we were very sensitive," owner David Braham said.
"It's just psychological. Now, people seem to be ready to go back to
normal."</TE>

<LD>The Kentucky Derby future wager opens again today and will continue
through Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-1 favorite on the morning line put out by the Daily Racing
Form is Siphonic. The field and Repent, who won his second in a row
with a narrow victory in Sunday's Louisiana Derby, are 6-1.</LD>
<LD>   Some new horses are on the list, including Mayakovsky, who will
make his first start as a 3-year-old in Sunday's Gotham Stakes at
Aqueduct; Sunday Break, a son of Forty Niner whose next start has not
been announced after trainer Neil Drysdale said he won't run against
Siphonic in Sunday's eSan Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita;
Yougottawanna, who won the El Camino Real Derby last weekend at
Golden Gate Fields; and San Rafael Stakes runner-up Easy Grades.</LD>
<TE>   None of the horses in today's split $75,000-added Academy Road
Stakes are listed individually in pool 2 of the Kentucky Derby future
wager, but the two races are interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Rage, who has found a home on the grass for trainer Bob
Baffert, leads the first division, which drew a field of eight, while
recent maiden winners Royal Gem and Prairie Predator lead the second
division, which has a field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership, Mountain Rage, a 3-year-old son of Mecke,
has won two of three on the grass. He took the Grade III Generous at
Hollywood Park last fall, then won the Hill Rise at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   A son of Royal Academy trained by Bobby Frankel, Royal Gem won
cleverly in his debut coming down the hill and figures to improve at
today's distance, which is a flat mile. Prairie Predator, a Geri
colt, won at the distance against maidens on Jan. 13 for trainer
Simon Bray.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Fit For A King, who has won five in a row, will
be seeking his 13th victory in 26 starts when he goes against 10
others in today's fifth, a sprint on Santa Anita's hillside turf
course.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jason Lumpkins. Although he has ridden only a portion
of the meet at Golden Gate Fields, the rider has won at a 19% clip,
second only to leading jockey Russell Baze.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Donna Elordi. Going into today, the trainer is winless
in 37 at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exactas in the fifth keying Golden Dragon
with Fit For A King, Islander and Silvertongue Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/157. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$926.80. Total money bet: $960.</TE>

<HD>Lopez: One More Full Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy Lopez, who earned her way into the LPGA's Hall of Fame 15 years
ago, said Wednesday that she won't play full time after this year.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not retiring from golf, but I will be playing one more full
year and kind of say goodbye," Lopez said at a news conference in
Phoenix before the Ping Banner Health.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I have some good golf left in me, but you know, I want to
be realistic and say to myself, 'Can you really go out there and
still win?' And I just don't want to say no, I can't."</LD>
<TE>   The 45-year-old winner of 48 tournaments, three of them majors,
said she intends to play a limited schedule beginning in 2003 and
will devote most of her time to corporate outings, television and
golf course and golf club design.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez ranks sixth in career victories, and in her breakout season
of 1978 won nine times, including a record five consecutive
tournaments. She is the only player in LPGA history to win rookie of
the year, player of the year and Vare Trophy honors in the same year.
A four-time player of the year and three-time Vare Trophy winner,
Lopez qualified for the Hall of Fame when she won her 35th
tournament, the Saratoga Classic, which was also the site of her
first victory as a 21-year old rookie in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   But Lopez has not won a tournament in five years and in 2001
dropped to 157th on the money list with $12,436--the lowest in her
career. Lopez's scoring average of 74.81 was also her worst. She
played only 11 times last year and missed six cuts. She also played
11 times in 2000 after having gall bladder surgery in May. Lopez was
also limited to 13 tournaments in 1999, a year in which she had knee
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like I can't dedicate myself to playing the type of
golf that I want to play out there," Lopez said. "If I can't do that,
then I feel like it's time to step away."</TE>

<LD>Kansas vs. Holy Cross: Sixteenth seeds are a combined 0-68 in the
NCAA tournament. They're likely to be 0-69 after this game. But the
Crusaders were seeded 15th last year, and they pushed Kentucky before
losing 72-68 in the East Region. Holy Cross leads the all-time series
1-0. Kansas figures to be fired up after a 64-55 loss to Oklahoma in
the Big 12 tournament final Sunday. That was a season-low scoring
output for a team that averages more than 90 points a game. Kansas is
led by Drew Gooden, who averages 20.4 points and 11.3 rebounds a
game.</LD>

<LD>   Stanford vs. Western Kentucky: The Cardinal entered the season
with only one returning starter, guard Casey Jacobsen, yet developed
well enough to tie for second in the Pacific 10. The Hilltoppers
entered the season in the top 20, lived up to expectations and open
the tournament on an 18-game winning streak. Jacobsen leads the
Cardinal in scoring and is clearly its key. But a telling matchup
will pit Chris Marcus, the Hilltoppers' 7-foot-1 center, against
Cardinal 7-foot center Curtis Borchardt.</LD>

<TE>   Oregon vs. Montana: The run-and-gun Ducks are coming off their
first outright regular-season conference championship since the
1938-39 Tall Firs, who would go on to win the NCAA title, won the
Pacific Coast Conference. Oregon was picked to finish sixth in the
media's preseason poll. The Grizzlies, who were selected to finish
fifth in the eight-school Big Sky, advanced to their fifth NCAA
tournament by winning the conference tournament after finishing in a
three-way tie for second at 7-7.</TE>

<HD>Florida Scuffle Leaves Nelson With Fracture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida Coach Billy Donovan insists the Gators are one, big happy
family, even though guard Brett Nelson has a fractured cheekbone that
indicates otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson was injured in a scrape with teammate LaDarius Halton
during practice Tuesday. Nelson had surgery that night, but Donovan
said the junior will be available when the Gators play Creighton on
Friday in the first round of the Midwest Regional in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, what happened was, you had two players playing very
hard," Donovan said. "Both guys' emotions got into it.</LD>
<TE>   "There was an altercation there. It was quick. They're both
perfectly fine. They hugged each other when it was over with."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan said Nelson was limited to light shooting in practice
Wednesday, but would return to full practice today and would play
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson will not need a protective mask to play, Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan said neither player would be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always applied discipline when discipline is needed, but
it's not in this case," Donovan said. "Both guys assumed
responsibility. I handled it. Nobody is disgruntled, upset, choosing
sides or anything like that. Our guys know how intense practice is."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan scoffs at the perception that the scuffle is a sign of a
team in turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say this is awful timing for something like this--I
think it's great timing," Donovan said. "They paint a picture of a
team in disarray. But bottom line, I think these guys are close-knit
and together."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson is Florida's third-leading scorer, averaging 14.7 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montana's players appear a bit dazzled by their surroundings in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The 15th-seeded Grizzlies play No. 2-seeded Oregon today at Arco
Arena, an NBA building that seats about 14,000 more than Montana
averages for its home games in Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many they pack in here--2,000 or 3,000," Montana
Coach Don Holst joked.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the Grizzlies plan to slow down Oregon, Holst quipped,
"Lock 'em in the locker room."</TE>

<LD>Mexico's national soccer team continued its preparation for this
summer's World Cup by routing Albania, 4-0, Wednesday night at San
Diego's Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Albania, which was a late replacement after Macedonia and Bulgaria
withdrew from the game, arrived in California only on Tuesday and was
no match for Coach Javier Aguirre's squad, which was trying to bounce
back from a 2-1 loss to Yugoslavia at Phoenix last month.</LD>
<LD>   Striker Jared Borgetti gave Mexico the lead in the 26th minute and
Ramon Morales scored the second goal four minutes later.</LD>
<TE>   Adolfo Bautista had goals in the 52nd and 90th minutes to complete
the rout.</TE>
<TE>   Albania played the second half with only 10 men after American
referee Kevin Stott red-carded Ardif Beqiri one minute before
halftime.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>STYLE OF PLAY: Pepperdine will try to use its depth and quickness to
wear down Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons have become an up-tempo team
under first-year Coach Skip Prosser, but they don't press as much as
the Waves and might be more comfortable in a half-court game. Look
for Wake Forest to challenge Pepperdine's interior defense by
pounding the ball inside to 6-foot-9, 248-pound Darius Songaila.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   MATCHUP TO WATCH: Terrance Johnson vs. Craig Dawson. Pepperdine
needs Johnson to regain his shooting touch after the freshman made
only eight of 24 shots, including two of 13 from three-point range,
in the West Coast Conference tournament. Dawson led the Atlantic
Coast Conference in three-point percentage (43%). He needs to be on
his game to take the pressure off Wake Forest's big men.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES: Glen McGowan is what coaches call an elevator player:
up one day, down the next. If the 6-8 sophomore can contribute
quality minutes off the bench, it would be a boost for the Waves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAGIC NUMBERS: Pepperdine is 21-0 when it shoots a higher
percentage than an opponent. Rebounding is another key for the Waves,
who are 15-0 when they at least match an opponent on the boards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: Pepperdine will move to the second round if it
buckles down on defense and creates fastbreak opportunities.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section council will discuss for the first time today a
controversial proposal that would force transfers to sit out varsity
athletic competition for one school year unless they exercise a bona
fide change of address.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, submitted by Downey Warren High Principal Earl
Haugen, could not face a vote until the council's April 25 meeting at
the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   The council will continue to discuss at its regular meeting the
implementation of a statewide pre-enrollment contact form that would
require school officials to certify that no one connected with their
booster clubs or athletic department had contact with prospective
transfers. The form would have to be signed by officials at the
former school and the new school, and by the transferring student and
his parents.</LD>
<TE>   The council will vote on a proposal that would increase the number
of divisions in girls' water polo from five to six to give the 207
girls' teams an equal number of championships as the 209 boys' teams.</TE>
<TE>   The council will also vote on a proposal that would form playoff
groupings based on competitive equity in sports not under the
guidelines of enrollment-based divisions for state playoffs. The
affected sports would be baseball, boys' and girls' soccer, softball,
boys' volleyball, boys' and girls' tennis and boys' and girls'
swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, all teams from one league would compete in the
same playoff division.</TE>

<HD>After Protest, Gritty Victory for Rios</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Playing in sandstorm, he beats Kratochvil but is
angry about conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Word spread through the grounds that play was being suspended on
Wednesday because of dangerous conditions at Indian Wells Tennis
Garden.</LD>
<LD>   What's this?</LD>
<LD>   Dangerous isn't a word you hear much around here. You wondered
whether Martina Navratilova smuggled in one of her dogs past the
crack security team at the entrances. Were people going hungry in the
luxury suites?</LD>
<TE>   No, it was weather-related. A nasty sandstorm blew in, and, for an
afternoon, the desert came to tennis rather than tennis coming to the
desert. Action was stopped on the outside courts for about an hour
when gusts reached 39 miles per hour, knocking over chairs and
creating a thin layer of slippery dirt, rendering the hard courts
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   At night, the sandstorm returned, stopping play again. Marcelo
Rios of Chile refused to resume his match against Michel Kratochvil
of Switzerland, making his case with the chair umpire Norm Chryst and
supervisor Gerry Armstrong. His sit-down strike lasted until the
blowers cleaned the court.</TE>
<TE>   Rios won, 6-4, 6-2, but both players had wanted to postpone the
match until today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time the ATP starts listening to players," Rios
said. "We're not playing just for fun and you can't play on a hard
court with sand. It was dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kratochvil, who upset Andre Agassi in the first round: "In 24
hours I went from maybe the best match in my life to maybe the worst
experience. It was unplayable conditions."</TE>
<TE>   There was no such choice for the women on the Stadium Court.
Fourth-seeded Monica Seles defeated No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, in one quarterfinal and No. 2 Martina Hingis of
Switzerland beat No. 10 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, 6-1, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Play was interrupted on the outside courts, but Seles and
Sanchez-Vicario continued.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we had that option [of stopping] because of TV,"
Seles said of ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Seles said she would wipe her face with a towel and the towel
would turn black from the dirt. Hingis said she taped her ankle as a
precaution because of the slippery court.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other changeover, I had to take a wet towel and just take
the sand out of my eyes. And I still have it [in my eyes]," Seles
said.</TE>
<TE>   Seles, who has lost to Sanchez-Vicario only three times in 23
matches, stood up on changeovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because I was getting cold today," she said. "I know it's
going to sound weird, but I like to stand up anyway because I think
the changeovers are so long, especially when you have TV time."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hingis: "I watched the Monica-Arantxa match just before. I
learned from that. I was trying to use that in my game. It worked
very well."</TE>
<TE>   There were three upsets on the men's side. Todd Martin defeated
No. 5 Tommy Haas of Germany, 6-4, 6-2. It was the first time he has
beaten Haas in four matches. Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina took out
former champion, No. 16 Alex Corretja of Spain, 6-4, 6-0, and
Jan-Michael Gambill defeated No. 13 Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic,
6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Two players with better luck regarding the wind and sand were
top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and No. 10 Pete Sampras.
Hewitt defeated Andrei Pavel of Romania, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, in the second
round. That match started at 10 a.m. and Hewitt escaped before the
conditions grew miserable.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't request anything," Hewitt said of the early start.
"Right now, I won't complain though. I'd rather be talking to you
guys and having lunch than getting ready to play this afternoon in
that weather."</TE>
<TE>   The women's quarterfinals followed Hewitt and the weather was
actually decent by the time Sampras took the court. Sampras has never
lost to Albert Costa of Spain and he made it five straight matches,
defeating Costa, 6-4, 6-4, in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   In what is becoming a post-match tradition, Sampras had a light
workout with his new coach Jose Higueras.</TE>
<TE>   Since Higueras has not had much time to work with Sampras, he is
fitting in these sessions when he can find the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Just kind of cleaning up my ground strokes a little bit, getting
pretty good pace on my backhand side, working on that a bit," Sampras
said. "It's a process. It's not going to happen overnight. It's going
to take some time. I'm sure Jose is looking forward to working with
me when I'm not playing. He'll grind me out there for a couple of
hours, which I guess I'm looking forward to, too."</TE>
<TE>   For those not in the room, that last line was a joke. "I've got no
choice," he said, smiling.</TE>

<DH>Analysis: With little going as planned this year, Indian
Wells event is raising ceiling on top seats next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Your name is Steve Simon, you are the chief operating officer of the
prestigious Indian Wells tennis event and you are bracing for a
storm.</LD>
<LD>   You are raising ticket prices for 2003, some as much as 40%.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, this is a rich man's playground, a marquee event in a resort
playground where the stress decision of the day frequently is what
number sunscreen to use.</LD>
<TE>   But is anybody this rich? Can anybody not named Gates or Anschutz
keep affording the leisurely afternoons and warm nights watching
young people pound tennis balls at each other?</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a soft-spoken force behind much of the success of Charlie
Pasarell's vision for the ultimate tennis tournament destination
spot, thinks the market will endure this.</TE>
<TE>   "We agonize over these things," Simon said here Wednesday, in a
lengthy interview with him and DeeDee Felich, tournament assistant
director. "There is no real formula. We watch it, monitor what the
rest of the industry is doing. We don't know what the ceiling is."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Indian Wells officials do not think the 2003 prices they
have set will reach it.</TE>
<TE>   One of Simon's problems is the sudden sticker shock. Even though
he, Tournament Director Pasarell and Felich did the most fan-friendly
thing they could three years ago, when they moved from the Hyatt
Grand Champions Stadium a mile or so down the street to their new
state-of-the-art tennis palace that rises up out of the desert sand
like some Taj Mahal, they now must call in those markers.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, their deal with their main ticket buyers, the
box-holders who moved with them from the Hyatt to the new stadium,
was that their prices would be frozen through this year's tournament.
That meant that a Stadium box--one ticket for all 17 days of the
event--that went for $800 in 2000 went for $800 in 2002; a courtside
box was frozen at $850, a front-row box at $900 and a club seat
ticket (a suite-level area where food and other amenities are right
there) at $1,250.</TE>
<TE>   People buying in along the way have paid elevated prices, but
those who got in after the '99 tournament and stayed in have had no
increase.</TE>
<TE>   But the three-year deal is up.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, the $800 stadium box seat becomes $1,110, a
27% increase; the $850 courtside boxes become $1,300, a 35% increase;
the $900 front-row boxes become $1,500, a 40% increase, and the
$1,250 club suite seats become $1,800, a 30% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Suffice to say that discussions of that are buzzing about the
stadium these days. The ticket buyers were told up front that this
time would come, but now that it has, there are some unhappy campers
sitting around in their Filas.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's position is made even more difficult by the current shaky
state of tennis and the current events of this week.</TE>
<TE>   Its women's tour seems to have a new CEO about every six months
and went for nearly a year without a title sponsor. The men's tour, a
smash success a few summers ago, got involved in a disastrous deal
with a marketing group called ISL. ISL is long gone and the Indian
Wells event scrambled like Fran Tarkenton to come up with newcomer
Pacific Life as a sponsor this year.</TE>
<TE>   And then, the Indian Wells event ran into tough sledding on its
women's side, especially costly because the women, led by Venus and
Serena Williams, have frequently been a bigger draw in recent years.
In a controversial moment last year, Venus defaulted to Serena in a
semifinal, just moments before they were to play, with a full stadium
and ESPN minutes away from going on the air. The next day, the crowd,
suspecting an arrangement had more to do with the default than an
injury, booed Serena as she took the court for the final, and kept
booing her for most of her match, which she won. This year, the
Williams sisters, citing the harsh treatment they received from the
rowdies in the desert, said they wouldn't play here.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports had them saying they would never come back here, but
"never" with the Williams sisters and father Richard can last as long
as six months.</TE>
<TE>   Then it got worse, or as Simon dryly put it, "We hit a bit of a
fluke."</TE>
<TE>   Two other top 10 players, , Jennifer Capriati and Amelie Mauresmo,
decided not to play here and Southern California's own Lindsay
Davenport, also in the top 10, is injured. That meant that half of
the women's top 10 wasn't here, unheard of for a women's event with a
$2.1-million purse.</TE>
<TE>   There was additional irony in all this, something that probably
only happens in the oft-messed up world of tennis. The Williams
sisters, as well as Capriati, are managed by IMG, which also is a
main partner in the Indian Wells tournament.</TE>
<TE>   On top of this, a worn-down superstar, Andre Agassi, lost in the
first round on the men's side; the best-hope newcomer, Andy Roddick,
got sick and defaulted, and this became the Pete Sampras
Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, Simon is trying to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like any other business." Simon said. "There are things we
need to do."</TE>
<TE>   The nut he has to crack includes enough sponsorship to cover not
only the women's $2.1-million purse, but the men's $2.45 million.
Also, whatever debt service you have with a $74-million stadium whose
main revenue producer is a once-a-year, 17-day event.</TE>
<TE>   Yet things are going well. Felich said that traffic at the ticket
renewal has much more activity than last year and that this year's
tournament, while paid attendance is fairly flat compared to last
year at this stage, is faring much better in revenue because more of
the people who have purchased tickets are actually coming to the
event and buying hot dogs and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and Felich also hope that the message of comparative prices
gets to their customers. The tournament most similar to theirs, Key
Biscayne's upcoming two-week event, is more expensive. Its front-row
boxes are now $1,120, or $220 higher than here. And the U.S. Open, an
incredible cash cow for the U.S. Tennis Assn., would get $11,375 for
its front boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the high seats above the boxes here will remain in the
affordable range of $25-$50, with lots of discounts easily available.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the public--even the tennis public--has a breaking point
somewhere near the back of their wallets. Indian Wells officials hope
they haven't gotten there yet.</TE>

<HD>Morgan Is Quickly Becoming Old Hand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jarered Morgan of La Quinta High is barely no longer a neophyte when
it comes to putting the shot or throwing the discus.</LD>
<LD>   But there was nothing novice-like about the way he opened his
outdoor track and field season.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan, a 6-foot, 270-pound senior, posted winning marks of 197
feet in the discus and 58-01/2 in the shotput last Thursday in a dual
meet at Coachella Valley.</LD>
<TE>   His effort in the discus was the farthest in the state this year
and topped his previous best by nearly 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   His mark in the shotput is fourth in the state this year and added
more than 21/2 feet to his previous best.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for someone who competed in the shotput and discus for the
first time last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really surprised," said Morgan, a two-time All-Southern
Section Division VIII selection at defensive tackle in football.
"Because I know a lot more about the shotput and discus than I did
last year. Last year I was learning the basic stuff, but this year
we're starting to speed things up. Our weightlifting is also a lot
more event-specific. We're doing a lot of explosive-type lifts."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's inexperience was evident last season in the Division II
preliminaries, where a case of the jitters prevented him from
advancing to the finals after he'd thrown a career-best 187-3 in the
Desert Valley League finals the previous week. But his raw throwing
ability and strong work ethic have his personal coach and the coaches
at La Quinta looking forward to the remainder of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 60 feet [in the shotput] and 210-220 [in the discus] are
both reasonable," said La Quinta throws coach Samantha Thomas. "It's
just such a natural thing for him. He just gets out there and lets it
rip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grounded Angel: Senior Angel Perkins of Cerritos Gahr will not
make her outdoor debut until at least March 23 after sustaining a
hamstring injury over the weekend in the National Scholastic Indoor
Championships at the Armory Track &amp; Field Center in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins, the defending state champion in the 200 meters and the
favorite to win that event and the 400 in the state championships
this year, strained a hamstring Saturday during a 400 qualifying heat
and aggravated it Sunday when she finished sixth--and last--in the
final after pulling up with 70 meters left in the race.</TE>
<TE>   "Angel, being her competitive self, didn't want to take no for an
answer," Gahr Coach Dan Fitzpatrick said about her decision to run
Sunday. "But her body was telling us something was wrong and we need
to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona-bound Perkins, who ranks fourth on the all-time
Southern Section list in the 100 (11.45 seconds), 200 (23.07) and 400
(52.18), missed the L.A. Invitational at the Sports Arena on Feb. 23
because of soreness in her right foot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruno sidelined: Senior Matt Bruno of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills
is another top-flight sprinter who suffered an injury in the National
Scholastic meet.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno, the fastest returning 100 sprinter in the state with a best
of 10.62, advanced to the finals of the 60 and 200 in New York but
withdrew Sunday afternoon after straining his groin at the end of a
semifinal in the 60 that morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have run the finals," Bruno said. "But I didn't want to
risk getting hurt. The outdoor season is what really matters."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno, who has committed to UCLA, won't race again until a March
23 meet against Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley or the Surf City
Invitational at Huntington Beach High two days later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linman under wraps: Senior Chucky Linman of Huntington Beach
Edison has not raced this season after suffering an ankle injury in
the Southern Section Division I football championship game against
Long Beach Poly on Dec. 8, and Coach Erich Moreno is evasive when
asked when Linman will open the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got a thoroughbred, you don't blow him out in the
prelims," Moreno said. "You want him to run in the Kentucky Derby....
He had a long football season, so we're taking everything real slow."</TE>

<HD>Freshmen Receive Knightly Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA fifth-year senior Billy Knight has counseled his freshmen
roommates, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson, on everything from
study habits to accepting reserve roles. Now Knight, who like all the
Bruins has been to the NCAA tournament every season, is giving advice
about not allowing late-season losses to destroy their confidence.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to them about it this week," he said. "It's something I
had problems with as a freshman. Over the years I've learned nothing
is set in stone. Just because we lost our last game doesn't mean we
have to keep losing.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a new season now. We start out playing 40 minutes and the
score is 0-0. The rankings and seedings don't mean anything. It's
something I've learned over the years."</LD>
<TE>   Freshman Cedric Bozeman hangs out in the dorm room Knight shares
with Thompson and Patterson, so he gets an earful as well. Bozeman,
who has been struggling at point guard, decided to give himself some
positive feedback after talking to Knight, digging out tapes of his
best performances, including the only two games he scored in double
figures since the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to remind myself that I can play well, that I have
played well and that I will play well in the future," Bozeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, 23, isn't too old to learn something from the Bruins'
roller coaster season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a make-believe or dream season where we win every game,
it was a season that is like life," he said. "You learn that you
can't give up. That sometimes you reach your potential, but that you
have to stay consistent."</TE>

<LD>Ebony Hoffman and Tiffany Elmore scored 14 points each as USC handed
San Francisco its second most lopsided loss of the season, 72-53, in
an opening-round National Invitation Tournament game Wednesday night
at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans (16-13) took an early lead and held on while moving to
the second round against the winner of tonight's game between North
Texas and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco (18-12), which had won six of seven, was led by Toni
Russell with 11 points and Molly Shanley with 10.</LD>
<TE>   Aisha Hollans added 13 points and Jessica Cheeks 10 for the
Trojans, who shot 50% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State seems to have a big advantage as it tries to make the
NCAA Final Four: The Cyclones won't have to leave home.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the 16 highest-seeded teams, Hilton Coliseum in Ames,
Iowa, is the site of first- and second-round games and the Midwest
Regional to follow. So the third-seeded Cyclones could advance to the
Final Four in San Antonio without having to play a game away from
home.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said it was unfair to have Iowa
State playing at home. He said Vanderbilt and Tennessee--the
top-seeded teams in the region--were being punished by having to play
at Ames.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State is not the first school to have this opportunity.
Connecticut and Tennessee won four NCAA tournament games at home to
reach the 1995 Final Four.</TE>

<HD>Oil Doesn't Grow on Trees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GOODSTEIN</AU>
<BD>David Goodstein is vice provost and professor of
physics at Caltech.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a singular moment in our history. We are rushing toward a
calamity that may very well bring our way of life to an end. It is
entirely predictable and almost inevitable. It is not the doing of
terrorists, but the terrorists may have given us a unique chance to
do something about it. The calamity I speak of is the end of the age
of oil.</LD>
<LD>   Here is the basic physics: Life on Earth exists because of radiant
energy from the sun, plus a small amount of nuclear fuel that
condensed with the Earth when it was formed billions of years ago.
Over the eons, a tiny fraction of that sunlight was converted by
natural processes and stored in the form of fossil fuels. In the
course of a few generations, we have nearly used up the Earth's
entire supply of accessible petroleum.</LD>
<LD>   When that and the other more-difficult-to-use fossil fuels are
used up, we will have nothing left to live on except the light from
the sun and whatever nuclear fuel on Earth we haven't burned. Even
nuclear fuel is a finite resource.</LD>
<TE>   How much oil is left in the ground? Even if we knew how to answer
it, that would probably not be the right question. A better question
is: How long can we go on increasing the rate at which cheap oil is
pumped out of the ground?</TE>
<TE>   We in the United States had a clear preview of what will happen
when conventional oil supplies start to decline. Extraction from
wells in the Lower 48 peaked in 1970 at 9.4 million barrels per day.
That number is now down to 5.8 million barrels and declining rapidly.
Americans consume about 20 million barrels per day. When the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries took advantage of that
situation by reducing supplies in the early 1970s, the result was
immediate and drastic.</TE>
<TE>   The most reliable source of information about how much oil is left
may be retired oil geologists, no longer beholden to their employers,
privy to confidential data and possessing the technical skill to make
use of the data. Their estimates of when conventional oil supplies
will peak (found in various obscure journals and Web sites) range
from 2007 to 2016. In his recent book, "Hubbert's Peak: The Impending
World Oil Shortage," retired geologist Kenneth S. Deffeyes' estimate
is 2004. After that, we will have no choice but to learn to live on
less oil.</TE>
<TE>   For as long as we have the sun, we have at our disposal a steady
stream of energy amounting to about 300 watts per square meter,
averaged over the face of the Earth. The sunlight falling on our
country amounts to about 10,000 times the electricity we Americans
consume. Each of us also consumes 30-plus barrels of oil each year.</TE>
<TE>   We already use little bits of solar energy in the form of
hydroelectric and wind power, biomass (wood from trees, alcohol from
corn) and photovoltaics, in addition to the fossil fuels we use up.
We could learn to live within our energy "income," but that would
amount to a technological and economic revolution of historic
magnitude. That revolution is precisely what President Bush should
challenge the nation to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, a task force under the leadership of Vice President Dick
Cheney issued a now-notorious report on energy that was heavily
influenced by testimony from oil and energy company insiders. The
report urged increasing the rate at which we pump oil as rapidly as
possible. That may have seemed the best solution for next quarter's
bottom line and for popularity in the next election--provided the
peak doesn't occur by then--but it was never the best solution for
our future.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist acts have made it politically possible to
do what is really needed. A president with courage and vision,
particularly one who is himself a former oilman, could seize the
moment and challenge the nation to devise the means to kick its
fossil fuel habit over the next decade. With all of our industrial
might and scientific talent applied to the effort, we might be able
to accomplish it.</TE>
<TE>   That is the way to win the real war. The alternative is to go on
hunting terrorists while our civilization slides into oblivion.</TE>

<HD>Let Yates Live So We Can Seek Root of Her Madness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me but nurse my baby once again</LD>
<LD>   I fondled it the livelong night</LD>
<LD>   They took it from me, just to give me pain</LD>
<TE>   And now they say I murdered it outright.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And indeed the woman had, by drowning. These aren't the words of
Andrea Yates, the Houston woman convicted Tuesday of killing her
children. Instead, these lines come from Margaret, the fictional
character in "Faust," the 1808 play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one difference. Whereas Margaret lives forever as a
symbol of maternal madness, Yates could be executed by the state of
Texas--and if she dies, a chance to learn more about infanticide will
be lost.</TE>
<TE>   We may not know why Yates killed her five children, but now, too
late, we know the signs. Start with the attempted suicide in 1999. "I
had a fear I would hurt somebody. I thought it better to end my own
life and prevent it," she said later.</TE>
<TE>   But what made her crazy? Was it the ultrafundamentalist preacher
who lived with her family for a time, the man who said that women
were the root of evil? Or maybe it was the devil himself; after all,
when she was jailed for quintuple murder, Yates wanted to shave her
body, looking for the numbers "666".</TE>
<TE>   Could it have been the drugs? In the two years before June 20,
2001, she received four mind-altering prescriptions: for Haldol,
Effexor, Wellbutrin and Remeron. Haldol seemed to help the most, but
not long before she killed, her doctor took her off it.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe genetics? Yates' sister and brother have been treated for
depression. Another brother is bipolar. And Yates' 1999 attempt on
her own life involved trazodone, a medication prescribed for her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly an obsessive perfectionism? She cooked meals from scratch
and made some of her kids' clothes; she home-schooled. When the
police came to her house, responding to her 911 call, she explained
her deed in the language of supermom-dom: "They weren't developing
correctly."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an undercurrent of threat bubbles through the mommy
culture. The late Erma Bombeck, the housewife-turned-humorist, was a
gentle soul, but the titles of her books suggest menace amid the crab
grass, including "At Wit's End" and "I Lost Everything in the
Post-Natal Depression." Just last year feminist author Naomi Wolf
published "Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the
Journey to Motherhood," in which she tells of one mother who would
flee from her crying baby, "go into her bedroom, close the door, and
pray, just to keep from harming herself or her daughter."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, 593 children younger than 5 were murdered--about
one-third by mothers--according to the latest data from the FBI.
That's 593 reasons for studying Yates and mothers like her.</TE>
<TE>   "You can always see effective modes of treatment over time in a
patient," says Dr. Pogos Voskanian, a forensic psychiatrist in
Philadelphia. Indeed, with enough data from enough patients, valuable
lessons about child-murder--and child-murder prevention--might be
learned, Voskanian believes.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, tragedies accumulate: On March 1, Guadalupe Garcia of
Plano, Texas, took her 4-month-old daughter to the hospital,
complaining that little Yadira couldn't sleep. The doctor, finding
nothing wrong with the infant, turned the mother away. Five days
later, the mother allegedly suffocated the baby.</TE>
<TE>   As both the Yates and Garcia cases demonstrate, we have little
understanding of why mothers kill their children, let alone how to
stop such killing. Terms such as "post-natal" and "postpartum"
depression may sound scientific, but they cover a wide amalgam of
ill-understood symptoms. Indeed, for the little that we know about
child-murder, we might as well say that such mothers are possessed by
demons. That was true of the infanticidal Margaret two centuries ago;
she saw the devil, "seething all in hell, holding his awful revel."
But after her evil deed, she said simply, "I never shall again be
glad."</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates, too, will never again be glad; five ghosts will
haunt her forever. But maybe, if she is spared the death penalty, she
could be clinically studied with an eye toward what went wrong--and
what could go right in future cases. Then her sad life may bring
wisdom about prevention, shedding light upon the darkness of her
madness.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Yorkers feel conflicted about how to memorialize ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   Many of us have especially strong feelings about the erection of
viewing platforms at the site. It's vulgar, we feel, to spectate at a
mass grave, shameful to desecrate a massive funeral pyre--which is,
literally, what ground zero was until recently, burning for months
and incinerating so many of the missing, presumed dead. Gawking
tourists dishonor the place. It's in unspeakably poor taste to make
the site a destination, like selling tickets at Srebrenica.</LD>
<LD>   Because we live here and we've seen ground zero up close, we also
know that pictures will never do it justice. The scale of the
devastation gets lost in a lens, no matter how wide-angled. You need
to see it in person to feel the shock.</LD>
<TE>   It changes you.</TE>
<TE>   It did me. About a month after the attack, I was driving one night
in lower Manhattan. I was late for an appointment, and I'd gotten
lost in the maze of one-way streets down there. I was whipping around
madly, desperate to find my way out, when suddenly, I turned a sharp
corner onto a dead end. There, in front of me, out of nowhere,
filling my field of vision, was ground zero. The sight pinned me to
my seat.</TE>
<TE>   The crews had the huge, garish spotlights propped high above the
pit, searing down their brutal whiter than white light like the
coldest, most unforgiving of suns. The angry, gnarled, smoldering
wreckage, piled story upon story upon story was so immediate, so
palpable that it seemed to be living, like some horrid industrial
dragon breathing in its sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the worst of it. The sight of the smaller
surrounding buildings hit harder. Still standing there, clustered
about the epicenter, with the black, blank spaces behind every
shattered window gaping like a mouthful of missing teeth, they
remained.</TE>
<TE>   Happening on it this way, out of the murky quotidian streets, was
like coming upon the wreck of the Titanic in the depths of the
sprawling North Atlantic--nothing, nothing, nothing, then suddenly,
all at once, monstrosity, history, grief, fright and a disbelief so
intense my brain could not embrace it. I felt diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, from the window of my East Village apartment, I
saw the towers burning impossibly, gorgeously orange and black
against an opaque blue September sky. Now, when I look out that same
window, I see the twin luminescent beams, assertive and calm,
reaching into the sleepless city night. And it seems from here that
many aircraft on the flight paths to LaGuardia or JFK make a point of
flying low, passing through the shafts as if saluting, communing,
partaking or maybe just offering the best view.</TE>
<TE>   It would be quite something, I imagine, to traverse that now
hallowed airspace, the very space the towers used to occupy, the very
space in which those poor hijacked passengers and office workers
died, not in an airplane determined to crash, but in one destined to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   I envision the aircraft cabin and each individual face within it
illuminated for a few seconds by that strange penetrating upward
light. I envision a smile of solidarity passing among anonymous
travelers, a small tribute both to the victims and to one another for
having carried on in the face of darkness.</TE>

<HD>Visa Reform: Just Say Atta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, the day before the House of Representatives passed an
important bill to make life a bit easier for some immigrants and the
people who hire them, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
notified a Florida flight school that it had approved student visas
for Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi. Unfortunately, six months
earlier the two killed themselves and thousands of others by
hijacking airplanes and crashing them into the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   Sorting the good guys from the bad will never be easy for
immigration officials, but the tragedy of Sept. 11 makes all the more
urgent the need to fix a system that rubber-stamps visas for aspiring
mass murderers while making getting visas all but impossible for tens
of thousands of immigrants who want only to earn a living.</LD>
<LD>   The House bill addresses the latter part of that equation by
temporarily extending a provision of federal law allowing some
noncitizens to remain here while courts decide their immigration
status. The probable beneficiaries are men, women and children who
may have come here illegally or overstayed their visa but have since
applied for permanent visas, sponsored by close relatives or
employers in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   If the new provision becomes law it will impose a $1,000 fine on
these applicants, rather than forcing them to return to their native
countries and risk being barred from the U.S. for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The White House says as many as 640,000 people would benefit from
the bill. Immigration advocates estimate the final figure at about
200,000. Either way, President Bush would no doubt be delighted to
take the change in policy with him as a friendship gesture when he
visits Mexico, El Salvador and Peru next week. And it looks as if
Congress will help him. The House bill barely got the two-thirds
majority vote needed for passage, but the Senate passed a similar
bill without dissent Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the House bill is a provision that requires
immigration officials to track foreign students more closely and to
make visas more tamper-resistant by including "biometric" data such
as images of the retina or facial geometry. It would also order the
creation of a database of suspected terrorists. These and other
immigration security measures are expected to cost $300 million. No
one's complaining about the price.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, however, is that the INS is still in charge of
immigration. Granting posthumous visas to two of the most infamous
terrorists in history is a monumental error, but sadly reflective of
the slapdash record-keeping and bad management that plague the
agency. So, along with the small steps it is making toward
immigration reform, Congress should also push to reform the INS.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious violence is India's shame and one of its biggest internal
threats. A ruling Wednesday by that nation's Supreme Court gives the
government a chance to atone for the abysmal failure of state and
local authorities to stop Hindus from slaughtering hundreds of
Muslims this month.</LD>
<LD>   The court barred Hindus from holding a prayer ceremony planned for
Friday in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya until a lower court
rules whether the site should be given to Muslims or Hindus. For
centuries a mosque stood on the site, but in 1992 Hindu
fundamentalists destroyed it, saying it was the birthplace of the god
Rama and they would build a temple of their religion there. Riots
between adherents of the two faiths after the destruction of the
mosque killed at least 3,000.</LD>
<LD>   This month Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindus from
Ayodhya through the state of Gujarat, killing nearly 60. Revenge
killings left nearly 700 dead, most of them Muslims. In narrow dirt
lanes, Hindus battled Muslims with sticks and swords. Assailants
burned residents to death in their homes while police stood by and
watched.</LD>
<TE>   A Hindu fundamentalist political party dominates India's coalition
government, which had urged the court to let the prayer ceremony
proceed. That violated its pledge not to back the temple construction
attempt at Ayodhya in return for the support of other parties in the
coalition. Now the federal government needs to push aside the
ineffectual leadership in the states and stop the carnage.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of India's 1 billion people are Hindu and 12% Muslim.
India prides itself on being a secular nation, allowing adherents of
all religions to practice their faiths, a contrast with Pakistan,
which was founded as a home for Muslims fearing persecution in India.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of people died in the religious riots of
1947, when the countries became separate, and periodic outbreaks of
sectarian violence have tested India's commitment to its
constitutional guarantees of secularism. The nation still has
hundreds of thousands of troops along its border with Pakistan. It
can't afford internal chaos.</TE>

<LD>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle was right Wednesday to push for
the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill to be passed before the
Senate adjourns for Easter. It may take all-nighters to break
Republican filibusters, but a few holdouts should not be permitted to
thwart what even President Bush has called a "very good bill."</LD>
<LD>   The bill would ban soft money, which is unlimited and unregulated
contributions that are funneled through party organizations. Never
has reform been closer, but it still needs to make it through the
Senate before it can be signed into law and mend, though not end, the
corrupt money culture that has taken over Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The need for reform has never been more pressing. In the 2000
election cycle, the two major parties raised almost $500 million.
With 2002 shaping up as one of history's most hotly contested
elections for control of the House and Senate, money will play an
even bigger role. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics, the Democrats have already raised almost $69 million in
soft money; the Republicans, a little over $100 million. So even as
the Senate debates the Shays-Meehan bill, both parties are trying to
raise as much soft money as they can.</LD>
<TE>   Each election cycle, the numbers go up, up and away. The fact is
that unless reform is passed, the money-raising fever that Congress
has contracted is never going to be cured; it will only get worse.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it is critical to stop Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),
the No. 1 opponent of reform, from destroying the bill. McConnell
persists in trying to make what he innocuously calls "technical
changes" to campaign finance reform. But the problem is that any
amendments, good or bad, mean that the bill would have to go back to
a House-Senate conference, where it would be killed or altered beyond
recognition by House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). As a last
resort, both McConnell and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) are threatening
to filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of reform like to claim that it would accomplish
nothing. Then why are they so afraid of it? No, the Shays-Meehan bill
will not stop all the excesses. Already the Bush White House is
preparing to push the so-called "Pioneers," who collected $100,000 or
more in $1,000 contributions, even harder since they will be able to
collect up to $2,000 as part of campaign reform. The Pioneer
contributors (what they are first in is nothing to brag about) raised
$113 million in 2000 for the Bush campaign. That's $113 million, not
to cure cancer or pay for good teachers but to finance one year of a
political campaign. As we've said before, if that idea offends you,
let Congress know.</TE>

<LD>Re "Simon's Best Hope: Be a New Riordan," Opinion, March 10: Tony
Quinn seems to misunderstand the purpose of a primary election. The
primary should be a reflection of the views of a political party and
not the view of what everyone who votes thinks of the party.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans are not interested in a "middle of the road, I love
everyone" candidate. Rather, the Republican selection of Bill Simon
reflects what our party wants in the next governor of California. The
Supreme Court made the right decision to discard the blanket primary
process as unconstitutional. It was not Justice Antonin Scalia who
made the biggest difference in the election, it was Richard
Riordan--who failed to understand what Republicans stand for. We
don't want a "new" Riordan, we want Simon.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Aspland</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've never been that thrilled with Gov. Gray Davis and was giving
some thought to voting for Riordan if he won the Republican primary.
Rest assured that Simon will not get my vote no matter how he tries
to reinvent himself. Simon billed himself as an ultra-conservative
Republican. After the 2000 presidential election it behooves us all
to beware of right-wing politicians masquerading in moderate
clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Garner</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every article on Simon seems to mention his relationship
with former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Your March 10 article
("Giuliani GOP's No. 1 Running Mate") was typical. It said, "And it
can nudge swing voters, including Californians who may be bothered by
Simon's antiabortion, anti-gun-control views--two topics where
Giuliani's stands are more moderate than those of his endorsed
candidate." Am I missing something here?</TE>
<TE>   Are people so stupid that they would vote for someone whose views
they disagree with simply because he is buddies with someone whose
views they share?</TE>
<TE>   Karen Dauphin</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To say that Gov. Davis selected his opponent gives him more credit
than he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   I will always think, unless Davis says otherwise in a memoir, that
since nobody was close to Riordan in the polls when Davis' campaign
started the attacks, Davis just wanted to face a weaker Riordan. He
probably thought (and correctly, in my opinion) Riordan would get
nominated but conservatives would stay home in the fall election,
seeing no real difference between the candidates, letting Davis skate
to reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Republicans have a candidate who will bring
conservatives out to vote. Simon's own skill, his pro-business
conservatism, the help from Giuliani and the inept Dukakis-ian
campaign of Riordan had more to do with the 50-point swing and
Simon's victory than Davis' overdoing his strategies again.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Sautter</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I probably should be in a museum, because I am a moderate
Republican. Voting is very important to me, and I have never missed
an election yet. Simon doesn't share my values on America's treasured
right to vote; he doesn't always vote. Yet I can't vote for Davis. In
November, I will either vote for a third-party candidate or skip the
governor selection. It's really a shame that Republicans will lose
the governor's race when Riordan had such a good chance of winning it
for us.</TE>
<TE>   BG Harper</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If only Davis could exhibit the same enthusiastic, proactive and
creative approach to governing as he has to fund-raising and the
hijacking of the Republican gubernatorial primary. I am not thrilled
with the expected tenor of the upcoming campaign that undoubtedly
will focus on a full array of social nonissues (abortion, et al.)
instead of budget priorities. It is no wonder that so few people show
up to vote.</TE>

<LD>Re "Conservative Jewish Groups Have Clout," Opinion, March 10:
Michael Massing states that lobbying groups that support Israel have
the support of the Bush administration. As Michael Ramirez pointed
out in his perceptive cartoon (Commentary, March 9), Europe supports
Iraq against U.S. policy (and supports the Arab position against
Israel) because of its dependence on oil. The most repressive regimes
in the world and the U.N. overwhelmingly support anti-Israel
resolutions.</LD>
<LD>   Massing seems to feel that President Bush, Vice President Cheney,
Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice (all strong supporters
of Israel) can't think for themselves. According to Massing they
don't know where America's interests lie and with which countries the
U.S. shares common values. Has he ever entertained the idea that
sometimes national interest and lobbying can be on the same page, or
must the U.S. share the craven views of much of the world?</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Freedman</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Massing tries to assert that the 60,000-member American Israel
Public Affairs Committee is a "conservative" group that does not
reflect the views of American Jews. As someone who interacts
regularly with Reform, Conservative and Orthodox Jews in many
different settings, I can attest that AIPAC is very much
representative of the views of American Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Jews from across the spectrum, whether they agree with the
concessions offered to Yasser Arafat at Camp David in 2000 or not,
are sickened and repulsed by his violent response. Most Jews realize,
as do most Americans, that Israel's deep yearning for a peaceful
solution is simply not matched by the Palestinians at this time.</TE>

<LD>I'm outraged by the government giveaway to survivors of the Sept. 11
attacks ("Final Rules on Sept. 11 Fund Give Families More Money,"
March 8). Kenneth Feinberg, the special master in charge of the
Victims' Compensation Fund, says that the payout will "average" $1.85
million per victim. That's at least $5.5 billion. For what? The
government didn't kill these people.</LD>
<LD>   Will my family get $1.8 million if I get killed on the way to work
tomorrow? No! They'll get a few hundred thousand from insurance that
I've been paying into for years. Will the family of a soldier killed
in Afghanistan get $1.8 million? No! They'll get a percentage of his
salary, which won't even come close to $1.8 million. But the family
of an alien who was in New York illegally will get at least $250,000.</LD>
<LD>   This is just insane. There is no responsibility to indemnify
people just because they happened to die in some dramatic way at the
same time as a lot of other people.</LD>

<LD>Instead of cutting back officers from crucial programs such as DARE
that educate young children on the dangers of drugs, Chief Bernard
Parks should clear out the sixth floor at Parker Center to put more
officers back on patrol ("LAPD's Elite Units Being Scaled Back,"
March 10). His deputy chiefs and commanders all have aides and sworn
personnel who are lieutenants, sergeants and P3s who are doing
clerical work that civilians can do.</LD>
<LD>   Parks should get rid of his driver, aide and bodyguard--who are
also sworn and who accompany him to all the events he attends and are
paid for by my tax dollars. They should be the first to be put back
on patrol and start doing real police work. If the Police Commission
makes its decision based solely on the merits of Parks' job
performance, then there is no doubt he should not be reappointed. The
LAPD cannot afford to lose any more good officers.</LD>

<HD>Arming Pilots Won't Improve Security</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Arming Pilots Is the Best Way to Get Air Security" (Commentary,
March 11), by John Lott, is misguided. Here are some simple
questions: What's a pilot's job? Fly the plane. What's not a pilot's
job? Dealing with passengers.</LD>
<LD>   The cockpit door shouldn't be opened--period. Should an "event"
occur, putting the plane on the ground should be the highest
priority. Providing a pilot with a gun just makes it more likely the
door will be opened; to stop people from coming into the cockpit, the
door just needs to be tougher.</LD>
<LD>   If Lott really feels that putting a gun in a tight space filled
with innocents will make travel safer, the flight attendants would be
a better choice; they are the front line and would be aware of any
disturbance before pilots.</LD>
<TE>   This discussion is a distraction from making travel safer--another
feel-good move like placing the National Guard at the airport. To be
safer, for starters, how about giving the Guard a pink slip and using
the money saved for more sophisticated X-ray machines and building a
passenger database that integrates with the FBI, INS and CIA watch
lists?</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Fallout of Desperation," Commentary, March 12: Robert
Scheer claims that aircraft terrorism would best be met by "taking
the modest steps of maintaining armed air marshals on civilian
aircraft and employing better-trained airport security guards." I
wonder how long it has been since he lost touch with reality?</TE>
<TE>   To put two marshals on each plane would require a force
approaching the size of the Marine Corps. Turnover would be high
because of the boredom. Airlines don't want to give away seats they
could be selling. It's a pipe dream.</TE>
<TE>   If Scheer himself trained for and took a job as a security guard
and was paid $500,000 per year, within a short period of time we
would find his performance to be no better than what we have now. The
boredom of the work would degrade his best intentions.</TE>

<TE>   It's nice to hear that Sandberg has gained respect by working
part-time so she can continue to get welfare benefits. What she
doesn't realize is that other people have to work 40, 50 and 60 hours
a week to support her. Governments have no money. They take it from
those who are willing to work and give it to those who don't.</TE>

<LD>When we consider the case of DeWayne McKinney, released after
spending 19 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, it is
important to remember that McKinney was convicted in a fair trial and
was represented by competent attorneys ("A Freed Lifer Just Lets It
Go," March 9).</LD>
<LD>   Had McKinney been executed, as the prosecutors in his case
demanded, his innocence would never have been discovered and he would
just be one of the hundreds of people put to death in the United
States since 1976, like the thousands now on death row, who we "know"
are guilty.</LD>
<LD>   Even at its best, our judicial system has convicted and will
continue to convict innocent people. The death penalty has no place
in such a system.</LD>

<LD>Re "Cities Exaggerate Cost of Water Cleanup," Opinion, March 10: Why
is it that our local cities are using our tax dollars to fight
against cleaning up polluted water? Did they miss the fact that 65%
of the voters of L.A. County supported Proposition 40, the
$2.6-billion bond measure that was largely promoted to protect water
quality and open space? L.A. has great weather, diversity of cultures
and incredible beaches. Enough is enough. The cities should stop
fighting for dirty water. The time is long overdue to start cleaning
up our beaches, rivers and wetlands.</LD>

<HD>Defense Rests in Dog Mauling Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Defendants were more concerned about their animals
than neighbors, prosecution suggests. Post-attack TV interview draws
scrutiny.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco lawyers on trial for the mauling death of Diane
Whipple cared more about their two large Presa Canario dogs than they
did about their neighbors, prosecutors suggested Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Dist. Atty. James Hammer asked defendant Marjorie
Knoller about her yearlong effort to keep one of the dogs alive even
after it participated in the fatal attack and after neighbors told
police they were fearful of the dogs.</LD>
<LD>   Hammer also said Wednesday that he planned to show the jury a
letter written by defendant Robert Noel, Knoller's husband, in which
he said he would fight to keep Hera alive, in spite of his neighbors.
"Bane is dead. So is one of our neighbors," the letter said.</LD>
<TE>   Whipple, 33, had just returned from getting groceries Jan. 26,
2001, when the dogs charged her in the hallway of her San Francisco
apartment building. Bane went for her throat and Hera tore at
Whipple's clothing. Whipple died that night. Bane was put to death.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel, who lived two doors from Whipple, are charged
with involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog. Knoller,
who was present during the mauling, also faces a second-degree murder
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the defendants ignored warnings that their dogs
were dangerous. Hammer and Assistant Dist. Atty. Kimberly Guilfoyle
Newsom have presented nearly 30 witnesses who testified about
frightening encounters they had with the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who rested their cases Wednesday, have
countered with testimony that the dogs were friendly and
well-behaved. Knoller testified that she was never warned about the
dogs and that she couldn't anticipate the mauling. Noel did not
testify.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller handed Bane over to animal control officials immediately
after the attack because, she said, she didn't want to have anything
to do with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a pet--a dog that had been loving, docile, friendly, good
with people--turn into a crazed wild animal," she said through tears
Wednesday. "I could never imagine this dog turning into what he
turned into."</TE>
<TE>   Couple Fought to Prevent Dog's Death</TE>
<TE>   But Knoller and Noel embarked on a legal battle to prevent Hera
from being put to death. Hera was destroyed last month after the
California Supreme Court refused to grant the couple a reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Nedra Ruiz said Knoller did not believe Hera was
vicious or dangerous. Ruiz said she was also trying to prevent Hera's
destruction so animal experts could examine her and testify in the
criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   During continued cross-examination Wednesday, Hammer confronted
Knoller with statements she made on the "Good Morning America"
television program two weeks after Whipple's death. Knoller said in
the interview that the attack was not her fault and that Whipple had
"ample opportunity" to go inside.</TE>
<TE>   "She was in her apartment," Knoller said. "She could have just
slammed her door shut. I would have."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer contrasted Knoller's composed appearance on TV with her
sobbing testimony this week. "On 'Good Morning America' she didn't
shed a single tear and blamed Diane Whipple for her death," Hammer
said outside court.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller denied shirking responsibility, and said she agreed to the
televised interview because of the way the press was portraying her
and Noel.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer also continued challenging Knoller's credibility and
accusing her of changing her story about what happened the day of the
attack. Knoller said that she can't always remember every detail but
that she never meant to mislead the jury.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peggy Hewett, 56, a Broadway actress who jokingly said she played
"ugly old broads," died March 1 at her home in Southampton, N.Y., of
leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   She had a small role as a chorine in the 1969 musical "Jimmy," but
was still considered a newcomer when Tommy Tune cast her in the
starring role in "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine" in 1980.
She played Madame Pavlenko, a dowager in the mode of the Marx
Brothers' high-society nemesis Margaret Dumont.</LD>
<LD>   That role opened the way for Hewett to win similar parts,
including the nagging wife Charis in "Olympus on My Mind" in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   Hewett spent much of the past decade in Southern California,
performing with small theaters and working as a real estate agent.</TE>

<HD>Elaine Sawyer, 62; Personal Aide to First Lady Reagan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAEME ZIELINSKI</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Elaine Crispen Sawyer, a trusted aide and press secretary to Nancy
Reagan who was deeply involved in the response to events that defined
the former first lady's public image, died Tuesday of pancreatic
cancer at Inova Mount Vernon Hospital in suburban Alexandria, Va. She
was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, who had worked in the 1970s as a media assistant to
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in California, served as Nancy Reagan's
personal secretary from 1981 to 1985, then as press secretary from
1985 to 1989.</LD>
<LD>   A tough employer whose relationship with members of the Reagan
Cabinet and staff was often rocky, Nancy Reagan showed a high degree
of confidence in Sawyer. In the role of confidant, in 1987, Sawyer
kept the secret of Reagan's breast cancer, and planned funeral
arrangements when Reagan's mother, Edith Davis, died.</LD>
<TE>   Sawyer also used her generally warm relationship with White House
reporters to try to recast what she saw as negative press about her
boss.</TE>
<TE>   "Come the first snow in Washington and it'll be Nancy Reagan's
fault," Sawyer said in a 1986 interview with the Washington Post.
"The minute anything goes awry, they're looking for people to blame
and it's Nancy Reagan. Somehow her name always comes to the top."</TE>
<TE>   That was said after Reagan was accused in a whispering campaign by
disgruntled Cabinet members of taking undue control of the
president's schedule during his recuperation from prostate cancer
surgery. Much of the tension was reportedly with then-Chief of Staff
Donald Regan. Sawyer was involved in the first lady's
behind-the-scenes response.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer was cited in Kitty Kelley's controversial 1991 Nancy Reagan
biography as being the aide who took zodiac charts to Reagan in the
White House family quarters. When it was reported in 1988 that Reagan
had been consulting San Francisco astrologer Joan Quigley for advice
on scheduling and even on presidential policy, Sawyer was initially
mum.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a blizzard of media inquiry and public parody, she and
administration spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later cast the
consultations as a reaction to the failed assassination attempt
against the president. "There is nothing wrong with it. It's done for
the sake of comfort, like a good-luck charm," she told the Post.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer also tried to tamp down another controversy when it was
revealed in 1988 that Reagan failed to report the borrowing of lavish
outfits and accessories by such designers as James Galanos, despite a
previous promise to White House lawyers, made in the face of similar
criticism, that she would disclose such arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "She set her own rule, and she broke her own rule," Sawyer said
initially.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan, however, later denied having accepted any of the clothing
or having done anything wrong, and Sawyer toed the line. But the
negative image of privilege lingered.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer was a key player in more successful public outreach, such
as the "Just Say No" anti-drug program, and had helped arrange
Reagan's appearances at NBA games and on a "Diff'rent Strokes"
television episode.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday, Nancy Reagan said: "Elaine Crispen Sawyer
was a dear friend and trusted confidant.... It's hard to believe that
she won't be here tomorrow when I want to pick up the phone and just
catch up on the news."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer, a native of Southfield, Mich., attended UCLA. In 1975 she
joined the media consulting firm Deaver &amp; Hannaford, where she was an
executive assistant to Ronald Reagan's communications advisor Michael
Deaver.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include her husband, George Sawyer, and a daughter from
her first marriage, Cheryl Crispen Bitsberger, both of Alexandria;
three stepchildren; and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Shirley Scott, 67; Jazz Musician Was Queen of Hammond Organ</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shirley Scott, one of the few women in jazz to fashion a successful
career on the Hammond organ, died Sunday in Philadelphia. She was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, in failing health in recent years with a series of problems
brought about by the use of the diet drug combination fen-phen, died
at Presbyterian Hospital of heart failure. In 2000, a Philadelphia
jury awarded her $8 million after she sued the drug's manufacturer
and a local physician who had prescribed the medication.</LD>
<LD>   Bedridden over the last year, she had been unable to play the
organ as she had done so magnificently since taking it up in the
1950s.</LD>
<TE>   Scott was born in Philadelphia, where her father ran a jazz club
and her brother played the saxophone in local bands.</TE>
<TE>   As a girl, Scott learned to play the piano and picked up the
trumpet at the city's high school for girls. She earned her
bachelor's and master's degrees at Cheyney University, one of the
country's oldest African American institutions, and decades later
returned there to teach music.</TE>
<TE>   But her career as a musician didn't take off until she switched to
the Hammond organ, an instrument becoming popular in jazz due to the
playing of another Pennsylvania native: Jimmy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   She began playing in small groups generally led by a saxophonist
and including a drummer. Her saxophone associates over the years
included Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, Dexter Gordon and Stanley Turrentine,
to whom she was married for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with National Public Radio some years ago,
Turrentine described playing with Scott.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't try to overpower you like a lot of other organists....
She played with you.... And when she played, she could sound like a
big band at times and then [at other] times she would sound like a
trio or whatever we wanted to sound like."</TE>
<TE>   Another admirer of hers was comedian Bill Cosby, who first heard
her in clubs around Philadelphia in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "The organ trios were very big in the local Philadelphia bars,"
Cosby told NPR, "and what struck me about her was the fact that she
played just as much organ as Jimmy Smith and Richard 'Groove' Holmes.
To me she was just a great keyboard player."</TE>
<TE>   Cosby hired Scott in 1992 to act as musical director for his
short-lived "You Bet Your Life" program.</TE>
<TE>   Scott recorded extensively through the late 1950s, '60s and '70s
for labels that included Prestige, Impulse and Atlantic. She also
toured with her own group.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her five children, several grandchildren and
two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Lake Being Searched by FBI for Bodies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FBI organized crime investigators are searching for bodies in a
remote mountain lake 60 miles west of Yosemite National Park and have
called for special equipment to help them scour the deepest areas.</LD>
<LD>   The search began Monday morning when 22 divers from five county
sheriff's departments were called to help locate at least one body
that may have been dumped in Lake Don Pedro, an FBI spokesman said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   No human remains were found during Monday's eight-hour search of
the Tuolumne County lake, a 13,000-acre reservoir with a 160-mile
shoreline, but sonar equipment showed several deep areas that divers
could not reach.</LD>
<TE>   Officials have now decided to bring in a small remote-controlled
submersible vehicle to help in the hunt, but it could take several
days for its arrival and resumption of serious search efforts, said
Nick Rossi, spokesman for the FBI's Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi said he could not reveal any details about who the possible
victims might be or discuss the organized crime investigation at all,
saying the case originated in another FBI field office that has
requested secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were diving Monday in an area beneath the Jacksonville
Bridge, where the water is about 140 feet deep,'' Rossi said. ''We
know from sonar that there are deeper pockets of the lake, so we may
resume when we have the right equipment to search deeper.''</TE>
<TE>   The search efforts Monday began after the FBI asked the Governor's
Office of Emergency Services to contact search and rescue teams in
mountain counties around Lake Don Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Divers and boats were provided by sheriff's departments from
Tuolumne, Calaveras, El Dorado, Mariposa and Placer counties.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are remaining in constant contact,'' said Sheryl Tankersley,
information officer for the state emergency services agency.</TE>
<TE>   Mariposa Sheriff's Department Sgt. Doug Bimmewies said Mariposa
County provided seven divers, one boat and one boat operator. His
team started out at 4 a.m., and the actual search began about 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   ''Visibility was fair, about 4 to 5 feet at 140 feet,'' he said.
''Bringing in a submersible vehicle should help. They are like a
miniature version of a mini-sub, maybe 3 feet by 2 feet, with a
camera that can go very low.''</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, authorities found a body in Lake Melones, in nearby
Calaveras County. The body was male, between 40 and 60 years old, and
was found floating with hands bound and a plastic bag over the head.
Officials are looking into whether the cases are connected.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the body of 15-year-old Juli Sund, one of three Yosemite
tourists allegedly murdered by motel handyman Cary Stayner, was found
at Lake Don Pedro. Area residents recalled that Wednesday while
discussing the newest FBI search.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've been living around here for 21 years, and now it's happened
twice in just a short time,'' said Lynne Hazelwood, an employee at
Lake Don Pedro Marina. ''Quite a few of our customers were talking
about it today.</TE>
<TE>   ''But the murder of that girl was scary,'' she added. ''There's
not a lot of worry about this, at least not yet. I suppose there will
be if they start fishing out bodies.''</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Rating Slips Over Bid to Oust Parks</HD>
<DH>Times Poll: The mayor's standing drops among city residents,
especially blacks. Approval of the police chief is up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's decision to oppose a second term
for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has hurt his standing among city
residents, less than half of whom approve of Hahn's performance in the
first nine months of his administration, according to a new Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's footing is particularly precarious among African Americans, who
voted overwhelmingly to elect him last year and have said they feel
betrayed by his decision to go against the black police chief. Now 43%
disapprove of his performance, compared with 30% who say he is doing a
good job.</LD>
<LD>   Among all residents, Hahn's approval rating is 46%, tepid support for
a chief executive so early in his term. About a quarter disapprove of how
he is handling his job, and almost a third of those surveyed had no
opinion.</LD>
<TE>   Respondents who are unhappy with Hahn's performance most frequently
cite his opposition to Parks' reappointment as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   "He shouldn't have taken that kind of stand," said Tarzana resident
Carmen Schiavoni, 77, who was surveyed in the poll and agreed to a
follow-up interview. "He's the mayor; he should bring peace to the city.
He shouldn't come right out and embarrass the man."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the chief's approval rating is up significantly from a year
ago, with 51% of residents saying he has done a good job, giving him
slightly more support than the mayor who wants him ousted. The same
percentage support the chief's bid for reappointment, and he enjoys
increased support among blacks, whites and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department appears to have rebounded from the
Rampart scandal, with about two out of three residents saying they
approve of the department's job performance. Two years ago, as
revelations of police corruption emerged, the department's approval
rating fell to 36%. In the last decade the LAPD has typically enjoyed
high public approval, with ratings falling only during controversies such
as Rampart and the beating of Rodney G. King.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, which was conducted between March 9 and 12 under the
direction of Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus, surveyed the
opinions of 1,113 city residents, including 257 African Americans, and
has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's efforts to dislodge the chief, which he announced at the end of
January, seem to have overshadowed all other actions he has taken so far.</TE>
<TE>   Among supporters, there is little consensus about what Hahn has done
well. About four out of 10 give no reason for approving the mayor's
performance. The next-largest group say they like him because he tries
hard.</TE>
<TE>   But more than a quarter of all residents said they are less supportive
of the mayor because of his posture toward Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could show me some positive things Hahn has done since he
became mayor that would counteract what is seemingly a deceptive act,
then maybe things would balance out in his favor," said Cheyenne
Chambers, a secretary from the Wilshire district. "But I don't really see
him doing such positive things."</TE>
<TE>   The survey also demonstrates dissatisfaction in Hahn's base. African
Americans gave Hahn broad support during last year's election, helping
him beat former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, 54% to 46%.</TE>
<TE>   In that campaign, four out of five blacks cast ballots for Hahn, who
grew up in South Los Angeles and whose father, the late county Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn, represented the area for decades, according to Times exit
polls.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a quarter of blacks strongly disapprove of Hahn's performance,
and an additional fifth somewhat disapprove. About four out of 10 blacks
who voted for Hahn said they would not have done so if they had known he
was going to push to replace Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not happy with him," said Bernardine Kelom, 70, a retired
county employee who lives in West Los Angeles. "He just seems like a
different person than I thought he was. I thought he was going to be a
chip off his daddy's block, but he wasn't."</TE>
<TE>Chief's Approval Up Compared to Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Parks, meanwhile, is enjoying a surge in popularity. Residents today
are more inclined to look favorably on his record as chief than they were
a year ago, when he and the LAPD were embroiled in the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In the new survey, slightly more than half of residents approve of the
way Parks is handling his job, up from 37% in March 2001. The number of
people who disapprove of Parks has also fallen, from 37% to 28%.</TE>
<TE>   But there were also stark racial differences in responses to questions
about the chief. Parks' favorable showing among white respondents, for
example, fell just shy of the mayor's, 42% versus 49%. And 7% of whites
said they don't approve of Parks because he is black.</TE>
<TE>   By far the strongest support for the chief comes from African
Americans, who give him a 71% approval rating and 16% disapproval.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than half of the city's residents think Parks should be
reappointed, about three in 10 oppose him staying on and a fifth remain
undecided. But 81% of blacks support the chief's bid for a second term.
Among those, roughly two out of three African Americans strongly support
a second term for Parks--substantially more than the number who strongly
approve of the chief's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's tried to make some strategic changes, and I think change
is good," said Edward Broaddus, 35, an actor who lives in North
Hollywood. "The short amount of time we've given him hasn't been enough."</TE>
<TE>   Residents offered many specific reasons they think the chief is doing
a good job, crediting him with cleaning up the LAPD, lowering crime and
being a strong leader.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has often touted the LAPD's efforts to investigate the case of
violent, drug-dealing officers in the city's Rampart precincts, arguing
that under his leadership the department undertook reforms to address the
problems it revealed.</TE>
<TE>   But the survey indicated that some people still hold him responsible
for the corruption scandal. More than a fifth of poll respondents who
disapprove of Parks' tenure cited Rampart as a reason. The other top
reasons were low morale among police officers and bad management.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD fared somewhat better than its leader in the poll, suggesting
that the department's public image may be recovering somewhat from the
ugly controversies surrounding Rampart.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they approve of the way the LAPD
is handling its job, with 20% describing their approval as strong--the
highest percentage since the scandal broke in 1999. And the percentage of
all respondents who said they strongly disapprove of the LAPD's
performance is at its lowest level in two years--9% compared with 26% in
an April 2000 Times poll. Residents hold these opinions although 56% of
them believe racist feelings are common within the LAPD, down only
slightly from previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Zerkle, 44, an actor who lives in Reseda, said that under Parks,
"the department has done a good job of trying to maintain higher
visibility in the neighborhood. They are really trying to increase their
presence."</TE>
<TE>Hahn Seeks Political Gain, Respondents Say</TE>
<TE>   Though black respondents also gave the LAPD favorable ratings by a
slim majority--53%--that portion was the lowest of any ethnic group. And
the percentage of blacks who disapprove strongly of the LAPD's job
performance was 20%--more than three times the rate for whites.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40% of all residents said Hahn staked out his position on Parks
for political gain. But the poll demonstrated that the move has cost him
more support than he gained.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than a quarter of respondents said they are less
supportive of the mayor because of his decision about Parks, while only
10% said they are more supportive.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has lost an even larger share of support among blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of five blacks said they think Hahn gave the chief his
qualified support during the mayor's race to get their vote.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn has three years before he faces reelection to recover that
support. And several poll respondents said that though they are
disappointed in the mayor's actions, he has time to convince them that he
deserves their backing again.</TE>
<TE>   "He still has his good points," said Albertha Stevens, a medical
records librarian who lives on the Westside and says Hahn used Parks to
win support in the black community during the campaign. "I might vote for
him again."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos, who voted overwhelmingly for Villaraigosa in last year's
election, seem the most unperturbed by the dispute over whether to
reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Half of Latinos approve of Hahn, while 20% disapprove of him. Only a
small fraction of those who are unhappy with the mayor cite his
opposition to the chief as a factor.</TE>
<TE>   But Latinos, more than whites and blacks, are worried about crime in
their neighborhoods. About one-fifth said they feel very unsafe, and an
additional 15% said they feel fairly unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 75% of city residents said they feel safe in their
communities, down slightly from one year ago.</TE>

<HD>In Breakthrough, Monkey Think, Computer Do</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An experimental brain implant the size of an M&amp;M has allowed a
monkey to control a computer cursor by thought alone, Brown University
researchers announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   It is the latest advance by scientists trying to perfect a link
between mind and machine in the hope that thousands of patients who are
unable to move or speak can resume communication with the world around
them.</LD>
<LD>   The development heralds a future when the paralyzed and infirm may
send e-mail, surf the Web and command other computer resources simply by
thinking about them.</LD>
<TE>   The new device, described in research published today in Nature, uses
a special mathematical formula to translate signals from a few motor
neurons on the surface of the monkey's brain via cable into movement on a
computer screen. There is no need for the extensive training previous
experimental techniques have required.</TE>
<TE>   "We substituted thought control for hand control," said Brown
neuroscientist John Donoghue, the project's senior researcher.</TE>
<TE>   Lead researcher Dr. Mijail D. Serruya and his colleagues at Brown
tested the device by having a monkey play a simple video game, in which
the animal used the cursor to chase a moving target on a computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   The monkey was able to move the cursor "instantly" with almost as much
control as if it were using a computer mouse or a joystick, Serruya said.
The monkey wills the cursor to move. The cursor moves.</TE>
<TE>   The animal's hands-free cursor control was almost as fast and accurate
as when it used its hands, the researchers reported. So far, three
monkeys have received the implant.</TE>
<TE>   Linked to a personal computer, the cursor control device "would work
for anything you can do or you can imagine doing by pointing and
clicking. This includes reading e-mail," Donoghue said. "Or imagine an
on-screen keyboard that someone can use to type sentences or issue
commands by pointing and clicking."</TE>
<TE>   The Brown implant system uses an array of 100 tiny electrodes to
detect electrical activity from a pinprick of neurons--between seven and
30 of the untold thousands of nerve cells in the motor cortex, the
section of the brain that controls movement--and relay it to a personal
computer.</TE>
<TE>   There, a formula the Brown group designed turns the brain activity
into instructions a computer can use to plot the cursor movements. That
software interpreter uses a fairly straightforward application of
textbook algebra, the scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   The system is so small and draws so little power that any future
device developed for human use could easily be made wireless, said
biomedical engineer Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi at the Rehabilitation Institute
of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "In clinical terms, that is quite important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It may be a decade or more before any clinical product is ready for
testing, however. So little is known about tapping the neural activity of
the human brain that researchers are likely to proceed slowly. No one
knows, for example, what the effect would be of having such an electrode
in the brain for years or whether over time the implant might lose its
ability to function.</TE>
<TE>   "This implant is potentially one that is very suitable for humans,"
Serruya said. "It shows enough promise that we think it could ultimately
be hooked up via a computer to a paralyzed patient.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be careful that the implant is suitable and safe," Serruya
said. "There are a few technical details that we are still working on."</TE>
<TE>   The Brown researchers have filed for a patent on the technique and
formed a company called Cyberkinetics to develop medical applications.</TE>
<TE>   Other research groups in recent years have announced encouraging
successes in experiments with devices designed to turn brain commands
into computer instructions. Until now, these were limited in their
potential usefulness by technical constraints.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, neuroscientists at the University of Tuebingen in Germany
tested an experimental cursor control device in human volunteers, as did
researchers at Emory University in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Those devices allowed several patients paralyzed by advanced strokes
or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to spell words on a computer screen by
modulating their brain waves.</TE>
<TE>   Both implant systems, however, required intensive practice to
master--up to 150 training sessions over more than a year. The implanted
electrodes themselves were bulky.</TE>
<TE>   In related work, researchers led by neurobiologist Miguel Nicolesis at
Duke University successfully used the motor control signals from monkeys
to move a robot arm. During an experiment last year, Nicolesis linked the
monkey to the Internet and used its brain signals to control a robot arm
600 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   To mimic arm movements, however, that system requires extensive
computer analysis after the scientists have recorded the brain signals
during many repetitions.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the newest effort to link brain and machine remarkable is
the ease with which it can be learned and the small number of neurons it
requires to operate, Mussa-Ivaldi said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a mountain of things we still need to know," he said. "But
this is progress."</TE>

<HD>'It's Like They Vanished Into Thin Air'</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Two neighbor girls, 12 and 13, are missing in Oregon.
Belief grows that crime occurred.</DH>

<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>When 12-year-old Ashley Pond disappeared--just vanished from the
apartment complex one day in January, didn't show up at the bus stop for
school--her friend Miranda was scared, then mad. Ashley had run away, she
figured. Hadn't bothered to call anybody. Left everybody worried for
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   "That was her way of dealing with it, I guess," said Miranda's mother,
Michelle Duffey, who lives a few apartments down from the Pond family.
Then, when the school dance team organized a benefit to raise money for a
reward for Ashley, Miranda choreographed a solo routine as a special way
of remembering her friend.</LD>
<LD>   "Miranda started realizing that even if she did run away, she wasn't
coming back any time soon," her mother said.</LD>
<TE>   The dance benefit is scheduled for March 23 at Oregon City High
School. But Miranda probably won't be in it. Friday morning, in a case
that has so many frightening parallels police believe they are linked,
Miranda Gaddis, 13, also disappeared from the Newell Creek Village
apartments. Said goodbye to her mother in the morning. Didn't show up at
the bus stop.</TE>
<TE>   Did they run away together? Did Ashley contact Miranda, tell her where
she was and persuade her to join her? Both families pray that's what
happened. But as the days go by, law enforcement officials are
increasingly convinced that neither girl left home willingly.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a growing belief that the cases are related, and while
there's a slight hope that they have run away, there is a growing belief
that there was some kind of criminal activity involved," said Beth Ann
Steele, spokeswoman for the FBI, which has sent in agents to help the
Oregon City police.</TE>
<TE>FBI Profilers Issue Advisories to Public</TE>
<TE>   This week, profilers from FBI headquarters in Quantico, Va., were
dispatched to this aging working-class suburb southeast of Portland.
Agency officials went on television advising people, without explaining
why, to be on the lookout for someone who recently sold a car, who shows
signs of increasing drug or alcohol use, who appears tired from being up
all night--profiles a parent can barely stand to contemplate.</TE>
<TE>   Both Duffey and the Ponds say they believe neither girl ran away, but
they are also sure that neither would have allowed themselves to be
abducted by a stranger. "I really think someone they know did something,"
Duffey said. "Because [Miranda] wouldn't have gotten in the car with
someone she didn't know."</TE>
<TE>   The Pond family has kept a low profile since Ashley's disappearance,
but Ashley's mother, Lori Pond, appeared with Duffey on all three
television networks this week pleading for the return of her daughter.
"She's very loud and outgoing and she likes talking. So she would likely
talk to you," Pond said.</TE>
<TE>   The 125-unit apartment complex is a cluster of neat, gray, two-story
buildings with balconies, sheltered in a deep gully in a nest of
forest--a place with plenty of kids and stay-at-home moms who are on the
phone with each other several times daily. Parents are uncertain what
danger to watch out for. A stranger lurking in the woods near the school
bus stop? Or someone everyone knows, someone who knocked on the door
Friday morning after Duffey kissed her daughter goodbye, warned her to
lock the door and left for work?</TE>
<TE>   With that haunting possibility in mind, at least four families have
moved out of Newell Creek Village in the last few days, and another
moving truck was parked at the complex Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of young families here, a lot of children, and a lot of
people are up at that hour of the morning, getting kids off to school,
going to work," said Kim Hamlin, a neighbor. "I keep thinking to myself,
it had to be someone they knew. Because for a stranger to have come and
violently abducted them, somebody would have had to see something. It's
like they vanished into thin air."</TE>
<TE>   Hamlin, like many parents at the complex, won't allow her 11-year-old
son to play outside anymore. "I've heard a lot of parents feeling like we
have to kind of raise our kids in cages at the moment," she said. "I
personally don't feel comfortable and safe for my child unless he's in
the house under lock and key."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Knoph allows her 12-year-old son to play with the two other
boys she knows best, "and that's about it. They don't go anywhere else,
with anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   "People are thinking that maybe somebody took them who knew them,"
Knoph said, "but who do you even think about going to question?"</TE>
<TE>'There's No Way At All She Would Run Away'</TE>
<TE>   Both girls were members of the dance team at Gardiner Middle School,
and Miranda was eagerly anticipating getting ready for a Saturday morning
competition the day she disappeared. The night before, Duffey helped her
bleach her sandy blond hair a lighter hue, and Miranda called her dance
coach, Sharonda Garrett, a close friend of the family, and asked her if
she would braid it in cornrows for her the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the whole, 'I'm going to bed now.' She was going to try
to get on the Internet, but she couldn't get on," Garrett said. "There's
no way at all she would run away. She wouldn't do that. There were so
many things that were coming up that she was too excited about."</TE>
<TE>   The dance benefit for Ashley, among them. Miranda planned a solo to
the tunes of Limp Bizkit, Britney Spears and 'N Sync, Duffey said. Now,
her 14-year-old sister, Marissa, will take her place, and the benefit
will help raise money for two missing girls, not one. The Portland
Trailblazers may attend, and the evening will culminate in Garrett and
Marissa performing to the Lee Ann Womack song, "I Hope You Dance," with
its entreaty for a life lived fully, danced, rather than sat out on the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for them," Garrett said of members of the dance team.
"They're all mourning in their own way. I mean, everybody is hanging onto
their prayers and their knowing that they're going to come back home.
Their new motto is they're not going to sit down and take it. They're
going to dance until they come back."</TE>
<TE>   At a vigil at Oregon City Christian Church for the girls Tuesday
night, youth pastor Ken Swatman urged the nearly 150 gathered there to
pray with hope--hope they'll come home, or else hope that a divine
presence is with them, wherever they are, making them strong enough to
deal with whatever is happening.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a memorial service," he emphasized. "We don't seek
closure here tonight. We are here to seek hope, to seek strength.
Celebrations and memorials are reserved for when the girls come home."</TE>
<TE>   But as the night wore on, and the soft hymns were sung, hope faltered.
Mothers clutched their daughters' small, shaking shoulders, and tried to
hush the sobs of children too young to cry quietly. Fathers stood near,
shuffling from foot to foot, looking miserable.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the girls' classmates gathered at the altar and read notes
and poems they had written over the last few days. "Ashley, please come
home! Everyone loves you so darn much," said one.</TE>
<TE>   "My best [friend] Miranda is gone, and this poem goes on," said
another. "Ashley, do not be mad just because of the missing of Miranda
makes me more sad. But don't worry, we will get you back. I just can't
believe that they have been kidnapped. They were 13 years old. Oh so
young. They couldn't go for the gold."</TE>
<TE>   In the aisle near the front, Duffey sat silently, the head of her
11-year-old daughter Miriah Gaddis buried in her lap. Then she went home
to see whether there were any messages on her answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   "Miranda, this is your mom, and I love you very, very much, and I want
you to come home. Wherever you're at, leave your phone number and I'll
come get you, wherever you are," the answering machine says. "And if this
is someone who knows where she is, please bring her back, because I'll
never stop looking for her."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday soundly rejected tougher fuel economy
standards for cars, SUVs and other vehicles, delivering a blow to
environmentalists and putting in doubt whether Congress will pass a
comprehensive energy bill this year.</LD>
<LD>   In a victory for the auto industry and auto unions, the push for
stricter fuel efficiency was thwarted by a coalition of Democrats from
vehicle-producing and rural states and Republicans dubious of new
regulation.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate instead approved a measure backed by the auto industry and
unions that would leave it to the Department of Transportation to set the
fuel economy standards. Senators also voted to bar the federal agency
from increasing miles-per-gallon requirements for pickup trucks, even if
it raises the standards for other vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   The votes virtually ensure that if an energy bill emerges from
Congress, it will not include a major increase in vehicle fuel
efficiency. That, along with an upcoming Senate vote expected to reject
President Bush's call to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil drilling, could doom the bill, one of the president's domestic
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   With both the drilling proposal and new fuel economy standards
eliminated, there may not be sufficient remaining inducements for
Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on a final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the tougher fuel efficiency standards, led by Sens. John
F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), framed Wednesday's debate
as a national security issue, the biggest step that Congress could take
to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   "We bowed down to the special interests on fuel efficiency and as a
result of it, we are going to bow down to [the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries] for decades to come," charged Sen. Richard Durbin
(D-Ill.), a supporter of the tougher standards.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, led by Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Christopher S. Bond
(R-Mo.), portrayed the proposed standards as a threat to auto worker
jobs, a recipe for more highway accidents and an assault on an American
freedom: the right to own an SUV, pickup or any other vehicle of choice.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to tell a mom in my state she should not get an SUV
because Congress decided that would be a bad choice," Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment that crystallized the arguments, Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) pointed to a photo of a minuscule purple car and
suggested that that was the future awaiting Americans if the Kerry-McCain
proposal passed.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be fine in Boston or Chicago, but it's not fine in Lucedale,
Miss., or Des Moines, Iowa, or a lot of other places," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also opposed the Kerry-McCain proposal. The Bush-backed energy
legislation that cleared the House last year calls for minimal increases
in the fuel economy standards.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry and McCain complained that their proposal's impact was being
misrepresented. Kerry repeatedly said that auto makers could improve fuel
efficiency without forcing Americans into smaller vehicles. "People
aren't going to be farming in compact cars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the average fuel economy figure that auto makers must
achieve for their vehicle fleets. Currently, they must meet an average of
27.5 mpg for cars and 20.7 mpg for light trucks, a category that includes
sport-utility vehicles, minivans and pickups.</TE>
<TE>Senators Cite Savings in Oil, Drop in Pollution</TE>
<TE>   Kerry and McCain proposed combining the two categories and raising the
standard to 35 mpg by 2015 (the current overall average is about 24 mpg).</TE>
<TE>   That would have been the biggest increase since the fuel economy
measure was signed into law in 1975. And, Kerry and McCain stressed, it
would have saved 1 million barrels of oil a day by 2015, as well as
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure the Senate approved as an alternative, traffic
safety administrators at the Department of Transportation would have 15
months to set revised standards for light trucks and 24 months for cars.
Factors to be considered would include how the standards would affect
vehicle safety and auto industry jobs. If the agency does not act,
Congress could set the standards.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said it was unlikely that the agency would mandate
significant improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "Senators have chosen political security over national security," said
David M. Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a
Washington-based advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   But Robert Liberatore, senior vice president of external affairs for
DaimlerChrysler, said: "We expect and are planning for increases in our
corporate average fuel economy in the coming years and commit to work
with [federal transportation officials] to do so in a way that does not
compromise safety."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measure, which passed 62 to 38, said it would allow
standards to be based on science, not an arbitrary figure drawn up on the
Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   "We all share the important goals of improving fuel economy in cars
and protecting our environment, and our bill will achieve these results
without costing countless U.S. jobs," said Levin, the proposal's chief
proponent.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment also calls for more generous tax incentives to encourage
consumers to buy fuel-efficient cars powered by alternative fuels and
increased government funding for research into other fuel-efficient
vehicles. Wednesday's Senate action continued a decade-long stalemate on
energy policy that has divided Congress nearly as much along regional as
party lines.</TE>
<TE>   While five Republicans from the Northeast and West Coast joined McCain
in opposing the measure, the proposal succeeded because of defections
from 19 Senate Democrats representing both auto-producing and farm
states, most of them in the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   That alignment reflects opponents' success in defining the issue not
only as an economic threat to the auto industry but a cultural threat to
rural values, symbolized by the pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the vote suggested that the rural arm of the opponents'
lobbying effort was much more successful than its suburban component. In
ads opposing the bill, the auto industry portrayed the legislation as a
threat both to suburban "soccer moms" carting kids in SUVs, and to rural
families who depend on pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats from such big suburban states as Illinois, California
and New Jersey--where environmentalists are also strong--uniformly
opposed the amendment leaving fuel economy decisions to Transportation
Department officials. (California's Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein voted against the measure.)</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Democratic support for the proposal came from either
states with significant auto production facilities--such as Michigan,
Missouri, Georgia and Indiana--or a large number of light truck owners,
or both.</TE>
<TE>Mikulski Represents the Lone Exception</TE>
<TE>   Of the 19 Democrats who voted for the amendment, 18 are from states
where more new trucks than cars were registered last year, according to
figures from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The only
exception, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), comes from a state with auto
production plants.</TE>
<TE>   Those defections underscored the anxiety among Democrats from rural
states since the 2000 election, in which the party's vote suffered in
small-town and farming communities across America. "Democrats in rural
states are just extraordinarily sensitive to taking any action that can
be portrayed as somehow hostile to the fabric of the society in which
they live," said one senior Democratic Party strategist. "And trucks are
a big part of that."</TE>
<TE>   That sensitivity was underscored by the votes of Sens. Zell Miller
(D-Ga.) and Phil Gramm (R-Texas) to exempt pickup trucks from future
increases in fuel economy standards. That amendment passed on a 56-44
vote.</TE>
<TE>   In opposition, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee, argued that the amendment would condemn rural drivers
to spending more on gasoline by exempting manufacturers from any
obligation to improve fuel performance on pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller declared the measure "a vote for the working man [and] . .
. a vote for rural America."</TE>
<TE>   The other key factor in Wednesday's results was the joint opposition
to the tougher fuel economy standards from the auto industry and the
United Auto Workers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a critical factor in putting fear in the hearts of Democrats,"
said John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff for President
Clinton who works with environmental groups.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Cheney Press Israel to Ease Palestinian Offensive</HD>
<DH>Mideast: U.S. signals concern about Sharon's conduct amid bid to
win Arab support on Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration intensified its efforts Wednesday to stop
the cycle of violence in the Middle East, as President Bush and Vice
President Dick Cheney singled out Israel, calling on Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon to curtail his military operation against the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   At the White House, Bush twice called Israel's military offensive "not
helpful" and said, "I certainly hope that Prime Minister Sharon is
concerned about the loss of innocent life."</LD>
<LD>   In Egypt, Cheney said Israel as much as the Palestinians bears
responsibility for stopping the violence. His comments marked a
broadening of the long-standing U.S. call on Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat to do more to rein in militants.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the burden is on both parties to bring an end to the
violence. It's not going to be possible to make progress until both
parties can agree to a cease-fire," Cheney said on the second stop of a
Middle East tour.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders' comments, coupled with the passage of a U.S.-sponsored
United Nations Security Council resolution late Tuesday endorsing a
Palestinian state, suggested that the White House is growing increasingly
concerned about Israel's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bush and Cheney's public pressure on Israel sent a new
signal both to Arab leaders, who want Washington to restrain the prime
minister, and to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the president reaffirmed that Israel's right to exist must
remain part of any Middle East peace accord, declaring, "There is nothing
more deep than recognizing Israel's right to exist."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Bush spoke, his Middle East envoy, Anthony C. Zinni, left
for Jerusalem to resume mediation between Israel and the Palestinians
after the worst violence there in years.</TE>
<TE>   "Zinni's job is to go over there and to work to get conditions such
that we can get into Tenet," Bush said, referring to a cease-fire plan
drafted by CIA Director George J. Tenet last year.</TE>
<TE>   "And [Zinni's] got a lot of work to do, but if I didn't think he could
make progress, I wouldn't have asked him to go," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. efforts to jump-start the Mideast peace process came as
Cheney moved deeper into his mission of seeking Arab support to confront
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney met Wednesday in the resort of Sharm el Sheik with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who predicted that Hussein will eventually allow
weapons inspectors into Iraq. The inspectors, whose mandate is to seek
out weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, left the country hours before
U.S. and British bombing raids in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney is demanding that if Hussein allows inspectors to return, they
must be allowed to operate without restrictions and be able to go
"anywhere, any time."</TE>
<TE>   During his White House news conference, Bush repeated his resolve to
"deal with" Hussein, whom he called "a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Bush insisted that his administration is consulting with other
countries, including Arab nations, on his intentions toward Iraq, but he
added pointedly: "Again, all options are on the table. . . . One thing I
will not allow is a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very future by
developing weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The president said Cheney's discussions in the Middle East represent
"the first stage" of an anti-Hussein campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The president said he didn't see a conflict in planning a campaign
against Iraq, which would anger many other Arab nations, while also
seeking their continued support in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, expressing optimism that talks next month between U.N. and
Iraqi officials would lead to a new opening by Hussein, said, "My
knowledge is that he's going to accept the inspectors."</TE>
<TE>   But Mubarak also called for U.N. Security Council
resolutions--intended to eliminate Iraq's arsenal of chemical weapons and
its nuclear and biological warfare programs--to be implemented "without
inflicting more suffering on the Iraqi people."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Mubarak warned that any steps taken must respect Iraq's
sovereignty and "territorial integrity," sending a message that toppling
the regime could lead to wider instability--a view widely shared among
Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   On the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians, Mubarak said that
"none of us can tolerate the continuation of that situation."</TE>
<TE>   "As Palestinians are expected to exert the maximum restraint
possible," he said, "Israel should . . . understand that the policy of
collective punishment, demolition of homes, humiliation of Palestinian
civil population and its current military offensive in civilian towns and
villages cannot be tolerated and must be immediately stopped."</TE>
<TE>   As he makes his way across the region, the vice president is finding
that the raw conflict bringing death to Israelis and Palestinians is
intruding, at every meeting, on the broader agenda he set.</TE>
<TE>   But senior officials in Cheney's entourage are adamant that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be addressed during his travels on a
parallel with efforts to expand the anti-terror campaign to deny Al Qaeda
operatives refuge beyond Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   As Cheney was planning his trip, the Israeli-Palestinian violence
increased to such a level that he could ignore neither it nor the desire
among Arab leaders, whose support he is courting, that the United States
pressure Israel to step back.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Cheney's mission would have been eased if Sharon had not
launched Israel's latest offensive, one senior administration official
said tartly, in a clear signal to Sharon, "Let's say he did not
coordinate his actions with me."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking pessimistically about efforts to broker a cease-fire, the
official said, "We appear to be a long way from the prospects of resuming
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   But he denied that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had pushed the war
on terrorism off the agenda in the countries the vice president is
visiting on his 11-day trip.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both major problems," the official said. "Both need to be
addressed. We need to have policies we're pursuing on both tracks."</TE>

<HD>Ramallah Residents See Dreams Crumble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>For Palestinians, this city of 60,000 residents--many of them
affluent, well-traveled, schooled in the U.S.--was the de facto capital
of Palestine. It was the bustling economic and political hub of what they
assumed would one day soon be a sovereign state.</LD>
<LD>   There were Internet cafes, a stock exchange and fancy residential
villas.</LD>
<LD>   Ramallah is today under siege by the Israeli army. Tanks slice the
pavement and residents huddle in their homes as Palestinian gunmen and
Israeli soldiers turn the city center into a war zone. It is as though
the clock has been turned back decades, residents say.</LD>
<TE>   As the power base of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
Ramallah became the haunt of militants who are attacking Israeli
citizens. Among them, Marwan Barghouti, a militia commander with Arafat's
Fatah movement, gained prominence after the current conflict exploded in
September 2000. Ramallah is his home base, from which Israeli authorities
believe he launches many a militia operation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's decision to reoccupy Ramallah, with the stated goal of
capturing militants and destroying their weapons, was a show of force
that dealt a huge psychological blow to many residents. Since the
invasion was launched Monday night, few have been able to venture
outdoors. Some have lost electricity or water. Life is frozen in time.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting peace and that we'd gain our freedom," said Omar
Kamal, a 55-year-old accountant, describing the aspirations that he and
others had not more than two years ago. "Ramallah was going to be a more
outward-looking city. I expected it to grow more and more. But now the
situation is very, very bad."</TE>
<TE>   Kamal and his family tiptoed Wednesday into their frontyard, a
well-manicured plot of pear trees and pink rosebushes, to watch two
Israeli Apache attack helicopters dart in the sky, the thump-thump
audible even after the aircraft dipped behind puffy white clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Kamal's two sons go to university but often can't reach their classes
because of Israeli roadblocks and closures. He has owned the house that
his father built for more than 30 years. But his face is worn and he
smokes nervously; no one has gotten much sleep since the military
operation began. His 75-year-old mother, Nadieh, worriedly fingered six
bottles of medicine she needs for a heart condition, afraid she will run
out.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still hope," Kamal said. "Hopefully, we are in our last hour
and someone will feel for us and intervene, before we sink to the very
bottom, to the point of no return."</TE>
<TE>   The Kamals live a stone's throw from Arafat's headquarters, so they're
hoping that will protect them. Though maybe it makes them a target.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ramallah's 60,000 residents, about 140,000 more people
live in the county, which includes several outlying villages. Before the
current uprising, Ramallah was a rare Palestinian city visited by Israeli
Jews, who ate at its restaurants and heard music in its clubs. That ended
about the time Palestinians lynched two Israeli reservists near
Ramallah's downtown Manara Square, scarcely two weeks into the current
uprising.</TE>
<TE>   On the eastern side of Ramallah, the Al Sarafandy Bakery on Wednesday
managed to fire up its ovens and bake bread for the first time in two
days. Dozens of people risked leaving their homes and crowded into the
small storefront, stocking up on plenty of pita. The shoppers were,
unusually, men for the most part; women were too afraid to venture out,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to feed people," said Sam Ali, a Palestinian American and
veteran of the U.S. Air Force, who owns the building in which the bakery
operates. He sat behind a low wooden counter to help handle the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   After 45 years in Boston, Ali returned to Ramallah in 1995. That was
around the time Israel was ending its military occupation of the city and
turning it over to the control of Arafat's Palestinian Authority,
established under landmark Oslo peace accords that were supposed to
govern Israeli-Palestinian coexistence and settle the conflict. The 1993
accords and many of the notions enshrined in them now are dead.</TE>
<TE>   Ali said two of his U.S.-born sons came to Ramallah as well, intending
to cast their lot with the emerging Palestinian state. Both left in
disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Customers in the bakery were loading up with as much bread as they
could carry. Bahieh Deib, a squat, 50-year-old woman dressed in a
traditional Palestinian embroidered gown, walked about two miles to pick
up pita for her family and her neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid to come out," she said. "I came by myself, and
everyone gave me money to buy bread." She plunked down 25 Israeli
shekels--about $5.40--for 150 pieces of pita.</TE>
<TE>   Several blocks away, four men in their 20s strode down the street,
looking for a way, they said, to "resist." They said Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to invade Ramallah will only strengthen
Palestinian defiance. In the meantime, a truce is out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   "If Abu Amar [Arafat] believes we should lay down our weapons, we
will," said Mohammed Mansour, 25, who studied fashion design until he ran
out of money and became a construction worker. "But we will not surrender
weapons only to start a political process that will deceive us, like
every other time.</TE>
<TE>   "If we hand in our weapons and get cheated again," he added, "we will
sell everything and get weapons again and resist again."</TE>

<HD>Doing a Number on Violators</HD>
<DH>Patrick Ball has pioneered the use of databases to expose
atrocities. At tribunal, he blames Milosevic for Kosovo 'ethnic
cleansing.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>As Patrick Ball scrawled equations across a conference-room white
board, his talk was of regression analysis, matching methodologies and
capture probabilities.</LD>
<LD>   His numbers were the equivalent of blood spatters at a crime scene.</LD>
<LD>   For three years, Ball traveled back and forth to Kosovo,
systematically culling data on civilian deaths from refugee reports,
exhumations and witness accounts. Building on that evidence, he and his
colleagues compiled a database documenting the ebb and flow of "ethnic
cleansing" of ethnic Albanians during the spring of 1999 in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.</LD>
<TE>   The statistical portrait of the displaced, missing and killed reveals
the timing and ferocity of fatal blows that fell across an entire
province. This numerical pattern of death and panic exonerates some
people; it points toward others.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the statistics that Ball calculated on a Boston white board have
become evidence in a war crimes trial. On Wednesday, in an international
courtroom in The Hague, Ball confronted the man he believes is
responsible for the deaths--former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence Ball laid out as an expert witness for the prosecution
represents the newest infusion of technical expertise into the human
rights movement--an effort to harness information science to track the
beatings, rapes, killings and mass executions of systematic political
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic has argued strenuously in his own defense that NATO
airstrikes or the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, or KLA, could have been responsible for the estimated 11,000
civilians killed between March and June 1999. The statistical analysis,
Ball testified, demonstrates that neither is possible.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers, he said, establish a clear pattern: The culprit was an
organized campaign of "ethnic cleansing" by Yugoslav military and
paramilitary forces under the command of Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   "When we looked systematically and really carefully at the killing
data, I found this pattern," Ball said during an interview before his
testimony. "My jaw dropped through the floor. It blew me away."</TE>
<TE>Negotiating a Minefield of Unreliable Data</TE>
<TE>   Ball, the deputy director of the science and human rights program at
the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science in Washington, has
spent a decade perfecting the use of computer technology in the service
of human rights.</TE>
<TE>   To arrive at their conclusions about Kosovo, he and his team had to
negotiate a minefield of technical uncertainties and unreliable data.</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo in 1999, in the
largest mass expulsion of people in Europe since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly how many died. International prosecutors and
human rights activists allege that as many as 11,000 men, women and
children were killed in a campaign of terror by the Yugoslav government
designed to trigger panic and cause people to flee their homes.
Atrocities in more than 500 towns and villages have been documented.</TE>
<TE>   The worst of the killing took place during the 11 weeks of NATO
airstrikes in Yugoslavia, from March into June 1999, when there were few
outside observers in Kosovo who could independently document human rights
violations.</TE>
<TE>   To complicate any subsequent investigation, military and paramilitary
forces routinely confiscated identity papers from the fleeing refugees.
Sensitive government records were purged. Houses were burned and
belongings scattered. Mass graves were obliterated. Bodies disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with a knapsack full of registries he rescued from the
rubble of an Albanian border crossing, Ball gathered as much information
as possible about the number of people leaving Kosovo, where they came
from and when they reached the border. The one knapsack contained files
on 272,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   From that set of records and other reports, Ball could map the timing
and source of the surges of refugees. Next, he sought to estimate how
many civilians had been killed, and where and when they may have died.</TE>
<TE>   Working independently of the U.S. government, Ball and his colleagues
drew information from 15,000 interviews and exhumation reports conducted
by four different humanitarian groups. Thousands of duplicate or
misspelled names had to be culled.</TE>
<TE>   Ball's team reliably identified 4,400 people who had been killed. They
then used a standard population sampling technique to estimate the total
dead--10,356 Kosovo Albanians, with an error margin of several hundred
people more or less.</TE>
<TE>   By comparing the refugee movements against the death records, Ball
discovered the numbers rose and fell in the same pattern in the same
parts of the country, suggesting that they shared a common cause.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ball compared records of the flight of the refugees to daily
military action reports and tallies of the dead. To ensure fairness, he
used the records from Milosevic's government of NATO airstrikes and KLA
ground actions.</TE>
<TE>   He lined all the patterns of behavior up against one another and
created graphs of the results.</TE>
<TE>   The peaks of refugee flight consistently occurred during and after
intense activity by Serbian forces, he found. Actions by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the KLA generally happened after the
surges in refugees and killings, not before them.</TE>
<TE>   "I find the data are consistent with the explanation that Yugoslavian
forces conducted a systematic campaign of 'ethnic cleansing.' The data
reject the hypothesis that KLA or NATO activity was responsible," Ball
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts called the statistical analysis "particularly
innovative."</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley demographer Ronald Lee, who reviewed the work, said:
"There are very subtle and difficult statistical questions about how to
draw these conclusions. I thought what they did was very impressive, very
valid . . . persuasive."</TE>
<TE>A Scientific Application 'Born of Desperation'</TE>
<TE>   Ball's work is an application of science "born of desperation," said
independent human rights scholar Louise Spirer in Stamford, Conn. "The
reason for the push is that we have to come up with a means to show what
happened when there aren't any records."</TE>
<TE>   In World War II, Nazi officials who orchestrated the death camps
meticulously documented their work. Allied armies captured almost 14 tons
of such files, which were then used as evidence at war crimes trials
involving 90,000 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts at concealment were half-hearted at best, said Richard Pierre
Claude, an expert on human rights and government at Princeton University,
who is author of the forthcoming book "Science in the Service of Human
Rights."</TE>
<TE>   Today, by contrast, those who use terror and mass murder as tools of
statecraft take pains to cover their tracks "to preserve plausible
deniability," said Yale University international law expert Harold Hongju
Koh, who was U.S. assistant secretary of State for democracy, human
rights and labor from 1998 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   So often too, both sides in a conflict can muster victims of
atrocities. Statistical analysis holds out the hope of a reliable way to
determine relative guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can do with statistical analysis that you can't do with
anecdotes is make overall scientifically valid estimates," said human
rights activist Herbert Spirer, an international law and information
management expert at Columbia University and husband of Louise Spirer.
"We don't have to sit and look at a single mass grave and try to decide
how many people died in an entire country."</TE>
<TE>   During truth commission proceedings in Guatemala, which were convened
to investigate abuses from more than 35 years of civil war, human rights
statisticians analyzed 7,500 cases compiled from 11,000 depositions
documenting 24,910 killings.</TE>
<TE>   In rural areas, the number crunchers proved, native people were killed
by government death squads at rates five to eight times greater than
rates among other ethnic groups, offering a statistical hint of genocide.</TE>
<TE>   In South Africa, researchers digested interviews with more than 21,000
witnesses covering 49,000 incidents during the latter decades of
apartheid. By comparing rates of death among groups of people in
different parts of the country, they developed statistics demonstrating
that police were responsible for the overwhelming majority of the
killings and that most of the victims were young black men.</TE>
<TE>   By matching a database of 9,000 witness accounts of beatings and
killings in El Salvador against comprehensive career records of military
and police officials, statisticians showed how units became more violent
when certain officers were placed in charge. The analysis helped get
those officers banned from government service.</TE>
<TE>   But in Kosovo, the high technology of human rights may face its
severest challenge yet.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely has a government worked so effectively to mask its operations
against civilians, several experts said. Never has so much high
technology been marshaled in the effort to uncover evidence of sustained
human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Said Koh, who helped lay the groundwork for the technical evidence
being presented against Milosevic: "Kosovo is what I consider the state
of the art.</TE>
<TE>   "You want an undeniable scientific account of what happened," Koh
said. "Getting out the historical record is as important as holding
someone accountable. These advances help make it impossible to erase
history."</TE>
<TE>A 'Hacktivist' Who Thinks in Code</TE>
<TE>   Ball, 36, is a "hacktivist," employing his programming skills in the
service of human rights. A sociologist by training, he has been writing
computer software since high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in code," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He worked his way through graduate school at the University of
Michigan by writing computer databases. His passion for dBase, Fox and
Paradox code was more than matched by a sense of political outrage. He
wrote his dissertation on human rights movements in Ethiopia, Pakistan
and El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   When Ball found himself in El Salvador as that country's civil war was
ending in 1991, he heard that a local human rights group "needed someone
who could hack a database."</TE>
<TE>   He volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, every truth commission or major human rights
investigation in the world has in some way drawn on his computer skills.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an odd line of work," Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade, he has been pioneering the use of computer databases and
statistical analysis to document human rights abuses. With his colleagues
at the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science's science and human
rights program, Ball recently published a hacktivist manual. It teaches
activists around the world how to design computer entry screens,
questionnaires and databases that can be used to track human rights
abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Helped initially by the American Statistical Assn., a 162-year-old
professional group that advocates the use of statistics in science, a
global network of documentation specialists has spread information
management techniques to human rights activists in 150 countries.</TE>
<TE>   With solar-powered laptops, activists log testimony of abuses from
survivors hiding far from any power outlet. They use the precision
navigation capacities of the Global Positioning System to pinpoint the
coordinates of mass graves they find. They combine databases and
integrated mapping software to chart the geography of terror.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the integrity of the information they are collecting, they
code it with encryption software and secure it behind Internet firewalls.
They create virtual havens for witnesses on Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   To further evade surveillance, they communicate with each other
through anonymous e-mailing techniques that disguise the location and
identity of the sender.</TE>
<TE>   In the computerized pursuit of justice, analysts like Ball employ the
same census and data-mining techniques used by marketing experts to
analyze purchasing habits, naturalists to estimate wildlife populations
and medical experts to document epidemics.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of consumer profiles, herd counts or public health warnings,
however, the product of Ball's work is compelling circumstantial evidence
of official brutality.</TE>
<TE>   Just as pathologists can use forensic DNA techniques to restore the
identities of those exhumed from anonymous mass graves, human rights
statisticians can reveal much of what is hidden to the individual eye.</TE>
<TE>   What they are creating, said Spirer at Columbia, is "the epidemiology
of horror."</TE>
<TE>Traditional Activists Uneasy With Statistics</TE>
<TE>   Other more traditional human rights activists are made queasy by so
many formulas. They recognize the power of statistics as an analytical
tool, but they are uncomfortable with it because abstract mathematical
modeling can rob the victims of their humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "You turn this into something you quantify--a smear of refugees--and
you have to be careful about dehumanizing it," said Eric Stover, director
of the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley. "The real testimony is the
body with the single gunshot to the head and the hands tied behind the
back."</TE>
<TE>   For Ball, however, the anonymity of numbers is a saving grace.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon during the data entry phase, Ball found one of his
co-workers Net surfing. She was building a bookmark file in the database
of Internet links to online photographs of the dead. He was dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop. Don't look," Ball told her.</TE>
<TE>   "She was useless for the next two days," he recalled. "All she could
do was cry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is data. Numbers. This is a technical problem. Otherwise, you're
done. Burned out. Gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Crying."</TE>

<HD>U.S. and Afghans Savor Victory in Valley</HD>
<DH>Asia: Coalition has destroyed a stronghold used by Al Qaeda and the
Taliban. Very few enemy troops are believed to have escaped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHAHI KOT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Shattered and empty, the mud-brick houses shone blood red in the
sunlight. Beyond the village, a small truck sat twisted, black and
bullet-riddled. On a hillside, two corpses of enemy fighters lay next to
a clothing heap that was in fact the torso of a third--mute testament to
the brutality of the battle.</LD>
<LD>   For U.S. and Afghan forces, who had waged an intense campaign to clear
this mountain redoubt of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, it was a day to
savor and declare victory.</LD>
<LD>   Except for the corpses and a gray donkey hiding amid the remains of
the buildings, the village of Shahi Kot was vacant Wednesday--its former
occupants killed, captured or escaped. A stronghold that had taken years
to construct no longer gave shelter to the foreign and Afghan disciples
of Osama bin Laden who had lived and trained here since the fall of the
Taliban government.</LD>
<TE>   Afghan and U.S. commanders at the scene said they believed that very
few enemy fighters escaped, and they expected to keep up the pressure on
any remnants in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Securing the pristine Shahi Kot valley cost the lives of eight U.S.
servicemen and three Afghans, all of whom died during the first three
days of fighting early this month. Estimates of the Al Qaeda and Taliban
dead have varied widely but usually have been put in the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Three key figures in the ground campaign--Afghan Gens. Zia Lodin and
Gul Hydar, and a lanky U.S. Special Forces officer who merely smiled when
asked his name and rank--held a victory meeting on a hillock in this
bowl-like valley as U.S. Apache attack helicopters buzzed overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel happy because I feel that the last stronghold of the enemy is
destroyed and there is no other place for him to hide out," a smiling
Hydar told The Times as his officers and soldiers crowded in.</TE>
<TE>   Hydar had arrived here in Paktia province Saturday at the head of a
column of old Soviet tanks and 1,000 troops sent by the Defense Ministry
from Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   His men entered the Shahi Kot valley from the south Tuesday
night--and, by most accounts, they didn't have to fire a single shot in
anger because the enemy had evaporated under the U.S. bombardment and
ground campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Lodin's men--the so-called campaign troops equipped and trained by
U.S. forces over the last six weeks to help root out Taliban and Al Qaeda
strongholds--came from the north and saw more action.</TE>
<TE>   They were in the initial assault up the valley March 2, when three of
the Afghans were killed by enemy gunfire and mortars. Since then, Lodin
said, they had been advancing slowly as U.S. air power cleared the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a few of the Al Qaeda escaped, but we are looking for them and
catching them to make sure none of them get away," said Lodin, who was
dressed in a tawny camouflage uniform and holding a short grenade
launcher.</TE>
<TE>   The unnamed U.S. officer estimated that 100 to 250 Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters had been in the Shahi Kot valley at the start of
Operation Anaconda, but he noted that the battle zone included two
valleys nearby where additional enemy forces had gathered. Most had
probably been killed, he said, but he didn't rule out that some had
escaped the U.S.-Afghan blockade by using narrow mountain trails.</TE>
<TE>   "A good rat line leads out of here," he said. "Eventually it goes to
Pakistan," about 30 miles to the east.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. officer said the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces have used "a
couple of dozen" caves in the Shahi Kot area. "Lord knows how many there
are in the mountains to the east of here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces assume that the Shahi Kot caves are mined, he said. "They
are going to be exploited extremely carefully by us, with our Afghan
brothers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Americans will continue to pursue the remnants of the Taliban
wherever they are, but he wouldn't be specific. Operations around Shahi
Kot will continue on a smaller scale for several weeks, he said. After
that, "I really can't talk about where we're going next."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Abdul Wahab Joyendah, a senior Afghan commander, said the leader
of the enemy fighters at Shahi Kot, Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour, appears
to have survived and escaped. The remnants of the band of holdouts might
be heading to Pakistan, he said, or they might try to regroup, circle
back through the mountains and resume their activities farther north, in
Lowgar province.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces captured about 20 people in the battle but have given few
details.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Lodin and Hydar's troops swarmed over the valley, which
is ringed by pale green slopes that rise gradually into craggy
12,000-foot mountains covered with snow.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the main village of Shahi Kot, the valley--which appears to
be about a mile wide--contains at least two smaller adobe settlements
plus isolated buildings on the hillsides. A soldier for Hydar pointed out
one building that he said concealed the entrance to one of the Al Qaeda
cave complexes.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the possibility of land mines and booby traps at the
entrances to these hidden lairs, the reporters who reached Shahi Kot were
told to stay clear until the sites can be thoroughly examined by
mine-clearance crews.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Sabar, leading a squad of Hydar's fighters, said that after
spending a day and two nights in the village, he and his men had found a
sizable cache of weapons that included rockets, mortars, hand grenades
and automatic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons were being turned over to the Americans, he said. While he
talked, a soldier nearby set off a bit of explosive material that erupted
with a bang--just to amuse himself and startle the visitors. He and his
comrades laughed at the joke.</TE>
<TE>   Besides weapons, fighters said they found books, manuals and documents
written in Arabic and the Chechen language. One Afghan fighter had taken
as a souvenir a flat sports mitt used for training in martial arts.
Another had snapped up a paperback of Koranic teachings in the Arabic and
Cyrillic alphabets. A third was seen claiming a small brown horse as war
booty.</TE>
<TE>   The corpses were about 100 steps from the village on the other side of
a ridge that appeared to be a defensive position against forces coming
from the west. One body was fairly intact. The fighter was on his stomach
and wore a green camouflage jacket over a brown leather vest and baggy
green felt pants. His hair and hands were reddish, as though colored with
henna.</TE>
<TE>   A young soldier who had come with Hydar from the arid plains north of
Kabul casually poked at the body and then coolly undid the black plastic
digital watch on its wrist. The soldier, named Hamed, later showed a
reporter that it was still keeping time perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel any pity for him, and I don't feel sorry about taking
it," the 18-year-old, who said he has been fighting the Taliban since he
was 14, said about the watch. "I feel sorry for myself."</TE>
<TE>   On the hillside near the bodies were scattered some of their
belongings: a torn pouch, a purple toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste,
shoes that may have been blown off one of the men, a roll of toilet
paper. According to soldiers, there were papers in the pockets
identifying the men as Chechens.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters reached Shahi Kot by driving over several mountains on
bumpy, unpaved roads, then crossed through the village on a narrow lane.</TE>
<TE>   The village itself was a shambles, and it looked from a distance like
a half-eroded sandcastle. At the entrance to the village, reporters came
across two U.S. Special Forces fighters, who took them to the rendezvous
point of the commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan soldiers at the meeting appeared not to believe their luck
that the village had fallen so easily. "It was nothing," said a soldier
called Ajmal. "The first day was difficult--we lost three guys--but after
that, it was not a hard battle."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan fighters insisted that a large number of dead would be found up
in the mountains or buried in destroyed buildings and in the debris of
caves. Hydar said he had seen graves everywhere. Ajmal said he had
counted 20 bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "There are houses that are destroyed, and under them are dead bodies
that cannot be counted," said fighter Mohammed Bashir. "We know because
flies are going there."</TE>

<HD>Mugabe Declared Victor in Zimbabwe</HD>
<DH>Africa: Official vote tally gives longtime ruler 56%, as opposition
calls the result a fraud. Britain, United States say the bitter contest
was flawed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>President Robert Mugabe, a former Marxist freedom fighter who led
Zimbabwe to independence, was declared the winner Wednesday of a bitterly
contested election that critics said was marred by massive flaws,
intimidation and violence.</LD>
<LD>   Official results gave the 78-year-old Mugabe 1.7 million votes--about
56% of the ballots cast and well over the 50% needed to guarantee him
another six-year term in office. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who
had posed the first real challenge to Mugabe's 22-year rule, came up
short with 1.3 million votes.</LD>
<LD>   Tsvangirai said his party, the Movement for Democratic Change, would
not accept the result and might take legal action to contest it.</LD>
<TE>   The emerging consensus among Western nations and independent local
observers is that the election was a sham because administrative errors,
voter harassment and a host of other government-endorsed political
shenanigans prevented thousands of Zimbabweans--primarily in Harare, the
capital and the opposition's stronghold--from voting.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush repudiated the results.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's
flawed," he said. "And we are dealing with our friends to figure out how
to deal with this flawed election."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they will probably punish the Mugabe government by
freezing assets held by him and his associates in the United States. A
senior State Department official said the asset freeze is expected to be
announced in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warned that Mugabe's controversial victory, viewed in the
West as a blow to democracy, could jeopardize potential foreign
investment in southern Africa and further undermine prospects for
economic growth and stability.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials of the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front said the poll results underscored the faith
Zimbabweans have in Mugabe to continue leading them.</TE>
<TE>   "What it shows is that the people of Zimbabwe are like any other
peoples of the world," said George Charamba, the country's secretary of
state for information and publicity. "They are rational voters. They vote
for their interests. They vote for their sovereignty. They vote for real,
genuine freedom."</TE>
<TE>   But Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader, called the election
"daylight robbery" and denounced it as "the biggest fraud I have ever
witnessed in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Voting was originally scheduled for Saturday and Sunday but was
extended into Monday after thousands were left waiting Sunday night
outside polling stations in the capital. On Monday night, a judge
rejected an opposition appeal to extend voting to a fourth day.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai noted that hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans had not
been able to vote because of a reduction in the number of polling
stations in MDC strongholds and the removal of people from voting
registers. He also charged that the opposition was prevented from
deploying its own polling agents in more than half of all rural polling
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "This was done through state-sponsored terrorism conducted by ZANU-PF
militia, rogue elements in [independence] war veterans, ZANU-PF youths
and, in some instances, with the active or passive connivance of the
police," Tsvangirai said.</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw denounced the conduct of the
election, saying Mugabe's government led a campaign of "violence and
intimidation designed to achieve one outcome: power at all costs."
Britain is Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-nation Southern African Development Community's Parliamentary
Forum said, "The election process could not be said to adequately comply
with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region," to which
Zimbabwe is party.</TE>
<TE>   But government officials denied that there were any irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said Zimbabwe should be praised for
conducting such an exemplary election, and he dismissed Western critics
as imperialists trying to impose their will on Africans.</TE>
<TE>   "You are a good boy if you repeat their rubbish," Moyo said. "Try to
stand up for what you truly believe in, and you will see what the white
world does."</TE>
<TE>   South African observers in Zimbabwe endorsed Mugabe's victory,
declaring his reelection legitimate because the opposition had
participated in the electoral process. Mission leader Samuel Motsuenyane
told reporters that it was simply "unfortunate that some registered
voters were turned away because of administrative oversight."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warned that South Africa's strategy of so-called quiet
diplomacy in dealing with Zimbabwe could endanger investment prospects
and derail Western backing for a new South African-led initiative
designed to promote growth, democracy and peace on the continent.</TE>
<TE>   Hailed at independence from Britain in 1980 as a true model of an
African democrat, Mugabe is now widely seen as a dictator who drove this
once-rich nation of 13 million people from prosperity to poverty.</TE>
<TE>   He has blamed the country's economic woes, including unemployment and
soaring inflation, on an alleged British-led conspiracy to ruin Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning under the slogan "Land Is the Economy and the Economy Is
Land," the president has vowed to continue his controversial program that
seeks to wrest property from Zimbabwe's white minority for the
resettlement of landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials insisted that the land issue spurred Mugabe's
victory. "We understand that the economy cannot be turned around without
resolving the core issue, which is land," Moyo said.</TE>
<TE>   A highly educated and articulate former teacher, Mugabe has also been
praised for promoting black empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   "At least I know that black people can have dignity, self-respect and
pride in this country, something we don't have when we travel outside,"
said Blessmore Totarisa, 31, a sound director and producer in the music
industry who voted for Mugabe.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe has accused Tsvangirai of being a puppet of Zimbabwe's white
minority and of Britain. Supporters view the MDC leader as the only
immediate hope to reverse the country's economic slide and reinstate law
and order.</TE>
<TE>   Despite killings and police harassment, the MDC stunned the ruling
party in March 2000 by winning almost half the seats at stake in
parliamentary elections.</TE>
<TE>   But observers said the 50-year-old opposition leader botched his
chances by failing to maintain the momentum of that victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The MDC failed to get its people out," said one Harare-based Western
official. "Even if they kept the polling stations open in Harare for six
days, Mugabe would still be the winner."</TE>
<TE>   Many businesses in Harare were closed Wednesday in anticipation of
unrest. But the streets in the capital remained calm for most of the day
except for sporadic celebration marches and convoys of ZANU-PF
supporters.</TE>

<HD>Russian Official Insists Terrorists Are in Georgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov said Wednesday that his
country will not ignore international terrorists who have infiltrated
neighboring Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   He said they are linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and are
"full of new plans for terrorist operations."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a news conference with Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld, Ivanov said these terrorists had trained in Afghanistan,
"committed terrible crimes" in the Russian breakaway republic of
Chechnya, and are now in Georgia's remote Pankisi Gorge, about a dozen
miles from Russia's border.</LD>
<TE>   Ivanov said that Moscow had provided the U.S. a list that names
hundreds such people with links to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   At Georgia's invitation, the Pentagon is preparing to send perhaps 150
troops to the former Soviet republic to train its armed forces in
counter-terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said he and Rumsfeld, in two days of talks at the Pentagon,
discussed U.S.-Russian cooperation in the global war on terrorism,
efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons technology and
preparations for President Bush's meeting in May with Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said the United States and Russia would probably work out a
legally binding document outlining their mutual pledge to reduce the
number of long-range nuclear weapons by two-thirds.</TE>

<HD>Two Minds in Yemen About U.S. Ties</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Distrust underlies official support as Cheney prepares to
visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>When it comes to helping the United States in its war on terror,
Yemen is behaving somewhat like a suspect who confesses only because
there is a gun pointed at his head. That, at least, is the picture
painted by one of the country's most influential leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "We have surrendered to the United States because it is the strongest
in the world," Abdullah Hussein Ahmar, speaker of parliament and head of
the nation's most powerful tribe, said in an interview Tuesday at his
home.</LD>
<LD>   This, in all probability, will not be the message conveyed directly to
Vice President Dick Cheney when he makes a very brief appearance here
today as part of his swing through the Middle East. Instead, he is likely
to hear President Ali Abdullah Saleh repeat his firm and unconditional
support for the war on terrorism and his appreciation for Washington's
military assistance in the form of a small contingent of U.S. troops.</LD>
<TE>   But if Cheney were to spend any length of time in this sliver of a
nation at the foot of the Arabian Peninsula, he would pick up on a far
more ambiguous attitude, one that recognizes the futility of opposing the
world's only remaining superpower but is also deeply distrustful of
Washington's aims and objectives.</TE>
<TE>  On the issue of Iraq, for instance, he would hear many people say there
is no love for President Saddam Hussein, but there is great anger at the
United States for continuing to bomb a sovereign Arab state while
maintaining sanctions that are perceived to punish civilians, not the
regime.</TE>
<TE>   "65% of Yemenis welcome U.S.," read a recent headline in the
English-language Yemen Observer.</TE>
<TE>   "Public opposes U.S. presence," read another recent headline in the
English-language Yemen Times.</TE>
<TE>   Both are correct, reflecting the split in the Yemeni psyche. Yemenis
want the social, political and economic benefits that cooperation with
America might bring, yet they would also like to see the United States
brought to its knees for supporting Israel.</TE>
<TE>   All of these attitudes became clear as Ahmar held court in the
cavernous greeting room of his house here in the capital. As leader of
the Hashid tribe and a revered political figure, he holds daily sessions
during which Yemenis from around the country kneel before him and ask
that he settle disputes between families or provide financial aid for
medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "You should know," he said, "Arab countries, and the Islamic world, do
really hate America for its unlimited support of Israel." Later in the
interview he variously described Yemen and America as "strong friends"
and the emerging alliance between the two countries as a "necessary
evil."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best example of the mental contortions taking place here
involves the pending arrival of U.S. troops, who will train Yemen's
military in anti-terror operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not accept any American military," Ahmar said, waving his
hand over his head while resting on a pile of cushions. An aide adjusted
a blanket draped over his feet and knees. "We do not welcome them, and we
will not."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the U.S. troops who are coming to do the training, and the
troops already here to pave the way for the pending forces, he said:
"That is something different. They are trainers. They are experts."</TE>
<TE>   Experts who happen to be U.S. military? "Yes, exactly," said Ahmar,
who also heads Islah, the Islamic political party that controls the
second-largest bloc of seats in parliament and has close ties to the
president.</TE>
<TE>   When terrorists hit the United States on Sept. 11, Yemen's government
unequivocally condemned the attacks. But the country's rough and isolated
terrain, and its traditional tribal structure, had made it a perfect
haven for Al Qaeda operatives. Yemen had to choose, quickly, between
becoming a target in the U.S. war on terror or a partner.</TE>
<TE>   It chose the latter, perhaps mindful of what happened in 1990, when
Yemen opposed the U.S.-led effort to liberate Kuwait from Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Just one year later, international financial aid to Yemen had dropped
dramatically--with the U.S. alone cutting its support from $22 million to
$3 million. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, couldn't
afford to take that route again.</TE>
<TE>   So the leadership said it would work with America. But even members of
President Saleh's ruling party, the General People's Congress, recognize
the fine line he must walk.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been much better if what is taking place now took place
30 years ago before satellite dishes are showing what is happening," said
Sultan Barakani, leader of the GPC's parliamentary caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are afraid of is that such Arab regimes will collapse one
after the other," he said, "and that the people will go against their
leadership due to the stand of the United States [with Israel]."</TE>
<TE>   It is this fear that has leaders such as Ahmar so ambivalent. "What is
between us and the United States is friendship." But when asked whether
he welcomed Cheney's visit, he replied, "The visitor who wants to visit,
we cannot refuse it, whether we want him or not."</TE>

<HD>Hindus to Take a Stand on Vigil Ban</HD>
<DH>Religion: Nationalists are to decide today whether to hold a
planned prayer near the disputed site of a proposed temple in India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>Hindu nationalists threatened Wednesday to defy a Supreme Court ban
on holding a symbolic prayer ceremony near the bitterly disputed site of
a mosque demolished by a mob nearly a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Indian government says it has deployed about 8,000 paramilitary
police officers, armed with tear gas, water cannon and live ammunition,
to deter any large-scale protests at the site in the northern town of
Ayodhya.</LD>
<LD>   But thousands of Hindu nationalists have been making their way toward
the town despite efforts to stop a repeat of clashes between Hindus and
Muslims that have killed more than 600 people during the last few weeks.</LD>
<TE>   A three-judge panel ruled Wednesday that "no religious ceremony of any
kind" may be held on a 67-acre site that includes land where the 16th
century mosque, Babri Masjid, stood until a rampaging Hindu mob destroyed
it in December 1992.</TE>
<TE>   A lower court has yet to decide what will become of the land, but the
nationalist Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or VHP, insisted again Wednesday that
it is determined to build a temple on what it says is the birthplace of
Lord Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu religious leaders will decide today whether to defy the Supreme
Court ruling and proceed with the planned prayer ceremony Friday, the
nationalist party's secretary-general, Praveen Bhai Togadia, told
reporters here.</TE>
<TE>   Although he said the party accepted the Supreme Court order "with
regret," Togadia also called for peaceful protests across India to insist
on Hindus' right to pray on land next to the site of the destroyed
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one way left," he said. "We'll go to the 'people's
court.' We'll present our case there."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, VHP President Ashok Singhal had said that his followers
would only protest peacefully, and invite police to arrest them, if the
court refused to allow the Hindu prayer ceremony, called a puja.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders of the movement to build the Ram temple have contradicted
one another several times recently as they campaigned to hold prayers at
the Ayodhya site. As their own allies press them to back down, the
militants may decide that retreat is the better part of valor.</TE>
<TE>   The party didn't help its cause by calling Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee, who is a member of a Hindu nationalist party but is
considered a moderate, "a new Muslim" this month.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee and several of his key ministers have supported the Ram
temple movement, but the prime minister has also repeatedly said that his
government would let the courts settle the argument.</TE>
<TE>   Before the court decision, Vajpayee had persuaded VHP leaders to tone
down their prayer plans with the help of the National Volunteer Corps
extremist group, which was implicated in the assassination of Mahatma
Gandhi in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim leaders rejected the proposed prayer ceremony even though it
was to be held on government-controlled land next to the original site of
the Babri mosque. The government also gave assurances that the ceremony
would not imply ownership rights for anyone involved or affect the status
quo.</TE>
<TE>   But Muslims have long accused Vajpayee and his government of favoring
Hindus on the potentially explosive Ayodhya issue. Vajpayee's home
affairs minister, Lal Krishna Advani, was one of several officials from
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party accused of inciting the mob that razed
the Babri mosque, a charge that the officials strongly deny. The
destruction of the mosque sparked sectarian riots that left between 2,000
and 3,000 dead.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi joined Muslim leaders
and other political figures in praising the court's decision as a victory
for the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Gandhi's party said Wednesday that it plans to send top officials to
Ayodhya to monitor the current confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Hindus claim that a Ram temple was destroyed to make way for the
mosque, which was built in 1528. But many Muslims believe that the Ram
temple was a myth spread by India's British colonial rulers as part of
their "divide and rule" policy on the subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu nationalists have been gathering at a spot about two miles from
the disputed site since Feb. 24 and plan to stay there until June 2, and
the VHP's Togadia angrily denied that they were defying the government by
doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't we exercise our religious rights in India anywhere?" he asked
at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Hindu pilgrims in Ayodhya peaked at about 14,000,
according to the government, but strict security measures have cut that
number to a few thousand at most.</TE>
<TE>   They are heavily outnumbered by well-armed police.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted Feb. 27
when a Muslim mob set fire to a train carrying supporters of the Ram
temple movement. The inferno killed 58 people, including 14 children.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu mobs retaliated across western Gujarat state by burning several
hundred Muslims alive and looting and torching their shops. Human rights
activists, Muslim leaders and opposition politicians have accused the VHP
of organizing the revenge attacks, with police and state government
complicity.</TE>

<LD>Six children--nearly half the number of kids in the tiny, remote
Pacific village of Quatsino--were feared dead in a suspicious fire.</LD>
<LD>   The siblings--three girls and three boys ages 2 to 11--were missing
after a fire Monday morning that destroyed the house where they lived
with their father, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Handel, 45, the father, was in protective police custody. No
charges have been filed, but authorities consider the fire suspicious
because all four buildings on the property burned simultaneously. Handel
and his wife separated in December.</LD>
<TE>   Quatsino, a Vancouver Island hamlet accessible only by boat or air,
has only 14 children, including the six missing. "To say that the
community has been devastated would be an understatement," said Sgt.
Grant Learned of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</TE>

years in prison for his role in a multimillion-dollar corruption and
election campaign finance scam.</LD>
<LD>   Sjahril Sabirin, however, said he would not resign his post and would
appeal--a move that will let him remain free at least until a higher
court reviews his case.</LD>
<LD>   Under Indonesian law, only parliament can dismiss the bank governor.
How this would be achieved is unclear: Its speaker, Akbar Tanjung, is in

</DL>
<LD>About 20 North Koreans who said they were fleeing persecution in
their hard-line communist country rushed past Chinese guards and sought
asylum today at the Spanish Embassy, threatening suicide if sent back.</LD>
<LD>   The men, women and children ran through the embassy's front gate, past
two armed Chinese guards. One asylum seeker struggled with a guard who
grabbed him, but broke free and ran with the others into the main
building.</LD>
<LD>   Within minutes, dozens of Chinese guards converged on the compound.
Spanish diplomats came out, talked to some of the guards and then
followed the asylum seekers into the building. Chinese guards formed a
cordon outside the compound, shooing away bystanders.</LD>
<TE>   The incident presented a dilemma for the Chinese government. China is
a close ally of North Korea but has been criticized by human rights and
aid groups for refusing to grant refugee status to North Koreans fleeing
famine and repression.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Defiant on '94 Arms Pledge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>North Korea, angered by a Pentagon study naming the communist state
as a potential target for nuclear strikes, threatened Wednesday to
abandon a 1994 promise to freeze its nuclear research.</LD>
<LD>   The accord with Washington is a linchpin of U.S. efforts to stop the
Stalinist country from developing atomic bombs.</LD>
<LD>   However, "under the present situation where nuclear lunatics have
taken office in the White House, we are compelled to examine all the
agreements with the U.S.," North Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a
statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea also accused Washington of planning to launch a nuclear
war on the Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "A nuclear war to be imposed by the U.S. nuclear fanatics upon the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea would mean their ruin in nuclear
disaster," the agency, using the formal name of North Korea, warned in a
separate statement.</TE>
<TE>   The remarks were North Korea's first reaction to reports last week
that the Pentagon was studying the possible use of nuclear weapons
against seven countries that could threaten the United States: North
Korea, China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   "In case the U.S. plan . . . turns out to be true, the DPRK will have
no option but to take a substantial countermeasure against it, not bound
to any DPRK-U.S. agreement," the Foreign Ministry said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee Tuesday that no country was being targeted from day to day.
He said reduction of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpiles would continue.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Enters Heart of Ramallah</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sharon hopes for the maximum military advantage before
U.S. envoy's arrival and a possible cease-fire, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces penetrated the heart of the Palestinians' most
important city Wednesday as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon rejected myriad
calls for restraint and pressed ahead with his nation's largest military
operation in three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Israel tightened its control over most of Ramallah, sending tanks down
the avenues leading into the city's central Manara Square but skirting,
for now, the compound where Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
has his headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   Helicopter gunships fired on targets in the city, and tanks shelled an
area where Palestinian gunmen were operating. Sporadic exchanges of fire
exploded throughout the day and into the night. Israeli troops took up
positions in schools and homes and conducted house-to-house searches in
the Al Amari refugee camp for a second day.</LD>
<TE>   Before the current conflict erupted more than 17 months ago, Ramallah
was the commercial and political center of Palestinian society. Now it is
a spooky no man's land of deserted streets, fearful residents and angry
combatants.</TE>
<TE>   Cars lay smashed in the roads, crushed by tanks that kicked up dust
and smoke as they rumbled by. In some neighborhoods, residents could be
seen rushing through the streets, loaded down with bags of pita bread
after a lone bakery opened during a lull in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's dead included one Israeli soldier, a senior Palestinian
police commander and an Italian journalist hit by fire from an Israeli
tank, according to witnesses. Several other journalists were hurt when
Israeli forces opened fire on their vehicles and offices, the journalists
said.</TE>
<TE>   The vast offensive, with its stated aim of hunting down militants who
are killing Israelis--and of destroying the militants' weaponry--comes on
the eve of a difficult U.S. mission aimed at halting the violence. After
a long U.S. absence from this region's peacemaking diplomacy, special
envoy Anthony C. Zinni is due to arrive today in a bid to broker a
cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>Sharon Not Ready to End the Offensive</TE>
<TE>   But Israelis and Palestinians threw cold water on the chances for a
truce.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats are reported to have joined European and U.N. attempts
to pressure Sharon to withdraw from Ramallah and scale back the military
campaign. Since March 1, Israel has flooded the West Bank and Gaza Strip
with 20,000 troops to raid Palestinian refugee camps, lay siege to
Palestinian cities and towns and control roads in between--all with the
goal of defending Israeli citizens and eradicating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Turning aside the criticism, and the demands of his own defense
minister, Sharon made it clear Wednesday that he is not ready to stop the
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli defense analysts said Sharon intends to gain the maximum
military advantage over the Palestinians before Zinni's arrival forces a
cease-fire on him. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Sharon
plans to extend the Ramallah operation at least until the arrival Monday
of Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramallah operation has caused a rift in the Israeli government.
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had ordered the actions to be
limited ahead of Zinni's arrival. But Sharon overruled him.</TE>
<TE>   In a bitter argument during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, the contents
of which were leaked to Israeli media, Ben-Eliezer threatened to quit the
government and take the center-left Labor Party--Sharon's largest
coalition partner--with him. Sharon called Ben-Eliezer's bluff, and the
defense minister backed down. The Ramallah offensive continued.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army insists that the campaign won't target Arafat
personally. But no one could miss the sarcasm in the name the army gave
to it: "Operation Your Turn Is Next."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians also ignored pleas to end violence Wednesday, vowing to
step up suicide bombings and shooting ambushes. A suspected Palestinian
assailant stabbed and critically wounded a man in a Jewish settlement
near Ramallah on Wednesday night, and another heavily armed Palestinian
opened fire on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip. He was killed, but no
one else was hurt, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, a bomb exploded next to a large vehicle in the Gaza
Strip, killing at least three Israelis, military sources said. They said
the attack occurred on a road to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks charged up the streets leading into Manara Square and
remained in it for a time before withdrawing Wednesday. Many Palestinian
gunmen have been holed up in the plaza. On Tuesday, they used it to
string up a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Ramallah is under the control of more than 100 tanks and armored
vehicles and hundreds of soldiers from Israel's paratroop battalion,
infantry, engineers corps and others who moved toward the center of the
city from the north, south and west, capturing as they went the
neighborhoods of Al Birah and Tira, where several leaders of the
Palestinian Authority live.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli soldier was killed in one gun battle. The other dead
included Raffaele Ciriello, 42, a freelance photographer from Italy who
was shot six times in the chest and stomach by an Israeli soldier firing
a heavy-caliber machine gun from a tank, according to other journalists
who were with him. Ciriello's colleagues said he was standing near
Palestinian gunmen when he was shot. He is the first foreign journalist
killed in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Other journalists came under fire when Israelis attacked the offices
of Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab satellite TV network, shortly after reporter
Shereen abu Shlek finished a live report.</TE>
<TE>Palestinians Say Talks Useless Until Soldiers Go</TE>
<TE>   A deputy commander of Arafat's Force 17 presidential guard was also
killed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Angry Palestinian officials said Wednesday that Zinni's mission will
prove pointless unless Israel withdraws from Ramallah. There can be no
talk of a truce, they said, while tanks control the Palestinians' de
facto capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel must stop the attacks first and withdraw if [the U.S.] expects
Zinni to succeed," Arafat aide Nabil abu Rudaineh said shortly after U.S.
Consul General Ronald Schlicher visited the Palestinian leader in his
besieged headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Rudaineh said the U.S. government was pressuring Sharon to call off
the offensive but that "clearly Israel is not responding."</TE>
<TE>   Israel indicated that it had no intention of scaling back its actions
until Arafat and the Palestinian Authority reined in their gunmen and
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel feels what is necessary now is to talk about the need to reach
a cease-fire," Sharon advisor Dore Gold said. "Israel will not negotiate
on the substance of peacemaking while our citizens and military are under
this terrorist assault. We hope that Gen. Zinni's mission works, but at
the same time we will do what is necessary to defend our people from this
illegitimate form of warfare imposed on us by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority."</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has produced superlatives that are bested almost as soon
as they are coined. One "deadliest day yet" or "largest incursion yet" is
soon followed by another. The series of raids launched Feb. 28 represents
the largest military operation Israel has conducted in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip since capturing those territories in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also many echoes of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon,
starting with the fact that it pitted arch-nemeses Sharon and Arafat
against each other.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Israeli intelligence official said Wednesday that the main
target of the Israeli offensive is Arafat's Fatah movement, a broad-based
political and social organization that also has an armed wing. A
Fatah-affiliated militia has taken the lead in attacks on Israelis,
combining both guerrilla-style shooting ambushes on soldiers and
checkpoints with suicide bombings that kill civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Fatah's most influential leader in the West Bank is Marwan Barghouti.
Israeli authorities hold Barghouti responsible for the deaths of 100
civilians, including Jewish settlers, but do not yet consider him a
legitimate target. There are two reasons: Eliminating Barghouti would set
Palestinian streets afire, and Israel may need him in a post-Arafat

items such as an artist's self-portrait with a Diet Coke inserted into a

<HD>Bush Puts Nuclear Use in 'Options Available'</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president defends the notion of a more flexible
arsenal as critical to fending off threats. Diplomacy is the top focus of
his remarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday defended a politically charged Pentagon
proposal to create new types of nuclear weapons and expand the nation's
list of potential nuclear targets, saying that a commander in chief "must
have all options available."</LD>
<LD>   Bush backed the notion of a more flexible nuclear arsenal, suggesting
that it is critical to deterring post-Cold War threats to the United
States and its allies, even as he said his administration remains
committed to nuclear arms reduction.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to make it very clear to nations that you will not threaten
the United States or use weapons of mass destruction against us or our
allies or friends," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   The president's remarks--his first since details of the classified
Pentagon document emerged last weekend--came during a White House news
conference that he called to pressure Senate Democrats who are blocking a
White House appeals court nominee, Charles Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   Bush complained bitterly about the Senate's treatment of Pickering but
spent much of the 45-minute session discussing his administration's
diplomatic efforts, his planned trip to Latin America next week and the
progress of the evolving war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Bush described how his decisions on the war in
Afghanistan have been colored by lessons he gleaned from the U.S.
experience in Vietnam. He said he is careful to be sure that the nation's
mission is clear and mindful of the need to separate military
considerations from the pressures of domestic politics.</TE>
<TE>   While stressing that the United States will be "judicious and wise"
about troop deployments, he said that national objectives and military
analysis, not political pressure, should guide deployment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics ought to stay out of fighting a war," Bush said. "There was
too much politics during the Vietnam War. There was too much concern in
the White House about political standing."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he worries that U.S. efforts to help other countries
excise terrorist cells might escalate into more direct military
involvement, Bush said he doesn't relish sending U.S. soldiers abroad but
would not adhere to the post-Vietnam ethos in which "the definition of
success in war was nobody lost their life."</TE>
<TE>   He also sought to connect the objectives of the current conflict to
those of the most storied--but also most costly--war of the 20th century.
The war on terrorism, he said, "is more akin to World War II than it is
to Vietnam. This is a war in which we fight for the liberties and freedom
of our country."</TE>
<TE>   His comments came as the bloodiest battle to date in Afghanistan--a
10-day engagement near Gardez in which eight Americans died--was winding
down. In general, the U.S. military in Afghanistan has employed a
strategy largely reliant on air strikes and proxy forces that has
protected American soldiers from much of the front-line fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he is pleased with the progress of the war. He said he does
not know whether Osama bin Laden is alive but said that, at the least,
the Al Qaeda leader is on the run, his terrorist network has been
crippled and his host government has been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the ultimate parasite who found weakness, exploited, and met his
match," Bush said of Bin Laden. "He has no place to train his Al Qaeda
killers anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for his trip to Mexico, El Salvador and Peru next week, Bush
praised House passage Tuesday of a bill that would allow thousands of
foreigners to seek legal residency in the United States, even if they
entered the country illegally. Currently, these immigrants are required
to return to their native countries as they apply for green cards.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good reform," Bush said, adding that he hopes the Senate
will move quickly to approve the bill. The measure is one ingredient in a
package of immigration-easing reforms that Bush and Mexican President
Vicente Fox were pursuing before the Sept. 11 attacks disrupted the
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also sounded new warnings to Iraq, as Vice President Dick Cheney
continued a trip to the Middle East seen largely as an effort by the
administration to lay the groundwork for potential action against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is among seven nations on the expanded list of potential U.S.
nuclear targets listed in a classified Pentagon report that was submitted
to Congress earlier this year, and whose contents were first reported in
The Times on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The document, called the Nuclear Posture Review, calls for the
creation of "low-yield" nuclear weapons that could be used against
smaller targets, including chemical or biological weapon facilities
buried deep underground.</TE>
<TE>   The document has created a stir in Washington, where several leading
Democratic senators have expressed alarm at the report, saying it could
undermine efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The
review has also drawn protest from leaders of China, North Korea and
other nations identified in the document as potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   Bush sought to soften the aggressive posture outlined in the report
but signaled that the United States is moving to strike a new balance
between disarmament and deterrence.</TE>
<TE>   "My interest is to reduce the threat of a nuclear war," Bush said,
noting that the administration is pursuing disarmament negotiations with
Russia and is even prepared to consider unilateral reductions in its
nuclear arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush did not back away from language in the report calling for new
categories of weapons. "I view our nuclear arsenal as a deterrent, as a
way to say to people that would harm America that . . . there is a
consequence," Bush said. "And the president must have all options
available to make that deterrent have meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Bush opened his news conference by attacking Senate Democrats who have
stymied the nomination of Pickering to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans. Bush defended Pickering's commitment to civil
rights and dismissed Democratic allegations that the nominee has a
troubling record on issues ranging from employment discrimination to
voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering's nomination is scheduled for a vote today in the Senate
Judiciary Committee, where it is expected to be defeated on a party-line
vote. Bush argued the matter deserves consideration by the full Senate
and criticized Democrats for what he said is a pattern of obstructing
worthy judicial candidates. He complained that only 40 of his 92 judicial
nominees have so far been confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unacceptable," Bush said. "It is a bad record for the
Senate."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, rejected Bush's complaints, saying the committee is moving
quickly on the appointments but has been delayed by the need to "undo the
damage of the last six years," in which Republicans who controlled the
Senate repeatedly blocked the nominees of President Clinton.</TE>

<HD>Daschle Orders Vote on Election Reform Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nearly a month after the House passed a landmark bill tightening
campaign financing rules, the Senate's Democratic leader moved Wednesday
to bring final action on it by next week.</LD>
<LD>   "Time has run out," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
as he scheduled a preliminary vote for Friday. More votes would follow
next week in an effort to resolve the issue before Congress leaves for a
two-week spring break.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle, a major proponent of the bill, said the chamber would conduct
unusual round-the-clock sessions, if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Based on the latest head counts, though, it seems doubtful that
Republican opponents have the will or the votes to maintain an all-out
filibuster to kill the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The bill at issue would ban the unlimited donations to national
political parties known as soft money and take other steps to
significantly overhaul campaign finance law for the first time in nearly
30 years. Its main aim is to diminish the influence of large donors on
the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say that portions of the bill are unconstitutional and that
its main effect will be to lessen the importance of the parties while
allowing special interest groups to exert more influence on campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents are confident the bill will be sent to President Bush
because the Senate last April approved a similar bill on a 59-41 vote.
While it takes 60 votes to force final action on disputed legislation in
the Senate, a few senators who opposed the bill last year have indicated
they would now vote to break a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents appear to recognize that reality.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a filibuster is called for at this time," said Senate
Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who opposes the bill. But in the
Senate, where rules grant senators great power to debate and propose
amendments to legislation, no action is certain until the final vote.</TE>

<HD>Editor's Relationship Raises Ethical Concerns at Harvard</HD>
<DH>Media: A Business Review article on GE's ex-chairman led to
romance, resignation, ire and perhaps divorce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>The Harvard Business Review is not normally known for plots
centering on seamy sex scandal. But the monthly bible of executive
America is reeling from disclosures that its top editor, while
researching an article, became a little too close to one of this
country's titans of industry.</LD>
<LD>   Suzy Wetlaufer stepped down last week after the Wall Street Journal
ran a juicy story about her "personal relationship" with former General
Electric Corp. Chairman Jack Welch. In New York, Jane Welch reacted
Monday by announcing plans to divorce the 66-year-old mogul.</LD>
<LD>   Wetlaufer, 42, was unavailable for comment. But spokeswoman Karen
Schwartzman said that after Wetlaufer's romantic relationship with Welch
was revealed, "it became apparent to her that she had lost the confidence
of a number of key people on the staff. She made a decision that without
their confidence, she could not effectively lead the organization, and it
would be in their best interest for her to step down as editor."</LD>
<TE>   Still, the fact that Wetlaufer will remain on staff as an
editor-at-large and will continue to occupy her coveted corner office
sent the staid publication into revolt. At least six editors at the
Business Review wrote letters calling for Wetlaufer's resignation. After
a meeting at which the divorced mother of four vowed to stay her ground,
two staff editors quit in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Executive editor Nicholas Carr issued a statement late last week
branding the arrangement "a masterpiece of editorial fecklessness and an
insult to the staffers."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Carr said he stood by his remarks but was too
"exhausted" by the whole matter to elaborate further.</TE>
<TE>   Alden Hayashi confirmed Tuesday that he had resigned because of
Wetlaufer. Harris Collingwood also jumped ship. Collingwood could not be
reached for comment, but in a posting under his name on a journalism Web
site, he wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "The senior editors of the Harvard Business Review insist that she
will exert no influence over the editing. . . . Such compromises with
reality are typical of the Harvard Business School Publishing's senior
leadership. My former colleagues . . . deserve better."</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Business School Publishing, an independent subsidiary of the
Harvard Business School, generates about $100 million a year in revenue.
The Business Review--with 240,000 subscribers--is its best-known
publication. The enterprise also produces books, as well as the business
school's famous case studies.</TE>
<TE>   The publishing company's editorial director, Walter Kiechel, said
Tuesday that he would not discuss personnel decisions "past, present or
future." He maintained, however, that "the integrity of the Harvard
Business Review has not been compromised by personal relationships or
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   According to published accounts verified by Kiechel, Wetlaufer met
several times with Welch late last fall to prepare a question-and-answer
feature for the Business Review.</TE>
<TE>   Under the magazine's policy, Welch was to be allowed to review the
article before publication. He ended up demanding that the original
title, "Jack Bites Back," be changed to something more positive. The
chairman of the board of Harvard Business School Publishing, James Cash,
is a director at General Electric.</TE>
<TE>   After word of her relationship with Welch leaked out, Wetlaufer took
herself off the assignment. Two other editors were sent to redo the
interview with Welch. It ran in the magazine's February issue under the
benign headline "Jack on Jack."</TE>
<TE>   A prepared statement from Wetlaufer said the romance with Welch began
after the interview was written and edited.</TE>
<TE>   Welch has declined to discuss the situation. His office in Connecticut
issued a statement saying only that "my wife, Jane, and I are involved in
a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   The Welches were married 13 years ago on Nantucket Island, where they
have a home. Their primary residence is in Fairfield, Conn., and they
also maintain homes in New York and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "We're currently negotiating a settlement, trying to work things out
and avoid going to court. If we do that, then the divorce is just a
matter of paperwork," Jane Welch's lawyer, William Zabel, told Associated
Press on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel, who was hired Friday, said he was trying to keep negotiations
amicable. "I'm trying hard to make it that way. It's very early."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's prenuptial agreement expired "a couple of years ago,"
Zabel said. He would not discuss anything else about the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine's list of 400 richest Americans in September said
Welch was worth $680 million.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartzman said Wetlaufer's relationship with Welch is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Wetlaufer earned $270,000 in 2000. Kiechel said she will not retain
that salary in her new position as editor-at-large.</TE>
<TE>   Kiechel also said that the whole affair has occasioned some
soul-searching at a publication that likes to think of itself as a beacon
of insight and ideas. The magazine has drafted a task force, Kiechel
said, "mostly of editors and others from around the country to develop
tenets of community behavior"--ethical policies about how to handle
intimacy between people who put out the magazine and people who are
featured in it.</TE>
<TE>   He praised his editorial staff of about 30 as "a strong-thinking and
passionate bunch." Then he paused to add, "What I meant was, they have
passionately held ideas."</TE>

<HD>Bush Calls for Probe of INS After Hijackers' Visas OKd</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Furor escalates over the approval for two Sept. 11
attackers. The mistake gives critics of the troubled agency potent
ammunition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush delivered a stinging rebuke to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service on Wednesday following the disclosure that the
agency confirmed student visas for two of the Sept. 11 hijackers--six
months after they destroyed the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The revelation not only embarrassed the INS but also underscored the
error-prone agency's central role in the nation's war on terrorism and
added force to the drive to address its long-standing problems.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said, "I could barely get my coffee down" as he read about the
incident in his morning newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   "I was stunned and not happy," Bush told a news conference. "This is
an interesting wake-up call for those who run the INS. It needs to be
modernized so we know who's coming and who's going out and why they're
here."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Bush stood by INS Commissioner James Ziglar, whom he
appointed. "His responsibility is to reform the INS," the president said.
"Let's give him time to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar has pledged to modernize an array of INS procedures, including
bringing in modern technology to track foreign students in the United
States and speeding up the process that caused the current furor.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft vowed an immediate
investigation of the INS, which is part of his Justice Department. The
INS threw up a defensive perimeter of explanatory news releases.</TE>
<TE>   The brouhaha began Monday, six months to the day since the hijackings,
when a flight school in Venice, Fla., received notification that the INS
had approved student visas for two of its alumni: Mohamed Atta and Marwan
Al-Shehhi, who are believed to have piloted the jetliners that brought
down the World Trade Center's twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   As news spread, the INS hastily released a statement pointing out that
the flight school had received a "secondary" notification. Atta's
application had been approved July 17, and Al-Shehhi's on Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to emphasize that the decisions regarding the request
to change status were made in the summer of 2001, prior to the tragic
events of Sept. 11," the INS said in the statement, which also noted that
the beleaguered agency "had no information indicating that Atta or
Al-Shehhi had ties to terrorist organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Those explanations were overshadowed by a hail of derision, and the
episode seemed destined to take on the status of a legend in the annals
of governmental miscues.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the terrorists' visa approvals quickly became
entangled with other grievances between Congress and the White House over
homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said the incident
underscored the need for Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge to testify
before Congress. The White House has resisted requests for Ridge to
testify, contending that he is a presidential advisor, not a Cabinet
officer, and that he regularly makes himself available to members of
Congress on an informal basis.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said Ridge needed to testify before Congress "and explain why
things like this" are happening. He said he was "absolutely shocked" at
the news of the visas, calling it "one of the most embarrassing incidents
since 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed concern that efforts to reform the INS were bogging
down. "My fear is that it is still business as usual at INS, even in the
aftermath of the most devastating terror attack on American soil," said
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). She urged passage of legislation to
improve visa security.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a co-sponsor of that legislation,
called the incident "an embarrassing mistake" that showed the INS had
serious problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an agency that is out of control, unable to perform its most
basic functions and is in need of radical reform," complained Sen. Bob
Graham (D-Fla.). He urged fellow lawmakers to mandate an overhaul of how
student visas are issued and monitored.</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed amazement that such an incident could ever have
occurred. "Anything with Mohamed Atta's name on it should send alarm
bells blasting," said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.). "What is this, a Keystone
Kops operation?"</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar has testified that the agency "is currently on schedule" to
introduce a modern system for tracking foreign students by Jan. 1, 2003.
The system is intended to replace the slow and circuitous approach still
in use, in which INS examiners mail information to a processing center,
where a private contractor enters data and ultimately sends paperwork
back to a school on the status of an applicant.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Atta and Al-Shehhi, the final mailing was sent by a
processing center in London, Ky., which is run by a private contractor,
to the flight school on Florida's Gulf Coast.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official Wednesday described Ashcroft as
"extremely concerned and furious," and said the attorney general would
have the department's inspector general investigate "as soon as
possible." Bush ordered Ashcroft and Ridge to "get to the bottom of this
immediately," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Ashcroft unveiled administration plans to overhaul the
INS, dividing the agency into two parts: one responsible for law
enforcement, the other in charge of services to law-abiding immigrants.
The effort was intended to head off more drastic congressional proposals
to effectively break up the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The latest furor provides the agency's many critics with some of their
most potent ammunition so far.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's "discovery that student visas had been issued to dead
terrorists sadly underscores the fact that the INS is so overwhelmed and
disorganized that it is incapable of managing the current flow of
immigration, let alone the additional mandates being foisted upon it by
Congress," said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for
American Immigration Reform, which seeks to restrict immigration.</TE>

<HD>House Budget Proposal $46 Billion Out of Balance</HD>
<DH>Economy: On party-line vote, panel OKs GOP's $2.1-trillion bill.
Included are increases sought by Bush for defense issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite improvements in the economy and pressure from conservatives
to balance the federal budget, House Republicans late Wednesday endorsed
a $2.1-trillion spending blueprint that would produce a $46-billion
deficit in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The budget, which would fully fund large spending increases sought by
President Bush for defense and homeland security, demonstrates how hard
it will be for Congress to avoid deficits during a time of war--and in an
election year.</LD>
<LD>   Hopes for avoiding a rising tide of red ink had been boosted by recent
signs that the economy is rebounding, boosting government receipts. But
if even the GOP-controlled House, the strongest bastion of fiscal
conservatives in Washington, cannot produce a balanced budget, analysts
say there is virtually no chance that Congress can avoid running even
deeper into the red.</LD>
<TE>   The House Budget Committee approved the GOP-backed resolution on a
party-line vote, 23-18, sending it to the full House for a vote next
week. That marks the beginning of a congressional budget debate that is
littered with political land mines for members of both parties, forcing
them to choose between favored spending priorities and going ever deeper
into debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be at balance [in the budget] in the worst way," said
House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Iowa). "If it were not for
Sept. 11, we would have a balanced budget."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Republicans seem willing to swallow the proposed deficit
because it largely stems from the cost of the economic stimulus bill
signed into law last week; it included about $43 billion in business tax
cuts and unemployment benefits for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We are balancing this budget, with the exception of something to help
the economy," said Rep. John B. Shadegg (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, though, see potential political advantage in the House
budget resolution's call for tapping $831 billion in Social Security
surpluses to pay for other government programs from 2003 to 2007. That
would force Republicans to violate their oft-repeated promise to keep
Social Security surpluses in a "lockbox"--meaning the money is off-limits
for other purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "So much for the lockbox," said Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   When the budget comes to the House floor, GOP leaders plan to add
language to the resolution that would provide a guarantee--albeit one
that is not legally binding--that the benefits of current Social Security
recipients would never be cut.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, in control of the Senate, will face political challenges of
their own when that chamber's Budget Committee tries to draft an
alternative spending plan in the coming weeks. While some Democratic
leaders have blamed the big tax cut Bush pushed through Congress last
year for bringing back deficit spending, they have been loath to propose
altering the law.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Democrats with the choice of writing a budget with a
deficit--violating their own pledge not to "raid" Social Security
surpluses--or produce a budget they have balanced by cutting Bush's
defense requests or their party's domestic priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The political choices are so difficult--and the differences between
the parties so deep--that many analysts predict that Congress won't pass
a budget resolution this year. That would mean lawmakers could write the
year's appropriation bills--the measures that fund government
agencies--with no spending ceilings or other guideposts.</TE>
<TE>   The budget resolution is the annual tool for setting congressional
spending priorities. The resolution sets overall spending and revenue
targets for broad categories of federal activities, such as defense,
education and health. But other bills must be passed later in the year to
appropriate money and change tax policy.</TE>
<TE>   In line with Bush's requests, the House GOP budget for next year calls
for $394 billion in spending for the Pentagon--a 13% increase. It also
includes $38 billion for homeland security--roughly doubling the current
level.</TE>
<TE>   The budget would increase spending for education and health, and would
restore some of the cuts in highway spending that Bush proposed. It
includes $350 billion over 10 years to provide prescription drug coverage
under Medicare--up from the $190 billion Bush proposed.</TE>
<TE>   But in other areas, the House budget calls for serious
belt-tightening. It would reduce funding in energy, environment and other
domestic programs.</TE>
<TE>   While criticizing those spending restraints, Democrats stressed their
support for Bush's anti-terrorism policies.</TE>
<TE>   "In the war against terrorism," Spratt said, "we're united behind the
president and unstinting about the cost."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A defiant President Bush flatly refused Wednesday to divulge
details of internal energy task force meetings to congressional
investigators, calling the information privileged and the request a
threat to executive authority.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, sued
the administration in February for records of the task force's meetings.
Democratic lawmakers allege Enron Corp. and other energy companies played
a disproportionately large role in the task force's deliberations,
whereas environmentalists were largely shut out.</LD>
<LD>   The task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, produced a
policy favoring more oil and gas drilling as well as a revival of nuclear
power. Cheney's office has acknowledged that representatives of Enron,
Bush's biggest financial backer in the 2000 campaign, were among the
industry experts that the task force consulted.</LD>
<TE>   But Bush insisted that releasing the documents would damage his
ability to obtain candid outside advice.</TE>
<TE>   "When the GAO demands documents from us, we're not going to give them
to them," Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Order Issued in Fatal Scaffolding Plunge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>A judge Wednesday ordered the preservation of all evidence and
records involving the deadly scaffolding collapse at the John Hancock
Center building so the materials can be examined by investigators for the
victims' families.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Robert Clifford sought the emergency motion as he filed a
lawsuit on behalf of the families of two women killed Saturday when their
cars were crushed by a 3,000-pound section of scaffolding that fell from
the 42nd floor.</LD>
<LD>   "The families are in need of protection, particularly with some of the
finger-pointing going on" by the scaffold operator and the city, Clifford
said.</LD>
<TE>   Another lawsuit was filed later by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. on
behalf of the husband of the third victim.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits accuse the Shorenstein Co., which owns the Hancock, and
scaffolding operator AMS Architectural Technologies of Denver of failing
to ensure the scaffolding was secured in a safe position.</TE>
<TE>   The suits also name scaffolding manufacturer Beeche Systems Corp. of
Scotia, N.Y., and Prime Staging Inc. of Bensenville, Ill., which
assembled the scaffolding.</TE>
<TE>   City Building Commissioner Mary Richardson-Lowry said Tuesday that AMS
violated manufacturer's specifications that the custom-made rig be
secured to the base or top of the Hancock building in high winds.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for AMS disputed the city's assertions. "We still believe
this whole investigation is going to focus on the design and not the
operation," Ray Hanania said Wednesday. "I know we followed the safety
procedures to what we believe was the letter of the responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Cochran Targets Major Firms in New Venture</HD>
<DH>The law: His Washington partnership will back the little guy
against big business. Reparations for slavery are one focus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who made his reputation as a criminal
attorney defending celebrity clients such as O.J. Simpson and Sean
"Puffy" Combs, announced Wednesday that he is opening an office here to
take on class-action, personal injury lawsuits against major industries
and government agencies.</LD>
<LD>   Joining forces with a law firm in Washington that handled many
Holocaust victims' cases and another in Florida that was instrumental in
tobacco litigation, Cochran promised a "consortium for justice" that
would "comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable."</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, politically minded attorneys increasingly have teamed
with personal injury lawyers interested in big-money, big-publicity cases
to take on major companies--be it Microsoft or breast implant
manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   One result is a sharing of information--and a collective strategy for
using it.</TE>
<TE>   "The asbestos litigation begat the tobacco litigation," explained
Ashley Taylor, a defense attorney who has argued cases for corporations.
"The tobacco litigation will beget more litigation. The only question is,
what industry is next?"</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Cochran mentioned the nursing home industry as a
potential target. And one of his new partners, Michael Hausfeld, said the
group already is at work on a case against the tobacco companies for
targeting advertising to children and young adults.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps most intriguing among the consortium's plans is the effort
to pursue slave reparations for black Americans, one case they say they
will work on without fees.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran has been meeting with other lawyers and academics for more
than a year to discuss the legal and political strategy for pursuing
reparations from the government and from corporations that, for example,
offered slave insurance policies before the Civil War. Chaired by Harvard
law professor Charles Ogletree and Randall Robinson, who two decades ago
launched public protests against South Africa's apartheid system, the
team is researching corporate histories for possible liability and
talking to Congress about possible legislative remedies.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the legal difficulty of proving any harmful effect on
individual descendants of American slaves, Cochran said he instead is
seeking "an education remedy," providing additional resources to schools
in predominantly black communities to erase the historic gap left by
slavery. That option might be "more palatable to the majority community,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is not for everybody to collect a check," Cochran said.</TE>
<TE>   Hausfeld--who brought action against Swiss bankers for seizing the
assets of Holocaust victims and who now represents Russia and several
Eastern European countries on issues of forced labor by the Nazis--thinks
some of the same principles apply to the reparation case. "We're looking
at expanding the scope," Hausfeld said. "Why keep the focus domestic?
There were British shipping companies, Dutch and German banks."</TE>
<TE>   Hausfeld's technical expertise, coupled with Cochran's high profile,
could propel the issue of reparations to new stature on Capitol Hill.
Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) has been calling for hearings ever since
Congress, in 1988, gave reparations to Japanese Americans for their
imprisonment during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Any lawsuit could provide Cochran a chance to work the political angle
to greater effect, given the public relations havoc a corporation accused
of profiting from slavery would face.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get into court, and Michael helps us with that," Cochran
said, referring to his new partner. "With regard to corporations and
universities, it's going to be different than dealing with the
government. Maybe down the road some of them will want to fashion some
kind of remedy. I really hope so. I would think that some of these
corporations may be vulnerable."</TE>

<HD>Judge Reverses Fingerprint Decision</HD>
<DH>Law: After not allowing an expert's opinion in murder trial, the
jurist changes his mind. The ruling is a setback to foes of such
evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge who stunned the legal community earlier this year
by forbidding the use of a fingerprint expert's opinion in a Philadelphia
murder trial reversed his decision Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Noting that a three-day hearing two weeks ago provided new
information, U.S. District Judge Louis Pollak said, "I have changed my
mind."</LD>
<LD>   The 59-page ruling is a major setback for lawyers across the country
who have been raising a series of legal challenges to fingerprint
evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The challenges began emerging because of U.S. Supreme Court rulings in
recent years that have imposed more rigorous standards for the admission
of scientific and expert testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Until Pollak's initial ruling Jan. 7 in their favor, challengers had
suffered one defeat after another.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of fingerprint evidence considered the ruling a turning
point that would become the basis for successful challenges in other
courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely throws a wet blanket on their hopes," said David
Faigman, a professor at the Hastings School of Law in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Patrick Meehan, whose office is prosecuting a murder trial
in which fingerprints are key evidence, called the decision a major
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly an important conclusion for law enforcement," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his earlier ruling, Pollak said fingerprint comparison techniques
have not been adequately validated through research, that they don't
incorporate a means of determining how often examiners err and that they
don't use objective standards for determining whether two prints match.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Pollak said in January, an expert would be allowed to
identify matching details of prints but could not specifically say that a
defendant's print matched those found at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling Wednesday, Pollak reversed one of his major findings:
that the subjectivity of fingerprint comparisons meant that the
techniques for matching crime scene prints with known prints was not
governed by any describable set of standards.</TE>
<TE>   "On further reflection, I disagree with myself," wrote Pollak, a
former dean of Yale Law School.</TE>
<TE>   While continuing to maintain that fingerprint examiners' opinions are
subjective, Pollak concluded Wednesday that they are no more subjective
than many other forensic science opinions accepted by courts. Moreover,
he said fingerprint techniques allow for less subjectivity than many
other fields of expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Pollak held to his earlier opinion that the reliability of fingerprint
methods has not been subjected to scientific testing and said such tests
"would clearly aid in measuring [the techniques'] reliability."</TE>
<TE>   But he said defense lawyers in the case have not shown that the FBI,
which did the fingerprint analysis, has a high error rate.</TE>
<TE>   "With those findings in mind, I am not persuaded that the courts
should defer admission of testimony on fingerprinting . . . until
academic investigators . . . have made substantial headway on a
verification and validation research agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Although Pollak accepted the reliability of the FBI's examiners in
this case, he clearly was unimpressed with the proficiency tests it gives
to its examiners to check their error rates.</TE>
<TE>   He accepted the defense arguments that the tests were too simple and
did not adequately test real fingerprint comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "On the record before me, the FBI examiners got very high proficiency
grades, but the tests they took did not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pollak also held firm to his January opinion that fingerprinting is
not a science, a claim that experts in the field continue to maintain.
But he said the Supreme Court rulings do not require that expert
testimony be scientific testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Epstein, a federal public defender in Philadelphia who has been
a leader in the challenges, said he was disappointed. But he said
Pollak's ruling still recognizes that fingerprint technology fails to
meet some important reliability standards, such as the lack of testing.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein said Pollak was wrong to accept the FBI's expertise simply
because the defense didn't show that the agency had never made mistakes
when matching fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of proof is on the prosecution to show the reliability of
their expert testimony," Epstein said. "Ultimately, the court of appeals
is going to resolve this issue, either in this case or some other case."</TE>
<TE>   The rulings mean that the murder trial in which it came will resume
Monday. The three defendants are charged with operating a drug ring and
are linked to four killings. A jury was picked earlier this year.</TE>

<HD>Nev. Doctors Get Helping Hand</HD>
<DH>Medicine: State to offer lower-cost medical malpractice insurance
to help physicians maintain their practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Nevada will offer less expensive medical malpractice insurance to
help doctors maintain their practices, Gov. Kenny Guinn announced here
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The formation of the Nevada Essential Insurance Assn.--launched with a
$250,000 contribution by the state--is only a stopgap measure to address
a crisis that ultimately needs to be resolved by state legislators, Guinn
said.</LD>
<LD>   The program will provide medical malpractice coverage to physicians
who are being denied coverage among the state-authorized carriers, and
who are being charged premiums by out-of-state carriers that cost upward
of four times what the doctors have previously paid.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first really positive news that Nevada physicians have
had in months," said Larry Matheis, executive director of the Nevada
State Medical Assn. "We haven't yet seen the crisis abate, but this
offers a temporary respite and hopefully we're on the road to recovery.
We're pleased the state has acted swiftly."</TE>
<TE>   The governor acted after state Insurance Commissioner Alice A.
Molasky-Arman concluded March 4 that malpractice insurance is no longer
readily available in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Under Guinn's program, a board of directors appointed by Molasky-Arman
will set premium rates sufficient to absorb losses paid out in
malpractice lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance coverage, which is allowed by state law under emergency
situations, will begin April 15.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a short-term solution that addresses the immediate issue,"
Guinn said. "I'm prepared to work with the Nevada Legislature on reforms
that will provide stable and reliable medical malpractice insurance well
into the future."</TE>
<TE>   The state-sponsored insurance pool may allow the city's only trauma
center to remain open, after its closure was threatened because two
trauma surgeons could not afford insurance. "This is a step in the right
direction, an interim solution to get us through to the legislative
session next year," said Dr. Dale Carrison, director of the University
Medical Center emergency department.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis surfaced in December, when the St. Paul Cos. of Minnesota,
which had insured about 60% of the state's doctors, abandoned its medical
malpractice business because of huge financial losses nationwide. Las
Vegas, with about two-thirds of the state's population, was especially
hard hit.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it was experiencing some of its worst losses in
Nevada, where it was paying about $1.80 in malpractice judgments and
settlements for each $1 it received in doctor premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies sharply increased their premiums, and have denied
coverage to many doctors in high-risk practices. Some doctors are being
charged premiums in excess of $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, dozens of Las Vegas physicians--particularly those in
obstetrics, emergency medicine and specialized surgery--have closed their
practices in recent weeks, and officials feared that more than 10% of the
doctors would be forced to quit by summer, unable to pay premiums that
outstrip their take-home pay, and jeopardizing the delivery of health
care in Las Vegas, which already is underserved by doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Sharply increased premium costs also are confronting doctors in other
states that, like Nevada, do not limit the amount of pain-and-suffering
damages paid in malpractice cases.</TE>
<TE>   Malpractice premiums are escalating less in California, where 1975
tort reform limits pain-and-suffering damages to $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ikram Khan, who advised Guinn on behalf of the Nevada Medical
Liability Physician Task Force, called the governor's decision
"relatively good news" because most doctors will find the new premiums
more affordable. But he warned that the premiums may still be too
expensive for many doctors, and that physicians still must secure,
through private companies, so-called tail coverage--insurance that
protects them from lawsuits for malpractice that occurred before their
new policies take effect.</TE>

<HD>Man Admits Theft From U.S. Archives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>A former National Archives employee admitted Wednesday that he
stole dozens of historical documents, including presidential pardons
signed by Abraham Lincoln and slave trade materials.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn P. Aubitz, 45, of Morrisville, pleaded guilty to a single charge
of theft by a government employee. He could get as much as 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine at his sentencing in June.</LD>
<LD>   Aubitz had worked at the National Archives and Records Administration
in Philadelphia for 14 years. Prosecutors said he took the documents from
1996 to 1999 simply by putting them in his briefcase.</LD>
<TE>   Aubitz sold the documents to collectors, using the money--more than
$200,000--for personal expenses and credit card debt, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen items included 64 presidential pardons, nearly $7,500 worth
of autographed photographs of Apollo astronauts and an 1863 warrant to
the U.S. marshal ordering him to seize Arlington House, the estate of
Robert E. Lee, during the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Of the pardons, 24 have been recovered, although none of the Apollo
photographs was found. The warrant was also recovered, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Shawn has given them every name of every collector, every place that
he recollects that any of the items were sold," said defense lawyer
Jodeen M. Hobbs.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were tipped off to the theft when a federal worker
became suspicious of an item offered for sale online.</TE>

<HD>Crematory Case Adds 30 Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>Authorities filed 30 more charges Wednesday against the operator of
the Tri-State Crematory, where 339 corpses have been discovered.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Brent Marsh, 28, now faces 204 charges in Georgia of theft by
deception for allegedly dumping the bodies on the crematory grounds
rather than cremating them, as he was paid to do.</LD>
<LD>   Marsh has been behind bars since last month.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities in nearby Bradley County, Tenn., filed arrest warrants
charging Marsh with six counts of abuse of corpses. But on Tuesday, they
said they were holding off asking for an indictment at the request of
Georgia investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that at least 250 bodies sent to the crematory since 1998
were from Tennessee. Tri-State also contracted with funeral homes in
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Family members of people whose bodies were taken to the crematory met
Wednesday with state legislators in Atlanta to make suggestions on
preventing similar incidents.</TE>

<HD>'60s Radical Draws Life in Killing of Deputy</HD>
<DH>Courts: More widely known as H. Rap Brown, Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin
faced death penalty. He wounded a second officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the 1960s black-power activist formerly
known as H. Rap Brown, was sentenced to life in prison without parole
Wednesday for killing a deputy sheriff who tried to serve him a warrant
two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Amin, 58, a Muslim cleric who in recent years led programs to
combat drugs and poverty in his West End neighborhood, showed no emotion
when the punishment was read. Later he turned and greeted family members
in the courtroom with a quick wave and a smile. The prosecution had asked
for the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   A generation ago, when Brown registered voters in Alabama and stirred
a riotous crowd in Cambridge, Md., with the words, "If America don't come
around, we will burn America down," a sentence such as Wednesday's might
have been racially divisive. But Al-Amin's defense elicited little
sympathy in the black community.</LD>
<TE>   The indifference is a measure, at least in part, of the great changes
that have swept over Atlanta since the turbulent 1960s. It is a city
where the mayor, police chief, district attorney and county sheriff are
black. The deputy Al-Amin killed was black. And the jury that convicted
Al-Amin on Saturday of murder and rendered his sentence Wednesday was
composed of nine blacks, two whites and one Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Amin did not testify in his own defense at the trial, but 17
character witnesses--including former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, now 70
and a business consultant, and former Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver, an
Emory University law professor--spoke in his behalf. Young, who said he
knew Al-Amin before he converted to Islam in prison and changed his name,
called the defendant a "peaceful man."</TE>
<TE>   The murder occurred March 16, 2000, when deputies Ricky Kinchen, 35,
and Aldranon English, 28, stopped Al-Amin near the West End grocery store
he ran. The officers were trying to serve him with an arrest warrant for
missing a court date related to charges of receiving stolen property,
driving without proof of insurance and impersonating a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   English testified that he told Al-Amin to put his right hand in view.
The deputy went on: "He said, 'Yeah,' frowned and swung up an assault
rifle and started shooting." English was wounded in his legs, left arm
and chest. Kinchen was hit in the abdomen and died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Security was extraordinarily tight during Al-Amin's trial and
sentencing, with at least half a dozen plainclothes security officers in
the courtroom watching the spectators, which included Kinchen's widow and
family, and members of the Islamic community.</TE>
<TE>   The red-bearded Al-Amin, wearing large glasses and a cleric's white
cap and robe, sat quietly and calmly throughout the trial, occasionally
shaking his head at something a witness would say. The defense rested its
case after two days of testimony, surprising many who had expected
numerous witnesses would be called over several weeks to support
Al-Amin's contention that he was a victim of mistaken identity.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House's stately East Room seemed more like an intimate
salon Wednesday as First Lady Laura Bush played host to a lively
discussion of the literary and cultural legacy of the Harlem Renaissance.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by massive chandeliers, formal portraits of former White
House occupants and ornate draperies, about 150 scholars, teachers,
students and other literature lovers were treated to a three-hour
retrospective on the prolific, Harlem-based black arts movement of the
1920s and '30s.</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Bush, a former librarian who has made teaching and early
childhood development her signature issues, noted that the historic heart
of African American culture provided a "welcome haven" where blacks
fleeing the racism of the South could find well-paying jobs, have fun and
write what they wanted.</LD>
<TE>   "The writers of the Harlem Renaissance whom we focus on today
celebrated their culture in poetry and prose while capturing the stark
realities of being black in America," she said. "In committing their
words to paper, they shaped a rich literary history and became agents of
change."</TE>
<TE>   The event included lectures by noted literary experts and a panel
discussion by modern black writers about the influences on their work of
their early 20th century predecessors, with afternoon tea served in
between.</TE>
<TE>   A local high school choir filled the room with period music.
Photographs, musical playbills, poem drafts and other artifacts on loan
from the Library of Congress also were strewn throughout the executive
mansion's public rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Attendees included Lucy Hurston, niece of novelist Zora Neale Hurston,
who was celebrated alongside fellow Harlem Renaissance writers such as
Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen and Jean
Toomer.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second in a series of symposiums being held by Mrs. Bush to
salute America's greatest authors. The Harlem Renaissance was supposed to
coincide with February's Black History Month, but scheduling difficulties
delayed the event.</TE>
<TE>   The Harlem Renaissance transformed American letters. But it also
shaped social history, helping to shift the country from Victorianism to
modernism, said Pulitzer Prize-winning writer David Levering Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "They were part of . . . a creation of new modernity, one in which
race and African ancestry would not be a badge of shame and not an
impediment to full freedom," said Thadious Davis, an English professor at
Vanderbilt University.</TE>

<HD>Thousands at Defense Dept. on 'Shopping Spree'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>More than 700 military officers are among 46,000 Defense Department
employees who have walked away from $62 million in debt against their
government-issued credit cards, and one civilian employee who charged
thousands in personal expenses has been promoted to the office that
oversees Army finances.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying Wednesday before a House panel, Sen. Charles E. Grassley
(R-Iowa) said those disclosures and the findings of a continuing General
Accounting Office investigation show that abuse of credit cards issued by
the Defense Department is not being taken seriously at the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   "DOD credit cards are being taken on a shopping spree and the
cardholders think they are immune from punishment. And they are,"
Grassley told a House government reform subcommittee.</LD>
<TE>   Defense procurement director Deidre A. Lee disputed Grassley's claim.
She said the Pentagon has taken significant steps in the last year to
tighten controls over credit cards and to better train the employees who
use them.</TE>
<TE>   As of November, more than 46,000 Defense Department employees had
defaulted on $62 million in official travel expenses charged to the
government cards. The bad debts, which banks that issue the cards have
been forced to write off, are growing at the rate of $1 million a month,
according to Grassley.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 1.7 million Pentagon charge cards were used for purchases
totaling more than $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the cards are for official travel and are billed directly to
employees, who are responsible for paying the bills and getting
reimbursement from the government.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley said the accounts of the officers have been unpaid for seven
months or more and include individual balances of as much as $8,000. He
said the officers range in rank from lieutenants to colonels and a Navy
captain.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley said civilian worker Tanya Mays charged nearly $12,000 in
personal expenses on her government card while working at the Navy Public
Works Center in San Diego, and in October was promoted to the Army's top
financial management office in the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Mays was never disciplined and has never been asked to repay the
government for any of the purchases, which included a computer, a kitchen
appliance, gift certificates, clothing and groceries, Grassley said.</TE>
<TE>   Mays did not respond to requests for comment made through the Army
press office.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of unauthorized personal purchases by Mays was cited last
summer by GAO investigators auditing the Navy Public Works Center. The
case was referred to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, but an
assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego declined to prosecute.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A runoff will be held April 9 between a Latino and an African
American seeking the Democratic nomination in Texas for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated by Republican Phil Gramm.</LD>
<LD>   The winner will join a ticket featuring the first Latino nominated for
governor in Texas by a major party.</LD>
<LD>   Laredo oilman and banker Tony Sanchez, armed with a personal fortune
of $600 million, easily won Tuesday's primary over former state Atty.
Gen. Dan Morales, and will challenge Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican. Perry
was the lieutenant governor who became governor when George W. Bush
became president.</LD>
<TE>   In the Senate race, schoolteacher Victor Morales, who lost to Gramm in
1996, and Ron Kirk, an African American who is a former mayor of Dallas,
each polled about 33% of the vote, falling short of the more than 50%
needed to win. U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen, nephew of former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
(D-Texas), ran third with 27%.</TE>
<TE>   The runoff winner will face Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn, a
Republican.</TE>

<HD>Gender Rules Issued for Airport Pat-Downs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Screeners at airport checkpoints will not frisk passengers of the
opposite sex, the head of the Transportation Security Administration
announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   John Magaw, who heads the security agency, said male screening agents
would pat down males and female workers would do the same for women.</LD>
<LD>   "You will not have a male frisking a female," Magaw said.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the security agency is setting standards for when to
frisk passengers at airport checkpoints, Magaw said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want every passenger to be treated with respect," Transportation
Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Flight Attendants said hundreds of its members reported
being touched inappropriately by screeners of the opposite sex.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokeswoman Dawn Deeks said the complaints ended after Feb. 17,
when the Transportation Security Administration took over responsibility
for airport security.</TE>
<TE>   "It had been a big problem,' Deeks said. "We were receiving lots of
reports of inappropriate screenings. It does seem to be getting better."</TE>
<TE>   The problem had reached such proportions that the home page on the
union's Web site included a special section on what do to if singled out
for frisking, including asking to talk to airport police.</TE>
<TE>   Magaw said there should be screeners of both sexes available at every
checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have a mixed work force, we're not recruiting properly,"
Magaw said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the agency will have a hotline and an ombudsman to hear
complaints about how passengers and flight crews are treated by security
screeners.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also unveiled its logo Wednesday: A black and white eagle
preparing to soar over nine stars and 11 stripes of a waving American
flag.</TE>
<TE>   The number of stars and stripes is to commemorate Sept. 11, the date
of the terrorist attacks that led Congress to create the Transportation
Security Administration.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Shift in Venue for Many Class-Action Suits</HD>
<DH>Law: The GOP bill seeks to move cases from state to federal courts
to curb frivolous legal action. Critics say it shields corporate
wrongdoers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Republicans on Wednesday pushed through the House legislation to
move many class-action lawsuits out of state courts and into federal
courts, where businesses say they are more likely to get a fair trial.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which the Bush administration supports, sparked a sharp
partisan debate.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans said it would discourage frivolous lawsuits by plaintiffs'
attorneys chasing deep-pocket defendants; most Democrats charged that it
would tilt the justice system in an effort to shield corporate
wrongdoers.</LD>
<TE>   The 233-190 House vote moved the bill to the Democratic-controlled
Senate, where it faces steep hurdles. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) said he has not yet reviewed the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Similar legislation narrowly passed the House in 1999 but died in the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Business lobbyists hailed the House action as a step toward curbing
what they view as excessive class-action settlements negotiated in local
courts in such states as California, Mississippi, Illinois and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of states now that have become nearly lawless in
their civil justice systems," said Jim Wooton, president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform. "They're essentially
acting like pirates and waylaying national corporations and taking
property away from them without due process of law."</TE>
<TE>   But trial lawyers and consumer and environmental groups deplored the
bill. They said that without the threat of class-action suits--in which
plaintiffs can seek damages on behalf of large groups--businesses would
not have been forced to put seat belts in cars or child-safety caps on
medicine bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Public-interest litigation against tobacco and pharmaceutical
companies, they said, also would be damaged if the bill were to become
law. The groups vowed to fight to ensure the bill never reaches President
Bush's desk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to get out of the Senate," said Carlton Carl,
spokesman for the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America. "This is outrageous
special-interest legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is a strong advocate of pro-business legal reforms. A White House
statement issued Tuesday described the bill as "an important step in
reforming class-action litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), would attempt to
steer most class-action lawsuits with plaintiffs and defendants from
different states into the federal court system if damages totaling $2
million or more are alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Exceptions would be made for cases that deal almost exclusively with
plaintiffs and defendants from one state.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also contained provisions that Republicans said would prevent
abuses in which lawyers earn enormous fees while plaintiffs get only
noncash benefits, such as coupons, from a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the bill would prevent lawyers from scouring the
country for venues favorable to plaintiffs to file their cases.</TE>
<TE>   "They can put their thumb on the scale of justice and skew the
results," said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach).</TE>
<TE>   But critics said the bill would overload an already crowded federal
court system and effectively deny plaintiffs the ability to pursue their
claims.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill is a bailout for corporate wrongdoers," said Rep. Alcee L.
Hastings (D-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   The bill was supported by 215 Republicans, 17 Democrats and one
independent.</TE>
<TE>   Among California's 52 House members, only two crossed party lines.
Reps. Calvin M. Dooley (D-Visalia) and Jane Harman (D-Venice) voted for
the measure.</TE>

<HD>'Don't Ask' Policy Decried as Gay Discharges on Rise</HD>
<DH>Military: Advocacy group says Pentagon rules foster anti-homosexual
harassment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The number of people expelled from the military for homosexuality
rose last year to the highest total since 1987, military figures show.</LD>
<LD>   The military dismissed 1,250 people last year for homosexual conduct
or for stating their homosexuality, up from 1,241 in 2000, according to
figures provided by the service branches to the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, an advocacy group.</LD>
<LD>   About one-sixth were from a Kentucky Army base where a soldier thought
to be gay was beaten to death in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Reports of anti-gay harassment increased 23%, from 871 in 2000 to
1,075 last year, the organization said in its annual report on the
Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.</TE>
<TE>   The policy, which took effect in 1994, allows gay men and lesbians to
serve as long as they keep their sexual orientation private and do not
engage in homosexual acts.</TE>
<TE>   "This policy undercuts the very liberties and freedoms our military
members fight to protect," the organization said. It contended the
Pentagon allows an anti-gay atmosphere to pervade its ranks by failing to
hold commanders accountable when harassment is reported.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon inspector general's report issued in 2000 said anti-gay
behavior was common. The Pentagon subsequently announced it was stepping
up training to try to eliminate such behavior and educate personnel about
the policy, but C. Dixon Osburn, the advocacy group's executive director,
said the military has made few changes.</TE>
<TE>   "When a problem continues to fester, things get worse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. James Cassella, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said
the Pentagon is conducting a survey to get a better handle on anti-gay
harassment. Meanwhile, he said, "we expect commanders at all levels to
exercise good judgment in implementing the policy in a manner that is
both fair and consistent."</TE>
<TE>   The Army led all branches in discharges with 616, up from 573 the
previous year. Of those, 222 came from Ft. Campbell, Ky. It was the
second consecutive year in which that base had more discharges than any
other facility.</TE>
<TE>   It was at that base in 1999 that Pfc. Barry Winchell, 21, was killed
by a fellow soldier who believed Winchell was gay.</TE>
<TE>   The report credits Maj. Gen. Richard A. Cody, who took over Ft.
Campbell in June 2000, with working to eliminate anti-gay harassment. But
the report said other officers at the post "perpetuate anti-gay attitudes
within their units by tolerating hateful anti-gay remarks."</TE>
<TE>   Master Sgt. Kelly Tyler, a Ft. Campbell spokeswoman, said soldiers on
the base are required to attend sensitivity classes. "I think Ft.
Campbell puts a special emphasis on it," Tyler said.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy followed the Army in the number of gay discharges last year
with 314, down from 358 in 2000. The Air Force was next with 191, up from
177, and the Marine Corps totaled 115, one more than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard, which is not part of the Defense Department but also
abides by the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, reported 14 discharges,
down from 19 in 2000.</TE>

<DL>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>A man accused of opening fire during a church service and killing a
priest and a 73-year-old parishioner had a "death list" of names in his
apartment, a prosecutor said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Troy, 34, an office clerk who took temporary jobs through an
employment agency, looked dazed as he appeared in Nassau District Court,
where he was ordered held without bail.</LD>
<LD>   He did not speak and did not enter a plea to two charges of
second-degree murder in the slayings of Father Lawrence Penzes, 50, and
Eileen Tosner at Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said charges may be upgraded to
first-degree murder, which would make Troy eligible for the death penalty
if he is convicted.</TE>
<TE>   He is also charged with attempted murder for allegedly lunging at an
officer with a steak knife and slicing his protective vest during his
arrest at a boarding house near the church.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not determined a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Troy is Roman Catholic but had no apparent connection to Our Lady of
Peace, said Lt. Dennis Farrell, chief of the Nassau police homicide
squad.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Tory had left a handwritten note titled "Lynbrook
Church Death List" inside his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "The list had a number of names on it," said Fred Klein, a Nassau
County assistant district attorney. Klein refused to disclose who was on
the list but noted that neither shooting victim was included.</TE>
<TE>   Troy had a history of psychiatric treatment, Klein said without
elaborating. In February 2001, Troy was expelled from the John Jay
College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan for "disciplinary problems,"
said Doreen Vinas, a spokeswoman for the school.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a .22-caliber rifle recovered at the church, Klein said a box
of ammunition was found inside Troy's car.</TE>
<TE>   Police credited parishioner Gerard Denk, a former Marine who served in
Vietnam, with helping prevent a greater tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   After watching Troy pace up and down the center aisle of the church
several times during Tuesday's 9 a.m. service, Denk got up to see what he
was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Troy pulled out the rifle and fired two shots, which, Farrell said,
police believe hit Penzes and Tosner.</TE>
<TE>   As Troy was firing, Denk tackled him, Farrell said. Three or four more
shots went off before Troy fled.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell said Denk and off-duty Lynbrook police Lt. Gary Knacke, who
was in the church, chased Troy to the boarding house where he rents a
room.</TE>

<HD>Pope Accepts Resignation of Florida Bishop Who Admitted Abusing Boy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II on Wednesday accepted the resignation of a
Florida bishop who admitted molesting a teenager more than two decades
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell, 63, of the diocese of Palm Beach,
announced his resignation Friday after admitting that he touched a former
student at a St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   The student, Christopher Dixon, now 40, said they touched
inappropriately in bed after he sought counseling from O'Connell in the
late 1970s. O'Connell was rector at the time.</LD>
<TE>   The Vatican's daily bulletin said the pope accepted the resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Father Seamus Murtagh was named by the Vatican to oversee the diocese
until a successor is selected by the pope, diocese spokesman Sam Barbaro
said. Murtagh had served as vicar general under O'Connell.</TE>
<TE>   The Palm Beach case came to light amid a major sex abuse scandal in
the Boston archdiocese, where a former priest, John J. Geoghan, has been
accused by 130 people of molesting them.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving a nine- to 10-year prison sentence for groping a
10-year-old boy, and faces another criminal trial.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Rating Slips Over Bid to Oust Parks</HD>
<DH>Times Poll: The mayor's standing drops among city residents,
especially blacks. Approval of the police chief is up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's decision to oppose a second term
for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has hurt his standing among city
residents, less than half of whom approve of Hahn's performance in the
first nine months of his administration, according to a new Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's footing is particularly precarious among African Americans, who
voted overwhelmingly to elect him last year and have said they feel
betrayed by his decision to go against the black police chief. Now 43%
disapprove of his performance, compared with 30% who say he is doing a
good job.</LD>
<LD>   Among all residents, Hahn's approval rating is 46%, tepid support for
a chief executive so early in his term. About a quarter disapprove of how
he is handling his job, and almost a third of those surveyed had no
opinion.</LD>
<TE>   Respondents who are unhappy with Hahn's performance most frequently
cite his opposition to Parks' reappointment as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   "He shouldn't have taken that kind of stand," said Tarzana resident
Carmen Schiavoni, 77, who was surveyed in the poll and agreed to a
follow-up interview. "He's the mayor; he should bring peace to the city.
He shouldn't come right out and embarrass the man."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the chief's approval rating is up significantly from a year
ago, with 51% of residents saying he has done a good job, giving him
slightly more support than the mayor who wants him ousted. The same
percentage support the chief's bid for reappointment, and he enjoys
increased support among blacks, whites and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department appears to have rebounded from the
Rampart scandal, with about two out of three residents saying they
approve of the department's job performance. Two years ago, as
revelations of police corruption emerged, the department's approval
rating fell to 36%. In the last decade the LAPD has typically enjoyed
high public approval, with ratings falling only during controversies such
as Rampart and the beating of Rodney G. King.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, which was conducted between March 9 and 12 under the
direction of Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus, surveyed the
opinions of 1,113 city residents, including 257 African Americans, and
has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's efforts to dislodge the chief, which he announced at the end of
January, seem to have overshadowed all other actions he has taken so far.</TE>
<TE>   Among supporters, there is little consensus about what Hahn has done
well. About four out of 10 give no reason for approving the mayor's
performance. The next-largest group say they like him because he tries
hard.</TE>
<TE>   But more than a quarter of all residents said they are less supportive
of the mayor because of his posture toward Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could show me some positive things Hahn has done since he
became mayor that would counteract what is seemingly a deceptive act,
then maybe things would balance out in his favor," said Cheyenne
Chambers, a secretary from the Wilshire district. "But I don't really see
him doing such positive things."</TE>
<TE>   The survey also demonstrates dissatisfaction in Hahn's base. African
Americans gave Hahn broad support during last year's election, helping
him beat former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, 54% to 46%.</TE>
<TE>   In that campaign, four out of five blacks cast ballots for Hahn, who
grew up in South Los Angeles and whose father, the late county Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn, represented the area for decades, according to Times exit
polls.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a quarter of blacks strongly disapprove of Hahn's performance,
and an additional fifth somewhat disapprove. About four out of 10 blacks
who voted for Hahn said they would not have done so if they had known he
was going to push to replace Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not happy with him," said Bernardine Kelom, 70, a retired
county employee who lives in West Los Angeles. "He just seems like a
different person than I thought he was. I thought he was going to be a
chip off his daddy's block, but he wasn't."</TE>
<TE>Chief's Approval Up Compared to Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Parks, meanwhile, is enjoying a surge in popularity. Residents today
are more inclined to look favorably on his record as chief than they were
a year ago, when he and the LAPD were embroiled in the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In the new survey, slightly more than half of residents approve of the
way Parks is handling his job, up from 37% in March 2001. The number of
people who disapprove of Parks has also fallen, from 37% to 28%.</TE>
<TE>   But there were also stark racial differences in responses to questions
about the chief. Parks' favorable showing among white respondents, for
example, fell just shy of the mayor's, 42% versus 49%. And 7% of whites
said they don't approve of Parks because he is black.</TE>
<TE>   By far the strongest support for the chief comes from African
Americans, who give him a 71% approval rating and 16% disapproval.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than half of the city's residents think Parks should be
reappointed, about three in 10 oppose him staying on and a fifth remain
undecided. But 81% of blacks support the chief's bid for a second term.
Among those, roughly two out of three African Americans strongly support
a second term for Parks--substantially more than the number who strongly
approve of the chief's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's tried to make some strategic changes, and I think change
is good," said Edward Broaddus, 35, an actor who lives in North
Hollywood. "The short amount of time we've given him hasn't been enough."</TE>
<TE>   Residents offered many specific reasons they think the chief is doing
a good job, crediting him with cleaning up the LAPD, lowering crime and
being a strong leader.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has often touted the LAPD's efforts to investigate the case of
violent, drug-dealing officers in the city's Rampart precincts, arguing
that under his leadership the department undertook reforms to address the
problems it revealed.</TE>
<TE>   But the survey indicated that some people still hold him responsible
for the corruption scandal. More than a fifth of poll respondents who
disapprove of Parks' tenure cited Rampart as a reason. The other top
reasons were low morale among police officers and bad management.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD fared somewhat better than its leader in the poll, suggesting
that the department's public image may be recovering somewhat from the
ugly controversies surrounding Rampart.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they approve of the way the LAPD
is handling its job, with 20% describing their approval as strong--the
highest percentage since the scandal broke in 1999. And the percentage of
all respondents who said they strongly disapprove of the LAPD's
performance is at its lowest level in two years--9% compared with 26% in
an April 2000 Times poll. Residents hold these opinions although 56% of
them believe racist feelings are common within the LAPD, down only
slightly from previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Zerkle, 44, an actor who lives in Reseda, said that under Parks,
"the department has done a good job of trying to maintain higher
visibility in the neighborhood. They are really trying to increase their
presence."</TE>
<TE>Hahn Seeks Political Gain, Respondents Say</TE>
<TE>   Though black respondents also gave the LAPD favorable ratings by a
slim majority--53%--that portion was the lowest of any ethnic group. And
the percentage of blacks who disapprove strongly of the LAPD's job
performance was 20%--more than three times the rate for whites.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40% of all residents said Hahn staked out his position on Parks
for political gain. But the poll demonstrated that the move has cost him
more support than he gained.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than a quarter of respondents said they are less
supportive of the mayor because of his decision about Parks, while only
10% said they are more supportive.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has lost an even larger share of support among blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of five blacks said they think Hahn gave the chief his
qualified support during the mayor's race to get their vote.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn has three years before he faces reelection to recover that
support. And several poll respondents said that though they are
disappointed in the mayor's actions, he has time to convince them that he
deserves their backing again.</TE>
<TE>   "He still has his good points," said Albertha Stevens, a medical
records librarian who lives on the Westside and says Hahn used Parks to
win support in the black community during the campaign. "I might vote for
him again."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos, who voted overwhelmingly for Villaraigosa in last year's
election, seem the most unperturbed by the dispute over whether to
reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Half of Latinos approve of Hahn, while 20% disapprove of him. Only a
small fraction of those who are unhappy with the mayor cite his
opposition to the chief as a factor.</TE>
<TE>   But Latinos, more than whites and blacks, are worried about crime in
their neighborhoods. About one-fifth said they feel very unsafe, and an
additional 15% said they feel fairly unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 75% of city residents said they feel safe in their
communities, down slightly from one year ago.</TE>
