<HD>Twisted tales of the wrapping-impaired</HD>
<DH>Haven't a clue what to do with ribbon and tape? Tips from a
gift-packaging contest finalist may help. Then again, maybe not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Cowherd</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the wrapping-impaired, the holiday season is a time of great
frustration.</LD>
<LD>   The wrapping-impaired are those of us -- yes, I have suffered with
the affliction for years -- who want to wrap presents neatly and
attractively, who yearn to make the flaps and creases and bows turn
out just so, but who, for various reasons, cannot make their fat
little fingers comply.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how much effort we put into wrapping a gift, what
results is a horrible, misshapen lump of torn paper and wilted ribbon
affixed with wads and wads of Scotch tape.</LD>
<TE>   Little wonder, then, that our cheeks burn with embarrassment when
someone holds up a gift we've labored over with scissors and paper
for hours and says, to much laughter: "Who wrapped this, a cornea
donor?"</TE>
<TE>   So we turned to Jodi Ceglia.</TE>
<TE>   Ceglia, 28, of Ellicott City, Md., is, by all accounts, an ace
gift-wrapper whose creativity amazes her family and friends, and who
was profiled last month in the Baltimore Sun. So I called her
recently for some tips, for a quick Idiot's Guide to Wrapping, if you
will. Ceglia is such a good wrapper, in fact, that in late November
she competed in something called the Scotch Brand Most Gifted Wrapper
Contest in New York.</TE>
<TE>   As you might imagine of a competition showcasing the best wrappers
in the country, the eight contestants were not exactly asked to wrap
ordinary, everyday gifts. In the first round, for instance, each
contestant was required to wrap a pair of boxing gloves.</TE>
<TE>   In the second round, they had to wrap a large telescope. And the
two finalists went on to wrap -- get this -- a child's jungle gym.</TE>
<TE>   Ceglia didn't win the $10,000 grand prize, but she made it into
the second round and took home $2,500, which, of course, makes her a
goddess to those of us who can barely wrap a shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, before getting to the tips, I felt compelled to ask Ceglia
about the gender issue in wrapping: the fact that the vast majority
of the wrapping-impaired are, well, men.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," said Ceglia, who is the graphics design manager for
the Community College of Baltimore County. "Although, there were
actually several males in the contest."</TE>
<TE>   Then she went on to tell me about her husband Bill's wrapping
abilities, which seemed to eerily parallel my own. "Oh, he's
horrible," Ceglia said. "There's tape everywhere. It looks like the
scissors just went haphazardly [off] on their own. There's no ribbon,
no bow, just a sticker."</TE>
<TE>   Listening to this, I have to admit I got a bit teary-eyed. Then it
was time for Ceglia's tips for wrapping, which she imparted in the
crisp tones of a football coach. "The absolute first thing," she
said, "is to be in the right frame of mind. You want to pick a time
when you're not rushed."</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, I figure the next time I won't be rushed is ... when
I'm dead. But can you wrap presents when you're dead?</TE>
<TE>   "Then," Ceglia continued, "you want to pick an area where you have
room," such as the kitchen or dining room table.</TE>
<TE>   Also, she said, "you don't want a place where the dog's jumping up
on the table and the kids are coming in and out."</TE>
<TE>   Got it. No dogs, no kids ... that'll only happen when I'm dead
too.</TE>
<TE>   The third thing is to always have good supplies. Ceglia mentioned
a good pair of scissors. And since so many of the wrapping-impaired
have trouble with tape -- is there anything more heart-rending than
watching a man claw frantically for the end of the tape with his
stubby little fingers? -- she suggested using pre-cut tape strips.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, we in the wrapping-impaired community must look
into our souls and acknowledge that all the time in the world and all
the space to wrap and all the best wrapping supplies can't make up
for the one basic flaw that has held us back all these years: a
complete and utter lack of talent.</TE>
<TE>   Admitting that is the first step toward healing.</TE>

<HD>At Wiltern, video saves a radio star</HD>
<DH>British DJ 'Oakey' re-creates album duets by projecting
vocalists' images on giant screen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Oakenfold's debut artist album, "Bunkka," is a variation on the
duets idea, with an eclectic array of vocalists, from Perry Farrell
to Tiff Lacey, taking their turn playing Gwen Stefani to Oakenfold's
Moby.</LD>
<LD>   Although that works fine in a studio, the British superstar DJ had
to address the challenge of how to re-create it live. Oakenfold, who
wrapped up his first tour with a band at the Wiltern on Saturday
night, settled on a giant video screen, projecting images of the
vocalists.</LD>
<LD>   After an hourlong DJ set, Oakenfold (a.k.a. Oakey), positioned
behind a low-rising wall of computers and keyboards, returned to the
stage. With guitarist/bassist Tim Hutton on the right, drummer John
Tonks on the left, and an Imax-size screen behind him, Oakenfold
opened with the new album's "Time of Your Life." The band raced
through the fast-paced dance beats while a larger-than-life Farrell
filled the screen.</LD>
<TE>   The video, if anything, was too compelling. During the first few
numbers, the images dominated. So much so that it was almost jarring
to look on stage and see live musicians. Thankfully, things turned
around early, due to a surprisingly compelling guest appearance by
Crazy Town's Shifty Shellshock. The hard rock singer/rapper belted
out the chorus to Oakenfold's current radio hit, "Ready Steady Go,"
then re-created his vocal turn on the jangly, warm "Starry-Eyed
Surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Hutton also handled vocals on a couple of tracks. That human
element seemed especially important, as it was a risky endeavor for
Oakenfold to tour without the actual singers.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he pulled it off, however, finding just the right mix
of man and digital man.</TE>

<HD>Was Couric's coup scored at a cost?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Bauder</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- The danger of the morning news show competition for
interviews was evident last week in the tears streaming down a
9-year-old boy's face.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after four boys drowned in Lawrence, Mass., after
plunging through thin ice on the Merrimack River, the "Today" show's
Katie Couric interviewed Jaycob Morales, 10, and Francis Spraus, 9,
the two boys fished out of the river alive on Dec. 14.</LD>
<LD>   After the talkative Morales was through, Couric addressed a
question to Spraus, who had tried unsuccessfully to hang on to a
7-year-old friend who died before his eyes. When the camera turned to
him, Spraus was sobbing. He could barely talk. Couric asked another
question.</LD>
<TE>   "It's OK," she said. "You don't have to. That's OK. But can you
describe at least what it is, what you felt like in the water,
Francis?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so hard for me," he replied. "It was cold, too. I thank
God that God gave me another life."</TE>
<TE>   The gut-wrenching interview was soon over. It was a competitive
coup for NBC's "Today" on a story its rivals also reported.</TE>
<TE>   But at what cost?</TE>
<TE>   Some people like to talk their way through a traumatic episode,
said Dr. David Fassler, a child psychiatrist affiliated with the
University of Vermont. But not always, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It can actually exacerbate the impact of a trauma to push kids to
tell their story or to encourage extensive contact with the media,"
Fassler said. "It can definitely make it worse. Kids need to work
through these experiences in their own way and at their own pace."</TE>
<TE>   Both ABC's "Good Morning America" and "The Early Show" on CBS
aired filmed reports about the tragedy that contained brief sound
bites from either Morales or Spraus.</TE>
<TE>   A freelance booker from "Good Morning America" made two inquiries
about interviews but backed off, said Shelley Ross, the show's
executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   "We put on the air what we wanted to put on the air," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes there's so much excitement in booking a big interview
that producers don't consider what they booked, said Michael Bass,
executive producer of "The Early Show" and a former high-level staff
member at "Today." CBS didn't pursue a live interview in this case.</TE>
<TE>   "The frenzy of the chase and the excitement of it sometimes clouds
your journalistic judgment," Bass said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Touchet, executive producer of "Today," acknowledged the
Merrimack River interview "was a really tough call." He doesn't
second-guess it because he believes Couric did a good job handling
the emotional situation. He said it was an important interview to
warn parents about the dangers of thin ice.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK, N. Y.</KH>
<HD>You dirty Rats! (Unions, however, love their vermin)</HD>
<DH>This is where the large intro goes, if needed. This is

<LD>There are rats and there are Rats.</LD>
<LD>   The little ones dominate New York streets, depending on the
mayor's pest control budget.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing stops the really big guys. Not even a kitchen knife.</LD>
<TE>   These menacing inflatable gray rodents, some as tall as 25 feet,
pop up in front of nonunion construction sites all over the city.
They're there to harass management. But with their angry pink eyes,
protruding white fangs and pointy claws poised for attack -- not to
mention the whirring of their portable air pumps -- these Rats can
annoy the whole neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Their appearance on city sidewalks was particularly fitting as New
Yorkers fretted over a potentially crippling subway and bus strike.
The strike was averted. But the Rats endure, unnerving reminders that
labor unrest is never more than one ultimatum away.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge we have as a union is to get people to care about
our issues," said Richard Weiss, spokesman for a council of
construction unions that employs almost a dozen gargantuan nylon
Rats. "Unless you're going to get up tomorrow and not have a bus or
subway to get to work, people do not have labor on their minds."</TE>
<TE>   After many years of declining membership, unions are on the
offensive again with grass-roots organizing and street-savvy Rats.
Weiss is nothing but honest about whom the Rats are trying to
attract. "You called, didn't you?" he said. "It's a lighthearted way
to bring to the public and media's attention to what's going on." He
also claimed the Rat has a 60% success rate, with contractors caving
and hiring union workers. Often this happens after another tenant --
say, a restaurant owner who doesn't need a Rat hogging the entrance
-- complains.</TE>
<TE>   The Rat certainly overtakes the sidewalks it inhabits for weeks on
end. From Fifth Avenue to Queens Boulevard, the inflatable rodent
population has grown so much that now as many as 100 are working the
region. The Rat even made an appearance on this season's "Sopranos,"
a theatrical brush with the mob that put Weiss momentarily on the
defensive. "That's not worth mentioning," he said, quickly turning
the conversation to two Rats stalking a high-rise on West 57th Street
just off Fifth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Williamson, an organizer for Local 79 Construction and
General Building Laborers, led chants there this week as the fanged
ones swayed in the cold winter wind:</TE>
<TE>   Williamson: "What do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   The shivering, shouting men: "Union."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson: "When do you want it?"</TE>
<TE>   The men: "Nowwwwww."</TE>
<TE>   They erupted in a chorus that sounded vaguely like the Santa down
the street in front of Tiffany's: "Hey hey, ho ho, Lefrak
Construction's gotta go."</TE>
<TE>   Lefrak, the owner and manager of 40 W. 57th St., where eight
floors are under renovation, has such a long history in New York real
estate that a Queens neighborhood is called Lefrak City. Williamson,
a native of Guyana, just can't get over this: "They own a city, man,
a whole city, and they can't pay their workers more than $10 for
pushing a broom?" In fact, the site's workers are mostly union
members. Only about a dozen are nonunion, mostly new immigrants being
paid off the books, the union insists. But that's enough, Williamson
said, to make Lefrak a rat, a traditional labor term for a bad
contractor. A Lefrak spokesman had this to say about the Rat and the
union's claims: "No comment."</TE>
<TE>   Tending a 15-foot Rat and guiding such protests is Williamson's
full-time salaried job. "It's a dream," he said. The union even paid
for him to attend organizing courses at AFL-CIO George Meany Center
outside Washington, D.C. "The union has given me such an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   After a day that usually begins at 6 a.m. and wraps up after
lunch, Williamson deflates his Rat (seven minutes up; two minutes
down), folds him into a big bag and stores him in the back of a Ford
Explorer. He has been known to inflate his Rat in front of his
mother's house in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. "She
loves it," Williamson said. "We're a union family."</TE>
<TE>   Local 79 owns five Rats, and each one comes with a union-owned SUV
and a minder like Williamson. Also available at a moment's notice is
a big van for impromptu protests like the one that occurred
Wednesday. The union decided to ratchet up the pressure on a
contractor at a YMCA in Queens. Rats all over the city left their
posts and converged on the Y. While they resist labels like Rat Pack
and Rat Patrol, they have that SWAT team swagger. "Sometimes we just
pile 15 guys in the van and fold up the Rat and, boom, we roll," said
Williamson, his eyes bright with enthusiasm. "New York is a union
city, and we mean business."</TE>
<TE>   The inventor of the Rat, however, hails from Chicago. He is Mike
O'Connor, president and founder of Big Sky Balloons and Searchlights.
He designed his first Rat in 1987 for a construction union in
Chicago. He admits his goal was to make it as mean looking as
possible. When the first one wasn't churlish enough, O'Connor went
back to the drawing board. Rodents now come in all sizes -- 6, 10,
12, 15, 20 feet tall and the King Rat, a 25-footer that costs $7,000
and is wheeled out only on special occasions. O'Connor has also
expanded to cockroaches, bulldogs and, recently, skunks.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed vigor of the labor movement has been great for sales
all over the country. O'Connor let slip that two very big Rats,
packed in a crate, are winging their way to Los Angeles, even as we
speak.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rats are still most closely identified with New York City
and its peculiar street life, taking their place alongside fur-draped
women swarming Madison Avenue and Senegalese salesmen hawking fake
designer pocketbooks on every corner of Manhattan. Still, it's kind
of shocking to encounter a monster Rat on your lunch hour.</TE>
<TE>   Terri Minsky, a successful television writer who splits her time
between New York and Los Angeles, said she had fantasies of pricking
the Rat that plagued her Upper West Side apartment building for
several months earlier this year. (Indeed, several Rat attacks with
knives and razors have been reported to the New York City Police.)</TE>
<TE>   Minsky insisted the Rat that filled the view from her living room
window "had none of the charms" of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
balloons -- never mind that her children were overheard singing the
union chant. Her Rat also came with a relentless team of
whistle-blowers who would sometimes awaken the neighborhood at 8 a.m.
Their beef, they said, was not with tenants like Minsky, but with the
landlord, who was not using union carpenters to add six new floors to
an old six-story building of rental apartments. But the tenants and
neighbors came to detest the goonish tactics, nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with the mayor expected to cut the rat-control budget by
almost a million dollars next year, a big stationary Rat full of hot
air, even one with its own whistle chorus, may be a lot easier to
live with than the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We live with vermin in New York all the time," said Minsky. "I
would 100 times rather see that Rat than a live one."</TE>

<HD>A queen who shaped era and image</HD>
<DH>The Huntington focuses on the legend of England's Elizabeth
I, a towering monarch and public relations genius.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The titian-haired queen could work a room better than Bill Clinton.
In truth, she could work an entire country.</LD>
<LD>   The day before Elizabeth I's coronation in 1558, she rode among
her people on her way to Westminster Abbey. Five years earlier, her
half-sister "Bloody Mary" had been crowned; that fierce Catholic
princess sat like a stone in her coach, her eyes fixed straight
ahead. But Elizabeth, the great Protestant hope of a nation bleeding
from religious strife, chose to share her obvious pleasure with the
crowd. She carried a sprig of rosemary given to her by a poor,
elderly woman. And when a young boy handed her an English Bible --
the Bible that Protestant martyrs had died for during Mary's brief
but brutal Catholic regime -- Elizabeth made sure that the people out
of earshot, in the back of the throng, understood her delight. She
took the Bible in her hands, kissed it, held it high above her for
everyone to see, then clasped it to her heart.</LD>
<LD>   It was a potent piece of nation-building theater.</LD>
<TE>   Not long afterward, the subjects of the new queen could buy an
inexpensive account of the procession in book form. A copy of that
16th century bestseller is among the dozens of eloquent objects by
and about Elizabeth I in an exhibition at the Huntington Library, Art
Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, through June 15.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Gloriana! The Golden Legend of Elizabeth I," the show
marks the 400th anniversary of Good Queen Bess' death on March 24,
1603. Gloriana was the name that poet Edmund Spenser gave his
Elizabeth-like Faerie Queen -- a 1590 first edition of his epic poem
is in the show.</TE>
<TE>   The show abounds with treasures that speak of Elizabeth and her
Age -- a letter putting off a suitor, signed with her distinctive
flourish, and another on that troublesome Mary, Queen of Scots; a
Nicholas Hilliard miniature portrait; Richard Hakluyt's account of
Sir Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the globe, which Elizabeth
blessed and helped finance; and the first printed edition of
Shakespeare's "The Merry Wives of Windsor," said to have been
commissioned by the queen, who called for a play about Falstaff in
love.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the show is drawn entirely from the Huntington's own
collection of Renaissance materials, most of it amassed during the
lifetime of founder Henry Huntington. The library's rare books,
manuscripts and other special collections attract more scholars in
the humanities to the Huntington than any other research institution
in the U.S., except the Library of Congress -- 1,800 annually,
according to Mary L. Robertson, its William A. Moffett chief curator
of manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, who did her doctoral dissertation at UCLA in Tudor
history, is the curator of "Gloriana." For all the research that has
been done on Elizabeth I, for all the continuing popular fascination,
Robertson realized that many people don't know that Elizabeth I was
one of history's great spinmeisters. "She is a genius at public
relations," says Robertson, who often speaks of Elizabeth as if she
were about to appear in the doorway, in farthingale and ropes of
pearls. "She understands the value of crafting and propagating an
image." And the image that she created is the one that persists
today, one of a handful of instantly identifiable historical faces.
Robertson recalls that she was organizing the show in the months
leading up to the 2000 presidential election, when Americans were
preoccupied with leadership and hyper-aware of how presentation of
self can boost, or destroy, a person who hopes to lead. Elizabeth
was, Robertson explains, a great conciliator, determined to bring
peace to her torn nation. She wanted a Protestant England, but not at
the cost of more lives. And so she did something that we think of as
both admirable and terribly modern -- she adopted a policy of
moderation and tolerance. She expected, indeed she commanded, her
subjects to conform publicly to the strictures of the Church of
England, but she didn't scrutinize too closely the beliefs they held
in their hearts.</TE>
<TE>   "Her line was that she didn't want to make windows into men's
souls," Robertson says.</TE>
<TE>   The printing press was transforming Elizabeth's Europe, and she
grasped how it could extend her reach and influence.</TE>
<TE>   Like her father, Henry VIII, Robertson says, "she uses the new
technology of cheap print." She had her royal proclamations and other
official statements printed and sent to every village, where they
served, Robertson says, "not necessarily as propaganda, but as an
opportunity to explain and justify."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson gives the example of Elizabeth's response to the 1601
rebellion led by the Earl of Essex, once her favorite. Within 48
hours, literate people throughout England could read the queen's
announcement that a revolt had taken place, that it had been put
down, and that her majesty was still in charge. For the queen's
subject reading such a broadside, Robertson says, "it's as if the
queen speaks directly to you."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not quite television, but it reaches a much larger audience
than would have been reached in the past by word of mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Her speeches were published and widely distributed as well.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a brilliant wordsmith," says Robertson. "Some of her
phrases are almost Churchillian." Like Henry's other children, she
had a fine humanist education. She read seven languages and could
give off-the-cuff speeches in Latin. "She has grown up reading the
great speeches of the world," says Robertson, explaining that
Elizabeth was steeped in classical rhetoric and knew its strategies
and power. She could move an audience to tears -- she still can, 400
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Among the speeches excerpted in the show is her famous address to
her troops in 1588, before she knew that the Armada had been
defeated. After saying she is ready to die in the dust with her men,
she says: "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I
have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too,
and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe
should dare to invade the borders of my realm...."</TE>
<TE>   As modern as Elizabeth was, Robertson doesn't buy the notion that
she was a feminist in our sense of the term. "The political world in
which she came to power simply did not believe a woman was capable of
ruling," the curator explains. "What she did believe was that there
were some exceptional women, and she was one of them."</TE>

<HD>To dream the improbable dream, and make it soar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A human being on foot is "five times more efficient than a rabbit,
twice as efficient as a dog, [and] almost as efficient as a horse."
Put that human being on a bicycle, and she or he is "3 times as
efficient as a horse, 25 times as efficient as a passenger train, and
50 times as efficient as a car with a single passenger." A buzzard
can coast effortlessly for hours on a thermal wave.</LD>
<LD>   These are just a few of the interesting points made by Paul Ciotti
in his book "More With Less." Connect the dots and what you've got
is, well, maybe something like aerodynamic engineer Paul MacCready's
Gossamer Albatross, the paperweight aircraft with bicycle pedals that
in 1979 became the first human-powered plane to traverse the English
Channel.</LD>
<LD>   Human beings have always dreamed of flying like birds, Ciotti
reminds us. If by flying, you mean simply traveling in an airplane
from one place to another, then that dream has been realized. But if
by flying, you mean soaring or gliding through the air with the wind
rushing against your skin, that is another matter entirely.</LD>
<TE>   It is probably not just a coincidence that many of the people who
have been exploring the possibilities of human-powered (as well as
solar-powered) flight live and work in California. Among the best
known is the visionary inventor and entrepreneur MacCready, the man
behind the Gossamer Albatross. Although Ciotti's sprightly and
intriguing book places MacCready at the center of the story, the book
also introduces us to an assortment of innovative, often colorful,
individuals who are involved in realizing this challenging, but by no
means impossible, dream: experts in analog electronics and
aerodynamics, engineers, sailplane pilots, mathematicians and
hang-gliding enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Take MacCready's contemporary Richard Miller, for instance, who
helped introduce hang-gliding to America. Unlike the conspicuously
successful MacCready, Miller has led a hand-to-mouth existence, like
that of an Eastern mystic. His book "Without Visible Means of
Support" described the art of building and flying your own hang
glider, but the title might also have described its author's life:
"I've never had money. I've never felt I was meant to have any," he
tells Ciotti. Now, in his late 70s, he continues to pursue the dream
of soaring, using the energy of the air itself, as birds do.</TE>
<TE>   "More With Less" also covers some of MacCready's other projects,
which have ranged from solar-powered automobiles, aircraft and
satellites to creating a working mechanical replica of a pterodactyl,
a giant flying reptile of the Mesozoic Era. "MacCready never doubted
that his team could make the model fly. 'Nature did it 60 million
years ago,' he liked to say. 'We should be able to do it too.' But
live [pterodactyls] had big brains ... and continuous active control,
not unlike a rider on a bicycle making continual small corrections.
There was no way the fairly simple electronics of the ... model could
match in sophistication the reflexes of a living creature...." The
model flew, but not very well. Enough, at any rate, to perform very
convincingly in the Smithsonian's Imax film "On the Wing." On a more
practical plane, the work that went into creating the solar-powered
Sunraycer for General Motors helped pave the way for electric and
hybrid automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Ciotti's approach is casual, almost haphazard, but there is method
to his modus operandi. He glides from topic to topic, touching down
on whatever seems interesting, whether it's the effects of the 1970s
oil shortages, the pluses and minuses of solar energy, early man's
prowess as a predator, the benefits of sweating, the engaging
personalities of turkey vultures or the mystery of how prehistoric
creatures like the pterodactyl ever managed to fly. He is able to
avoid many a journalistic cliche simply by reporting what he actually
sees and hears rather than what he expects to see and hear.</TE>
<TE>   MacCready, he finds, is not, as some other journalists have
portrayed him, "a whimsical soul walking around in a childlike state
of wonder," but a tough-minded, rather charmless character: quiet,
introverted, given to speaking in a monotone, often tactless and
tightfisted, but also single-minded, unpretentious, open to any
reasonable suggestion and (it almost goes without saying) able to
think outside the box: "He didn't insist that everything be done his
way; he wasn't frightened by people smarter than himself; and he
wasn't wedded to any one approach."</TE>
<TE>   Not a perfectionist or even much of a craftsman, MacCready, as
Ciotti shows us, has always preferred to go ahead and build
something, then iron out the mistakes later, subscribing to the credo
of another of his sometime colleagues, the extroverted, boisterous,
womanizing, daredevil pilot Jack Lambie: "If it's worth doing, it's
worth doing poorly." Unfortunately, this anti-perfectionist credo, so
liberating to explorers and inventors, is also evident in the way
that this book has been copy-edited. Typos abound: "wings" for
"winds," "aestheic" for "aesthetic" and "Los Vegas" for "Las Vegas,"
to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Ciotti's enthusiasm and his ability to convey it come
through loud and clear. His thought-provoking book not only pays
tribute to the individuals engaged in the ongoing search for energy
efficiency, but to the very idea of efficiency itself: "In a world
without constraints," he muses, "the need for efficiency vanishes,
and in many cases, so does beauty too."</TE>

<HD>Obsession's outcome: A film examining the nature of chance</HD>
<DH>'Intacto' was therapeutic for Spain's Juan Carlos
Fresnadillo, who witnessed a plane crash as a boy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sorina Diaconescu</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is said that filmmaking often is a form of therapy. In the case of
Spanish-born filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, it has been more like
an exorcism.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since he witnessed, as an impressionable 9-year-old, two jets
colliding on the runway in his hometown of Santa Cruz de Tenerife,
Fresnadillo has been consumed by a fascination with the intertwined
concepts of fate, life and death. As an adult, he collected anecdotes
about survivors of plane crashes, searched for stories about people
who were able to escape their fates at the last minute and poured
over Primo Levi's memoirs of Holocaust survival.</LD>
<LD>   "Luck is something that probably obsessed me in all my life," he
says in a phone interview from Manhattan, where he recently flew in
for a screening of his debut feature, the thriller-cum-fable
"Intacto." "So I decided to tell all my feelings about it in my first
movie."</LD>
<TE>   When Fresnadillo set out to make a therapeutic picture, he had no
inkling that his somber meditation on the metaphysical nature of
chance would garner major accolades in his native Spain and yield a
remake deal with a major Hollywood studio.</TE>
<TE>   The attention being paid to the film, opening today in limited
release, also illustrates the rising fortunes of Spanish-language
cinema in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Fresnadillo, 35, is only the latest addition to a crop of new
talents from Latin America and Spain whose brazen, confident work has
afforded them a gateway into American pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Spaniard Alejandro Amenabar made his English-language
debut with the acclaimed art-house horror pic "The Others," just as
his 1997 thriller "Abre Los Ojos" was being retooled as "Vanilla Sky"
with such A-list Hollywood players as Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe.
After spectacular artistic coups with "Amores Perros" and "Y Tu Mama
Tambien," Mexico's Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu and Alfonso Cuaron,
respectively, are now both directing their first big-budget Hollywood
productions (in Cuaron's case, no less than the third installment in
the Harry Potter chronicles).</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this renaissance? "We are probably making movies
with real feelings, with real characters, and I think the current
world situation demands that," Fresnadillo wagers.</TE>
<TE>   Even though in the grand scheme of Hollywood production, foreign
pictures still barely make a dent, their concepts and ideas
eventually seep in and invigorate the craft at large. "Mainstream
movies are really influenced by little movies," he says. "It has
always happened, but this time it is happening in particular with
Latin cinema -- it's great."</TE>
<TE>   Thriller and fairy tale</TE>
<TE>   In a contemporary context in which belief in religion and esoteric
ideologies is perhaps waning, "Intacto" proposes the intriguing,
almost medieval notion of random fortune as the determining factor of
one's destiny. Part thriller, part fairy tale, the film traces the
fates of a cabal of individuals united in their conviction that luck
itself, good and bad, is a tangible commodity to be won, hoarded,
lost, sold or teased out of unsuspecting victims. To find out who is
the richest, they compete against one another with ever more
audacious games of chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Intacto's" luck addicts share one common trait: They have emerged
unscathed from life-threatening circumstances -- plane crashes, car
accidents, bullfights -- and have developed a peculiar compulsion to
reenact their initial encounter with chance, daring their good
fortunes to carry them through each time.</TE>
<TE>   In the parlance of psychotherapists, the phenomenon is known as
survivor's guilt, and "Intacto," Fresnadillo says, is "a fable about
the strange ways in which people try to liberate themselves from that
crazy feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Fresnadillo recalls that "when we were doing research for the
film, we discovered amazing things, especially about Holocaust
survivors. There have been cases when those who survived
concentration camps didn't accept the idea that they lived while a
lot of other people, most probably all their loved ones, died. So
they risked their own lives on purpose, and in some strange cases,
they risked other people's lives too. That dark way to live your life
after a terrible experience obsessed me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Fortune and misfortune were also the twin concepts behind his
short film "Esposados" (Linked), a pitch-black burlesque comedy about
a hapless husband bent on offing his wife and collecting her jackpot
earnings to start a new life. On the strength of these 15 minutes of
material (nominated in 1997 for a live action short Oscar),
Fresnadillo was allowed a chance to direct his first feature-length
project.</TE>
<TE>   The film features the lunarscapes of Fresnadillo's homeland, an
archipelago off Morocco notable for its mix of touristy beaches and
eerie expanses of high desert. "The Canary Islands have a kind of
surreal landscape, and I think 'Intacto' is really inspired by that,"
the director explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Intacto's" denouement plays out in a series of stately tableaux
that alternate between light and shadow. As if in a dream, the pace
of action is slowed down, the mood infused with anxiety. "I thought
[a dream-like] ambience would be a good way to hypnotize the public
and to provoke reflection," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, the surrealist movement was a big inspiration,
particularly the work of painter and fellow Canarite Oscar Dominguez.
And, of course, other filmmakers; he cites as inspiration Orson
Wells, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick, Luis Bunuel -- "directors whose
signature is imprinted on every shot."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Alfred Hitchcock who bore the greatest impact on
Fresnadillo's decision to become a filmmaker. "When I was 16 years
old, I watched 'Notorious' and I realized that I want to tell stories
like that," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Fresnadillo says he can hardly believe that Disney bought the
rights to remake "Intacto" and is currently developing an
English-language version. "It's a really big honor that other people
were inspired by 'Intacto,' " he says. (Asked whether he will direct
the remake, he says: "No, no, no! All the things I needed to tell, I
already did.")</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to foresee the conceit of the film -- a subterranean
fellowship of extreme gamblers engaging in bizarre rituals -- evolve
into new, possibly more titillating directions. But the question
remains whether the philosophical wiring of the movie will survive
intact in the new version. Recent cinematic history is littered with
examples of visionary foreign thrillers that morphed into toothless
Hollywood counterparts -- "The Vanishing," "La Femme Nikita,"
"Vanilla Sky."</TE>
<TE>   Fresnadillo accedes diplomatically that there's generally "a fear
about remakes," but adds that he remains optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Should the new version fail, "maybe people will say, 'Oh, the
remake sucks, but you should see the original.' And if it's good,
'Intacto' will be recognized as the real inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win-win situation," he says with delight. "I love that!"</TE>

<HD>Ikea puts a paper chase in motion</HD>
<DH>It's OK. Tear off a piece of gift wrap from the wall. It's
a new marketing ploy designed to be "unboring."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Eastman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does this sound boring to you -- or unboring? Ikea is giving away
wrapping paper.</LD>
<LD>   While the value-minded might not think there is anything ho-hum
about that idea, the marketing department at the home furnishings
megastore is twisting the giveaway idea in a subtle (too subtle?) way
to underscore its "unboring" ad campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The gift paper is posted on vacant storefronts and sooty walkway
walls, sharing space with guerrilla handbills on streets that are
miles away from the company's sunshine yellow-and-blue buildings. If
you're interested, you'll have to find the paper displays on your
own. And do you know why? Because surprises are not boring.</LD>
<TE>   What is boring, we are told in the store's multimillion-dollar
marketing campaign, is holding on to old stuff that doesn't project
our personal style. The average American, says the company with
gritted teeth, will have five jobs, four homes, three dogs and fewer
than two dining room tables in a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Well, dull!</TE>
<TE>   Ikea's antidote: Your opportunity, in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
New York and Washington, D.C., to encounter one of its displays and
take away a sheet (or sheets) of the specially designed paper in one
of four styles -- thin vertical stripes in orange, mustard and pink
that cause flashbacks to Marcia Brady's crewneck tops; overlapping
pastel circles that look as if you're seeing the fuzzy-focused end of
a kaleidoscope; international flags shaped like people (think "It's a
Small World" without the gnawing music); and a swarm of bug-size red
and green human faces.</TE>
<TE>   On the street, Ikea's displays are arranged in 2-by-3-foot blocks;
the tablets of wrapping paper alternate with store ads that have a
close-up shot of a product, its price, the company logo and the words
"wrap unboring." Those are the minimalist instructions that marketing
whizzes hope communicate the holiday spirit: Give a gift and, since
you're cool enough to decode this, you get something for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   (For a thorough explanation of the campaign, you can read "The
Unboring Manifesto." There are 10 million copies inserted into
current issues of design magazines.)</TE>
<TE>   People who passed by the tablets near the Venice boardwalk during
lunchtime last week noticed the colorful sheets of paper flapping in
the wind. And then they kept on walking.</TE>
<TE>   The question: Did you know these sheets are free for the taking?</TE>
<TE>   The answer: Huh? How would I know that?</TE>
<TE>   After an explanation, one guy in a knit cap shook his head and
asked: "What decent, law-abiding citizen would think of ripping off a
poster?"</TE>
<TE>   Um. An unboring one who's read the manifesto?</TE>

<HD>Pasadena show has 'Peanuts' flavoring</HD>
<DH>A trio, led by pianist John Campbell, mixes Guaraldi's
cartoon tunes with Christmas music at Institute's season finale.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Special To The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Vince Guaraldi probably never imagined, when he received the
assignment in 1965 to compose the music for the first "Peanuts"
cartoons -- "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" followed by "A Charlie Brown
Christmas" -- that he would wind up creating some classic Christmas
music. But he did, producing tunes so durable that they have become
staples of the holiday season, with pianists George Winston and David
Benoit among their more visible interpreters.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night at Travis Auditorium in Pasadena, pianist John
Campbell offered his brightly enthusiastic Guaraldi renderings in the
final program of the Pasadena Jazz Institute's second season.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell, who spent a few years as accompanist to Mel Torme, led a
trio that also included bassist Bob Maize and drummer Colin Bailey, a
Guaraldi associate from the early '60s. In the first half of the
program Campbell applied his brisk, boppish style to a group of
familiar Christmas numbers -- "Winter Wonderland," "Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas" and (appropriately, since it was composed by
Torme) "The Christmas Song."</LD>
<TE>   After the intermission the music was all Guaraldi, embracing
"Peanuts" numbers such as "Oh, Good Grief," the lovely "Christmas
Time Is Here" and an item from a different holiday, "The Great
Pumpkin Waltz," as well as his non-"Peanuts" hit, "Cast Your Fate to
the Winds."</TE>
<TE>   Although Campbell's style, with its airy, open qualities, differed
from the rhythmic groove-orientation of Guaraldi, the spirit of the
music -- especially in the holiday numbers -- was the same, an
engaging expression of jazz at its communicative best.</TE>

<HD>The power option</HD>
<DH>An obscure contract clause is becoming a major force in
Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Horn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the screenwriter of the $200-million blockbuster "Rush Hour 2,"
Jeff Nathanson had directors salivating when his new script, "Catch
Me If You Can," started circulating around Hollywood. Among the first
filmmakers smitten by the con-man caper was Lasse Hallstrom. The
twice Oscar-nominated Swedish director was courted by DreamWorks and
started discussing the project with Leonardo DiCaprio, who starred in
Hallstrom's "What's Eating Gilbert Grape."</LD>
<LD>   It looked like a rare alignment of director, story and star -- and
perhaps Hallstrom's most commercial movie to date. But when "Catch Me
If You Can" opens in 2,900 theaters Christmas Day, the director with
the credit will not be Hallstrom but Steven Spielberg.</LD>
<LD>   The tale of how Hallstrom lost "Catch Me If You Can" reveals how
an obscure contract clause is reshaping show-business deal making,
sometimes ruining the very relationships it is supposed to cement.
Called an option, this contract term legally obligates actors and
directors to work in a number of subsequent films, often at
below-market rates, as a condition of employment in an initial movie.
Used for years with little acrimony to bind performers to sequels,
options are turning some contract talks into what look more like
hostage negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Although options are part of the ordinary (and largely hidden)
work of talent agents, producers and studio executives, the battles
over their enforcement are starting to shape the movies audiences
will -- and won't -- see. Paramount just exercised an option to force
Edward Norton to star in a movie he didn't want to make and,
according to DreamWorks, an option cost Hallstrom the "Catch Me If
You Can" job. Ever wonder why Ashton Kutcher ("Down to You," "Texas
Rangers," "Reindeer Games" and next year's "The Guest") seems to star
in nearly every other Miramax movie? It's because the studio had
several options on the young actor.</TE>
<TE>   Options have become such a critical bargaining chip that
Hollywood's most autonomous stars and producers are being dragged
into the fray. George Clooney says he had to surrender options on
himself and his production company to resolve a casting and budget
dispute in his directorial debut, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."
And an option on actress Kirsten Dunst will reunite two blood rivals,
British producer Working Title Films and Miramax, in the upcoming
Dunst film "Wimbledon."</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually every studio has options on people," says Jim Wiatt,
president of the William Morris Agency. "But generally speaking,
people have found a way to work them out so they don't become
abusive." Until now, that is.</TE>
<TE>   What might look abusive to outsiders is, from a studio's
perspective, an attempt to reclaim clout once held during the star
system's glory days. Dating from the silent era, the star system
required talent to sign long-term contracts with a single studio. By
signing a crop of performers to these lengthy deals, a studio could
not only exert more control over its stars but also limit their
salaries. But as studio power waned in the 1950s, actors turned into
free agents, jumping from back lot to back lot depending on where the
best material -- and paychecks -- resided.</TE>
<TE>   Today's option blitz, like almost everything else in show
business, is driven by money. In an era when $25-million actor
salaries are no longer unfathomable, options give studios a rare bit
of leverage, a reward for taking a chance on new talent and a
starting point in future negotiations. But if a studio implements
them aggressively, options can strain talent relationships to the
breaking point.</TE>
<TE>   Studio hired an attorney</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's fiercest options drama involved the Oscar-nominated
Norton, who last week completed filming Paramount's "The Italian
Job." Norton co-starred in the film only after Paramount hired
formidable lawyer Patricia Glaser to threaten that Paramount would
sue Norton if he didn't show up for work.</TE>
<TE>   The studio argued that Norton was duty-bound to act in the remake
of the Michael Caine crime drama because of an unfulfilled option
deal dating to Paramount's 1996 release "Primal Fear," which launched
Norton's movie career. The studio was obligated to pay him a mere
$75,000 for the follow-up film, but it renegotiated his fee to $1
million, still a fraction of the $9 million Norton now commands. All
the same, the "Italian Job" dispute has been so unpleasant that
Norton has told colleagues he will never work at Paramount again.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount says it was merely enforcing its contractual rights and
had given Norton repeated chances to make other movies, all of which
he turned down. If it had let Norton out of the deal, the studio
says, all its other options with other actors would have become
meaningless. "We felt we ultimately had to exercise the option," says
Rob Friedman, Paramount vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Just as options might force someone to work on a movie, in the
case of "Catch Me If You Can" they might also prevent employment. "We
approached Lasse Hallstrom, and he loved the picture," says Barry
Kemp, a "Catch Me If You Can" executive producer. "But Lasse had a
three-picture commitment with Miramax" and still owed the studio a
movie, Kemp says.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks says Miramax, which made Hallstrom's "Cider House
Rules," "Chocolat" and "The Shipping News," wanted to own half of
"Catch Me If You Can" in exchange for releasing Hallstrom from his
pact, even offering DreamWorks a share of some other Miramax movies
to sweeten the pot. "But DreamWorks was not going to take on a
partner, so Lasse had to drop out," Kemp says. Hallstrom's
representatives say he passed on making the film because of
scheduling problems and that he did not contractually owe Miramax a
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg then stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   In a business in which talent negotiations can stoop to shouting,
Miramax's has been by far the loudest voice in asking for -- and then
enforcing -- options. Thanks to an option Miramax held on its
"Shakespeare in Love" director John Madden, Miramax was able to
become a partner on "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" (which Madden
directed), a film developed by British producer Working Title.</TE>
<TE>   The production was contentious enough that Working Title vowed
never to work with Miramax again. So who owns a third of Working
Title's upcoming tennis movie "Wimbledon"? That's right: Miramax.</TE>
<TE>   The "Wimbledon" deal illustrates how options can reward a studio
that makes an early bet on young performers. When Miramax made the
2001 film "Get Over It," it asked that Dunst agree to star in at
least one more future Miramax movie. When Dunst was offered the
co-starring role in "Spider-Man," she had to promise Miramax yet
another movie so that she could be released to make the superhero
blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Studio's point of view</TE>
<TE>   Miramax says it uses options to help get actors jobs. When
discussing casting for a new movie, the studio says, it will often
first consider those people who owe the studio a movie. And even if
options lock in a raise for an actor's subsequent film, that
prenegotiated salary can often exceed what the performer would earn
on the open market, Miramax says.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Wimbledon," Miramax says Working Title asked
Miramax to use its Dunst option to resolve a scheduling conflict on
"Spider-Man 2." Working Title and Universal say Miramax's Dunst
option was more hindrance than help, but it did allow the filmmakers
to hire Dunst at a discount. She will earn $5 million for
"Wimbledon," less than what she might take home for another film, but
a huge raise from her option price of $750,000, according to
Universal. And when the movie is completed, she will no longer owe
Miramax anything, the studio says.</TE>
<TE>   Options have become vital in deals for franchise films, which can
generate countless sequels and spinoffs. Studio negotiators love
options because they help them reunite franchise film talent without
breaking the bank.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put a lot of money and promotion into a movie, you want to
make sure that in the next movie you can have your star," says Amir
Malin, whose Artisan Entertainment is now casting its action film
"The Punisher" and will ask the star to pledge at least one sequel
option. "It's really no different than a studio in the television
business locking up its cast from a series for a three-year deal. You
just don't want your budgets to get out of control."</TE>
<TE>   The price for not having options can be steep. When MGM made the
first "Legally Blonde" movie, it paid star Reese Witherspoon $2.5
million. Because she declined to make an option deal for a sequel,
the actress will pocket $15 million for "Legally Blonde 2." Sony's
"Men in Black II" was repeatedly postponed because the combined
salaries and profit participation of stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones, director Barry Sonnenfeld and producer Amblin Entertainment
made hammering out a cost-effective deal nearly impossible. That's
why Sony insisted on "Spider-Man" sequel options on both Maguire,
co-star Dunst and James Franco, who plays Parker's friend, Harry
Osborn.</TE>
<TE>   The entire lead cast of Fox's "X-Men" had to agree to make at
least one, and for some of the actors, at least two, sequels when
they were asked to star in the original 2000 film. When Alan Cumming
signed on to play Nightcrawler for next May's "X-Men" sequel he, too,
had to sign on for another movie.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy" getting "X-Men" actors such as Patrick Stewart
and Ian McKellen to commit to subsequent films, says Fox Chairman Tom
Rothman. "But I wanted to plan for success. We weren't just making a
movie. We were making an investment in cracking a genre." If a movie
becomes a huge smash, it doesn't always matter if you have a deal in
place. Just like the baseball slugger who wants to renegotiate his
deal after a career season, the star of a hit film will try to
renegotiate. Universal was obliged to pay Paul Walker $2 million for
a "Fast and the Furious" sequel but raised his paycheck to $7 million
to keep him happy and reward him for the hit performance of the first
film.</TE>
<TE>   Options have become so prevalent -- and, to some, so confusing --
that Disney recently drafted a list of guidelines it is considering
submitting to talent agencies. The draft memorandum defines the
actors from whom Disney expects two options (newcomers who have no
previous starring roles in television or film), one option (emerging
stars who have been featured prominently in a film or a TV show but
have some leading roles) and no options (established stars).</TE>
<TE>   With few credits outside of obscure plays, newcomers have little
leverage and are usually so eager to work that they don't mind
committing to a future of servitude. "If you're just starting out,
you're desperate and you'll do whatever you have to do," says
producer Jorge Saralegui.</TE>
<TE>   As actors become more popular, they can quickly rise above options
deals. When Disney cast the neophyte Anne Hathaway in the lead for
"The Princess Diaries," it insisted that she give the studio an
option on another film, and she agreed. (The studio is developing a
sequel to "Princess Diaries.") But when that film went on to gross
more than $100 million, Hathaway suddenly enjoyed much greater
bargaining power.</TE>
<TE>   So when Miramax asked the actress for an option when casting her
in "Ella Enchanted," she refused but was still cast. (Her co-star,
British beginner Hugh Dancy, didn't have that kind of clout and had
to promise the studio another film.)</TE>
<TE>   But superstar status doesn't eliminate worry about options.
First-time director Clooney was determined to cast Sam Rockwell
("Galaxy Quest," "Green Mile") as "Gong Show" host Chuck Barris in
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind." Miramax was fielding inquiries
from better-known stars who wanted the part.</TE>
<TE>   The studio relented on Clooney's choice only when Clooney gave
Miramax several options, he says. One called for Clooney to appear in
a cameo in a Miramax film and another gave Miramax an opportunity to
co-produce movies made with Clooney and partner Steven Soderbergh's
production company. (Clooney's publicist says Miramax later forgave
the options when he added Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore to his
"Confessions" cast.)</TE>
<TE>   As much as talent agents complain about them, not everyone hates
options. John Lee Hancock was willing to commit to two more Disney
options when, with no experience behind the camera, he was hired by
the studio to direct "The Rookie."</TE>
<TE>   The March release was a strong success, and Hancock soon became
one of the town's top script doctors, recently rewriting the Jerry
Bruckheimer movies "Bad Boys II" and "King Arthur."</TE>
<TE>   In the open market, Hancock can command as much as $3 million to
direct a movie. But because of his Disney option deal, he will earn
$900,000 to direct the studio's epic "The Alamo." "There's no doubt
that it's a one-sided deal," says Hancock.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there's no guarantee that you will get to make another
movie. But it is fair. They took a huge chance on me. And without
'The Rookie,' I would not be directing 'The Alamo.' "</TE>

<KH>TELEVISION / HOWARD ROSENBERG</KH>
<HD>CNN gears up the giddy machine for 'Person of the Year'
showcase</HD>
<DH>Television is peerless in the art of self-promotion.  That
ranges from CNN trumpeting as major news the annual "Person of the
Year" pick of its sister company, Time Magazine, to the Fox News
Channel regularly patting itself on the back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take the latter hypocrisy, with Fox news personnel commanded to
remind viewers relentlessly their employer is "fair and balanced." If
it were so, Fox would run companion rebuttals noting it is not "fair
and balanced." They would immediately follow claims by its anchors
that Fox is "fair and balanced." That would achieve true fairness and
balance, don't you think?</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of self-serving devices, though, nothing tops the Arts &amp;
Entertainment network's annual "Biography of the Year" award.</LD>
<LD>   Well, we are living in an epoch of gratuitous awards by the
kadzillions, the latest to join this crowd being the Video Game
Awards that cable's TNN plans to televise next year.</LD>
<TE>   But A&amp;E's award ranks with the loopiest.</TE>
<TE>   This year's "Biography of the Year" winner, touted in a recent
special that A&amp;E penciled into its schedule twice? George W. Bush.
Not the president as "American of the Year" or "Texan of the Year" or
even "Bush of the Year." Nope, "Biography of the Year."</TE>
<TE>   Say what? That would be like "Frida" director Julie Taymor
praising the late Frida Kahlo herself as 2002's movie "Biography of
the Year."</TE>
<TE>   How can someone of flesh and blood get tabbed "Biography of the
Year"? Easy, when it's a publicity device. Easy, when the main
purpose is not to honor that person but to celebrate the uneven,
often thin and perfunctory "Biography" series that has become A&amp;E's
signature program in the crowded universe of cable.</TE>
<TE>   And get this. A&amp;E says its top executives and series host Harry
Smith personally gave Bush his "Biography of the Year" goodies in a
ceremony at the White House. He must have been thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   Tied for second just behind Bush, by the way, were Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. If they
had won, would Smith and his bosses have jetted there for the
official handshakes? And what of the "Beltway sniper suspects" who
finished eighth in the A&amp;E voting, just ahead of Halle Berry and
Martha Stewart. Would the awards ritual have taken place in their
cells?</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;E's 8-year-old "Biography" award is a callow babe here. The
granddaddy of this group -- and the faux news event of the year -- is
Time's "Person of the Year." The 2002 announcement came Sunday, 75
years after its origin as Time "Man of the Year."</TE>
<TE>   Although made a national institution through sheer, knee-jerk
exposure in all U.S. media -- including this newspaper and others --
"Person of the Year" is nothing more than a shrewd marketing strategy
to sell the magazine and its ad space. It's almost uniquely specious
in our culture.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes CNN's giddy reporting of it -- don't forget Walter
Isaacson was Time managing editor before becoming chief executive of
CNN, and that both companies are owned by AOL Time Warner -- one of
the media's great synergistic charades.</TE>
<TE>   How giddy is that reporting? Last year, CNN took to the streets to
survey pedestrians about Time picking former New York Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani (who was also A&amp;E's "Biography of the Year" in 2001).</TE>
<TE>   This year, with corporate chauvinism again roaring through its
veins, CNN went further. On Sunday, it scheduled to run twice a
"special report" capturing Time's behind-the-scenes deliberations
inside the magazine's Rockefeller Center headquarters. As if this
were a papal succession and throngs had gathered outside to await
smoke from the chimney.</TE>
<TE>   The advance PR blurb: "CNN sits in with the editors of Time,
including the magazine's managing editor, Jim Kelly, and brings
viewers an exclusive look at who makes the final cut -- who doesn't
and why."</TE>
<TE>   Get out!</TE>
<TE>   This qualifies as news, only if you define news as anything that
happens, like paint peeling, skin wrinkling and the sun rising and
setting. In fact, a bunch of editors reaching consensus on who they
believe most affected news is not itself news. It's opinion, and
reporting it as news is another example of messengers making
themselves the message, in this case Time creating and distributing
its own story about itself with the generous assistance of its CNN
kin.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing for critics and columnists to create "best" and
"worst" lists for readers' diversion, quite another for someone to
give weight to those wee footnotes and opinions by inflating them
into hard news headlines.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't end quite there. Just as ABC's "World News Tonight"
used to squander a bit of its precious Friday news hole on silliness
titled "Person of the Week," CNN is copying Time these days by having
its "Connie Chung Tonight" program anoint a "Person of the Day."</TE>
<TE>   And given how fast news accelerates across the media landscape
these days, coming soon may be a Person of the Hour. If so, it will
be reported here first.</TE>
<TE>   Fair and balanced.</TE>

<LD>My best present ever was a snow globe. It was a birthday present from
my cousin. Inside the globe is water, snowflakes and the Statue of
Liberty surrounded by four American flags. The snow globe plays
music. It puts me to sleep at night. It is very special to me. It
reminds me of the people who died on Sept. 11. It makes me sad to
think of New York.</LD>

<TE>   The best gift I ever got was born on April 22, 2000. My baby
sister arrived at 12:38 p.m. I was the first one to see her after my
parents. I was really happy that she was born. I really wanted a
sister more than any toy or a brother or anything in the world! We
play all the time and I never get sick of her -- sometimes maybe. Her
name is Katia and she is so fun. She loves me and I love her too.</TE>

<TE>   My best present was a dog. Her name is Sadie. My parents gave her
to me. Sadie wasn't a present for any special occasion. Sadie was the
best present because I had been wanting a dog like her for two years.
I am an only child and I thought a dog would be good company. Sadie
is very playful. She runs around my backyard in circles until she
gets dizzy. Getting Sadie made me feel really, really great!</TE>

<HD>Santa's in the hot seat, squirming away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt or congenitally single
friend of the family, many adults face a thorny question during the
holiday season: How to sustain children's carefully constructed Santa
myths when they hover on the bittersweet cusp of disbelief?</LD>
<LD>   What exactly are the ethics here? On a recent rainy night, in an
impromptu interview at their faux gingerbread cottage at L.A.'s Grove
shopping center, the weekday Santa and his three assistants shared
their thoughts on how to navigate the diverse and idiosyncratic
belief systems of thousands of parents and children.</LD>
<LD>   They admitted the pressure is great: A careless comment could earn
the wrath of a parent or ruin a child's Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   "I just don't want to mess up what their parents are telling
them," said Joe Leavitt, an actor with a genuine white beard who has
played Santa for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   In an instant, he and his assistants must gauge the age and
sophistication of a child, as well as the investment of the parent in
the Santa myth. They begin with a few rules of thumb: By and large,
kids are safe in the realm of believers until about age 6. Then
things start to get hairy.</TE>
<TE>   "By 7 or 8 they are really starting to get suspicious," said
Leslie Murphy, Assistant No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "By 8 or 9 they are pretty clued in," added Wendi Firenza,
Assistant No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the assistants try to take their cues from the
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time the parents still want them to believe," said
No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   They debated who clings to the myth more fiercely. Perhaps for
parents, the end of Santa heralds the end of an age of innocence.
Children pick up on that and don't want to burst their parents'
bubble. But children "don't want to realize their belief system is a
hoax," said Santa.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant No. 1 said some savvy children keep saying they believe
long after they don't. Their childish artifice, she suggested, is
motivated by purely material concerns. "I think they're afraid that
if they stop believing, they won't get any gifts," she said. Many
children in the age of suspicion enter the cottage like pint-size
investigators. Their eyes scan the room and scrutinize Santa from
head to toe. They stand in line and fire their questions accusingly
at the assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Is he the real one? (Yes, look at his beard!)</TE>
<TE>   Where are Santa's reindeer?</TE>
<TE>   (Parked on top of the parking structure, of course!)Last weekend,
said Assistant No. 1, one child saw that Santa was wearing black
spats over his sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's the real Santa Claus, why is he wearing sneakers?" the
child demanded. Before the assistants could come up with an answer to
that one, the child's mother intervened.</TE>
<TE>   "You're wearing sneakers, aren't you?" the mother said. "It's hot.
He wears sneakers because it's California."</TE>
<TE>   The interrogation can continue with Santa. Some kids climb onto
his lap only to taunt him. To tell him they have seen Santas at other
malls. Why should they believe he is real? This Santa invites them to
pull on his beard for a reality check.</TE>
<TE>   Other children display adult obsessions, layered over Santa
mythologies. Santa recalled a 6-year-old girl who climbed onto his
lap and said to him: "I am worried about your cholesterol." She told
him he ate too much milk and cookies, and needed to eat more carrots.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the prepubescent disbelievers who are the real loose
cannons, Santa said. He recounted an incident last week when three
sassy 10- or 11-year-old girls marched in the back door of the
cottage and confronted him.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, there are like 100 Santas in town," one girl said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you are just an actor in a Santa suit," said another.</TE>
<TE>   "Take off your hat," demanded the third.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just trying to show me how sophisticated they were,"
Santa said good-naturedly. His assistants ushered the young skeptics
back out.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some children are so sweet and solicitous that Santa feels
as if he has the best job in the world. He said one little girl last
week made him a diorama of himself. She said she didn't know if he
was Jewish or not, so she made him a star of David too. She provided
a letter documenting how good she had been this year, and also wrote
a poem for Santa and Mrs. Santa. He promised to pass it along.</TE>
<TE>   In more dire situations, though, the assistants said their job
requires them to embrace a line of questionable moral integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of lying goes on here," said Joseph Sepulveda, Assistant
No. 3.</TE>

<HD>When death walks by</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Death walked down a busy street in Santa Monica a few days ago and
met Chuck Morrell coming the other way. It caught his gaze for a
moment and appeared as though it were about to speak, but then
vanished in silence and waited to claim its own. Morrell hasn't been
the same since.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred on Santa Monica Boulevard between 19th and
20th streets, just after the noon hour. Morrell, a glowingly healthy
68, had just come from a routine physical examination and was walking
toward his car on a day filled with sunshine. The exam had gone well.
All of his tests were normal. He was feeling good.</LD>
<LD>   Coming from the other direction was a stranger who appeared to be
about Morrell's age, striding along as though he hadn't a care in the
world. Morrell is the kind of guy who talks to everyone, and he
greeted the man with a friendly "hi" and a nod when they were about 5
feet apart. Instead of responding, the stranger fell silently to the
sidewalk.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no clutching his chest and no doubling over in pain the
way you'd expect a heart attack victim to react," Morrell said later,
still stunned by the event. "He just keeled over backward, like a
tree falling."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, Morrell thought it might be a joke, the act of a
street performer who would pop up again with his hat out, asking for
money. But listening to the gasping sounds of the man lying on the
sidewalk, he quickly realized it was real. Death was in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Using his cell phone, Morrell called 911 and a recorded voice told
him all the lines were busy. He was put on hold. Meanwhile, others
who had witnessed the incident came rushing over. A man from a nearby
office began administering CPR. Another ran to St. John's Hospital
just a block and a half away but was told that the matter had to be
handled through 911.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve minutes passed before an emergency operator responded and
the incident was reported. Paramedics, based just around the corner,
were there in less than two minutes. For much of the 12 minutes,
Morrell says, the man was alive and gasping. By the time help
arrived, he was in full cardiac arrest.</TE>
<TE>   It was Morrell's first encounter with sudden death. Days later, he
wanted to talk about two thoughts that kept trailing through his head
like drifters on a dark road. One was the abrupt realization of his
own mortality, the other his inability to reach 911 in time to
possibly save a stranger's life.</TE>
<TE>   "At my age, I know death can be around the corner," he said in
obvious anguish. "But you always figure there's a chance that if you
got help quickly enough, you could be saved. But now I know better."</TE>
<TE>   Not the kind of man who is haunted by life's misgivings, Morrell
still finds it difficult to come to grips with the nature of the 12
minutes that encompassed a stranger's final moments. "There was such
a feeling of helplessness," he said. "We were so close to everything!
So near to the hospital and so near to the paramedics. Had I only
been able to get through to 911 ... " He let the sentence trail off
into silence.</TE>
<TE>   There is indeed something wrong with the system. It's clogged.
Last year there were 7.2 million 911 calls made in California from
cellular phones alone, and nearly half of them had nothing to do with
real emergencies. Callers were reporting lost dogs or were asking for
directions or were complaining about being overcharged by cabdrivers
or wanted help with noisy neighbors or were just lonely and wanted
someone to talk to.</TE>
<TE>   Nuisance calls, more than simply irritants, can fill the minutes
that separate life from death. It is uncertain whether such a delay
was caused by unnecessary calls when Morrell was trying to get
through. But he can't help wondering, would that man, the stranger,
be alive had someone immediately answered his call?</TE>
<TE>   He thinks about it as he rises at 5:30 in the morning for a brisk
walk near his Palm Desert home. He had quit taking walks for a while,
but he's back at it again, after that terrible incident on Santa
Monica Boulevard. And he's back practicing yoga too.</TE>
<TE>   The man who died on that city street was 82. Death is never far
away in one's eighth decade of life, and going quickly isn't that
bad. The poet Alfred Lord Tennyson said it gently: "God's finger
touched him and he slept." No heavy pain, no long goodbyes.</TE>
<TE>   But witnessing unexpected death is something else. I suspect that
for years, Chuck Morrell will see the look on the dying man's face
and wonder at the words that were never said. And he will similarly
always hear the ticking of a 12-minute clock and ponder the existence
of a stranger's life within the embrace of its passing seconds.</TE>

<HD>Disney follows a formula, supersizes 'The Lion King'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Disney has found yet another lucrative way to breathe box office life
into its classic animated titles: large-format cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Last holiday season, Disney debuted a special edition of its 1991
"Beauty and the Beast" -- the only animated film to be nominated for
a best picture Oscar -- at Imax theaters internationally, complete
with a new animated sequence and digital enhancement. The
large-format version took in more than $25 million during its
four-month run.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Day, Disney unveils its large-format edition of "The
Lion King." The 1994 release is the most successful animated film,
grossing $771 million worldwide. And like "Beauty and the Beast,"
"Lion King" was transformed into a long-running, Tony Award-winning
musical.</LD>
<TE>   "Lion King" director Rob Minkoff says the Imax version of the film
"is the best presentation of the movie I've ever seen. What's great
about turning an animated movie into Imax format is that the digital
record of the shots still exist. So when you are printing on the
large-format frame, you actually don't lose any quality, as you would
do in a live-action movie." Because Minkoff was busy working on
"Stuart Little 2," he wasn't available to help supervise the
reformatting of "Lion King," though he worked on other aspects of the
project. But he had no complaints when he saw the finished product.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing was actually to get back in and do the remix of
the sound," he said. "In the Imax format, the theaters have a
different sound system, so the balance had to be changed for
everything. Hearing it in that format is just unbelievable. Things
like the wildebeest stampede are pretty breathtaking."</TE>

<HD>New 'Rings' towers over the competition</HD>
<DH>Fantasy film rakes in $101.5 million in five days. 'Gangs
of New York' struggles to find an audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" ruled the box office this
weekend, raking in $101.5 million in five days, while the expensive
historical epic "Gangs of New York" struggled against the stiff
competition to bring in an estimated $9.1 million since its opening
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The Two Towers" grossed 33% more than the 2001 opening of Peter
Jackson's first part of the trilogy, "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring," becoming the biggest December opening of any
movie. New Line Cinema released the film internationally on the same
date as the U.S. opening and saw a 25% increase from last year on a
worldwide basis. The three-day U.S. tally for Friday-Sunday was an
estimated $61.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Impressive as it was, the film was no match for this summer's
"Spider-Man," which grossed $114 million in its first three days, and
last year's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," which brought in
$90.3 million over its opening weekend.</LD>
<TE>   New Line executives asserted that "The Two Towers" is in good
shape for the coming week, with the film playing strongly to all four
so-called demographic quadrants. It brought in a slightly more male
audience, 55%, but also drew a large 45% of female moviegoers. It
brought in the expected under-25 crowd but also lured in a large
number of people over age 25.</TE>
<TE>   Rolf Mittweg, president of worldwide marketing for New Line
Cinema, said the studio had made a concerted effort to attract a
larger share of the female under-25 crowd, which did not turn out as
strongly for "The Fellowship of the Ring." Mittweg said a targeted
young-female marketing campaign on MTV and other TV outlets focused
on the insinuation of a love triangle between Viggo Mortensen's
Aragorn, Liv Tyler's Arwen and Eowyn, a new character played by
Miranda Otto.</TE>
<TE>   The "Lord of the Rings" tidal wave nearly sank "Gangs," which
despite a riot of media attention came in fourth behind new and
returning romantic comedies. The Sandra Bullock/Hugh Grant vehicle
"Two Weeks Notice" debuted with an impressive $14.4 million, and
Jennifer Lopez's "Maid in Manhattan" brought in $11 million in its
second weekend for a 10-day total of $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax executives maintained a positive spin on the opening of
"Gangs of New York," but many industry observers said it was a
disappointment. The film, which was supposed to open last holiday
season, has weathered bad publicity that included feuds between
director Martin Scorsese and Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, as
well as a spat with DreamWorks over Miramax's initial plan to open
the picture Dec. 25 against DreamWork's "Catch Me If You Can"; both
films feature Leonardo DiCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Gangs" garnered five Golden Globe nominations last week,
its critical reception has been mixed. Scorsese's career, which
includes such classics as "Raging Bull" and "GoodFellas," is
ultimately judged by his filmmaking abilities and not his box office
muscle.</TE>
<TE>   However, the numbers matter mightily to Miramax, the movie's
distributor and co-financier. It is the company's most expensive film
to date, and for the studio to recoup its investment, "Gangs" must
gross at least $55 million domestically. The nearly $100 million
budget was cobbled together with $65 million from Graham King's
Initial Entertainment Group for international rights and $32 million
that was split between Miramax and its parent company, Disney, which
will also share cost of the roughly $35 million domestic marketing
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax Films has been among the most successful acquisitions for
the Walt Disney Co., which bought the specialty film distributor in
1993. Miramax has contributed a relatively small, but not
insignificant, amount to Disney's bottom line, with such art-house
films as "Chocolat" and "Shakespeare in Love," as well as the more
lucrative teen-oriented horror movies, with such titles as the
"Scream" trilogy and "Scary Movie" spoofs produced by its Dimension
label.</TE>
<TE>   As the corporate parent of Miramax, Disney would be forced under
new accounting rules to take a write-down if "Gangs" tanks at the box
office, but the financial toll would be small in comparison to the
recently released animated film "Treasure Planet," for which Disney
has projected a pre-tax loss of $74 million. That's because "Treasure
Planet" was financed entirely by Disney, whereas Disney and Miramax
created a cushion by selling the international rights to "Gangs" to
Initial Entertainment Group.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax executives played it somewhat cautious, opening "Gangs" on
only 1,500 screens nationwide, and its per-theater average of just
over $6,000 was respectable. They are counting on the film's business
to grow in the week ahead and will expand it by 500 screens on
Christmas Day. "After the 25th [of December], a lot of our audience
becomes available," said Rick Sands, chief operating officer of
Miramax. "People are going to be sampling the film until February. We
believe in the word of mouth of this picture."</TE>
<TE>   However, it will take a lot for the violent, nearly three-hour
epic to rise above the glut of product coming out this week, which
traditionally is the largest-grossing seven-day period of the year.
It remains to be seen whether the film will have the legs --
particularly in the heartland -- to carry into January or February.
"Now, they will see if they can spread the word and if it catches
fire," said Dan Marks, president of the Nielsen EDI box-office
tracking firm. "It's a crowded marketplace, and you have to
distinguish yourself .... There was some good word of mouth on the
acting, but there is certainly some negative on the amount of
violence."</TE>
<TE>   In other releases this weekend, Fox Searchlight's "Antwone Fisher"
grossed $217,500 on 15 screens for a strong average of $14,500 per
screen. Paramount's "The Wild Thornberrys Movie" got off to a decent
start, coming in sixth with an estimated $6.1 million. The Ray
Liotta/Jason Patric undercover cop drama "Narc" performed well on six
screens, grossing $66,000.</TE>
<TE>   But Paramount's "Star Trek: Nemesis" suffered a brutal setback,
coming in only five days before the opening of "The Lord of the
Rings." "Nemesis," which competes for the same demographic, dropped a
whopping 76% from its debut last weekend, grossing $4.4 million for a
10-day total of $26.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Norton's intense drama "25th Hour" opened in only five
theaters to a respectable $109,811 per theater.</TE>
<TE>   The total for all films was an estimated $148 million, compared
with $140 million last year, an increase of 5.7%. The box office is
still on track to be 12% ahead of last year by the end of this year,
according to Nielsen EDI.</TE>

<HD>A stocking stuffed with R&amp;B treats</HD>
<DH>Stevie Wonder's House Full of Toys concert collects for the
needy while showcasing a wide range of notable talent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stevie Wonder's seventh annual House Full of Toys benefit concert at
the Forum on Saturday offered a holiday sampler of favorite R&amp;B acts,
including veterans Luther Vandross and Teena Marie, hip-hoppers Nelly
and Wyclef Jean, and modern romantic soul duo K-Ci &amp; JoJo.</LD>
<LD>   More than 18 acts represented styles from hip-hop to gospel,
providing the predominantly black audience an opportunity to
celebrate many different bright lights.  The show had a moral leg up
on some seasonal spectaculars, since its purpose was to collect toys
for needy kids rather than to glorify the sponsors or participants.
Yet the emphasis on genuine talent was clear, with even marginal
artists displaying a level of craft and musicianship not always
evident in modern pop.</LD>
<LD>   Although the mood ranged from sanctified to sexual, Wonder set a
general tone of peace and transcendence as the nearly five-hour show
began. Invoking Martin Luther King Jr., Wonder reminded the packed
house that "we should do right by each other, and judge each other
not by the color of our skin." Then he obliquely referenced the
recent controversy over Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, who stepped down
last week as Republican majority leader after making what many
considered racist remarks at Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday
party.</LD>
<TE>   Ol' Trent took more direct hits from host comedian Jamie Foxx,
whose between-act riffing made more bearable the inevitable delays,
occasionally fitful pacing and long running time.  Indeed, the
pitfalls were mostly offset by a welcome spontaneity that allowed for
Wonder to play harmonica and sing with soul crooner Deborah Cox, lend
vocals to gospel-R&amp;B duo Mary Mary's rendition of his "You Will
Know," and perform an electrifyingly percussive, unrehearsed
give-and-take with tap dancer Savion Glover.</TE>
<TE>   Other surprises included a brief inspirational speech by Jesse
Jackson, a quick word of thanks from WNBA star Lisa Leslie, and the
pairing of Wonder and young hip-hop soul star India.Arie during his
show-closing set. Another unexpected highlight was the giddy
impromptu reunion of K-Ci &amp; JoJo with their former partners in vocal
quartet Jodeci, brothers Donald and Dalvin DeGrate.</TE>
<TE>   Saxophonists Boney James and Mike Phillips represented the
evening's wide array of approaches and sensibilities. Old favorite
James evoked a classic romantic moment with a take on Bill Withers'
melancholy "Ain't No Sunshine," while Phillips, a label mate of
alternative hip-hop favorite Jill Scott, offered a more avant-garde
turn and a conscious message.</TE>
<TE>   The vintage acts proved hard to beat, as Vandross' silky romantic
ballads evoked plenty of screams and Marie offered a dramatic
performance that started in the audience and ended on stage with a
blazing take on her old hit "Square Biz."</TE>
<TE>   But the vocal trio NEXT also revved up the energy with an early
set of funky hip-hop and sweet ballads, and Nelly fired up the crowd
with his current hit "Hot in Herre."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran duo Chante Moore and Kenny Lattimore also emphasized
romance with a smooth slow jam, while young Heather Headley sang of
love's uncertainty with polish, if not much spark. Reminding folks
that "Jesus is the reason for this season," gospel singers Judith
McAllister and Donnie McClurkin brought in the church with their
respective choirs.</TE>
<TE>   Other inspirational notes came from vocal octet Sounds of
Blackness.</TE>

<HD>Karaoke lawsuits pending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karaoke is a lot like the weather -- plenty of people complain but no
one does anything about it. Well, almost no one. Nashville attorney
Linda Edell Howard has long championed the causes of songwriters, and
in recent years that has pitted her against the karaoke powers, whom
she says show rampant and casual disregard for songwriter rights.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the heat Howard has aimed at the sing-along industry
will go up a few notches.</LD>
<LD>   Two major record labels, Universal Music and Zomba, are preparing
to file lawsuits, and Howard is also hopeful that a federal judge in
Nashville will rule on a motion for a summary judgment in the first
lawsuit by an individual songwriter against karaoke companies. That
$3.5-million suit is on behalf of Howard's client Kristyn Osbourne, a
songwriter and member of country-pop group SHeDAISY.</LD>
<TE>   It's meant "to be an educational lawsuit," says Howard, who makes
no bones about her desire to teach karaoke companies a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   The crux of all the cases: the permission and payment due
songwriters as the karaoke follows the bouncing ball in a business
valued, by some estimates, at $25 billion worldwide annually.</TE>
<TE>   Karaoke companies churn out CDs with versions of hit songs that
are either instrumental or feature a sound-alike on vocals, and those
tracks are played in clubs, saloons and homes as backing for amateur
singers. The problem, Howard argues, is that many companies don't
bother to pay for the composition or the display or reprinting of
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the matter of permission. Artists such as Van
Morrison, Sheryl Crow and Linkin Park, for instance, have taken a
steadfast stand against any of their songs being used, but their
wishes are widely ignored, Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   "The good companies that do pay royalties charge $15.99 [for the
karaoke CDs] and then the bad companies undercut them at $7.99,"
Howard said. "The bad companies also say, 'Oh well, too bad,' when
songwriters say they don't want their music taken away. The good
companies want a level playing field. And the songwriters deserve
their due."</TE>

<HD>A star is born in boxers</HD>
<DH>Vaughn Lowery put on red skivvies and danced himself to
fame in a Kmart ad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the season's hottest toy, latest must-see movie and anything
J. Lo. The holiday buzz is all about the muscular, merrymaking,
practically nude dude who coyly dances his way out of a silvery gift
box -- worn around his hips--to reveal red boxer shorts trimmed in
faux fur.</LD>
<LD>   Doing the skivvy shimmy is Vaughn Lowery, 28, the star of a Kmart
commercial for Joe Boxer shorts. Not since Tom Cruise danced around
in his shorts in "Risky Business" has such a brief encounter captured
-- and endeared -- an audience.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a saucy commercial, but it's also funny," says Lowery of
the spot called "Unwrapped," which started airing in mid-December and
this week moves into movie theaters. Another holiday take, called
"Antler Boogie," has Lowery with his hands on his head playfully
impersonating a reindeer as he hoofs it up with four women.</LD>
<TE>   Both commercials have become so popular that Kmart recently
launched an online free e-mailable greeting card service on its Web
site (www.Kmart. com). There fans can dress Lowery in
different-colored boxers and view the commercials. Not sure how to do
the dance? Lowery says the boxer-boogie action goes like this: Bounce
in place, pretend to jump rope, make puppy faces and end with a
victory dance.</TE>
<TE>   The gig was just the break Lowery, who has a degree in labor
relations from Cornell University, was hoping for when he moved to
Los Angeles from Detroit two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I say? I'm just so very thankful," Lowery says about his
sonic rise in undershorts. It started this summer when Lowery
auditioned for a Boxer commercial and twice read from a script.</TE>
<TE>   On his third try, he threw caution to the wind, dropped his
trousers to reveal his Joe Boxers, and launched into his now
almost-famous dance.</TE>
<TE>   "He did his thing and everyone in the room just died laughing. It
was forget the lines but keep the dance," says Abigail Jacobs, Kmart
spokeswoman. The script was indeed dropped and a spot featuring
Lowery was created by TBWA/Chiat/Day, the advertising agency in New
York that has the Joe Boxer account.</TE>
<TE>   Those spots ran in summer, then came Lowery's holiday spots and
his star turn.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Boxer founder Nicholas Graham says Lowery's personality is a
perfect match for the company's product. "He's hysterical and fun and
goofy and everything that Joe Boxer is all about," says Graham.
"We're getting hundreds of e-mails a day about Vaughn," he says,
adding the company has reshipped orders of all its Santa and reindeer
boxer shorts to Kmarts. "That's it. No more, just what's in stores."</TE>
<TE>   If shoppers find themselves boxer-less, they can still be a part
of the holiday hoopla.</TE>
<TE>   The company's Web site (www.joe boxer.com) welcomes versions of
Lowery's feverish routine from fans; many have e-mailed their own and
can be viewed on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn, who is reveling in his boxer-boogie mass appeal, isn't
sure yet what his next gig will be -- but he wants to act full time,
and Hollywood has taken notice. "I don't want this to end. But I'm
very focused about what I want out of this business, which is
success," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For now, that comes in making people laugh, and in understanding
just why the spots have been such a hit: "We all know that everybody
does that underwear dance at home in the front of the mirror."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria and Alfonso were spending a few days with Uncle Ruben in the
snowy landscape of the San Bernardino Mountains where he worked as a
nature guide and caretaker.</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben noticed that Maria and Alfonso had been sitting in
front of the large fire in the main lodge for quite a while after
breakfast. They looked bored.</LD>
<LD>   "Put on your boots and coats," he said. "We're going exploring."</LD>
<TE>   It was cold outside, and there was a thick layer of snow on the
ground. The children quickly dressed and were soon headed out the
door.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to explore?" Alfonso excitedly asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at winter in the woods," said Uncle Ruben
with a smile. "You never know what you might see out here."</TE>
<TE>   After they walked for a short while, Uncle Ruben instructed the
children to look at a tree. "Can you tell me what you see there?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like someone scratched the bark," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, there are hairs there too!" yelled Maria.</TE>
<TE>   Both children looked more closely now.</TE>
<TE>   "Smell it," said Uncle Ruben. The children cautiously touched
their noses to the bark.</TE>
<TE>   "It stinks!" said Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it smells good, sorta like our dog," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "A bear rubbed there," said Uncle Ruben. "But it was here maybe a
month ago. You don't see any bear tracks, do you?"</TE>
<TE>   The children quickly looked around in the snow, and shook their
heads no.</TE>
<TE>   "The bear is probably hibernating somewhere now," added Uncle
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   They walked some more. Now the children were looking more
carefully at the trees and the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, what's that?" asked Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   There were a series of very small hand-like prints in the snow
followed by a large mark, as if something had rolled around. Then
there were no more tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "What do think happened here?" Uncle Ruben asked the children.</TE>
<TE>   "Some little animal was walking, and then something happened,"
volunteered Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a little ground squirrel," explained Uncle Ruben,
pointing to the tracks. "It appears that a large bird -- probably a
hawk -- swooped down and grabbed the squirrel, right here. See where
its lower wing brushed the snow?" The children studied the mark with
fascination.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor squirrel!" the children said together.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way of nature," responded Uncle Ruben. "Animals eat
other animals. But look up ahead." He pointed about 15 feet away, to
a depression in the snow and a series of tiny footprints leading
away. "The squirrel got away. The hawk must have lost its grip."</TE>
<TE>   "Hurray!" said both children.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben just smiled.</TE>

<HD>From the off-kilter, the sublime</HD>
<DH>Thwarted expectations make Berlioz's Christmas story glow,
with help from the Chorale, Philharmonic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a perfect visual complement to Berlioz's "L'Enfance du Christ" --
the Los Angeles Philharmonic's marvelous Christmas present to its
listeners this year -- the stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was
a little off Friday afternoon. A festive row of wreaths was set at
the foot of the orchestra, but it wasn't even. With a harp in the
way, one wreath was plopped down lower than the others.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, Berlioz's slightly screwy oratorio is a series of
tableaux -- each a telling, almost cinematic scene from the childhood
of Christ -- that doesn't quite line up. And it is in the not quite
lining up, the almost constant thwarting of expectations, that the
Christmas story glows with a halcyon sublimity perhaps unique in all
of music.</LD>
<LD>   The first thwarted expectation is that there is very little divine
in this "sacred trilogy." The oratorio is divided into "Herod's
Dream," "The Flight Into Egypt" and "The Arrival at Sais." At the
beginning, a narrator singing in chant-like declamation tells us only
that a newborn Jesus lies in his manger, not yet singled out by
heaven. At the end of the oratorio, the narrator returns, again with
but little inflection, to tell that the child, when grown, will open
a path of salvation.</LD>
<TE>   In between, with Jesus as a gentle prop and the help of the
occasional hovering angel, Berlioz searches for the source of simple
human goodness. Herod's tyranny is a perversion of his own inner
desire for the peace denied kings. Joseph and Mary are less anointed
guardians than typical loving, anxious parents.</TE>
<TE>   The warmest, most giving music of all is that of the Ishmaelite
father who shows hospitality to the holy family. The Ishmaelites'
stress-reducer is a little light music from a pair of flutes and a
harp. And rather than any biblical miracle, it is this gorgeous
diversion near the oratorio's end, this touching, modest moment of
familial peace, that leads to one of the most beatific choruses in
all music.</TE>
<TE>   This is strange, beautiful music, full of quirky sonorities, and
the Philharmonic's playing under Esa-Pekka Salonen was well
controlled, sometimes exquisite. It is a piece that Salonen still
needs to grow into; his approach was straight-ahead, shapely and,
when appropriate, dramatic, but not yet personal. The instrumental
trio was sumptuously played by flutists Anne Diener Zentner and
Catherine Ransom and harpist Lou Anne Neill.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Master Chorale did nearly everything right. It
doesn't have that nasal French sound that gives Berlioz's vocal music
its pungency, but the sheer mystical ardor of it singing in the quiet
a cappella closing chorus was heart-stopping.</TE>
<TE>   The vocal soloists were a slightly off-kilter quartet but
effective. Tenor Vinson Cole's operatic approach to the narrator's
chant-like lines proved surprisingly moving. Next to the outstanding,
elegant baritone, Gilles Cachemaille, who was Herod and the
Ishmaelite father, the mezzo-soprano Susanne Mentzer and baritone
Nmon Ford could not help but seem overwrought as Mary and Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   Next December will be Berlioz's 200th birthday, and the
Philharmonic will be celebrating the Berlioz bicentennial extensively
when it moves into the Walt Disney Concert Hall next season. Given
how well this "L'Enfance du Christ" sonically illuminated the
acoustically dull old Pavilion, the stage is well set. I even hope
the skewered flower arrangement might become tradition.</TE>

<HD>On the trail of the three wise men</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of the three wise men has been retold and embellished
countless times during the past 2,000 years, but rarely has it been
examined as thoughtfully as in a new documentary.</LD>
<LD>   "Mystery of the Three Kings," airing at 10 tonight on KCET,
journeys from southern Arabia to Ethiopia as it explores the origins
of the three wise men and the precious gifts they brought Jesus. Made
by Atlantic Productions, the 60-minute program was directed by Giles
Llewellyn-Thomas and narrated by Cherie Lunghi.</LD>
<LD>   Combining location footage, interviews with biblical scholars,
digital effects and dramatizations, the show retraces the enigmatic
trio's steps in a captivating style, even if, ultimately, the mystery
is not entirely solved.</LD>
<TE>   The "kings," apparently, were not rulers but Persian Magi,
esteemed astronomers and practitioners of a mystical religion who saw
divine communication in dreams and the stars.</TE>
<TE>   The Magi took the Star of Bethlehem -- which may in fact have been
a lunar eclipse of Jupiter -- as heralding the birth of Jesus, the
new "king of the Jews." They set out on a long trip to pay homage to
the baby Jesus, a journey that became more treacherous when the
current king, Herod, got wind of it.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the program delves into various questions about the
story. A collector's relatively recent discovery of an ancient coin,
for example, helped lead scholars to the theory that Jesus may have
been born on April 17, 6 BC. Jesus also may have been older than 12
days (by as much as two years) when the wise men found him (in a
house rather than a manger).</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the story's message of faith and exploration can't be
disputed.</TE>
<TE>   As one scholar concludes, "This is a true story in the sense that
it conveys values. It is not a story that is verifiable."</TE>

<HD>A point-blank look at luck</HD>
<DH>Brainteaser 'Intacto' lures the viewer into a wonderfully
spooky world where characters can toy with their fortunes at will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone knows what it is to be lucky, but what exactly does being
lucky mean? Is it simply a matter of chance or are there other
factors, as unusual and unnerving as they are unknown, clandestinely
at work?</LD>
<LD>   What if, just for argument's sake, luck was something
quantifiable, a commodity that could be traded, gambled away, even
stolen. What if luck were a gift that could be discovered and
maximized or, just as easily, deactivated. What if good luck for you
meant bad luck for someone else. Even scarier, what if other people
could bet with your luck without your knowledge, risking the entire
course of your life in the process.</LD>
<LD>   The wonderfully spooky Spanish film "Intacto" takes these
questions and concepts and turns them into a sharp brainteaser of a
film, a compelling mind game you compulsively play along with. Think
of "The Hustler" in a "Twilight Zone" setting and you'll have an idea
of the territory director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and his co-writer
Andres M. Koppel are getting into.</LD>
<TE>   Fresnadillo, who won the Goya, his country's Oscar, for best new
director with this, his debut, is one of a group of Spanish
filmmakers, including Alejandro Amenabar of "Abre los Ojos," who have
a gift for contemporary fantasy, for making supernatural thrillers of
the everyday that posit that the world is stranger than we can
possibly know, that odd forces are at play and just out of reach of
our understanding.</TE>
<TE>   The director was helped in this by a well-chosen cast and a
cinematographer (Xavier Gimenez) able to craft a clean,
matter-of-fact style that is the ideal counterpoint to the strange
dramatic situation. "He was able to create a realistic look that also
had the quality of fable," explained Fresnadillo, who for his part
added a strong sense of narrative that propels the film from event to
mysterious event.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional center of "Intacto" is Samuel Berg (persuasively
played by Max von Sydow), otherwise known as the king of luck or the
god of chance. He's a concentration camp survivor who lives in the
antiseptic bunker of a gambling casino located on a blasted lava
field (shot in the director's Canary Islands homeland) and no one has
ever had more control over luck than he. Even Berg's top lieutenant
and protege Federico (Eusebio Poncela), who lived through a
destructive earthquake, discovers he cannot leave the man and take
his good fortune with him.</TE>
<TE>   Banished from the kingdom, Federico devotes himself to finding a
protege of his own, someone he can match against the king. He thinks
he's found him when he comes across Tomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the
only person to come out intact (hence the film's title) after a plane
crash that claimed 237 others.</TE>
<TE>   Federico introduces Tomas to the bizarre world of clandestine
gambling based on luck, a disturbing subculture that involves
peculiar contests of chance like running blindfolded but full speed
through a forest heavy with trees. It's an undeniably creepy world,
but as presented here a completely convincing one.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Federico's quest is the fact that Tomas turns out to
be a fugitive bank robber actively pursued by the law. Causing more
difficulties is that Sara (Monica Lopez), the policewoman chasing
Tomas, is another one of these preternaturally fortunate individuals
with luck to burn.</TE>
<TE>   Co-writer/director Fresnadillo, it turns out, has been thinking
about this film since he was 9, when completely by chance he
witnessed the aftermath of a horrific 1977 Canary Islands plane crash
that killed 578 people. "I think it was that exact moment," he says,
"that gave birth to 'Intacto.' "</TE>
<TE>   Because it is so smart and so carefully worked out, "Intacto" can
be a bit hard to follow at times, but the effort it takes to
understand what's happening is well worth it. We may not be quite
sure from moment to moment where the narrative is going, who's
playing who for a fool and why, but we always care, and that is
saying a lot.</TE>

<HD>Respite in a time of revelry</HD>
<DH>Subdued, quiet 'Blue Christmas' services provide comfort
for those suffering from pain and loss. The practice is gaining
popularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caryle Murphy</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>They sang "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear," lighted Advent candles and
listened to St. Luke's story about the birth of Jesus. But the 20
Presbyterians who gathered recently for "a different service of
worship for Christmas" also recalled lost loved ones, the trauma of
losing a job and the pain of poor health.</LD>
<LD>   "Perhaps the empty chair at the table is too much to bear ...
perhaps the illness has just taken too much of a toll on your body
... perhaps the fog of depression has returned," the Rev. Diane
Walton Hendricks suggested to her subdued audience. "And in this time
of caroling and revelry, when everyone else is ho-ho-ho-ing, the pain
and loss is even harder to bear."</LD>
<LD>   The worshipers then rose one by one, took fire from the Advent
wreath to light their own candles and placed them upright in a box of
sand. As the tiny quilt of flames formed on the table, a deep
silence, broken occasionally by soft sobbing, filled the small
chapel.</LD>
<TE>   The service at Little Falls Presbyterian Church, where Hendricks
is associate pastor, is part of a spreading Christmas tradition in
Protestant churches. More quiet and reflective than the traditional
liturgies of Christmas Day or Christmas Eve, these so-called "Blue
Christmas" services are for people often overlooked at this time of
year: those who just can't get into the merriment of the season for
one reason or another.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is the first Christmas after the death of a beloved
spouse, a recent divorce, a diagnosis of cancer, deep family rifts or
the deployment of a loved one to the Middle East, many people find
the holidays a time of distress. Blue Christmas services are intended
to acknowledge that sadness and to offer comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather died in May, and this will be the first Christmas
without him," said a tearful Carlin Schwartz, 24, an Arlington
County, Va., schoolteacher who attended the Little Falls service. "I
thought it would be easier to do all the other Christmas stuff if I
could get the sadness part out of the way first."</TE>
<TE>   Others say they are drawn to such services because they are
overwhelmed by holiday stress and fatigue, or they are alienated by
the commercialization of the season. "I came because it's a wonderful
relief from all the glitter and turmoil that's going on now as we
come into the last week before Christmas," said Ann Potter, 66, a
retired school librarian who had spent the day gift-shopping.</TE>
<TE>   The origins of Blue Christmas services are not clear. Some pastors
say they've been holding them for more than a decade. But they seem
to have gained steam after 1996, when a prototype liturgy for such
services was included in "Whole People of God," a Sunday school
curriculum used by many Protestant churches in the United States and
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bass Mitchell, a United Methodist pastor in Hot Springs,
Va., believes the name may have been inspired by the song "Blue
Christmas," made famous by Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   Many churches, including Little Falls in Arlington, prefer to call
them "Longest Night" services because the gatherings are usually held
on or near Dec. 21, the winter solstice.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Biblical readings and songs stressing God's comfort,
the services usually involve lighting candles to mark an important
event or the loss of a loved one. Rituals that symbolize hope and
encouragement for the participants are another feature.</TE>
<TE>   At Community of Faith, a United Methodist church in Herndon, Va.,
people were invited at a service last Monday to write their reasons
for being sad on a piece of paper.</TE>
<TE>   They then placed the notes into a large glass bowl of water,
representing the tears they had shed, "and the words on paper
disappeared," said church member Nancy Webster. "It was symbolic that
the water, the tears that had been shed, were cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   Mental-health experts say Blue Christmas services meet a
widespread need because people's high expectations for happy times
during Christmas often are not met, worsening whatever depression or
sadness they were already experiencing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our call volume goes up a lot," said Mary Azoy, director of
training and community crisis response for CrisisLink, an
Arlington-based association of hotlines. "I'm delighted to know that
some of the churches are recognizing the part of us that wants to be
quiet rather than going out and spending $300 on gifts that nobody
wants."</TE>
<TE>   The Church of the Good Shepherd, also United Methodist, in Vienna,
Va., held its first Longest Night service Saturday as an occasion "to
find the meaning and truth behind the bows and packages."</TE>
<TE>   Participants holding lighted candles approached the communion rail
one by one and were directed to one side or the other, depending on
whether they wanted to pray privately or with others. The Rev. James
Noland, Good Shepherd's pastor, said the idea was to give
participants a comfortable choice.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the candles were placed on the altar. The service,
which was open to the public, was not just for the grief-stricken,
Noland added. "To put it colloquially," he said, "it's for anybody
with the holiday blues."</TE>

<HD>Pressing ahead to battle tumors</HD>
<DH>Spotty trials deflated hype over angiogenesis as a way to
stop cancer's growth. But scientists say it's early yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a brand-new approach to fighting cancer: Instead of attacking
tumors directly, clinicians would starve them to death by cutting off
their blood supply.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the first, early human trials, and the results were
lackluster. Had the hope for this approach -- known as
anti-angiogenesis -- evaporated before the ink had even dried on the
celebratory reports?</LD>
<LD>   Scientists say that isn't the case. Anti-angiogenesis remains a
leading, novel way to fight cancer and is being pursued by
researchers and drug companies. They caution, however, that nobody
should expect any miraculous, blanket cures from such drugs (or any
other drug, for that matter).</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is typical of any field in oncology: You make some
preliminary observation and exciting laboratory discoveries, and
there is probably this excessive hype generated," said Dr. Przemyslaw
Twardowski, staff physician in the division of oncology and
therapeutics research at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte.
"Then there's a little bit of a reality check."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two dozen anti-angiogenesis drugs are in trials right now
-- some of them natural, others cooked up in labs -- including such
surprising compounds as thalidomide, responsible for birth defects
when prescribed for pregnant women in the 1950s; Celebrex, the
anti-arthritis drug; and squalamine, a chemical extracted from the
cartilage of sharks.</TE>
<TE>   And recent reports have been promising. Last month, at a cancer
meeting in Frankfurt, French scientists reported that a drug
developed by Sugen Inc. shrank tumors by 50% or more in a quarter of
the 23 patients treated, and that it stabilized tumor size in five
others. All of the patients in this early, phase I, trial had
advanced cancers that no longer responded to other therapies.</TE>
<TE>   Another drug, Avastin, developed by Genentech Inc., more than
doubled the time to disease progression in 116 patients with advanced
kidney cancer in an early trial reported in May, though in most
patients it didn't shrink the size of the tumors. Avastin also slowed
progression in small studies for cancers of the colon, lung and
breast and is currently in larger trials for those cancers.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists are rightly cautious. Avastin, for instance, failed
to show increased survival or delayed disease progression in a large
breast cancer study reported in September, in spite of the fact that
many tumors significantly shrank.</TE>
<TE>   And even if trials pan out, we shouldn't expect any miracles from
anti-angiogenesis, scientists say -- just some useful drugs that work
well for some cancers, under some circumstances, likely in
partnership with other treatments.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind anti-angiogenesis was born largely from the
persistence of one scientist, Dr. Judah Folkman, director of the
Surgical Research Laboratories at Children's Hospital Boston. Folkman
had long been convinced that, to grow past a certain size, a tumor
needed to orchestrate the growth of hundreds of tiny, hair-like blood
vessels to supply itself with energy and oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   "The clearest analogy is if you have 10 houses in a block and now
you're going to build 50 more on the same block, they just can't
exist on the same water supply -- you've got to put in more pipes,"
Folkman said.</TE>
<TE>   Folkman also proposed that doctors might be able to fight a cancer
by figuring out a way to interfere with that process. And that would
hold a big attraction for cancer research. Cancer cells are
constantly mutating and changing and often become resistant to the
drugs used to fight them. But the DNA of blood vessel cells is
genetically stable, holding out hope that a drug aimed at them would
work for much longer.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Folkman's ideas were dismissed by his colleagues, who
thought that already existing blood vessels would more than satisfy a
tumor's needs. But Folkman turned out to be right.</TE>
<TE>   Today, scientists know a lot about how tumors take advantage of
the body's system for forming our complex mesh of veins and arteries
-- and by doing so, manage to grow large and threaten life. The
cancer cells ooze "come hither" chemicals into the surrounding
tissue; these chemicals find their way to blood vessel cells and
trigger fresh growth toward the tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have also found chemicals that block that blood vessel
growth. One, called angiostatin, was heroically purified from
hundreds of liters of mouse urine by Folkman's research associate,
Dr. Michael O'Reilly, in 1993. Another, endostatin, was extracted by
the same group from cell culture medium, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   These drugs certainly looked potent in some animal experiments. In
one study, for instance, angiostatin reduced the rate of tumor spread
in mice by a factor of 20.</TE>
<TE>   But it was in 1998 that the frenzy came, after an article in the
New York Times quoted a Nobel Prize-winning scientist saying that
Folkman would cure cancer "in two years." Phones rang off the hook in
cancer centers across the country.</TE>
<TE>   That climate set the stage for disappointment when early clinical
trials for endostatin and angiostatin were reported in 2001: The
drugs appeared safe and showed slight signs of clinical benefit, but
no more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Folkman points out that these were very early studies, "phase I"
trials that are not designed to study effectiveness, just safety. He
says endostatin and angiostatin, which are still in trials, are
showing increasing benefit as patients stay on them longer.</TE>
<TE>   But should they fail, they won't be alone: Other anti-angiogenesis
drugs have fallen by the wayside in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fair to say that all the novel approaches to cancer
treatment, including anti-angiogenesis, are turning out to be as
complicated to develop clinically as we expected," says Dr. Louise
Grochow, chief of the investigational drug branch at the National
Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with each failure comes new knowledge -- and important course
corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now know, for instance, that there is more than one way
to lure growth of a blood vessel: If the drug doesn't block the
particular method a tumor is using, that drug won't help shrink the
tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, oncologists must learn to better target their therapies,
just as doctors today give tamoxifen or Herceptin only to patients
with specific kinds of breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   And, the tumor can play wily tricks. Block one angiogenesis
pathway and -- sooner or later -- one of the cancer cells will mutate
to draw in blood vessels a new way.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, a multi-pronged approach makes sense: one in which several
angiogenesis pathways are wiped out together.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of both the Sugen drug (known as SU11248) and Avastin
may be the reason they've done better than some of the others.
SU11248 blocks several chemicals involved in blood vessel growth.</TE>
<TE>   Avastin is an antibody that binds to, and hamstrings, a protein
called VEGF -- which is involved in multiple blood vessel-forming
pathways.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, researchers believe that anti-angiogenesis may turn
out to be not the answer to cancer, but part of the answer. They
envision the battle taking place on multiple fronts: attacking tumors
directly (with traditional chemotherapy and radiation as well as
tailor-made drugs such as Herceptin) and also cutting off the tumors'
blood supply -- much as soldiers fire missiles at enemy forces and
also blow up bridges to cut off supply lines.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists say that the anti-angiogenesis approach moved too
fast into clinical trials before the complex biology of blood-vessel
growth had been adequately figured out.</TE>
<TE>   "You may have an idea that, 'This should be a target' or 'The
biology should act this way,' but if you don't really know how things
are acting, you might be wrong," said Zena Werb, a professor of
anatomy at UC San Francisco and a specialist on blood vessel growth.</TE>
<TE>   But other scientists say that there's nothing necessarily
premature about the clinical work. Rather, what we're seeing with
anti-angiogenesis is simply cancer research as usual, complete with
the requisite sea of cured mice and a high rate of clinical
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "This field is kind of littered with molecules that showed promise
in the lab but failed to deliver in the clinic," said Dr. Fairooz
Kabbinavar, associate professor of medicine at UCLA's Johnson
Comprehensive Cancer Center. "Anti-angiogenesis research is really in
its infancy, but I personally feel that it is here to stay. We have
to learn how best to use it. We need to give it more time."</TE>

<HD>A fateful step into fitness</HD>
<DH>MaDonna Grimes, who helped choreograph the dance-aerobics
movement, continues to keep it fresh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If MaDonna Grimes' college cheerleading partner hadn't dropped her,
causing a serious knee injury, it's possible that the dance major
might never have discovered weight training, stepped into an aerobics
class, gotten involved with the exercise movement and become one of
Los Angeles' premier fitness teachers, fusing her extensive dance
background with aerobics.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a tragic story," she says, touching her hand to her forehead
for mock-dramatic effect, "but it was the beginning of a new part of
my life."</LD>
<LD>   For the last decade Grimes, who declines to give her age, has been
a fixture on the L.A. fitness scene. She was at the forefront of the
dance-aerobics movement in the early '90s and quickly earned a
reputation for teaching lively classes combining elements of jazz,
hip-hop and ethnic dance with traditional aerobics. It earned her
stints at such clubs at Voight Fitness &amp; Dance Center, Gold's Gym,
Crunch Fitness and Bally Total Fitness, where she developed a large,
loyal following that helped her start her own studios.</LD>
<TE>   Her latest turn is as the group exercise creative director for the
Sports Club/LA, where she'll develop and teach classes. Priority one
will be to incorporate more dance-based classes such as Brazilian,
jazz and hip-hop into a schedule that includes group cycling, yoga
and Pilates.</TE>
<TE>   "I love creating new classes and I want to add different
elements," she says. "I want to combine modern dance with fitness and
jazz, and it would be great to have a live piano in the corner during
class. I would love that."</TE>
<TE>   Does the pressure of constantly coming up with the hottest new
thing ever get to her? "I change like this," she says with a quick
snap of her fingers. "I'm not afraid. I'll say, 'Let's try it, let's
do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Grimes was extremely instrumental in "creating a very strong dance
influence and integrating that into fitness. She's also always been
on the cutting edge of choreography and stayed ahead of the current
trends," says Rob Glick, regional group fitness director for Crunch
Fitness in Orange County and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But it was that fateful fall while cheerleading for Ohio State
University that landed her in the weight room, where she did strength
training to help heal the torn ligaments in her knee. The aerobics
classes were nearby, and Grimes would watch at the door and laugh at
what seemed like silly, regimented moves. She eventually tried it and
liked it. The pace appealed to her; unlike dance classes, which have
a stop-start rhythm, aerobics offered continuous high-energy music,
repeated movements, and straightforward combinations.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't like it enough to teach -- at first. Grimes got a
master's degree in dance performance and choreography at New York
University, then performed as a dancer while choreographing for and
competing in aerobics competitions. (She was part of the team that
won the U.S. Aerobics Championship in 1987.)</TE>
<TE>   After discovering that fitness instructors earned more than dance
teachers, Grimes bounced back and forth between her base in New York
and Los Angeles to teach at a number of clubs. Weary of East Coast
winters, she moved to L.A. in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Developing her technique of dance aerobics wasn't a conscious
decision to be a groundbreaker: "I just didn't follow any rules," she
said while sitting in the noisy Sports Club/LA cafe. "I wasn't
thinking I was going to make history or anything. I did all kind of
dance movements with funky music for half an hour, then I taught them
a routine that was pretty physical."</TE>
<TE>   Styles such as Afro-Latino funk developed as Grimes traveled in
the United States and abroad. While teaching, she continued to
compete in fitness competitions and win titles, and choreograph for
other champions.</TE>
<TE>   But the itch to start her own studio wouldn't go away, and in 1995
she opened the MaDonna Grimes Dance &amp; Fitness Theatre Company. She
grew out of that space in three years, then joined forces with Gold's
Gym Hollywood before outgrowing that as well. She rented the old
Voight studios until fire destroyed part of the building in 2000.
Since then she's completed a three-part instructional video series
titled "I Just Wanna Dance," and has continued to teach at various
clubs, including Crunch Fitness in Los Angeles and Bally Total
Fitness. She still maintains a small studio in Old Town Pasadena
called the Athletic Garage.</TE>
<TE>   Signing up Grimes exclusively, says Sports Club/LA founder and
executive vice president Nanette Pattee Francini, is part of the
club's goal "to be as progressive and edgy as we can. Group exercise
is a huge area, and dance-based classes seem to be on the rise, and
that's one of her big talents. She also makes it fun."</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher, Grimes' strength is in not just coming up with the
latest choreography, but "making people feel at ease," says Glick.
"She connects with people and makes them feel it's cool to be just
who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Grimes says she's happy to have bridged the previously separate
worlds of fitness and dance: "Before," she says, "dancers would never
touch fitness; they'd never go to the gym. Now they'll take a fitness
class, and fitness people will take a dance class. They're not afraid
of it."</TE>

<HD>Window of fertility not always gauged accurately,
researcher finds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who are trying to become pregnant may not be using the most
accurate predictor of fertility, says a researcher who has studied
the best method of gauging the "window of fertility."</LD>
<LD>   That window is the six-day period during which conception can
occur. It consists of the five days before ovulation and the day of
ovulation itself.</LD>
<LD>   But the greatest probability of conception results from
intercourse one or two days before ovulation, not the day of
ovulation as had been thought, says Dr. Joseph B. Stanford, coauthor
of a review of fertility detection methods in the December issue of
the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology and an associate professor in
the department of family and preventive medicine at the University of
Utah in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   Calendar calculations and basal body temperature aren't as useful
as identifying the approximately five days leading up to ovulation.
Urine tests for the surge of luteinizing hormone that occurs a day or
two before ovulation identify only a small part of the fertile
window.</TE>
<TE>   Methods that do reveal the complete window of fertility are those
that evaluate changes in vaginal discharge or that assess estrogen
levels in urine or saliva.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hypnosis has been so effective in treating irritable bowel syndrome
that British researchers recently tested its usefulness for chronic
indigestion.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 people at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester,
England, were assigned to receive 12 30-minute sessions of either
hypnotherapy, supportive therapy and a placebo medication, or
medication (rantidine twice a day) over 16 weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In the short term, hypnotherapy had a slight edge over the other
treatments: Symptoms improved 59% on average compared with a 49%
improvement in both the supportive therapy and drug treatment group.
But a year later, symptoms had not only improved 73% on average,
compared with 34% with supportive therapy and 43% with medication,
but none of those who had gone through the hypnosis program was
taking medication to control symptoms, while 82% of patients in the
supportive group had to begin other treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Although physicians are not certain how hypnotherapy works on the
gastrointestinal tract, evidence that it is effective is "cumulative
and consistent," says an editorial accompanying the study in the
December issue of Gastroenterology.</TE>

<HD>Newborns often do just as well going home early</HD>
<DH>As long as follow-up care is good, releasing moms from the
hospital before 48 hours doesn't harm babies' health, a Harvard study
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in the 1990s, a public outcry over "drive-through deliveries"
led 41 states and the federal government to pass laws mandating
48-hour minimum hospital stays for mothers after routine births.
Proponents of the laws argued that sending mothers home from the
hospital less than 24 hours after birth, as some health plans were
doing, posed a health risk to infants.</LD>
<LD>   Now a Harvard study has found no evidence that sending mothers
home faster harmed the health of newborns.</LD>
<LD>   "Short stays and long stays had no effect on the health of the
newborn as long as there was good follow-up care," said Jeanne M.
Madden, the study's lead author and a researcher at Harvard Medical
School.</LD>
<TE>   Newborns do equally well going home from the hospital one or two
days after delivery, according to the study published last week in
the New England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers concluded that home nursing visits could
"adequately substitute" for longer hospital stays. Longer stays made
no difference in how frequently babies returned to the hospital for
emergency care or re-hospitalization, the study's authors found.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying that this wave of legislation that guaranteed 48
hours was the wrong thing to do, because there may be other contexts
where the early-discharge programs were not done as carefully and
perhaps harm was done," Madden said. California mandated the 48-hour
stay in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The public outcry in the 1990s focused on health plan policies
that limited patients' insurance coverage to 24 hours in the hospital
following a routine vaginal delivery. In some instances, mothers were
sent home as soon as eight or 12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The study was based on records of 20,366 newborns delivered
between 1990 and 1998 at a large Massachusetts HMO affiliated with
Harvard University. Researchers compared newborn health during
periods of time in which three different discharge policies were in
effect. During the first, from 1990-1994, maternal length-of-stays
were not mandated. The second period, from 1994 to 1996, was when the
HMO's policy was a one-night hospital stay followed by a home nurse
visit. The final study period began in 1996, after Massachusetts
passed a law mandating a two-night stay. (In many cases, mothers left
sooner than 48 hours to take advantage of a home nursing visit that
the health plan guaranteed for shorter stays.)</TE>
<TE>   Longer stays had a downside: The babies were less likely to be
examined on the third or fourth day when problems like jaundice or
dehydration peak.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that the longer stays did not affect
insurers' costs very much: They added about $100 to total costs of
care. The authors explained that the cost difference between a
one-night and two-night stay was negligible because some
Massachusetts hospitals raised rates for shorter stays after the HMO
began its short-stay policy in 1994, and also because women
discharged earlier used more outpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Laura E. Riley, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at
Massachusetts General Hospital, noted that the findings only apply to
families with access to care. "That's very different from your
[low-income] 16-year-old who goes home in 18 hours and her baby is
not eating. She doesn't know what to do and where to call." Riley
also noted that the study didn't address maternal health.</TE>

<LD>When scientists reported last week that diuretics can be better than
newer, more expensive drugs for treating high blood pressure, many
people may have wondered: Can I get the same effects from herbal
products and nonprescription water pills?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is a qualified yes. But a major caveat is that
nonprescription products should be considered only if your high blood
pressure, or hypertension, is mild to moderate -- and if you take
them with supervision from a doctor or trained herbalist.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a serious medical condition. You should not self-treat
for this," said Dr. Mary Hardy, head of the integrative medicine
group at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Most evidence for their usefulness is based on anecdotal
experience because most herbs haven't undergone the scrutiny of
rigorous clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no good clinical research that I've seen for
blood-pressure treatment with herbs," said Hardy, who routinely
recommends herbal diuretics for swelling in the legs and premenstrual
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Trained herbalists and alternative-medicine practitioners use them
as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension, which
includes dietary changes, stress management and exercise, Hardy said.
"Herbs are not a magic bullet. They don't replace drugs. They ...
work best in the context of lifestyle modifications."</TE>
<TE>   If a patient's blood pressure doesn't go down within two weeks of
herbal treatments, it's time to see a physician.</TE>
<TE>   Diuretics help the kidneys get rid of salt and water. By lowering
the volume of fluid in the body, they reduce blood pressure.
Prescription diuretics used for hypertension include thiazides such
as hydrochlorothiazide (Dyazide); loop diuretics like fursemide
(Lasix); and potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone
(Aldactone), which keep the body from losing potassium and causing
muscle weakness.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to herbal alternatives, "the humble and familiar
dandelion leaf" is considered equivalent to Lasix as a diuretic, said
Amanda McQuade Crawford, a medical herbalist at the Ojai Center for
Phytotherapy. Crawford warned against treating hypertension with
herbal diuretics from the local health food store or Internet.
"Retail products vary too much for the consumer to bank on," she
said. She uses extracts made to pharmaceutical standards that are
available only to professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said she also safely treats hypertension with herbal
diuretics including the leaf, berry and flower of hawthorn, celery
seed and yarrow. But she avoids many herbs advertised as diuretics,
such as juniper, which can hurt the kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   The federally sponsored study, which appeared in last week's
Journal of the American Medical Assn., compared an inexpensive
diuretic, chlorthalidone, with three other classes of hypertension
drugs.</TE>

<HD>FDA gives flu spray conditional approval</HD>
<DH>So far, FluMist is not recommended for children younger
than 5 and has not been shown to be effective for adults older than
49.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although it won't be available for this winter's flu season, a novel
flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose moved a step closer to
approval last week when government scientists said it is safe and
effective for healthy people ages 5 to 49.</LD>
<LD>   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel also said there was
insufficient scientific evidence that the vaccine, called FluMist, is
effective for people ages 50 to 64, a key group that health officials
often urge to get vaccinated.</LD>
<LD>   Makers of the inhaled vaccine said they plan to collect more data
on this age group if the drug is approved for the younger age group.</LD>
<TE>   If approved, FluMist could be in doctors' offices by the 2003 flu
season, said Jamie Lacey, a spokeswoman for MedImmune Inc., the
Gaithersburg, Md., company that makes the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials hope that FluMist could provide a
painless alternative to the injected vaccines and encourage many
Americans who dislike getting shots to get vaccinated, said Dr. Keiji
Fukuda, an epidemiologist in the influenza branch of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   More than 174 million Americans should get flu shots, but only
about 70 million actually do.</TE>
<TE>   Citing safety concerns, the FDA advisory panel last year declined
to recommend its use by toddlers. It also recommended against anyone
with asthma or a chronic illness using the mist, even though those
with chronic illnesses are at high risk of serious flu complications.</TE>
<TE>   Babies and toddlers are often urged to get vaccinated because they
spread the infection through day care and to elderly grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   However, in 20 clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of the vaccine to prevent influenza, up to 1.5% of children
younger than 5 who received FluMist suffered asthma attacks or
wheezing symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if FluMist is approved and more data become available, said
Fukuda, the FDA may broaden the number of people who could safely use
the vaccine.</TE>

<LD>Running is good. Trail running is better. I saw the light on my first
jog in the Santa Monica Mountains: No smoky diesels; just birds,
vistas and white-tailed rabbits. The market for sturdy, supportive
trail-running shoes is growing. Here are some of the best for when
you head for the hills this winter.</LD>
<LD>   -- Roy M. Wallack</LD>
<LD>   A splashy rain shoe</LD>
<TE>   Salomon X-A Pro GTX: Wet-weather version of a do-it-all shoe for
street, trail and adventure racing.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Novel, practical Kevlar lacing system cinches tight with a
pull (not by tying) and won't come undone. Wide and comfy. Great for
long runs that often cause feet to swell. Stylishly funky
blue-yellow-red color scheme. Armored toe-cap shields the top of your
toes. Gore-Tex inner bootie keeps you drier in rain.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Gore-Tex is expensive and too hot and sweaty for L.A.
(Advice: Save $30 and buy the regular X-A Pro.)</TE>
<TE>   Price: $120. (877) 272-5666; salomonsports.com.</TE>
<TE>   A delicate balance</TE>
<TE>   Montrail Diablo: An all-condition shoe designed for road and trail
surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: A form-fitted design that locks your foot in before you
lace it, providing great stability on all surfaces. That's due to a
tall arch support in the foot bed and a one-piece, high-instep collar
that wraps around from tongue to heel. The latter seals out dirt and
rocks. Also, a high sidewall protects both sides of your feet.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Collar makes shoe difficult to get on and off. You'll
need to grab with two hands and yank hard.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $100. (800) 826-1598; montrail.com.</TE>
<TE>   Plowing through</TE>
<TE>   Merrell Rip: Dedicated trail runner with heavy-duty construction.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Feels as if it could plow through anything. Deeply studded
soccer-shoe-like sole grips surfaces. Large synthetic-leather cap at
front end shields toes. Dense rubber sole and nylon plate add
stiffness and protection against sharp rocks. Air-cushioned shock
absorption.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Not designed to handle pavement running; studded sole
will quickly wear down. Heaviest of the bunch at 14.5 oz. May be too
stiff for some.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $100. (888) 637-7001; merrell.com.</TE>
<TE>   Fast but vulnerable</TE>
<TE>   Adidas Supernova TR: Ultralight trail and street runner.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Feels very fast. At 12 ounces, it's the lightest of the
group. Big, grabby lugs on forefoot.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Little toes vulnerable due to lack of protection on side
of shoes. Thin, tall studs on soles likely to wear out fast on
pavement. Lacks the toe-to-heel plastic plate that other shoes offer,
which adds stability and helps provide protection against rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $85. (800) 423-4327; adidas.com.</TE>

<HD>That gift anxiety isn't so crazy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey and Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anxiety is one thing. But scuttling around town feverishly in search
of the perfect gift -- at the last minute, after weeks of paralysis
and denial -- is something else. It's what people do when they're
forced to define the most important relationships in their lives
under deadline, psychologists say.</LD>
<LD>   "When you're buying a gift for someone who's important, there's
considerable risk in making the wrong choice," said David Mick, who
studies consumer decision-making at the University of Virginia.
"Spend too much money and you can be embarrassed, too little and you
look cheap .... This is what has some people so worried."</LD>
<LD>   In a time of terror and war, it's a stretch to call shopping
treacherous. Nonetheless, psychologists say that high anxiety over
holiday purchases reflects an acute appreciation for the power and
function of gifts and their effect on social ties.</LD>
<TE>   An ongoing survey of about 500 people in Japan, South Korea and
the United States, conducted by researchers at the University of
Oregon, has shown that choice of a personal gift makes two
statements: "This is the kind of person I am" and "This is the kind
of person I think you are."</TE>
<TE>   "These two are universal," said psychologist Lynn Kahle, the lead
investigator.</TE>
<TE>   "Money certainly comes into it, and there are other factors, but
mainly gift giving is a public statement of what you value in
yourself and the other person."</TE>
<TE>   Consciously or not, the recipient weighs carefully the emotional
and symbolic content of those statements, psychologists have found.</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety is highest precisely in situations of gift exchange, such
as Christmas or Hanukkah, when people are simultaneously showing
their hands about each other and the relationship, said David Wooten,
a University of Michigan researcher who has studied anxiety in gift
giving over several years in about 200 people ages 20 to 60.</TE>
<TE>   The classic example is a couple approaching a decision about
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "For some women there's a tremendous expectation of getting a ring
this time of year," said Elaine Rodino, a therapist in Santa Monica.
"That can be the source of plenty of anxiety and misery, for both
partners."</TE>
<TE>   Yet a single gift can alter the current of any romantic
relationship that's in transition. In the first bloom of romance,
there's tremendous pressure to define oneself with a gift: Should I
get that new Kurt Cobain book, or would the new John Updike hardback
look better?</TE>
<TE>   "You also have people wondering what to buy based on how far or
how fast the relationship is going," said psychologist David Stewart,
a professor of marketing at the USC School of Business. "Do you buy
the sweater; or is it time for a necklace? If you get the necklace,
you may be going too fast."</TE>
<TE>   When a relationship is important but secure, there's far more
safety in gift choice. People who've been married happily for years
have already given each other dozens of nice presents. This poses a
familiar puzzle -- what to get for the person who seems to have
everything.</TE>
<TE>   But it is nothing compared with the challenge of buying for a
spouse or lover or boyfriend when the relationship is uncertain or
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Cele Otnes, a business professor at the University of Illinois,
was among the first to study recipients' views of how gifts affect
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   The research, which was based upon the gift-giving experiences of
140 people, identified six outcomes for a gift and its impact on a
relationship: It could strengthen it, reaffirm it as positive, have a
negligible effect, validate it as negative, weaken or sever it.</TE>
<TE>   Even a gag or bizarre gift -- the mounted singing fish; the Chia
Pet -- can't hurt a relationship, "if the relationship is strong and
the recipient perceives the giver's intentions to be good," said
Otnes, who co-wrote the study with two other professors. "On the
other hand, if the relationship is weak, even the best gift can't
save it."</TE>
<TE>   Even a new Lexus with a global positioning system on the dashboard
won't bring back an embittered spouse, if he or she has decided it's
over.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of souring a prized relationship with the "wrong" gift
does not ease with advancing age, and presumably wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its holiday Web page, the AARP posted guidelines for
choosing appropriate gifts for grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to obvious recommendations such as checking with their
parents for suggestions, the organization cautions: "Don't feel
pressured to buy gifts beyond your means because you don't want to
disappoint your grandchildren or be outdone by other grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   But don't assume that pressure can be so easily wished away,
either, psychologists say. Bonds with grandkids can be as vital and
important as any later in life, and gift giving will require some
thought.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that many people resent the ever-growing
obligations to less intimate recipients, which serve only as
stressful distractions.</TE>
<TE>   At Suzi Finer Artworks &amp; Artware, a small gift shop in Beverly
Hills, Donna Feinstein, the store's shopping guide, has fielded her
share of frantic customer requests for the right gift for the new
person on their list.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said she helped a desperate client who had already
bought something for her child's elementary school principal,
assistant principal, teacher, office worker, librarian and school
nurse choose yet one more gift for another school employee.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother was horrified when she realized she hadn't gotten
anything for the music teacher," said Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," Feinstein added, "I had a writer come in this week
who asked me, 'What do I get my therapist?' "</TE>

<HD>Safer psoriasis drug works well in trials</HD>
<DH>The treatment for those with debilitating symptoms appears
to block the autoimmune reaction without serious side effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 4.5 million Americans have psoriasis, a disorder
characterized by raised, thickened patches of red skin covered with
silvery scales. Although the condition is common, scientists only
recently learned that it is an autoimmune disorder.</LD>
<LD>   Now that discovery has paid off. A new injectable drug relieves
symptoms by blocking the immune system reaction without the sometimes
serious side effects of current treatments.</LD>
<LD>   "Now we have a drug that is as effective but much safer," said Dr.
Mark Lebwohl, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York, who has tested the drug, Amevive, on patients.</LD>
<TE>   Most people with psoriasis experience only mild symptoms, which
can be soothed with topical creams. But 1 million sufferers have more
debilitating symptoms, including constant itching, cracked skin and
painful lesions.</TE>
<TE>   These symptoms can be controlled with ultraviolet light or
medications that dampen the immune response, such as cyclosporine (a
transplant anti-rejection drug) and the cancer medication
methotrexate. However, getting UV treatment three times a week for
months is inconvenient; methotrexate can damage the liver and cause
anemia; and cyclosporine can cause headaches and kidney damage.</TE>
<TE>   University of Michigan scientists, led by Kevin Cooper, discovered
in the 1980s that when certain types of  white blood cells hook up to
other immune cells, known as antigen-presenting cells, the white
blood cells send a signal that prompts skin cells to grow wildly out
of control.</TE>
<TE>   That team later collaborated with Biogen scientists, including
Paula S. Hochman and Barbara P. Wallner. In 1986, Wallner cloned a
gene that produces a compound to block this activation. The trick,
says Wallner, was to devise a drug that blocked the immune reaction
without weakening the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   Two more years of tinkering produced a substance potent enough to
work on human skin cells in the test tube, and several more years of
tests were conducted before the drug was injected in the first
patient in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be quite effective. A 2001 study of 229 patients
with chronic psoriasis, some of whom had as much as 50% of their body
covered with plaques, compared weekly injections of Amevive with a
placebo.</TE>
<TE>   In those treated with the drug, psoriasis severity declined by
about half, and a quarter said their skin cleared completely.</TE>
<TE>   In some patients, the drug kept the disease from flaring up for a
year or more after the 12-week treatment was over. The drug is
awaiting FDA approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them had suffered with severe psoriasis for 20 years and
had given up because nothing really worked," says Hochman. "They were
thrilled -- it really changed their life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other Options</TE>
<TE>   Another promising psoriasis drug, Raptiva, may be available by the
end of 2003. Like Amevive, it is part of a new generation of
therapies that fight psoriasis by blocking the immune system reaction
involved in the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Recent tests in 1,000 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis
showed the drug is as effective as Amevive.</TE>
<TE>   Raptiva can be injected under the skin by patients at home
(Amevive must be injected intravenously in a doctor's office). The
drug also works faster than Amevive, providing almost immediate
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Two other drugs already on the market also may be able to treat
psoriasis. Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, and Remicade, for
Crohn's disease, have proven effective in some studies.</TE>

<HD>The danger of acetaminophen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has long been known that too much acetaminophen can cause liver
damage, but the alarming extent of the problem has just been
documented. A new study has found that overdosing on acetaminophen,
the most widely used nonprescription analgesic, was responsible for
39% of 308 cases of acute liver failure.</LD>
<LD>   Most cases of liver toxicity from acetaminophen reported by the
Acute Liver Failure Study Group, a consortium of 17 centers
specializing in liver diseases, were accidental and not suicides.
Seventy-nine percent of them were women. "We don't know if this is
because women take more acetaminophen-containing drugs than men do,
if women's livers are more vulnerable, or if it's because they are
smaller," says Dr. William M. Lee, the principal investigator and
professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "We were surprised to find that the number of people with liver
damage from acetaminophen was three times that of all other
prescription drugs," Lee says. He cautions people to be careful of
how much they take and read the labels of all over-the-counter
products taken together. Mixing acetaminophen-containing medicines
for cough, sleep and pain can add up to a dangerous dose. Most people
in this study had taken more than 4,000 milligrams of the drug. The
study of cases over a 41-month period was reported in the Dec. 17
Annals of Internal Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a preliminary report of this study's findings
prompted a Food and Drug Administration committee to advise that
over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen such as Tylenol
and other pain relievers and cough-and-cold remedies carry a stronger
warning label than they currently do.</TE>

<HD>Back in the game</HD>
<DH>Many adults over 50 are returning to the team sports of
their youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year was 1959 and Audrey Kallas-Pastore was in her last season of
high school basketball. The 5-foot, 10-inch forward helped lead tiny
Baldwyn High School to the Mississippi state tournament for the first
time in the school's history.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, her team was knocked out in the third round by a tough
rival. Defeated, it was time to bid her teammates and the game
farewell.</LD>
<LD>   "When we lost that game, I thought, 'This is the end of something
in my life that I won't ever do again,' " said Kallas-Pastore, who
still has newspaper clippings of her basketball exploits. "Like
everyone else of that era, I just moved on."</LD>
<TE>   For 36 years, moving on meant marriage, career and few sports
activities. But in 1995, motivated by a newspaper article about older
women and basketball, she joined the San Diego Senior Women's
Basketball Assn. at her local YMCA. In a few years the league has
grown from just a handful of players to more than 100 who compete
year-round on nearly a dozen teams. "We feel like we're in high
school out there," said Kallas-Pastore, 62, whose team, the Shooting
Stars, recently won an over-50 national championship in Utah. "It
puts you back in time."</TE>
<TE>   The retired marketing executive from San Diego is among tens of
thousands of Americans over 50 who are returning to organized team
sports. The trend is being driven by more than nostalgia, although
that's certainly a significant part of it.</TE>
<TE>   A cultural emphasis on the benefits of exercise, improving medical
techniques and technology, and a strong desire for a sense of
community are helping to create and sustain a vigorous team-sports
network for older Americans. Baseball, softball, basketball and
volleyball are favorites, particularly in Southern California, but
sports from rowing to ice hockey also are represented. To
participate, graying athletes often must overcome age, injury and
even societal expectations for a chance to play a game that has
produced some of the fondest memories of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "They are continuing to rewrite the old manual for life that
essentially said team sports end at high school for the vast majority
of us," said Mark F. Frazier, a psychologist in Arlington Heights,
Ill., who tracks aging and sports. "First, it was the over-30s, then
it was the over-40s. Now, it's the over-50s and 60s who are saying,
'We still want to play,' and they will."</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 21 million baby boomers expected to reach age 50 in
the next five years, the over-50 leagues are poised to expand by
leaps and bounds. Most leagues contacted for this story reported
heightened interest and only expect more to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just gone bananas," said Ken Jaffe, 51, a player-coach on
the Hollywood Stars, a local over-48 baseball team in the Men's
Senior Baseball League that boasts more than 16,000 players
nationwide. "I remember when we were on over-30 teams and we thought
that was old. There's just a ton of guys out there who don't ever
want to stop playing with the hard ball."</TE>
<TE>   The leagues make it easier for their graying athletes to stay in
the game. They realize that though an older person's enthusiasm may
not have been diminished by time, their physical capabilities most
certainly have. As a result, rules are often modified to enhance
enjoyment and reduce the risk of injury.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in Jaffe's baseball league, one of several large
fast-pitch baseball leagues in the nation, a "courtesy runner" can be
requested once a player reaches first base. And collisions between
baserunners and fielders are strictly forbidden. Likewise, in over-50
ice hockey leagues, body checking and slap shots are banned as well.</TE>
<TE>   But with bones more brittle and tendons and ligaments less
flexible, injury is almost unavoidable. Broken noses, arms and legs,
and torn-up knees and shoulders aren't uncommon. Since returning to
the gymnasium, Kallas-Pastore has fractured her elbow, hyper-extended
her finger and ripped up her knee.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the injuries can lead to an earlier-than-planned
retirement from action.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the constant pounding on hardwood floors, we had one
guy on our team that had to have a hip replacement," said Bill
Florentine of Incline Village, Nev., a 62-year-old player-coach on a
volleyball team. "He can't play indoors anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Physicians recommend that people over 50 who want to play
competitive and strenuous sports get a complete physical. To reduce
the likelihood and severity of injury, prospective athletes are urged
to begin a conditioning and stretching program at least a month
before playing.</TE>
<TE>   The doggedness to participate in the face of such pain sometimes
triggers unsolicited, usually unwelcome, advice. "When I was having
my knee redone, the anesthesiologist said, 'What are you doing?
You're too old for this,' " recalled Kallas-Pastore. "Well, life is
for living. You just go to the doctor, get better, and head back out
on the court."</TE>
<TE>   And even those who don't suffer serious injuries must cope with a
body that simply doesn't bounce back as it once did. "Every year, I
hurt more and for longer from doing less and less," said Jaffe, a
math teacher and baseball coach at Morningside High School in
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the physical struggles, aging team-sports enthusiasts say
the new friendships generated and the old ones deepened by the
experience more than compensate. Indeed, many of the team players
could have chosen to get their physical exercise in individual sports
such as running and tennis, or by working out at a health club.
Instead, they've deliberately sought out team sports to make a human
connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a family," said Kallas-Pastore. "This is our
sisterhood. Many of us go on vacation together, go to the theater.
It's like a party all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Other athletes relish the performance boost supplied by the group
dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to have someone there encouraging you," said Steve
Hathaway, who rows competitively in two-person and four-person boats.
"We are constantly egging each other on to go to a higher level. You
just don't want to let your teammates down."</TE>
<TE>   League play can even hold together teammates who have long since
scattered to far-off places. Although they don't play in weekly games
as most leagues do, the Quiksilver Legends USA have competed all
around the globe over the last decade. The team's roots are in
Southern California, and many of its players still reside here, but
many live as far away as Nevada, Colorado and Hawaii. Their efforts
to stay together through relocations and job changes paid off in
October, when the squad defeated the Russian national team to capture
a gold medal at the World Masters Games in Melbourne, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we contemplate whether we'll keep doing it or not,"
said Florentine, who used to live in Los Angeles, but has retired to
Nevada. "But we just enjoy each other's company. As long as we can do
it, I figure we probably will."</TE>
<TE>   The sense of devotion to the group, even among teams that don't
win world championships, shouldn't be surprising. "Teams provide
someone in their 50s and 60s something that is very difficult to find
anywhere else, and that is camaraderie." This is particularly true
for men who often prefer individual achievement and activity over
group ones, according to Frazier.</TE>
<TE>   For women, team sports deliver a socially acceptable way to
express aggression -- a behavior still discouraged in women,
especially older ones. Whether it's stealing the basketball from an
opponent or scoring a soccer goal, the activity provides an
adrenaline rush for a generation who graduated before Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   "For many of these women, when they grew up, if you did anything
more than reading it was considered dangerous," said Irene Deitch, a
psychology professor at the College of Staten Island-CUNY. "The
intensive competition is a healthy distraction. They work out
tension, they don't have to think about a fight with a spouse or the
kids. They get a chance to be who they are."</TE>
<TE>   For some older women, the opportunity to play team sports wasn't
widely available when they were in school. These women never
benefited from Title IX, a sweeping, federal educational reform
passed in 1972 that requires equal distribution of athletic aid and
resources among men and women in high schools and colleges. Before
Title IX, about one in 27 high school and college women played for a
school team. Today, the ratio is one in 2.5.</TE>
<TE>   To account for a lack of experience, many leagues have several
skill divisions, usually ranging from beginner to advanced. Some
teams, such as those in Kallas-Pastore's basketball league in which
about a third of the players had never played, put on seasonal
clinics that focus on fundamentals. The clinics not only nurture and
sharpen basic skills but also help reduce injuries by teaching
inexperienced players where they should -- and more importantly,
where they shouldn't -- be on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got former homemakers out here who had never played a game
of basketball in their whole lives," Kallas-Pastore said. "They get
the hang of it soon enough and make good friends along the way. I've
seen it change their whole lives."</TE>

<TE>   Sports injuries</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- had more than
1 million injuries related to sports activities that required medical
treatment in 1998, the latest year for which figures were available.
Many of these injuries resulted from participation in popular teams
sports, including basketball, volleyball and flag football. The most
common injuries for this age group, in order, were:</TE>
<TE>   *Contusions and bruises</TE>
<TE>   *Muscle strains (hamstring or lower back)</TE>
<TE>   *Shoulder (dislocation, separation or rotator cuff problems)</TE>

<HD>Smallpox: The misunderstood virus</HD>
<DH>A survey of Americans shows that the level of ignorance
about the disease is much higher than expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By now you'd think everyone in America would be walking, talking
experts on smallpox -- but ignorance apparently abounds.</LD>
<LD>   A new survey, to be published in the January issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, found that most Americans don't even
know that smallpox was eradicated from the natural world more than
two decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The published report, based on a poll of 1,006 adults between Oct.
8 and Dec. 8, was one of several smallpox-themed papers released
early by the journal last week "to help inform the current debate
about smallpox vaccination."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to vaccinating military personnel, the Bush
administration is offering voluntary smallpox vaccination first to
health care and emergency workers and, by 2004, to the American
public.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that, although most people knew that smallpox is
a contagious disease, 11% did not. Also:</TE>
<TE>   30% believed there have been smallpox cases in the United States
in the last five years, and 63% thought there had been cases
somewhere in the world in that time. Fact: The last known U.S. case
of smallpox was in 1949, and the last natural case worldwide was
reported in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   78% thought there is an effective treatment for smallpox
infections. Fact: There is no specific treatment for smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   30% believe that if they were vaccinated in childhood, they are
still immune. Fact: Experts believe that people vaccinated decades
ago are no longer immune.</TE>
<TE>   One-fourth said they were likely to die if given the vaccine (6%
thought it very likely) and 41% thought they would likely become
seriously sick (11% thought it very likely). Fact: The vaccine can
have serious side effects, but the risk is much lower than
respondents believe. For each million people vaccinated, it is
estimated that 14 to 52 people will become seriously ill and one to
two will die.</TE>
<TE>   Only 16% believe there is enough vaccine for everyone in case of a
terrorist attack. Fact: The government says there is enough vaccine
for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of misperception is much higher than we expected," said
lead author Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political
analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. This is serious, he
said. "People will be making choices about whether to get vaccinated
or not, so they need the basic facts."</TE>
<TE>   The survey was designed and analyzed by the Harvard School of
Public Health and conducted by International Communications Research.
It found that 65% of Americans think the public should have access to
the vaccine and that doctors may significantly influence decisions:
73% said they would get the vaccine if their doctor opted to have it.
Only 21% would do so if the doctor refused.</TE>
<TE>   To raise awareness, Blendon recommends use of educational leaflets
at doctor's offices, respected and visible "Dr. Koop-like" spokesmen
and some kind of "entertainment figure" who speaks on smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   "But I haven't nominated anybody," he said.</TE>

<LD>Ginkgo trees, native to China, can live as long as 1,000 years. It
may be this longevity that has convinced people over the ages that
the leaves can give elderly people more vigor. As far back as ancient
China, ginkgo biloba was considered to be good for the heart and
lungs. Extracts made from the tree's leaves continue to be among the
most popular herbal remedies in the world today.</LD>
<LD>   Shari Roan</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Ginkgo contains antioxidants that may prevent or reverse the
cell damage that occurs in many degenerative disorders. It's most
commonly used to treat memory and concentration problems associated
with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Ginkgo is thought to improve
blood flow. The herb is also used for depression, impotence, vertigo,
premenstrual syndrome, to prevent intoxication and the vascular
disorder called Raynaud's syndrome.</LD>
<TE>   Dose: Typically 120 to 240 milligrams daily. Scientists have
identified ginkgo supplements containing 6% terpene lactones and 24%
flavone glycosides as having enough of the active chemicals to have
an effect.</TE>
<TE>   Precautions: Can react with some blood-thinning medications to
increase their potency. Should not be combined with aspirin or taken
prior to surgery because it may increase bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Research: There is some evidence that ginkgo can delay cognitive
deterioration related to dementia, but the link is unproven; a
six-year, $15-million federal study on the herb's effect on cognitive
function was launched in 1999. There is much less research on the
other uses of ginkgo.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Chartering New Course for Schools</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Lee Colvin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite some recent, impressive gains by elementary school students,
it's hard to find much evidence of the waves of education reform that
have swept through the Los Angeles Unified School District in the
last decade.</LD>
<LD>   Some schools still display the green and white banner of LEARN, an
ambitious attempt to spur innovation and team-building by giving
power to schools, parents and teachers to operate outside the
gravitation-like pull of the giant district's death-star bureaucracy.</LD>
<LD>   Then came LAAMP. Fueled with $110 million in private funds and
contributions of time and expertise, that effort focused on linking
elementary, middle and high schools to foster common expectations and
teacher professionalism.</LD>
<TE>   Various superintendents launched their own initiatives, only to
see them evaporate with hardly a trace. Does anyone remember the list
of 100 low-performing schools drawn up with great fanfare by
short-timer schools Supt. Ruben Zacarias?</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative effect of all that activity inside the district is
what policy analysts from WestEd, a nonprofit education research lab,
call "reform fatigue."</TE>
<TE>   After studying the L.A. school system for more than a year and
talking to leading experts across the country, WestEd is recommending
a radical break from that past. In a new report, the lab urges the
creation of a shadow district of 100 charter schools. That would
triple the number of such schools in Los Angeles and add to pressure
on the district to change.</TE>
<TE>   Not incidentally, such a network would give about 50,000 students
in Los Angeles' most ill-served areas an alternative to being bused
far from home or attending the huge, chaotic and academically
undemanding schools in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   But before anyone jumps to the conclusion that this is an assault
that would leave the rest of the district's nearly 750,000 students
in the lurch, it's clear that such a network also holds great promise
for the system itself.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of
school districts, with the idea that more freedom will lead to
innovation and excellence. The first such charter opened in 1991 in
St. Paul, Minn.; this year, there are 2,700 charter schools in 38
states serving nearly 700,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the charter school record is mixed, as one would expect
from a reform meant to foster innovation and eclecticism. And teacher
unions and school boards nationally continue to work to block the
movement's advance.</TE>
<TE>   But prominent civic leaders in Los Angeles, organized into the
Alliance for Student Achievement, are taking a different route. The
alliance wants to run a network of schools that would be far smaller
than the massive, impersonal institutions typical of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of 4,000 students, alliance high schools would have 400.
With fewer students (and no football team), these schools could set
up shop in existing buildings or in new structures built on far
smaller parcels, easing the district's space crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Civic, political and labor leaders in L.A. should rally behind
this idea of establishing a large-scale system of charter schools to
both compete and cooperate with the existing district. The mayor's
office should help find sites for new schools and work to smooth over
any zoning problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Board of Education, which has made clear it is
receptive to charter schools, should hack away red tape and not shirk
its responsibility to hold the charters accountable for performance.</TE>
<TE>   The United Teachers-Los Angeles should not make it difficult for
union members to sign up to work in the charters, if they desire,
without risking benefits.</TE>
<TE>   And local politicians should do their best in Sacramento to ensure
any future charter school regulations do not undermine the L.A.
system's chances of success.</TE>
<TE>   Reform fatigue is understandable, given the limited results of
past efforts to improve L.A. Unified. But this bold idea should
invigorate the community to put its collective shoulder to the wheel
one more time.</TE>

<HD>Acts of Desperation</HD>
<DH>Even as it lashes out, Al Qaeda is a shadow of its former
self</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fawaz A. Gerges</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda leaders have recently unleashed a new campaign of
psychological warfare. Hardly a week goes by without the terror
network issuing threats against Westerners, particularly Americans.</LD>
<LD>   At times the Bush administration appears to fall prey to this
campaign by sending ambiguous messages to the American people about
the efficacy of its efforts to eradicate terror and ensure their
security. Fearing the worst, an FBI internal assessment two weeks ago
warned the nation to brace itself for "spectacular" attacks by Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the administration swiftly expressed their dismay that
it has failed to locate Osama bin Laden or to eliminate him. They
also accused the administration of a lack of focus in the fight
against Al Qaeda and of being distracted by its potential military
plans for Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Administration aides offered quick rebuttals and marshaled facts
and figures to show that their effort against Al Qaeda has made
considerable progress.</TE>
<TE>   If the war against terrorism has gone well, why then is Al Qaeda
still capable of launching "spectacular" operations?</TE>
<TE>   This ambiguity stems from the fact that the administration is
legitimately concerned about declaring victory against Al Qaeda lest
future attacks play into Al Qaeda's hands. Washington also seems to
have little appreciation of the terror group's shifting tactics and
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, Al Qaeda seems to have been waging a
propaganda and psychological struggle to sow fear and inflict
economic damage.</TE>
<TE>   The post-9/11 terror, relying on decentralized operations and
aiming mainly at "soft" civilian targets, is designed to defy the
U.S. and to indicate that Al Qaeda's reach is global.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda has shown itself to be highly adaptable and resourceful
by scattering its surviving fighters, estimated in the low hundreds,
from Afghanistan into various destinations, and by building alliances
with other fringe Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   But these recent attacks, bloody and costly as they are, should
not blind us to the fact that Al Qaeda is a shadow of its former
self.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the pontifications of its leaders that it will deliver
faster, harder strikes against the most vital American centers, it no
longer possesses the means to plan, organize and launch strategic
operations of the scale of Sept. 11. The war has slowly but steadily
dismantled the group's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   The network lost its vital operational base in Afghanistan. Its
partner, the Taliban regime, is history. Its financial and military
infrastructure in Europe, particularly in Germany, France and
England, was dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, hardly any state, regardless of its political
orientation, could afford to aid or harbor Al Qaeda's fugitives, a
testament to the effectiveness of the global anti-terror coalition.
The deepening of regional cooperation has netted scores of Al Qaeda
operatives worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's surviving foot soldiers are forced to operate
underground in a hostile world with no official refuge.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the tightening of the international noose around Al
Qaeda's neck, the network, or what is left of it, acts like a serial
criminal band, killing at random. This is a sign of weakness and
desperation, not strength.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bush administration should not lower its guard or be
complacent, it must avoid falling into the trap of fear and panic
laid down by Bin Laden's men. It is true that Bin Laden and his chief
lieutenant remain in hiding. But their resurfacing will make them
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   The one remaining real danger lies in Al Qaeda's effort to
reinvent itself as a defender of Palestinians and Iraqis and thus
expand its pool of recruits. One of Bin Laden's major failures since
9/11 revolves around the lack of new recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. must find ways to frustrate the network's tactics and
limit the pool of recruits available for jihadi, or holy war causes.
Working closely with allies and friends is the most effective way of
putting Bin Laden and his organization out of business once and for
all.</TE>

<HD>Meds as Stocking Stuffers?</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Frederick R. Lynch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a result of Congress' failure to compromise on competing bills
authorizing Medicare prescription drug coverage, Dear Abby is
recommending pharmacy gift certificates as stocking stuffers for the
elderly.</LD>
<LD>   I discovered this sad state of affairs a few days ago when I asked
a 71-year-old relative what she would like for Christmas. After
mentioning that she and her husband paid, out of pocket, $150 for
their most recent prescriptions (neither has a serious chronic
illness), she invoked Dear Abby's advice.</LD>
<LD>   She and her husband are both loyal Republicans, nourished by a
steady media diet of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly. When I
suggested she pay closer attention to politicians' positions on
Medicare, she responded frostily that she would never vote for
Hillary Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of similar individual disconnects between private pain
and public policy have postponed a national Medicare crisis into 2003
while further frustrating AARP and allied policy reformers. They have
tried to forge a more class-conscious "Medicariat" to lobby Congress
and overcome the insurance-pharma- ceutical juggernaut that has
stymied efforts to make prescription coverage a government-funded
Medicare option.</TE>
<TE>   Invoking the specter of price controls and lower research budgets,
the drug and insurance industries -- largely through their GOP allies
-- have countered with bills that steer drug coverage into a
private-insurer maze of subsidies, deductibles, limits and
co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   How bad is the situation, and what is the potential for a
Medicariat? Nationally, about 30% of Medicare-eligible subscribers
lack prescription drug coverage. The remainder have coverage that may
contain substantial deductibles, exclusions, co-payments and annual
caps.</TE>
<TE>   Only three out of 10 standardized Medicare supplemental insurance
plans (Medigap) cover prescriptions, and only 10% of Medigap
purchasers bought prescription coverage, AARP says.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Kaiser Family Foundation eight-state survey found wide
variation by state and source of coverage. In California, 18% of
seniors have no drug coverage; in New York, 19%; in Michigan, 25%; in
Illinois and in Texas, 31%. In heavily unionized states,
employer-sponsored retiree health plans were a major source of
coverage -- for example, in Michigan (50%), Ohio (47%) and New York
(42%). Medicare HMOs provided coverage in California (34%) and
Colorado (24%) but less than 15% of coverage in other states.</TE>
<TE>   This same survey contained an additional dark finding that nearly
a fourth of seniors reported skipping medication doses or not filling
prescriptions because of cost. Nearly a fourth of seniors are
spending $100 or more a month on prescriptions. In addition, Medicare
beneficiaries may be spending up to a fifth of their incomes on
health care, according to a private foundation that researches health
and social issues.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare and its recipients are caught up in a medical-care
revolution. The original 1965 Medicare legislation addressed elderly
people's great fear of long, bankrupting hospital stays. Today,
"miracle drugs," endoscopic microsurgery and other breakthroughs have
reduced hospital stays and lengthened life spans.</TE>
<TE>   But considerable costs are shifting to biotech devices (i.e.,
complex implants), the pharmacy window and, increasingly, home health
care.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should pass a prescription drug benefit as a prelude to
rethinking Medicare altogether. (Scheduled Medicare reimbursement
cutbacks have rising numbers of doctors threatening to limit or
refuse Medicare patients.) Major Medicare reforms, in turn, will
accompany overhauls of the nation's creaking, expensive and outmoded
health insurance system.</TE>
<TE>   Americans will have to decide how much they want to spend on
health care, balancing the competing "have-it-all" desires for
equity, access, choice and high quality. In so doing, we may be able
to abandon Scrooge-like visions of holiday gift certificates for
life-sustaining drugs -- for the elderly or anyone else.</TE>

<LD>When the fighting started last fall in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's
leaders genuinely expected to mire our coalition down in a reprise of
the Soviet experience. They were just as genuinely surprised. And
then sorely disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, more than one-third of the top leadership that had
been identified before the war has been killed or captured. Almost
half of our successes against senior Al Qaeda members have come in
recent months, during which time we've netted:</LD>
<LD>   * Al Qaeda's operations chief for the Persian Gulf, who also
helped plan the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings and the attack on
the U.S. destroyer Cole in 2000;</LD>
<TE>   * a principal Al Qaeda planner who was also a conspirator in the
9/11 attacks;</TE>
<TE>   * numerous operations officers and facilitators;</TE>
<TE>   * and a trove of information that is helping us to press the hunt
further.</TE>
<TE>   We are still in the "hunt" phase of this war -- the painstaking
pursuit of individual Al Qaeda members and their cells. This phase is
paying off, but it is manpower intensive and will take a long time.
There are no set battles against units of any size. We are tracking
our enemies down, one by one.</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 3,000 Al Qaeda operatives or associates have
been detained in more than 100 countries since September 2001. Not
everyone arrested was a terrorist. Some have been released. But this
worldwide "rousting" of Al Qaeda has definitely disrupted its
operations. And more than 166 countries worldwide have seized more
than $121 million in terrorist-related financial assets.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has had a lot of partners in this fight. Without
them, we could not have accomplished what we did. Most governments
around the world understand that Al Qaeda poses a threat to them as
well. The notion that the Muslim world has "lined up" against us is a
myth. The fact is, after a few initial turnouts, the Muslim "street"
never really showed up.</TE>
<TE>   But let's be very clear: There is no letup in the threat at the
moment. Despite the loss of several senior lieutenants and the
security worries of the remaining leaders, intelligence clearly shows
Al Qaeda is still preparing terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, every Al Qaeda operations officer and facilitator we have
captured so far was in the midst of preparing attacks when captured.

<HD>Fixing Failed Families: Job for Heroes or Fools?</HD>

<LD>The ball sailed over the fence, setting off a dog's territorial
barking. Noe scrambled after it. But two competing voices froze the
13-year-old at the top of the chain link, and there he teetered,
precariously balanced between two families and two lives.</LD>
<LD>   It was a Saturday afternoon and 3-year-old Leticia, 16-year-old
Jorge and their six brothers and sisters whose ages fall in between
-- Nan, Noe, Marisol, David, Oscar and Armando -- were with their
birth mother, Maria, for the weekly visit social workers had
arranged. Months earlier, according to interviews and documents,
Maria had stopped taking her medicine for epilepsy and depression.
When she landed in the hospital, Los Angeles County's Department of
Children and Family Services put the children in foster homes.</LD>
<LD>   Now Maria saw her offspring only on weekends, when three sets of
foster parents ferried them to this Hacienda Heights park. That
afternoon, when one of the kids booted the ball into a neighboring
home's backyard, Maria urged Noe to get it. One of the foster fathers
ordered Noe down. With the dog yapping, Noe glanced in confusion from
his mother to this new authority and back before finally abandoning
the ball.</LD>
<TE>   By evening, Maria had returned to Whittier, where the family had
lived. The children were back to their foster homes in Riverside
County's Moreno Valley and the San Bernardino County towns of Colton
and Fontana. And that's where they remain while their social workers,
sagging under the weight of rules, regulations and caseloads of 40
children or more, crisscross three counties attempting to knit the
unraveling clan back together -- all the while debating, no doubt,
whether they are on a taxpayer-funded fool's errand.</TE>
<TE>   What's Best for the Kids</TE>
<TE>   The law and common sense prescribe that when a parent makes an
effort to do his or her job, the county must also make a serious
effort to knit the failing family back together before forever
removing a child. Social workers call this "family reunification."</TE>
<TE>   In the small yard of the Fontana foster home in which they now
live, four of Maria's children show off the tomatoes and flowers they
put in the soil with their own hands. But the transplanted siblings
-- Nan, 15, Marisol, 12, David, 10, and Oscar, 6 -- can't entirely
shake the frightening sense of being uprooted that came when social
workers pulled them from their mother's home.</TE>
<TE>   No reasonable adult would doubt that the children are better off
now. The question social workers still struggle to answer, however,
is: What can be done to give them the best shot at a happy, healthy
life? The default answer -- the one that costs taxpayers the least,
as it happens -- should be: Restore the original family, if at all
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Simple geography ranks high among the catalog of problems that
keep the Department of Children and Family Services from doing that
as often as it should for the 50,000 children in its charge.</TE>
<TE>   Noe and his brother Jorge are happy in their bustling home in
Colton, with its cheery Christmas lights and other foster and adopted
children who create a familiar cacophony. But they miss their
friends. "The streets here," Noe says softly, "seem lonely for some
reason." And they fret constantly about their siblings, peppering a
social worker with questions that lingered after their last meeting
in the park: Why was Leticia's hair messed up? Is Oscar doing his
reading?</TE>
<TE>   In trying to meet the needs of Maria's children while the county
wrestles with reuniting the clan, their social worker must drive a
loop of almost 150 miles, heading from Santa Fe Springs to Fontana,
to Colton and then out the Riverside Freeway to Moreno Valley. Maria,
still in Whittier, is too far away to attend her children's weekly
group therapy sessions. If the agency had been able to find homes for
the children near Whittier, the kids could see more of each other and
their mom. And their social workers might have more time for the kids
-- time to go beyond the basics by visiting their teachers, perhaps.
Group therapy, family meetings and doctor and dentist visits would be
vastly simplified and more productive. The children would have the
stabilizing continuity of friends and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Using mainly state and federal funds, the county gives a set
amount of money to foster parents for each child's food, clothing and
other expenses. Good foster parents lose money on the deal. So
finding volunteers is hard, and the county has largely relegated the
job to private recruiting companies.</TE>
<TE>   Now the county needs to change these companies' habit of mining
families where they increasingly are settling: far from the urban
core. Because a familiar, supportive community is the next best thing
to crackerjack birth parents, when contracts expire in April, the
agency needs to renegotiate with the companies that provide most
foster homes and demand that they recruit more local foster families.</TE>
<TE>   Foster Parents as Pros</TE>
<TE>   The department should also follow Illinois' example and
professionalize a corps of highly trained foster parents. Subsidizing
their housing costs or paying them a modest salary -- particularly
those who take in kids with severe emotional difficulties -- is a
better bargain than the $40,000 the county pays to keep a child in a
group home, and better for the kids, too.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to prevent the time drain that comes from social
workers pinballing from, say, Lancaster to San Pedro in one day, is
for the county to find and fully staff regional offices in the
neighborhoods with the most need and recruit more local therapists
and tutors to serve neighborhood children accordingly. As things
stand, astonishingly, children in South-Central Los Angeles, where
there's plenty of need, are visited by workers stationed in Torrance
and other suburban offices. Ultimately, though, trying to put a
family back together isn't as smart as making an effort to keep whole
any family not blatantly beyond redemption.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, child welfare agencies in Oregon and New York
and in other countries do a much better job than Los Angeles County
of using such tactics as "family conferencing" -- a process that
gathers relatives, friends and others to create a plan to help
parents conquer the alcoholism, domestic violence and other miseries
they have visited upon their children before thrusting a child into
the vast bureaucratic "family" of foster care.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, however, L.A. County's Department of Children and
Family Services has been too eager to drag parents to dependency
court, where due process, including presumed innocence, is subjugated
to the interests of protecting a child.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has cause for outrage when the county uses its
extraordinary power to break family bonds and then fails to give the
children something better. But no one could suggest that Maria didn't
have, and miss, opportunities to keep her family intact -- a sad
social work reality.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas Season Chaos</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, days before Christmas, Maria signed a "Voluntary
Family Maintenance Service Plan." The department sent therapists and
social workers to teach Maria how to keep a cleaner house and make
sure she got her medicine. They drove her kids to school when needed
and made sure they were clean and got their eyes checked.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this, according to records and interviews, motivated
Maria to take care of her children or herself. Instead, she foundered
and fought with Javier, the youngest children's father. Jorge, now a
bright, articulate 16-year-old, remembers fleeing outside to avoid
the battles. "Shut up!" he shouted. "The little kids are getting
scared!"</TE>
<TE>   Just after Thanksgiving last year, an agency "teaching and
demonstrating instructor" arrived for a regular visit and found Maria
in a stupor. Social workers drove her to the hospital. They'd deemed
Javier, who was living elsewhere, unreliable. So they took the kids
to the Santa Fe Springs county child welfare office, where the
youngest played with dolls and toy cars while the others watched the
social workers pore through files and pound their phones' keypads. By
night, the team had parceled the children out to foster homes.</TE>
<TE>   Noe remembers waking up the next morning in Colton, longing for
his siblings, overwhelmed with sadness, thinking it must all have
been a dream. "How could this happen to us?" he repeatedly asked
himself. "Our family was perfect."</TE>

<LD>Re "Hundreds Are Detained After Visits to INS," Dec. 19: I believe
these people have no fundamental civil rights. They have entered our
country illegally and should be deported to where they came from.
They are crying about how badly they are being treated in our
country; let them go back to their own country and ask for their
civil rights. Anyone who enters this country illegally takes a chance
at being detained. You are not supposed to be here illegally and then
apply for legal status. It's time for this country to start putting
its citizens first and foremost. Those at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are finally doing their job and protecting the
citizens of this country. Unfortunately, it took Sept. 11 for them to
get off their behinds.</LD>

<TE>   The INS states that this action is to help with its accountability
of immigrants who lack green cards? Who are they kidding? If that was
its true intention, then it should be requiring all immigrants to
comply with this regulation. If terrorism is its true concern, which
it isn't, then Saudi Arabia should have been first on the list. After
the registering of all these men, what next? Registering the women
and children from these countries? Deportation? ID tags? Maybe camps
a la Manzanar? Such a nice 60-year-old flashback.</TE>

<TE>   It seems to me that the only people complaining are the ones who
have to register. Kudos to the INS for at last starting enforcement
of our immigration laws. Poll after poll shows that over 60% of
Americans want immigration reduced. It is time to deport these people
who are here illegally. When will the INS require other foreigners to
register? The sooner the better!</TE>

<HD>A Rescue Mission for Harrier Aircraft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your series on the Harrier aircraft was superb (Dec. 15-18). You have
poignantly brought to our attention a situation that begs for
attention. As I read about some of the failures, I realized that at
least some of them could have been avoided by using oversight. This
is a process used for the Air Force's space programs (and probably
others), whereby an independent team of experts reviews and assesses
the contractors' design, manufacturing, inspection and testing plans
before fabrication starts. Based on my own experience at the
Aerospace Corp. (where I organized and headed the manufacturing
engineering office), many problems would be prevented.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a retired Navy officer who spent much of his career serving
with Marines, I have witnessed the single-minded drive to what you
aptly call the "vertical vision" within the corps. To your
observation that the roots of the argument are in the Marines'
oft-voiced concern that they'll be "abandoned" by Navy forces, I'd
add that this claim is unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents my brethren in the corps glibly cite as evidence
are false: On those occasions during World War II (the only war ever
discussed) when Navy shipping was withdrawn from the beach area
during amphibious operations, the withdrawal was temporary, after the
major ground assault was over, and only with Marine commanders'
concurrence. Furthermore, and highly relevant to the current naval
aviation debate, Navy aircraft were routinely taken from their
carrier bases and stationed at the Marine expeditionary airfields
alongside Marine planes. (In those days, it was possible to base
aircraft at unimproved fields, and the Navy and Marines flew
identical planes.) However, Marines have routinely fallen back on the
"they'll abandon us" argument in their budget campaigns, usually to
the desired effect.</TE>
<TE>   Having said this, I hasten to add that the vertical vision is a
fundamentally sound one. The V-22 will revolutionize our ability to
fight the kind of wars this unstable new century will spawn. And the
unrealized goal of a tactical fighter capable of moving from a sea
base to the front is valid, if unrealized in the Harrier. In fact,
the Navy needs to get on board with the vision, realizing that the
VSTOL [vertical/short take-off and landing] fighter and V-22
multipurpose airframe will free it from the burden of large,
expensive aircraft carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The British have routinely criticized the Marines for inadequately
training Harrier pilots. They realized early in the plane's history
that it required far more intensive and specialized training to
handle the Harrier than the Navy/Marine pipeline for tactical jets
provides.</TE>

<TE>   As a ground-pounding U.S. Army Vietnam veteran, I can tell you
there is no sweeter sound than that of inbound Navy jets en route to
bail you out of a bad situation. Need a hero? Look no further than
the heart-wrenching photographs of these brave young Marines, and
those who step up to take their place. These men are the best of
America. God bless!</TE>

<LD>Re "No Break for City's Gun Dealers," Dec. 19: Outrageous! I second
the plea for information on where the money from the 1,000% increase
in police-permit fees is going. L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss and
his compatriots must be idiots. According to the article, "He said
the fees are needed to ensure firearms dealers follow the law."</LD>
<LD>   So crime prevention is their goal? Then perhaps this wise City
Council should assess similar fees on the muggers, rapists and
murderers who flock to this "murder capital" for its easy pickings.
After all, they're in "business" as well and should be given equal
treatment under the law. Such action would provide the much-needed
money to put them out of business -- as I am sure is the city's
intention for law-abiding gun dealers.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The 13th Juror," Commentary, Dec. 18: I have served on nine
juries, some of them as the chair, so I have some basis for my
comments. I personally would resent the intrusion of a camera into
deliberations, and I have no doubt that cameras would have a chilling
effect on most jurors and evoke theatricality from a few others.</LD>
<LD>   The sanctity of a jury room is very important and no one, not even
the judge, is privy to these discussions. This process creates an
atmosphere where jurors may speak their minds, back up, change their
minds, ask questions, conduct straw votes, argue and cooperate in
rendering a fair and impartial decision without their every move
being subject to second-guessing by outsiders. Cameras would destroy
this atmosphere. They're a bad idea.</LD>

<TE>   I served as a jury foreman in a criminal matter that went to a
verdict. Our jury was instructed as to how to interpret the law, was
given the physical evidence and then asked to reach a verdict. What
started out as an orderly discussion turned tumultuous, and some
jurors were reluctant to vote by raising their hands because of the
fear of being browbeaten to vote with the majority. We voted in
secret ballots and honesty prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras at the deliberations would be questionable, at best.
Cameras in the deliberations would multiply grounds for appeals and
cause even more case overload for the Court of Appeals. Can you
imagine an appeal based upon an utterance, facial expression or body
motion of a juror during deliberations? Don't laugh, the "expert"
psychologists are lining up.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Chief Proposes Ban on Majority of Police Pursuits," Dec. 17:
In your Dec. 8 Opinion section you ran a piece about new technical
discoveries, " 'Sci-Fi' Weapons Going to War," and one item described
was an invention called a "directed energy" weapon. The article
stated that the military was working on a device that could scramble
or disable the electronic functions of a car engine when pointed at
the vehicle. This would in effect disable the engine of a fleeing
auto without danger to anyone involved. It would seem that this kind
of device should be supported by citizens, police and government
agencies across the country. It wouldn't be unreasonable for states
to supply funding to assist in the final development of such a
device.</LD>

<HD>A Formula to Reduce Number of Gas Guzzlers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The administration's plan to increase the average gas mileage for
SUVs, vans and light trucks 1.5 miles per gallon by 2007 is too
little, too late (Dec. 13). Our nation's plans to reduce dependence
on foreign oil since the OPEC embargo in the '70s are being
compromised by the increasing population of gas-guzzling SUVs and
pickups.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it is time to include these vehicles under the same
federal tax formula paid by consumers for passenger cars that are
classified as gas guzzlers. Since most light trucks, especially SUVs,
are used for the same purposes as cars, they should be treated the
same to discourage the production and purchase of these
fuel-inefficient vehicles. Pickup trucks that are used for a business
or farm could be exempted.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, I am sure that this will not happen, as the
domestic manufacturers seem only able to compete with the imports by
building large, oversized, relatively unsophisticated, gas-guzzling
trucks.</LD>

<LD>I decided it was a pleasant day to go for a walk and deliver our
Christmas cards personally to each neighbor's house. Because few were
home, I let my little boy run up to the door and drop them into the
mailbox or door slot. It was a lovely thing to do. The trip made me
feel a deep kinship with my neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Later that day the mailman came round to our door and scolded us,
saying that we'd get a fine if we ever did that again.</LD>
<LD>   I suppose I understand why such a rule exists, as our boxes might
be clogged with even more junk mail. But to fine someone for dropping
a friendly Christmas card into a neighbor's box? Seemed downright
silly to me.</LD>
<TE>   Then I got mad. It is downright scary to find out that we were
violating a federal law by our friendly gesture. (I found the mail
regulation on the U.S. Postal Service Web site). In this day and age,
we need as much neighborhood unity as possible.</TE>

<HD>Charles E. Fraser, 73; Influential Developer of Hilton Head
Island</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developer Charles E. Fraser, whose vision helped transform South
Carolina's Hilton Head Island from a sparsely populated sea island
into a world-class resort, died Dec. 15 in a boating accident south
of the Bahamas. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Fraser and his wife, Mary Wyman Stone Fraser, were on a day trip
on a chartered boat, the Sundance, out of the Turks and Caicos
Islands when an explosion threw them and two other passengers into
the sea. Mary Fraser was injured but survived.</LD>
<LD>   An alumnus of the University of Georgia, Fraser graduated from
Yale Law School in 1953 and, four years later, created Sea Pines
Plantation, a luxurious master-planned residential development and
resort on Hilton Head Island, at the southern tip of the state near
Savannah, Ga. The development made an important tourist destination
and golf center out of an island that had previously had just a
hunting lodge and a few resident farmers and fishermen.</LD>
<TE>   In the decades since, Hilton Head has grown to become the
ninth-largest city in South Carolina, with a population of almost
34,000, and attracts millions of vacationers a year.</TE>
<TE>   With its golf courses, gated subdivisions, multimillion-dollar
beach homes, boutiques and restaurants, it became a model for resort
communities around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Under his leadership, Fraser's company also planned and initiated
development of Amelia Island Plantation in Florida; River Hills
Plantation and Kiawah Island Resort in South Carolina; Brandermill in
Chesterfield County, Va.; and Palmas del Mar in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Fraser was chairman of Sea Pines from 1956 through 1983. At the
time of his death, he was president of Charles E. Fraser Co., which
provides planning services to developers. He and his family were also
instrumental in creating the Heritage Classic, a PGA-sponsored event
on Hilton Head, in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Fraser's survivors include two daughters,
a brother and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Wheeler North, 80; Helped Save Kelp Beds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wheeler North, a marine biologist who developed techniques to
reforest the depleted kelp beds off the coast of Southern California,
and pioneered the use of scuba diving as a basic research tool for
marine scientists, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   He had been in frail health for some years and died Friday at Hoag
Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Raised in La Jolla, one of two children of a mining engineer,
North became fascinated by marine life as a boy and began to probe
the tide pools near his family's home when he was 7. His first
underwater adventure was a 10-minute excursion in 1949, as an
undergraduate at California Technical Institute in Pasadena. He
remembered it vividly for the rest of his life.</LD>
<TE>   Wearing long woolen underwear for lack of a wet suit, and an "aqua
lung," a breathing device that preceded modern scuba gear, North
waded into the water off La Jolla Cove.</TE>
<TE>   "I only went down 10 feet," he recalled in 1995. "But even at that
shallow depth, I was immersed in a remarkable community. Fish of all
kinds slowly passed by, instead of fleeing like animals do on land.
Eelgrass and kelp swayed with the current. I was mesmerized."</TE>
<TE>   A serious fall down a seaside cliff put an end to diving for some
time, and caused him to limp for the rest of his life. North broke
his back in the fall, and the family dog, Benny, saved him by going
for help as the tide rolled in around him.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, North was excavating caves above the shoreline. A
notorious packrat, he stored his collection of specimens, bottles,
motors and other "musts" in the natural recesses. As he filled one
cave, he went in search of another. He was in the process of digging
out a new cave when the cliff gave way.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Caltech with degrees in electrical
engineering and biology, North entered the doctoral program at the
Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego. He studied marine
ecology with special attention to the kelp beds off the Southern
California coast and the effects of the sea urchin population upon
them.</TE>
<TE>   In later years he also researched kelp as an alternative fuel, and
tracked the effects of several major oil spills on marine life. The
week of his death he was writing his findings on a spill of diesel
fuel off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1957 that he had been
monitoring from the time of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   After completing his doctorate at Cambridge University in 1955,
North returned to Scripps with a grant to further his studies. "I was
the only diving PhD around," he said to explain how he got funding
for his somewhat obscure research. He also began to offer scuba
diving lessons to research scientists, partly so that his own
assistants could accompany him under water.</TE>
<TE>   An El Nino condition in 1957 led to a breakthrough discovery for
North and his colleagues. The kelp forests at Point Loma and Palos
Verdes were in decline. Hordes of sea urchins were feasting on them.
The question was: Did the warm waters brought on by El Nino encourage
the urchins?</TE>
<TE>   North camped on the beach for a week, diving and observing each
day. He concluded that sewage being pumped into the ocean, not an El
Nino condition, supported the increase in sea urchins.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague suggested using quicklime to control the problem.
Sprinkled on the water it sank to the bottom, scorched and killed the
urchins. Immediately, the kelp began to flourish. But the lime
apparently affected other marine life adversely as well.</TE>
<TE>   North suggested a different technique and received a grant to test
it. He and his assistants hammered, or "mashed" the urchins to death.
The technique is still used.</TE>
<TE>   His determination to preserve the kelp forests came out of his
research. North proved that they are part of a complex marine
ecosystem providing food and shelter for hundreds of underwater
species. His techniques for reforestation and laboratory cultivation
of kelp are now considered the standard. They are among techniques
used by the Marine Forests Society, a group North helped to found in
1986, to replace damaged marine habitats. "The kelp beds off Southern
California are in the best condition since 1922, the beginning of
their monitoring," North's longtime colleague Charles Mitchell told
The Times on Friday. "Water temperatures and nutrients have also
contributed to their health."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell first worked with North as an assistant in 1956 and
referred to him as his adopted father. North helped him to found MBC
Applied Environmental Sciences, a marine biology consulting firm in
Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   By 1963, North's reputation as a scientist reached international
scope. Caltech invited him to join its environmental engineering
group and he accepted, although he spent more time at the Institute's
Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory in Corona del Mar than on the Pasadena
campus. During those years, he reforested kelp beds off the coast of
San Diego and Palos Verdes by planting laboratory cultivated kelp, or
transplanting it from elsewhere. He also developed a deep-sea kelp
farm where he could explore the use of kelp as an alternative energy
source.</TE>
<TE>   North wrote about his work for the August 1972 issue of National
Geographic:</TE>
<TE>   "Creatures bizarre and beautiful swarm about me. Overhead, the
tangled foliage almost obscures the daylight.</TE>
<TE>   "But I need no tree climbing irons; only fins. The air I breathe
is carried on my back. I am a scuba forester and the 'trees' I tend
are giant, vine-like streamers from the ocean floor off Southern
California."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Leahy, director of the Kerckhoff Laboratory, met North 28
years ago when he got his first job there. He knew North by
reputation, but was surprised by what he saw. North was inclined to
wear shoes with torn soles that flapped on the sidewalk and clothes
that appeared to be castoffs from a recycle bin. "If you saw Wheeler
standing in line, you'd think he was just some schmo," Leahy told the
Orange County Register in 1995. "He doesn't pay much attention to his
personal appearance."</TE>
<TE>   What impressed Leahy was North's integrity as a scientist. "He was
dedicated to his work," Leahy told The Times on Friday. In recent
years, when North struggled with lymphoma as well as persistent back
problems, Leahy said, "he was still determined to get around. He wore
himself out."</TE>
<TE>   North is survived by his second wife, Barbara, a son and a
daughter. He divorced his first wife, Nance, in 1960.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Owens, 65, a former Utah congressman who worked to foster peace
in the Middle East, was found dead Wednesday in Israel, according to
the State Department.</LD>
<LD>   A Democrat, Owens served four terms in Congress, beginning in
1972. He later helped launch the Center for Middle East Peace and
Economic Cooperation, a Washington D.C.-based group focused on
bringing peace to the region through economic development and
improving communications between policymakers.</LD>
<LD>   He had been in Israel on business when his body was discovered on
a beach in Tel Aviv Wednesday night. A spokesman for the State
Department's Consular Affairs Bureau said Owens apparently died of
natural causes.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Panguitch, Utah, Owens' accomplishments in Congress
included fighting to protect 5 million acres of Utah wilderness and
legislation to compensate those who became ill from radioactive
fallout from nuclear weapons testing in Nevada. As a member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, he was an advocate for Middle East
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Owens left the House in 1992 after two unsuccessful bids for the
U.S. Senate and a run for Utah governor. He spent much of the last
decade meeting with Middle East leaders as president of the Center
for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation. Among the projects
his group fostered was building some large water desalination plants
to help the Palestinians control their own water resources.</TE>

<HD>William Farrell, 81; Marine Combat Pilot in Three Wars</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Farrell, 81, a Marine Corps fighter pilot who served in World
War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, died Dec. 12 at Mission
Hospital in Mission Viejo of complications from a fall.</LD>
<LD>   Farrell was born in New Jersey, but his parents moved to Los
Angeles the next year when he developed double pneumonia and doctors
recommended a warm, dry climate.</LD>
<LD>   He entered military flight school at age 20 and, on graduation two
years later, he was stationed at Okinawa, Japan. Soon after he
arrived, Farrell was flying a security mission with three other
pilots when they encountered 39 Japanese aircraft. In the ensuing
battle, 17 Japanese planes were shot down.</LD>
<TE>   Farrell and his wing leader were credited with downing a total of
nine, which earned them the status of ace -- the title given to
pilots who incapacitate at least five planes in aerial combat. Both
pilots also were awarded the Navy Cross.</TE>
<TE>   In the Korean conflict, Farrell most often flew night missions,
and in Vietnam, he supplied air support for ground troops. With close
to 400 combat missions to his credit, he retired from military
service in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 20 years, Farrell worked as a substitute teacher in
the Tustin School District.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Barr, 81, a network television executive who began as an actor
and then became a respected acting coach and founder of Film Actors
Workshop, died Thursday in Palm Desert after a lingering illness.</LD>
<LD>   After small roles in films and television programs in the 1950s,
Barr became a vice president, first at ABC and then at CBS, where he
headed the development of television series, mini-series and movies
until 1987. In his capacity as executive producer for the network, he
supervised such series as "Magnum, P.I." and "Simon &amp; Simon."</LD>
<LD>   In 1961, Barr also established the Film Actors Workshop, which is
still functioning. Among the actors he trained were Jon Lovitz and
Mike Farrell. In 1982, Barr published the book "Acting for the
Camera," which a Times reviewer called "a first-class book for the
beginner and a refreshing review for any pro."</LD>
<TE>   Barr was a member of the Directors Guild of America, the Screen
Actors Guild and the board of governors of the National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences.</TE>

<HD>Don Turano, 72; Sculptor of Reagan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Turano, 72, a nationally recognized sculptor whose work included
commissions at the Washington National Cathedral and a bust of Ronald
Reagan for his presidential library in Simi Valley, died of cancer
Dec. 1 at the Warsaw, Va., Health Care Center.</LD>
<LD>   Turano worked in materials that included stone, terra cotta,
bronze and wood, and on a scale that ranged from small bronze medals
to 1-ton tablets. The life-size bust of Reagan began with a model
Turano created at the end of the president's administration.
Completed in white marble by master carver Vincent Palumbo, the bust
is now in the Reagan Library.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Turano said he first met Reagan at the White
House in August 1988 and was amazed at the encounter.</LD>
<TE>   "I was sitting down when he walked in, and he looked gigantic,"
Turano said. "Shoulders out to here -- too much shoulder to get into
the portrait. His shoes looked like size 14! And he couldn't have
been nicer. He was relaxed and friendly and didn't put on any airs."</TE>
<TE>   Turano worked for several months from photos and caliper
measurements and took the bust back to the White House for a final
sitting. "Must I look so stern?" Reagan asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President," the sculptor said, "this is going to be carved in
marble, and if we did you smiling, a hundred years from now, people
would look at this and ask, 'What does he know that we don't?' "
Reagan shrugged, said OK, and sat down.</TE>
<TE>   Turano created works for the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library, the
U.S. Court of Appeals, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National
Geographic Society, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in
Washington, the World Trade Center, the National Institutes of
Health, and religious institutions and banks across the country.</TE>
<TE>   He sculpted bronze medals for the Federal Aviation Administration,
the AFL-CIO, the Interior Department and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. Among his silver medal commissions was the
Louis Sullivan Award for Architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Turano exhibited at galleries, government agencies, universities
and other venues. They included the Corcoran Gallery, the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Xerox Corp. headquarters in
Rochester, N.Y., and the Smithsonian Institution.</TE>
<TE>   He also worked at a Washington advertising agency and taught at
George Washington University, the Corcoran School of Art, the
Sculptors Studio and other schools.</TE>
<TE>   Turano was a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., and a graduate of what is
now the New York School of Painting and Sculpture. He also studied at
the Corcoran, the Skohegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine
and the Rinehart School of Sculpture in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Washington during the Korean War while serving in the
Army. He was assigned to Walter Reed, where he made prosthetics for
wounded soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, the sculptor worked out of a downtown Washington
studio. He also operated a foundry in Paris, Va., and was a
consultant to foundries in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He was a member of the National Sculpture Society, the Sculpture
Center in Washington, the American Medallic Sculptors Assn. and the
Washington Religious Arts Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Turano was briefly married and then divorced in New York. Three
later marriages also ended in divorce.</TE>

<HD>Calavo Growers See Profit Double on Higher Prices</HD>
<DH>Sales in the first quarter, however, would be affected by a
fruit fly quarantine in San Diego County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Avocado handler Calavo Growers Inc. said that higher prices helped
double fourth-quarter profit despite slightly slower sales due to an
earlier harvest. But a fruit fly quarantine in San Diego County is
expected to affect first-quarter sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Ana-based firm, which went from growers cooperative to a
public company in the summer, earned $1.2 million, or 10 cents a
share, for the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31. That's double the net
income of $608,000, or 6 cents, from the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   For the year, Calavo's net income rose 82% to $6.9 million, or 60
cents a share, versus $3.8 million, or 37 cents, in the previous
fiscal year.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks like we are on track to have another good year," said
Chairman Lee Cole, noting that Calavo has gained market share and
lowered its costs by recruiting more grower-suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast port disruptions had little effect on the firm's
bottom line, Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he warned that sales in the company's first quarter would
be flat or slightly down because of a Mexican fruit fly quarantine in
Valley Center in San Diego County. Growers there supply Calavo with
about 15 million to 20 million pounds of avocados a year.</TE>
<TE>   Those avocados, he said, still would be harvested and sold but
later next year. To make up for the reduced Southern California
avocado crop, Calavo plans to import more Chilean and Mexican
avocados, Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   And Calavo plans to sell more of the imports year-round because
their low prices make them a big seller both here and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that helped us have a successful year" was
sales of Mexican avocados to Japan and Europe, Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, he expects greater sales in key supermarket accounts
from a new just-in-time delivery program that delivers avocados to
stores ripe and ready to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Calavo's frozen guacamole, however, were a weak spot
during the fourth quarter, declining 9% to $7.4 million. The company
is in the midst of adding high-pressure pasteurization equipment in
order to sell fresh guacamole.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Calavo rose 4 cents to $6.79 on Nasdaq on Friday.
Earnings were released after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Shaves Shipping Costs</HD>
<DH>The No. 3 automaker saves time and money by tackling
problems in getting its vehicles from the factory to dealers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Chrysler Group has cut transportation costs 15% in two years by
sharing trucks and train cars with other units of DaimlerChrysler,
redesigning models and getting vehicles to dealers faster, executives
said.</LD>
<LD>   The measures will help cut shipping costs, which account for as
much as a fifth of the cost of a new car or truck, by 5% next year,
said David Hodgson, who oversees worldwide logistics for the
U.S.-German company.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler Group -- maker of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles -- is
trying to trim expenses to compete as North American automakers spend
more offering rebates, low interest rates and other incentives.</LD>
<TE>   The unit has used transportation and other savings to trim its
five-year product development costs to $30 billion from $40 billion
while adding five models, Chrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche has
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Automotive logistics is one of the most inefficient systems on
the planet," said Dan Poole, vice president of equity research at
National City Corp., which manages $23 billion, including shares of
DaimlerChrysler. "This all makes sense. The only thing embarrassing
for the industry is that it wasn't done 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   A year-old joint venture with Union Pacific Corp. has contributed
much of the savings because Chrysler Group can identify
transportation problems more quickly, Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 3 U.S. automaker has cut the time it takes to get a model
from the factory to the dealership to nine days from 12, cutting
about $5 a day from the cost of shipping an auto, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgson is seeking ways to coordinate schedules for auto-related
products among Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Freightliner and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp., the Japanese automaker that is 37% owned by
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler shaved $20 from the cost of its 2003 Neon by persuading
designers to make the small car half an inch shorter, allowing more
of the cars to fit in a truck, the executive said. That will amount
to $2.5 million next year on unit sales of 125,000 to 130,000.</TE>
<TE>   The company has started loading Jeeps destined for Baltimore from
Toledo, Ohio, on Mercedes-Benz trucks that have just carried cars to
the Midwest from Baltimore. Jeeps used to go by train from Toledo,
and the trucks returned to Baltimore empty. The move cut transport
costs 70%, Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler ships about 11,000 cars and trucks a day from its
factories to dealerships and accepts more than 70,000 shipments of
parts at its plants, Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares rose 56 cents Friday to $30.89 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>CSC Tells Workers to Take a Vacation</HD>
<DH>In a cost-saving move as demand slows, the computer
services firm says all must take a paid week off by March 28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Employees of Computer Sciences Corp. must use their vacation days to
take a week off between Dec. 30 and March 28 to help the El Segundo
computer services company save money as its sales and profit slow.</LD>
<LD>   Computer Sciences had asked employees to take vacation for
Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks, the company said in a memo sent to
employees and posted on the Web site Internalmemos.com. Employees who
lack enough vacation time to take another week off before March 28
will have a "negative vacation balance until they accrue more
vacation over time," the memo said.</LD>
<LD>   "It is very common practice for American industry to require some
employees to take paid vacations during slow times of the year," said
company spokesman Mike Dickerson. "The memo does not in any way
accurately reflect the company's consolidated financial condition."</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Van Honeycutt said last month that demand for
information-technology services in North America isn't improving, and
corporate customers have ordered fewer add-on services. Last month,
the company reduced its profit forecast for the third quarter ending
this month to about 60 cents a share. The average Thomson First Call
analyst estimate had been 69 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our financials continue to be weaker than anticipated though we
have implemented a number of cost-cutting programs such as reducing
travel and training costs as well as layoffs," the company said in
the memo.</TE>
<TE>   CSC shares Friday fell 35 cents to $34.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have fallen 29% this year.</TE>

<HD>DVD Bonanza Spins Unrest</HD>
<DH>Soaring disc sales are prompting Hollywood unions to
agitate for a bigger piece of the pie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is one bonus feature on DVDs that Hollywood studios aren't
advertising: a likely rise in labor tension due to the sudden
explosion in digital disc sales.</LD>
<LD>   The key point of disagreement is a contractual formula that keeps
the largest share of studio DVD and videocassette revenue from
counting toward residuals, the payments triggered when a film is sold
in various formats after showing in theaters.</LD>
<LD>   Looking ahead to a contract negotiation still more than a year
away, Writers Guild of America Assistant Executive Director Cheryl
Rhoden promised: "The issue of DVDs will be at the top of our list."</LD>
<TE>   The focus on DVDs isn't surprising, given that some hit films now
enjoy first-weekend disc sales that are even bigger than their
box-office openings. Sony Pictures Entertainment's "Spider-Man," for
instance, rang up more than $190 million in DVD sales on its first
weekend, compared with record ticket sales of $115 million during its
first weekend in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the film industry shipped 425.6 million DVDs in North
America through the end of September, far outstripping sales for all
of 2001, with this year's holiday season yet to be counted. Guilds
and unions won't have solid numbers for 2002 until next year because
of a reporting lag.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the DVD boom already is providing some benefits to
Hollywood labor: Discs are putting extra cash into the pockets of
actors, directors and writers, while bolstering the pension and
health plans of Hollywood's blue-collar workers.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Gaffner, an attorney for the International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employes, said the amount flowing into the union's
health and pension fund from video and DVD sales will exceed $200
million this year, compared with $165 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Screen Actors Guild said the combined growth in its payments
from video and DVDs had been averaging about 6% but that is likely to
be greater this year because of the flood of hot-selling discs.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the WGA said its annual kitty for writers from DVDs
and videocassettes comes to about $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Through October, that number is up about 8%, and it's likely to
rise even further when fourth-quarter DVD sales are tabulated.</TE>
<TE>   The boost from DVDs is particularly welcome for those working in
Hollywood because the movie and television residuals pool has
stagnated in recent years, with the slowdown in foreign and
videocassette markets.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, the DVD explosion is focusing new attention
on the industry's method of dividing the pie -- and labor is
determined to grab a bigger slice.</TE>
<TE>   Under deals worked out in contracts dating back to the early
1980s, when the videocassette business was just taking off, studios
can exclude 80 cents out of every $1 in wholesale revenue from
counting toward residuals. The theory: This offset reflects the cost
of making, marketing and distributing a video.</TE>
<TE>   Studios say that video and DVD sales are an integral part of a
movie's revenue package and often determine whether a film even makes
money. Rather than view such income as a surplus to be "taxed" by the
guilds, the companies say it is needed to fund new projects and cover
a vast array of costs.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that the latest rise in DVD sales could flatten
quickly once buyers have replaced their libraries of videocassettes
with discs.</TE>
<TE>   Both writers and actors tried to make the exclusion a central
issue in their hard-fought 2001 negotiations, but the studios
wouldn't budge.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never liked" the way the money is carved up "and still
don't believe the 80% exclusion has ever been justified," said Chuck
Slocum, chief strategist for the Writers Guild.</TE>
<TE>   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which
speaks for the industry on labor matters, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current system, about 3 cents of every $1 in wholesale
revenue goes to the workforce. Once the 80% exclusion is lopped off,
writers and directors each get about 1.8% of what's left.</TE>
<TE>   Actors get 3.6% because there are more of them. About 5.4% goes to
the pension and health funds of blue-collar workers such as grips,
lighting technicians and electricians. (In addition, big-name talent
often cuts lucrative deals that far exceed guild payments.)</TE>
<TE>   Labor unions find the exclusion especially galling because DVDs
are cheaper to make than are videocassettes. They also contend that
many DVDs are reissues of movies that were paid for long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We negotiate this type of payment recognizing that the medium is
growing," said Pamm Fair, a national director for the Screen Actors
Guild.</TE>
<TE>   "But you never realize exactly what the potential is until you
live it. Obviously, we'll take a closer look at this provision of the
contract to make sure our members are getting their share of the
growth."</TE>
<TE>   Also eyeing the growth closely are Hollywood agents. Under an
expired "franchise" agreement that long governed relations between
agents and the Screen Actors Guild, agents didn't get commissions on
DVD deals.</TE>
<TE>   If the current stalemate over a new arrangement between the two
sides ever thaws, agents are likely to push again for a cut of their
clients' latest gold mine.</TE>
<TE>   "This somewhat new but huge growth industry is permitting
employers to offer less money upfront to actors, with the carrot of
new revenue streams coming in from the home entertainment market down
the road," said Karen Stuart, executive director of the Assn. of
Talent Agents.</TE>

<HD>Average Gasoline Price Climbs 3 Cents a Gallon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices rose nearly 3 cents a gallon in the last two weeks,
an industry analyst said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The average weighted price at the pump nationwide, including all
grades and taxes, was about $1.45 a gallon Friday, according to the
Lundberg Survey of 8,000 stations nationwide. Gasoline cost about
$1.42 a gallon on average Dec. 6, the date of the previous such
survey.</LD>
<LD>   A crippling strike by Venezuelan oil producers, refiners and
shippers drove up the price of crude oil, contributing to the cost
hike at the retail level, Camarillo-based analyst Trilby Lundberg
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Crude oil prices are responding to a near halt of supplies from
Venezuela," she said, noting that the South American producer is the
fourth-largest supplier of imported oil to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term oil futures in New York have risen 11% since the start
of the Venezuelan strike, from $27.24 a barrel Dec. 2 to $30.30 on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Continued instability in Venezuela and the threat of war in the
Middle East could push fuel prices higher next month, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Although prices were up Friday, the final survey of the year, the
average price for a gallon of gasoline was about 9 cents lower in
2002 than in 2001 and about 16 cents lower than in 2000, Lundberg
said. On average, gasoline cost $1.39 a gallon this year.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.41 a gallon for regular,
$1.51 for mid-grade and $1.60 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Seeks to Revive Sales, Reinvent Itself</HD>
<DH>With its share of the PC market slipping fast, its strategy
includes extending 'beyond the box'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOLEDO, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Ray Stanton is a perfect customer for Gateway Inc.</LD>
<LD>   When he started looking last week for a computer for his
81-year-old mother, he didn't expect to buy one. But after visiting
the Gateway store here, he walked out with his mom's first PC -- a
$1,500 system complete with a flat-panel screen and a combination
printer and scanner.</LD>
<LD>   "The staff was very courteous and extremely knowledgeable -- more
than at the fast-moving, off-the-shelf retailers," Stanton said.</LD>
<TE>   Gateway, based in the San Diego suburb of Poway, needs a lot more
customers like Stanton. And it needs them fast.</TE>
<TE>   The company's revenue has plummeted from $9.6 billion in 2000 to
an estimated $4.4 billion this year. Chief Executive Ted Waitt has
acknowledged that Gateway must rack up strong sales during the
holiday shopping season if it is to have any hope of keeping its
full-year loss under $250 million. Those dismal results would come on
top of a staggering $1.03-billion deficit for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need a strong couple of weeks as we exit this quarter,"
said Waitt, who founded Gateway 17 years ago out of an Iowa
farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no guarantees that the company can pull it off.
Price pressure from rivals Dell Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. are slicing PC profit margins paper-thin.</TE>
<TE>   And with its share of the cutthroat PC market slipping
uncontrollably, some analysts are predicting Gateway's eventual
demise, despite the $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash that the
company currently has on hand. "Gateway is probably more valuable
dead than alive," said Los Angeles technology consultant Martin
Pichinson.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to generate more business, Gateway has been selling a
no-frills computer for as little as $399. Last week, the company went
one step further: It began offering this low-end model for free to
anyone who purchased a high-end $3,500 desktop or a $2,400 laptop. To
some, such a promotion seems more appropriate for a fast-food chain
-- buy one burger, get another at no charge -- than a purveyor of
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like you have a very desperate company," said
Pichinson, founder of Sherwood Partners, a tech-sector crisis
management and debt-restructuring firm.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gateway's strategy involves more than giveaways and price
cuts. The company is trying to reinvent itself by branching out
beyond computers and such traditional peripherals as printers. Its
foray into higher-margin digital equipment and "beyond-the-box" home
entertainment could breathe new life into the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's 272 stores and Web site now carry consumer electronics
items such as digital cameras, MP3 music players, video cameras and
an enormous 42-inch plasma television that can hang on a wall. At the
Toledo store, an employee unwrapped and quickly assembled a tablet
computer, a brand-new product that had just arrived for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gateway's problem isn't its merchandise, analysts say.
People like the products and rave about the customer service. The
company's brand value is on a par with industry leader Dell,
according to independent research studies.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton dropped by the Gateway store last week because he trusts
the name, even though he uses a Dell PC. Once inside the store, it
took him all of about 20 minutes to make his purchase. "It was nice
to get in and out quickly," Stanton said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite this kind of consumer satisfaction, Gateway is taking
a beating in a world of slowing consumer demand for PCs and
relentless price competition.</TE>
<TE>   Its U.S. market share dropped to 6.1% in the third quarter from
7.5% during the same period last year, according to market researcher
Gartner Dataquest. Over the same period, Dell's share grew robustly,
to 28.9% from 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's battered shares have fallen from about $80 in late 1999
to close Friday at $2.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Gateway is not a stock that I would own at any price at this
point," said Joseph Beaulieu, an analyst with equity research firm
Morningstar Inc. and an owner of a Gateway computer. "They're losing
money, and they have no viable business plan to turn things around."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of talk is tough for Gateway -- the kind of company that
many people are inclined to root for. Waitt, 39, started the firm
with a rented computer and a $10,000 loan guaranteed by his
grandmother. Like Michael Dell, Waitt was an entrepreneur with a
vision of low-cost supply emphasizing value and customer loyalty.
Sales quickly ballooned.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway has maintained a down-home, folksy feel. Until recently,
its shipping boxes were white with large black spots reminiscent of a
cow. Ads stressed customer service and its knowledgeable, friendly
staff who are available to demystify the often intimidating beige box
that houses a PC.</TE>
<TE>   But costs soared, especially with regard to its stores, as the
competition became more ruthless.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Waitt returned to the company he had left in 1999, and
moved its headquarters to Southern California from South Dakota. He
also cut Gateway's workforce by 10%, shut down its Internet service
and began closing more than 50 stores nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that hasn't been enough.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears Gateway's aggressive pricing strategy is not working,"
said technology analyst Joel Wagonfeld of Banc of America Securities.
"Either Gateway's expectations for the quarter were far too
optimistic, or the company is losing share, both of which do not
augur well for the stock."</TE>
<TE>   Gateway declined to make executives available for this story,
citing its "quiet period" ahead of its fourth-quarter and full-year
earnings announcement Jan. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Waitt's comments at a recent technology conference were infused
with excitement over the new directions Gateway is undertaking and
products it is carrying. But they also revealed a sense of dread
about the competition. Whereas Dell and HP crowed about strong
Thanksgiving weekend sales, Gateway's take was muted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty brutal pricing environment," Waitt said. Regarding
Thanksgiving sales, he added: "What we saw was good but not great."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts fault Gateway for uneven store quality. Though
certain outlets are picture-perfect, others are dingy places that
display broken computers and peripherals that aren't properly
connected.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also have hammered Gateway for building its stores away
from destination shopping centers. Rival Apple Computer Inc. has
benefited from putting its locations inside malls and high-traffic
retailers such as CompUSA.</TE>
<TE>   Waitt said Gateway is reassessing the sites of its remaining
stores. High overhead and a fixed cost structure for its stores is
hurting, but next year about 120 leases come up, and more may be
closed or relocated.</TE>
<TE>   With growth in the PC market next year estimated in the single
digits -- compared with more than 20% in some years during the 1990s
-- shedding more stores could buy Gateway some time to rebuild market
share and await the next cycle of consumers upgrading their
computers.</TE>
<TE>   But if Waitt can't turn the company around soon, the consequences
could be dire, warned Pichinson, the technology consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there's just no room for them," he said. "Dell is
beating the you-know-what out of everybody. There's just no margins
anymore. You've got to know when to hold them and when to fold them."</TE>
<TE>   Pichinson is convinced that Gateway should liquidate and shut
down, or find a foreign partner such as China's biggest computer
maker, Legend Holdings Ltd., which could use access to the U.S.
market.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Waitt is contemplating a Christmas that doesn't look so
cheery. "A lot of people are out talking about successes this holiday
season," he said at the conference, but "I don't see anybody pointing
to desktop PCs as being a hot Christmas item."</TE>

<HD>Regulations Are Seen as Feeble Response to Greed</HD>
<DH>New rules and fines won't alter human nature, some Silicon
Valley players say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the heyday of the technology boom, any analyst, venture
capitalist, investment banker or entrepreneur who didn't become
filthy rich just wasn't trying. Greed wasn't merely good; it was the
fuel that powered the system.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's agreement between regulators and 10 top Wall Street
firms aims to stamp out the things that greed inspired: conflicts of
interest, sweetheart transactions, chicanery, lying and fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Good luck, says a cross section of players and critics in Silicon
Valley -- the place where the dot-com boom was born, nurtured and
quickly exploited by natives and Wall Streeters alike.</LD>
<TE>   Human nature is not easily re-engineered, these folks say, and
well-meaning but toothless measures aren't going to help much.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so sad that people think this is a remedy," said Ruthann
Quindlen, a venture capitalist with Institutional Venture Partners in
Menlo Park, Calif. "It changes nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gary Lutin, a New York investment banker who runs forums on
dot-com excess: "The solutions seem artificial. It's sort of like
needing water at the top of a hill, so you pass a law saying water
should run uphill."</TE>
<TE>   The exact nature of the new regulations, which are accompanied by
$900 million in fines, remains to be detailed. But they will include
forcing the brokerage firms to spend $450 million to hire independent
researchers, presumably resulting in the objectivity that Wall Street
pretended was there all along.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the offing: a ban on having a firm's research analysts
accompany its investment bankers on pitches, which is supposed to
make sure that stock recommendations are untainted by the quest for
banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   A third regulation would prevent brokerage firms from giving
shares in hot initial public offerings to their big clients, a
practice known as spinning.</TE>
<TE>   IPOs occurred at the rate of about two a week in Silicon Valley
during the second half of 1999 and the first six months of 2000,
providing enormous fees to the bankers, paper riches to the
entrepreneurs and, through spinning, quick fortunes to Valley
executives who already were vastly wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   "They were bribes," said Quindlen bluntly, and very lucrative ones
when a hot stock could double, triple or quadruple on its first day.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Margaret Whitman, chief executive of San Jose-based EBay
Inc., resigned from the board of Goldman Sachs Group. Two months ago
it was revealed she had received shares in more than 100 Goldman
IPOs. EBay is a Goldman client.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said Whitman had done nothing wrong but was resigning
to remove any appearance of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Other Goldman clients in Silicon Valley who have been
beneficiaries of spinning, according to congressional investigators
are EBay founder Pierre Omidyar and Yahoo Inc. founder Jerry Yang.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning, as some critics have pointed out, already was prohibited
under the "corporate opportunity" doctrine, which holds that an
officer of a corporation can't take personal deals without first
offering them to his own company.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem during the boom wasn't the lack of rules," said San
Carlos, Calif., hedge fund manager Eric Von der Porten. "It was that
no one enforced them. So why are new rules going to make a
difference?"</TE>
<TE>   The rule barring analysts and investment bankers from being
together in the same room with IPO candidates was, according to those
interviewed, at best naive and at worst nonsensical. Couldn't the two
simply collude on the phone, the analyst agreeing to hype so that the
banker could win the business?</TE>
<TE>   Granted, analysts' docility has been revealed as a huge problem.
As Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Henry Blodget acknowledged at the
height of the boom: "There's certainly a tendency to give the company
a benefit of the doubt" when your firm is the one that has taken it
public.</TE>
<TE>   Just how deep this tendency went in Blodget was revealed this
year, when investigators released e-mails showing him touting
Merrill-backed stocks he privately was describing as junk.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, a Merrill Lynch financial consultant asked
Blodget if he would recommend buying Excite@Home, the Redwood City,
Calif., Internet portal and broadband company.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Inc. probably would buy the company, Blodget wrote back, "but
as a stand-alone business, it's falling apart." At the time, Blodget
had "accu- mulate" ratings on the stock. Excite@Home later folded.</TE>
<TE>   "If the same firm employs the analyst, the originating investment
banker and the broker who allocates the shares of the IPO, they're
all going to have incentives" to act as a team, Lutin said. "You have
to change the structure to change the incentives, and that's not
happening."</TE>
<TE>   As for independent analysis, the notion is "fanciful," said Randy
Komisar, a consulting professor at Stanford University and veteran
entrepreneur. "I see a bunch of [Wall Street firms] paying blood
money to get out of a sticky wicket. I'm not sure how much they'll
support independent analysis in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   If those with a reformist bent believe the reforms don't go far
enough, others in Silicon Valley are convinced they went too far.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Draper, one of the best-known and most successful venture
capitalists, wasn't sure what the new rules were, but he decried
their mere existence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an act of bureaucratic terrorism," he said. "I think what
happened was, there was some trouble at Enron, and somehow the
bureaucracy decided every corporate group was at fault."</TE>
<TE>   The market, Draper added, "self-regulates, unless there is
regulation."</TE>
<TE>   "This creeping regulatory environment just makes it tougher for
the little guy to go out and create something new," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of proper punishments and wise laws comes against a
backdrop of misery in the high-tech world.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of taking a company public in the current climate is
so unlikely that the notion makes people in Silicon Valley giggle
when it doesn't make them want to throw themselves into the ocean.
Only a handful of tech companies have completed IPOs this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's licking their wounds," said Jeffrey Sohl, director of
the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire.
As long as investors still have at least a memory of the pain of the
last three years, he said, that will do more than any new regulations
to keep the market honest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Valley is in low-key, penitential mode.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to keep our heads down," said Nirav Tolia, chief
executive of Epinions Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The online consumer ratings service, based in Brisbane in the Bay
Area, launched during the tech boom with tremendous publicity. It
didn't have a chance to go public before the crash, which might have
helped it survive during the current lean times.</TE>
<TE>   Like Draper, Tolia said he didn't know much about the new
regulations. But then they won't be relevant to him for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled to report that we've achieved profitability, but

<TE>   For the moment, at least, reality has banished greed. And that's
more than the regulators ever could do.</TE>

<HD>Investor Hopes Dim for Santa Claus Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three straight years of declines, Wall Street needs a Santa
Claus rally more than ever. Many investors say a traditional stock
market rally that occurs just before Christmas and continues into the
new year is not in the cards this year.</LD>
<LD>   If that's true, then beware the bear.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Claus tends to visit Wall Street almost every year, bringing
a short but respectable rally in the last five days of the year and
the first two in January, said Jeffrey Hirsch of the Stock Trader's
Almanac.</LD>
<TE>   The so-called Santa Claus rally has been good for an average 1.7%
gain since 1969, or 1.5% since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors, though, doubt such a rally will occur this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll see a Santa Claus rally," said Joseph
Kalinowski, chief investment officer at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, major indices eked out modest gains. The blue-chip Dow
Jones industrial average rose 0.93% for the week, while the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 0.72%. The Nasdaq composite index was up
0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume usually is anemic the last week of December, and
this year it could be even lighter than normal due to the timing of
the holidays. This year, Christmas and New Year's Day fall on
Wednesday, smack in the middle of the week.</TE>
<TE>   As earnings season draws to a close and thoughts turn to taking
off for the holidays, a potential war with Iraq is the wild card that
could disrupt the low level of trading that typifies Wall Street this
time of year.</TE>
<TE>   Many will be paying close attention to events in the Middle East
that could cause investors to suddenly lose confidence in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Rising oil prices and the Iraqi situation could continue to weigh
on stocks, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Key U.S. economic indicators to be released this week include a
final figure for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index
for December, which will come today.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also said they will be looking for any news from U.S.
retailers, for whom the last week and weekend before Christmas can
make or break them for December.</TE>

<PH>THE WALL STREET SETTLEMENT</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Strategy Shift Kept Deal From Dissolving</HD>
<DH>Regulators' decision to focus on the top five brokerages,
hardball tactics led to agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Eliot Spitzer was fed up.</LD>
<LD>   The New York attorney general had spent months haggling with Wall
Street's most powerful securities firms over a proposed industrywide
settlement of stock analyst conflicts of interest, and a deal that
seemed within reach a few days earlier was in danger of falling
apart.</LD>
<LD>   The brokerage houses were objecting to the size of the fines they
were being told to pay, and they seemed intent on delaying the talks
into the new year. That infuriated Spitzer and other weary
regulators, who wanted a deal by Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   To break the stalemate, regulators huddled Dec. 16 and came up
with a two-pronged strategy, according to interviews with some of the
key participants.</TE>
<TE>   They decided to focus most intently on working out a deal with
Wall Street's top five firms -- Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse First
Boston, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point," one regulator recalled, "we were willing to say,
'Let's do a subset of the firms now, and the rest later.' "</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, the regulators figured, any sort of pact would allow
them to claim a victory in their months-long effort to forge a
"global" settlement.</TE>
<TE>   They also were betting that striking an agreement with the larger
firms would squeeze four smaller brokerages -- Lehman Bros. Holdings,
UBS Warburg, Deutsche Bank and Bear Stearns Cos. -- into signing on.</TE>
<TE>   A pact with the five big firms, said one regulator, would "put an
incredible amount of pressure on the other four."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their size, the smaller firms posed a significant threat
to the broad settlement because their opposition was more strident,
and they seemed more willing to walk away from the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   As the days passed, regulators also adopted a more urgent and
threatening tone. Agree to a deal immediately, they told the firms,
or face years of withering court battles.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have one regulator read a firm the riot act, and then
find out that another regulator did the same thing 20 minutes later,"
one official said.</TE>
<TE>   The stern message was delivered most forcefully Wednesday, when
Spitzer summoned high-ranking executives of the five firms to his
office and bluntly told them to get on board that day.</TE>
<TE>   The hardball tactics worked.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Spitzer and other regulators announced a settlement
that included the biggest securities-related fines in U.S. history
and some of the most sweeping reforms ever on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Pending the signing of final documents in the next few weeks, 10
companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., would fork over $1.4
billion in penalties and other fines and revamp the rules governing
stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   But persuading the firms to sign off on the deal was only part of
the battle. Spitzer faced dissension within his own ranks as
securities regulators in some states -- most notably California --
thought their counterparts were conceding too much in their rush to
do a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Demetrios A. Boutris, commissioner of the California Department of
Corporations, publicly broke ranks with his counterparts in late
November by declaring that each firm should pay at least $100 million
-- double the amount sought from several of the brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   California had led the probe of Deutsche Bank, and Boutris was
especially adamant that the German company be fined at least $100
million. He met stiff resistance from his fellow regulators, who
argued that the evidence supported a $50-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition from Boutris was significant because one of his top
deputies was co-chairing a task force of states probing analyst
conflicts and because California's size gave it clout in shaping a
final deal.</TE>
<TE>   Boutris eventually relented after personal entreaties from Spitzer
and New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso, who lobbied him
in four phone calls Tuesday and Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no sooner had Boutris backed down than grousing was heard from
another quarter: Matthew Nestor, senior securities regulator for
Massachusetts, complained in a Wednesday e-mail to his counterparts
that the government had relaxed its settlement demands too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was with great reluctance that we immediately moved from $250
to $150 million approx. a week ago," Nestor wrote, referring to the
fine demanded of CSFB, the investigation of which was handled by
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Nestor noted that he had made it clear he would go "no lower" than
$150 million, and he was incensed when other regulators went to CSFB
with an offer of $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not consulted or advised about this change until after it
was transmitted to CSFB," Nestor wrote. "This breach of protocol is
astonishing and unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   CSFB eventually agreed to pay $150 million. Nestor declined to
comment Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Although reconciling the interests of 50 states presented
problems, their participation also yielded dividends.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators, who have long worked in the shadow of their
national counterparts at the Securities and Exchange Commission, were
intent on proving their mettle.</TE>
<TE>   This was especially so because of the lack of respect that some
state officials believed they were accorded by those on Wall Street.
A regulator in one state said he heard through the grapevine that
executives at one brokerage had actually cheered after learning that
his state would lead the probe of their company.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought, 'There's no way these underpaid state employees
going up against $400-an-hour lawyers could put this case together,"
said another regulator, Joe Borg, the Alabama securities chief who
spearheaded the Lehman Bros. probe. "That was a big motivator."</TE>
<TE>   At one meeting last week, Borg recounted, he and his counterpart
from the SEC turned to Lehman's lawyers and said, "OK, we'll see you
in federal court on Tuesday and state court on Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   NYSE Chairman Grasso played a key behind-the-scenes role
throughout, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach a settlement initially were hampered by a feud
between Spitzer and then-SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's investigation of Merrill Lynch analysts last spring,
which ended with the firm assenting to a $100-million fine, had
kick-started the broader analyst inquiry. The SEC worried that
Spitzer would overstep his boundaries and usurp its authority to set
national market standards. Spitzer fretted that Pitt would not be
tough enough on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Those differences were smoothed over at a meeting convened by
Grasso in October.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso also was instrumental in prodding the recalcitrant firms to
come to the table in the final week, one source said. While Spitzer
focused on the five largest firms, Grasso lobbied the four smaller
ones.</TE>
<TE>   SEC enforcement chief Stephen Cutler played a central role as
well, one official said, relaying offers between the two sides like a
State Department envoy practicing shuttle diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, regulators said, the firms got the message that it was
time to do a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "What brought it across the finish line," one official said, "was
the regulators said, 'We're done. We've talked enough.' "</TE>

<HD>Consumers Get an Early Christmas Present</HD>
<DH>Stores continue to mark down their merchandise in a game of
'retail chicken.'</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>'Tis the season for price slashing.</LD>
<LD>   With no must-have toys or standout apparel being pushed this
holiday season, retailers instead are using discounts of up to 50%
off as the best motivators for getting customers into stores,
industry analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the shopping season enters its final hours, the question
is: How low can they go?</LD>
<TE>   Apparently, as low as they have to.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers will do whatever it takes" to make last year's revenue
numbers, said Marshal Cohen, co-president of market research group
NPD FashionWorld. "And this year they are promoting their way into
achieving that."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Giss, a retail analyst with Deloitte &amp; Touche in Los
Angeles, agreed that stores would continue to reduce prices through
Christmas, if that's the only way they think they can generate enough
business. "The gloves are off," he said "There's a lot of panic."</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, many of the stores inside the Glendale Galleria
-- one of the largest malls in Southern California -- were touting
sales of 50% to 70% off. Even on tony Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills
"sale" signs abounded: Shoe designer Charles Jourdan marked down all
merchandise 70%, and the Emporio Armani boutique slashed apparel
prices 40%.</TE>
<TE>   At the Macy's department store at the Brea mall, some men's
sweaters were going for half price, and then an additional 40% was
being taken off the ticket on top of that.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, at an Express outlet in Pasadena, nearly all sweaters,
jackets, jeans and T-shirts were discounted up to 50%. But the store
didn't stop there: Shoppers were given another 20% off everything
once they got to the checkout counter, where they also were handed a
$25 store voucher for use after Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers "are looking at the price and unless it's 50% off they
dismiss it," national retail analyst Kurt Barnard said Sunday. "Even
at 50% off, they can't make up their minds to buy it. The battalion
of bargain hunters is out in full force."</TE>
<TE>   Low prices got 37-year-old Dionne Colvin in a shopping mood early
this year, but the deals were so good that the San Pedro resident put
her gift buying on hold and began snapping up clothes and shoes for
herself. By Saturday, Colvin, a department manager for a car
manufacturer, was at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa buying for
others.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm trying to catch up and do my Christmas shopping," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Torres, 25, was happy with what he found at the Target store
in Eagle Rock on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my mom's sweater for 6 bucks," said Torres, a medical
assistant at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles. "Hopefully it fits her
and she doesn't want to return it because she'll find out how much it
cost."</TE>
<TE>   Some retail experts had expected that the lean inventory in stores
this year would heighten demand and, at some point, give retailers an
edge. That didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, many retailers discovered that they had to cut prices
early and deeply or lose customers to competitors that were doing
whatever it took to win sales. Unloading store shelves quickly this
time of year is important in part because retailers must make way for
spring merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got something that just isn't selling, you can take it
down to 30 cents on the retail dollar and get as much money as you'd
have gotten if you sold it to a close-out company," said Giss, the
Deloitte &amp; Touche analyst. If the store has been forced to take a
loss, it at least has gained -- or kept -- a customer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the steep markdowns, consumers have remained cautious for
a variety of reasons this year, experts say. Among them: uncertainty
about the economy and the possibility of war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "For shoppers, it's a paradise," Barnard said. "Unfortunately,
many consumers are not in a position to take advantage of it. We are
dealing with a very jittery consumer."</TE>
<TE>   Still, because the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was
six days shorter than usual this year, some industry observers
thought shoppers would feel the pressure and buy more consistently
this season. Instead, sales were strong over the Thanksgiving
weekend, dipped, and then improved somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales numbers for the last week aren't yet available,
anecdotal evidence indicates that Saturday was, as usual, the busiest
shopping day of the year, according to Scott Krugman, spokesman for
the National Retail Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems the last-minute shopping is going to make or break
holiday sales," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet retailers have gotten some breaks this year, including lower
wholesale prices. And, unlike 2001, when the terrorist attacks
upended business, retailers were prepared for sluggish sales this
year. So they bought conservatively to minimize the effect on
profits.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers knew well in advance there were going to be markdowns,"
said Krugman, whose group has predicted the lowest sales increase in
five years for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   And although markdowns erode margins, Krugman said the effect
probably won't be as bad this year as it was in 2001, partly because
of the shriveled expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen agreed. Having "bought smart" this year, he said, some
retailers managed to pay, say, $10 for a shirt that they could price
at $40. In such cases, they could take 25% off the price, and cut an
additional 40% off that, and still beat what they paid to the
wholesaler.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to get customers into stores, retailers often toss out a
"loss leader," a low-priced item that they don't expect to make a
profit on, but which is expected to draw customers who will then buy
something else. The technique works particularly well for mass-
merchandise stores, such as Target and Kmart, which have a wide range
of products.</TE>
<TE>   "While you're in the store sticking a Chicken Dance Elmo in your
cart, you'll pick up a pair of khakis, a golf shirt, a sweater for
Uncle George and groceries," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Stores this year also have increasingly used "door busters" --
special sales for early shoppers -- to lure customers inside. The
tactic worked, Barnard said, but only to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "When the promotion ended, the shoppers disappeared like snow in
the palm of your hand," he said. Consumer electronics stores were an
exception to the rule, he noted, having had more success at
sustaining interest from shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the launch of this year's shopping season, analysts
and retail experts said that a game of "retail chicken" was getting
underway between stores and customers. The question then was: Who
would become more desperate as the weeks wore on?</TE>
<TE>   Now that Christmas is almost here, the victor is obvious, Giss
said. "The consumer won this one. The retailers have blinked."</TE>

<LD>Richard M. Cannon, president and chief executive of Watson Land Co.,
is retiring after leading the Carson-based company for 18 years.</LD>
<LD>   The board of directors of the private real estate investment trust
named as his successor Bruce A. Choate, who has been the company's
chief financial officer since 1991.</LD>
<LD>   Cannon, 61, had been with Irvine Co. for 16 years as a vice
president and corporate officer prior to joining Watson. He also
served on the boards of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce,</LD>
<TE>   Choate, 54, joined Watson Land after serving as chief financial
officer of Bixby Ranch Co., another privately held REIT. He begins
his new duties at Watson Land on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Watson Land dates back two centuries to Rancho San Pedro,
California's first Spanish land grant that included 75,000 acres of
land in and around what is now Carson. One of the daughters of the
original rancho owner married into the Watson family in the late
1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Since embarking on a development program in the early 1960s, the
company now owns and manages about 12 million square feet of
industrial, office and technology buildings and business centers,
primarily in the South Bay.</TE>

<PH>THE WALL STREET SETTLEMENT</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Settlement Is Expected to Aid in Lawsuits by Investors</HD>
<DH>Evidence uncovered by regulators investigating Wall Street
firms could be used by plaintiffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although investors won't get much money from regulators' $1.4-billion
settlement with Wall Street firms, the evidence dug up by government
investigators is expected to prompt a new wave of private lawsuits
and arbitration claims.</LD>
<LD>   Depositions and internal brokerage firm e-mails and other
documents obtained by regulators in New York and other states could
make it possible to bring cases that otherwise would be too expensive
or difficult for investors to pursue, according to experts in
corporate and securities law. The detailed evidence could help the
lawsuits survive dismissal motions and make settlements easier to
reach with the investment firms' defense teams, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "That kind of stuff is sometimes very hard for private plaintiffs
to get," University of Texas law professor Henry Hu said. "Here you
may not have to pay for it -- it could be handed to you on a platter,
courtesy of the New York taxpayers."</LD>
<TE>   State and federal officials on Friday announced the so-called
global settlement with the Wall Street firms -- a series of tentative
deals that must be approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The investment firms admitted no wrongdoing in settling
the cases.</TE>
<TE>   Only as finalized settlements are released in the coming weeks
will the scope of the cases become public. Regulators, including SEC
enforcement chief Stephen Cutler, said they would release detailed
findings, which could be used to support claims filed by investors
against the firms.</TE>
<TE>   But observers said it was unclear whether private attorneys would
get access to all the documents that regulators used to support their
charges. Some of those documents touch on issues of immediate concern
to investors burned during the market bubble of the late 1990s, such
as e-mails in which brokerage analysts privately disparaged stocks
that they were touting in their published reports.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC usually does not release documents it obtains," said
Thomas Ajamie, a Houston attorney who represents investors in claims
against their brokers. But he noted that the New York attorney
general's office, which took a leading role in the case, "has already
provided the public with much more information than the SEC ever
has."</TE>
<TE>   Even before seeing the finalized settlements, some securities
lawyers were passing harsh judgments. Joseph Cotchett, a prominent
Bay Area plaintiffs attorney, said the deals may serve as a "giant
corporate shield" to protect officials at the investment firms from
criminal liability.</TE>
<TE>   "Those analysts, executives and supervisors created trillions of
dollars in losses to the public. Police pensions, fire pensions were
lost all across America, and they're walking out of this for an
amount that is infinitesimal compared to the damage they have
caused," Cotchett said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he and other attorneys representing shareholders "are
going to have to pursue this in the courts."</TE>
<TE>   "I assure you we'll be filing the appropriate motions with the
courts to get all the evidence out in the light of day," said
Cotchett, who is representing California's teacher pension fund in
lawsuits seeking to recover money lost on failed investments. "We
want the public to see who the individuals behind this are, and what
really went on."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators haven't yet devised a plan to determine how much of the
$1.4-billion settlement investors will get, when they'll get it or
how it may be divided. Of the settlement, $900 million represents
fines, $450 million is earmarked for independent research and $85
million is for investor education.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain, though: With stocks worth trillions of
dollars less than a few years ago, the settlement funds won't go far
toward making investors whole, and the "main mechanism" for investors
seeking to recover losses will remain the judicial system or
arbitration, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer aides said the regulators would adopt a technique like one
used by New York in its lawsuit this year against Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
In that case, state regulators published a lengthy complaint on the
Internet with references to a host of internal Merrill documents.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys in private lawsuits were given access to the e-mails,
documents and depositions cited in the case, which Merrill settled
for $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer spokesman Darren Dopp said he expected "a huge document
dump" about firms such as Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit,
which Spitzer's office investigated. Citigroup agreed to pay the
largest fine, $300 million, and the company faces dozens of lawsuits
related to stock research.</TE>
<TE>   But a Spitzer legal aide said the information, though
considerable, would be less extensive than in the Merrill lawsuit,
and the settlement language less harsh. It is unclear how aggressive
regulators from other states, who investigated other firms, will be
in releasing evidence.</TE>
<TE>   As attention turns from the public enforcement action to private
legal claims, defense attorneys said they expected a wave of claims
against brokers. But they added that investors may not realize how
difficult it is to prove their losses resulted directly from
wrongdoing by an investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Isolated private e-mails from sharp-tongued analysts, dissing a
favored stock that subsequently collapsed, aren't sufficient by
themselves to prove an intent to deceive, no matter how inappropriate
they appear, the defense attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an investor, you'd need to prove you actually received the
research, relied on the research and that the research was tainted,"
said Gerald F. Rath, a Boston attorney who frequently represents
investment companies. "After all, during the exuberant days in the
market people were buying stocks for a lot of reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Amery, a New Jersey attorney, said most of the claims he
defends for brokers are brought by investors in their 40s and 50s who
are educated, successful and financially aware -- and thus have a
hard time proving they were suckered into buying unsuitable
investments.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people that had the big money in the market," he
said. "They rode it way up, and they rode it way down."</TE>
<TE>   But Hu, the Texas law professor, noted that arbitration
proceedings -- the required way for most individual claims against
brokers to be resolved -- often dwell less on details of the law than
on overall fairness.</TE>
<TE>   If e-mails or other evidence appear particularly bad, they could
exert a strong influence on arbitrators, "who don't need to issue
detailed reasons [for their decisions], the way judges often do," Hu
said.</TE>

<HD>CMS Energy to Sell Pipeline Business</HD>
<DH>Southern Union and AIG Highstar agree to pay $662 million
and assume $1.17 billion in debt for natural gas unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMS Energy Corp. said Sunday that it had agreed to sell its natural
gas pipeline business to Southern Union Co. and an investment fund
for $662 million and the assumption of $1.17 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   CMS Panhandle Cos. would be acquired by Southern Union Panhandle
Corp., a new company established by Southern and AIG Highstar, an
equity fund sponsored by American International Group Inc.</LD>
<LD>   CMS Panhandle operates about 11,000 miles of natural gas pipeline
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest and Canada. The sale, which
has been approved by the boards of all three companies, faces
regulatory reviews.</LD>
<TE>   "CMS Panhandle is a well-run and stable business, which will be
accretive to our earnings in the first year," said Thomas Karam,
Southern Union's president and chief operating officer. "We expect to
execute a smooth and seamless transition."</TE>
<TE>   CMS Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich., said it would use the
proceeds to accelerate debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, CMS said it was selling its natural gas trading book's
contracts to Sempra Energy of Canada, a division of Sempra Energy.
Sempra, based in San Diego, also is parent of Southern California Gas
Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   CMS has been selling assets to reach a goal of raising $2.9
billion by year's end. Last month, the company said it had raised
$2.7 billion and reduced its debt by $860 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Union of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., distributes natural gas to
about 1.5 million customers in Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Texas as well as in Mexico. Southern Union also
generates electricity in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   In trading Friday, CMS shares fell 4 cents to $8.61, Southern
Union lost 70 cents to $15.40 and American International Group rose
98 cents to $59.07. All trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Generic Heartburn Drug Hard for Some to Swallow</HD>
<DH>Insurers and consumer groups critical of the Prilosec
knockoff say it costs too much. But analysts expect the price to come
down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kim Dixon</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A generic version of blockbuster heartburn drug Prilosec is failing
to soothe the stomachs of U.S. health plans and consumers, who say
the knockoff is not much cheaper than the original.</LD>
<LD>   After generic drug makers waged a lengthy patent war against
AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish maker of Prilosec, only Schwarz Pharma
of Germany won the rights to sell a cheaper version in the United
States. As a result, the copycat Prilosec went on the market this
month for as much as 90% of the price of the prescription version --
in stark contrast to deep discounts enjoyed on typical generics, U.S.
insurers and consumers said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have found the generic is not living up to its promise," said
John Eadie, policy analyst at the New York Statewide Senior Action
Council, which lobbies on drug cost issues.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a faux generic," said Robert Seidman, pharmacy chief at
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. of Thousand Oaks. Schwarz "could have
this monopoly position for a prolonged period of time," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expect that generic Prilosec, called omeprazole,
eventually will cost 20% to 25% less than the brand-name product. But
WellPoint and other major U.S. health insurers including Health Net
Inc. and Humana Inc. remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, analysts said Schwarz Pharma got off to a strong start
in sales this month, capturing 13% of the market for the drug class.
Three firms jockeyed to sell the generic, but plans unraveled after
Schwarz alone won the legal battle to market its version of the
$6-billion-a-year heartburn drug.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual twist, Schwarz will share profits with rivals Andrx
Corp. and Merck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Generic Prilosec "ain't that cheap; it's going on the third tier,"
meaning it could cost consumers as much as $40, said David Olson, a
spokesman at Health Net, which with 2.5 million members is one of
California's biggest health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Non-brand Prilosec will cost Humana customers as much as $50, a
spokesman for the Louisville, Ky.-based firm said.</TE>
<TE>   A CVS Corp. pharmacy in Chicago says it sells a 90-day supply of
generic Prilosec for $113, compared with $126 for the brand name --
about a 10% discount.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz said it was discounting the pill by 20% to 30%. The list
price is $2.88 per pill, spokeswoman Antje Witte said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference arises in part because the companies negotiating
prices for drugs with HMOs -- known as prescription benefits
managers, or PBMs -- take a slice, said Linda Cahn, a lawyer who
works on health issues.</TE>
<TE>   When a health maintenance organization such as WellPoint does its
own negotiating, it gets those trimmings.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys don't pay list prices; they make deals," said Cahn,
who is representing corporations suing Merck's Medco Health, one of
the biggest PBMs. "PBMs and intermediaries buy cheap at undisclosed
prices and sell far higher."</TE>
<TE>   Cahn is among critics questioning deals between PBMs and
brand-name manufacturers, charging that PBMs cherry-pick drugs in
exchange for kickbacks from drug makers.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz's Witte suggested that out-of-whack supply and demand
skews the market, noting: "It depends on a lot of factors, including
court decisions and only one player being in the market."</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, Schwarz's U.S. unit cannot make enough of the
product to meet demand, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drugs are among the biggest contributors to
double-digit-percentage medical inflation. Ulcer and heartburn drugs
make up about 10% of health plans' prescription drug costs,
WellPoint's Seidman said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers and employers had hoped that Prilosec would follow
generic Prozac and Claritin in saving them big bucks. But it appears
they may have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca's patent expires in 2007, so Schwarz Pharma
potentially could have sole selling rights until then, Witte said.</TE>

<HD>Blake Tip Needed Endless Legwork</HD>
<DH>The investigation of the slaying of the actor's wife may
have been one of the most extensive in the LAPD's history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten days after Robert Blake's wife was killed, a stunt man named Gary
McLarty walked into the North Hollywood police station and said the
actor had offered him $10,000 to kill her.</LD>
<LD>   Two days later, police got a tip that another stunt man, Ronald
Hambleton, had told a friend that he too had been offered money by
Blake to kill the actor's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.</LD>
<LD>   Despite those early leads, it took the Los Angeles Police
Department's elite Robbery-Homicide Division nearly a year to make
arrests in the celebrity case. Blake and his bodyguard, Earle S.
Caldwell, were taken into custody April 18 and have pleaded not
guilty to murder charges.</LD>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors have been extraordinarily tight-lipped
about their investigation, which a former chief called one of the
most extensive in LAPD history.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Blake's much-anticipated preliminary hearing,
at which much of the evidence would have been made public, was
delayed as the actor changed lawyers. As a result, the public so far
has had little chance to assess the government's case against Blake
and Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   But an examination of hundreds of pages of documents in court
files shows how the case was painstakingly assembled.</TE>
<TE>   While investigating Bakley's slaying, the team of detectives, led
by Ronald Y. Ito, a veteran of the O.J. Simpson case, traveled to
more than 20 states, interviewed more than 150 witnesses and
collected more than 900 pieces of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The court records show how the detectives maneuvered Hambleton,
who had vowed to tell the real story only on his deathbed, into
making a statement that led to the only physical evidence linking
Blake to the killing -- a prepaid phone card that Blake allegedly
bought as a way to conceal calls he made to the would-be assassins.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's alleged assumption -- that calls on the phone card could
not be traced to him -- was wrong. Records of the calls provided
police the corroboration needed to bring a case against the
69-year-old actor. One month after detectives obtained the phone
records, Blake was arrested. He has been in custody ever since.</TE>
<TE>   No Witnesses</TE>
<TE>   Blake's defense argues that the evidence against him is weak, with
or without the phone card records. There are no witnesses and there
is no conclusive physical evidence -- the weapon, bullets, blood or
gunshot residue -- linking Blake to Bakley's shooting. The defense
contends that the arrests, broadcast live on television, were
politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the killing, Blake's attorney gave police two
steamer trunks full of tapes and documents that belonged to Bakley,
suggesting they would find a motive for the crime there.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, police concluded, "No other viable suspects were
found."</TE>
<TE>   Police contend Blake acted suspiciously at the scene of his wife's
death, which he was the first to report, on May 4, 2001. Blake said
they had just eaten dinner at Vitello's restaurant in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley, waiting in a car parked on the street, was shot in the
right jaw and shoulder with an unregistered pistol, a vintage Walther
P-38. Police found the gun the next day in a commercial trash bin
that authorities had hauled away from the crime scene. The gun had
been splashed with oil, making it impossible for police to recover
any fingerprints linking a suspect to the weapon, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   The first big break in the case came 10 days later when Ito and
Det. Steven Eguchi received an urgent page from the North Hollywood
police station: A man wanted to talk to them about the Bakley case.
When the detectives arrived, McLarty told the detectives that a month
before the murder Blake, whom he had worked with years earlier but
had not seen in more than a decade, had asked to meet him. He said
the two men met at Du-Par's restaurant in Studio City, then drove
together to Blake's home, about a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   There, Blake suggested that someone could sneak through the
sliding glass doors in the rear apartment on his property, where
Bakley lived, and "bump her off while she was asleep," according to
court documents. "How's $10,000 sound?" Blake asked McLarty,
according to the account of the conversation presented in the court
file. McLarty, 61, told police he had declined.</TE>
<TE>   According to the detectives, McLarty also mentioned that an old
friend of his, Roy Harrison, had been the go-between who had set up
the meeting with Blake. The next day, Ito and Eguchi called on
Harrison at his home in West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, 67, told the detectives that he believed the meeting
with McLarty had been about a book deal, according to a summary of
his statement to police. The next time detectives tried to contact
Harrison, they were told to call Arna H. Zlotnik, lawyer for Blake's
co-defendant, Caldwell, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day the detectives talked to Harrison, a man was
telling San Bernardino authorities that he, too, had information on
the Bakley murder. According to a police summary of his statement,
the man, a handyman from the high desert, told detectives that Blake
had offered his boss, Hambleton, $100,000 to kill Bakley. Blake
feared their daughter would "wind up as a porn star," the summary
recounts.</TE>
<TE>   McLarty, too, had mentioned Hambleton's name, telling detectives
that, in their conversation, Blake had asked about him. That tip put
police close to closing the case. If two people, Hambleton and
McLarty, both said they had been solicited by Blake, the case, though
circumstantial, would be compelling.</TE>
<TE>   But Hambleton told police he wouldn't talk. He would be a "dead
duck for being a snitch," he told the detectives, according to the
court file. Detectives went back a month later with a search warrant.
Again, Hambleton refused to talk. He would make a full statement on
his deathbed, and not before, he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives were making slow progress. Joe Bakley, Bonny Bakley's
brother, later told police that Blake on three occasions had offered
him $5,000 to "eliminate" someone but had never specified whom.</TE>
<TE>   William Welch, a retired LAPD detective and private investigator
who had worked for Blake, told detectives that Blake had talked to
him about killing Bakley in October 1999, a few weeks after the
couple met at a Burbank jazz club and she became pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators spent the next several months crisscrossing the
country, checking out leads. A Los Angeles detective even met with
police in New Jersey to review the criminal file of a real-life
murderer that Blake played in the 1993 made-for-television movie,
"Judgment Day: The John List Story." List was convicted, after
spending 18 years on the lam, in the 1971 murders of his wife, mother
and three teenage children.</TE>
<TE>   But detectives felt that Hambleton held the key to their case.
Late last year, Ito and his colleague Brian Tyndall returned to
Hambleton and handed him a subpoena ordering him to appear before a
grand jury. He might prefer talking to prosecutors directly, they
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the detectives returned to Hambleton's home in
Lucerne Valley with Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory A. Dohi. After months
of evasion, Hambleton finally talked -- providing what police believe
is the blueprint of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   According to a summary of his statement to police, Hambleton said
Blake had driven him through the alley behind Vitello's restaurant
and along nearby streets on March 11, 2001, pointing out possible
places where Bakley could be killed. Blake suggested that Hambleton
could approach Bakley on foot as she sat in a car alongside a road
and kill her, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Her remains could be taken to a desert location and buried, Blake
allegedly told him.</TE>
<TE>   A Mundane Detail</TE>
<TE>   The account was intriguing, but the key moment in the interview
came with a mundane detail: Hambleton, 66, informed detectives that
he had urged Blake to buy a phone card "to avoid leaving any record
of any future phone conversations." He said Blake had called him on
the day of the murder, seeking assurance that calls made with the
card could not be traced.</TE>
<TE>   If they could trace and verify the purchase of the card, and then
records of its use, the detectives knew, they would have something
they urgently had been seeking -- physical evidence to corroborate
the stunt men's stories.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hambleton told detectives that he had watched Blake buy
the phone card, he could not recall the exact date it had been
purchased or the location of the convenience store where it had been
sold. He told detectives that he recalled a 7-Eleven store near a
Unocal station where Blake had bought gas after lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's credit card records showed transactions at Art's
Delicatessen and a nearby Unocal station on March 11, 2001. Tyndall
contacted a security officer at 7-Eleven who reported that just three
phone cards had been sold that day at that location. He provided the
access and PIN numbers for the cards and the times they had been
sold.</TE>
<TE>   The detective subpoenaed the phone records from AT&amp;T Corp. but was
told they had the wrong access number. Phone company officials
refused to comply without a new subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   After correcting the error, on March 15, 2002, detectives received
five pages via fax of every phone call made with the card. The
records reportedly confirmed that Blake made 126 calls between March
12, 2001, and May 5, 2001, from his home using the phone card.
Fifty-six of the calls were made to Hambleton's home and three to
McLarty's home.</TE>
<TE>   By April 18, police had enough evidence to secure a warrant for
the arrests of Blake and Caldwell. They were taken into custody that
evening and booked at Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   On the drive downtown from Blake's home in the gated San Fernando
Valley community of Hidden Hills, Blake told detectives, "I've been
waiting one year for this."</TE>

<HD>Batten Down the Hatches: It's the Rose Parade</HD>
<DH>Some residents get out of town. Others 'embrace it and
enjoy it.' Either way, they had better be ready on New Year's Eve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 0200 hours on Dec. 31, a 27-foot freight truck will take position
along Pasadena's Colorado Boulevard, a defender against an incoming
swarm.</LD>
<LD>   In its arsenal will be 198 sheets of half-inch-thick plywood --
the tools it will use to protect businesses along the boulevard from
the barrage of people, floats and debris that are part of Pasadena's
annual Rose Parade invasion.</LD>
<LD>   As the city braces for an incursion that will take almost 26 hours
to complete and will, according to Tournament of Roses estimates,
swell the population of Pasadena almost tenfold, there are strategies
to employ, preparations to make and allegiances to consider.</LD>
<TE>   But it's a matter of debate whether the coming invasion is a bad
thing (think vandals sacking Rome) or a good thing (think the Allies
entering Paris).</TE>
<TE>   "There are basically two approaches on the part of Pasadenans,"
said Steve Madison, a city councilman who represents many of the
residents around the Wrigley Mansion, headquarters for the parade.
"One approach is get out of town. Don't even be here. The other
approach is to embrace it and enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   For Pasadena-based Rusnak Automotive Group, at the western edge of
the parade route along Colorado, avoiding the invasion is a costly
but necessary part of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, said Ron Taylor, the company's president, Rusnak tried
staying open on Dec. 31. But it was immobilized by the invaders. "Too
many people are trying to get in to use your restroom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the dealership stayed open, Taylor said, "it would be a good
day for business." Instead, at 0730, the time Rusnak's mechanics
begin work on a typical Tuesday, the building will be shuttered and
two extra security guards will keep watch over the Jaguars,
Mercedes-Benzes and other upscale vehicles that Rusnak sells.</TE>
<TE>   Others along the parade route relish the opportunity to celebrate
with Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "We love it," said Becky Thyne, a Pasadena lawyer who lives with
her husband in a condominium at the corner of Orange Grove Boulevard
and Waverly Drive, where the parade's equestrian units line up on New
Year's Day. "As long as I live there, why not enjoy it?"</TE>
<TE>   Pete Stevens, general partner of Boardups Unlimited, enjoys the
parade too. His company owns the 27-foot truck loaded with plywood.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our single biggest day throughout the year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boardups Unlimited will sheathe 13 businesses this year along
Colorado to guard against accidents. For $10 a linear foot, the
company will install a framework of 2-by-4s, to which it attaches
8-foot tall sheets of plywood. A typical Rose Parade installation
runs about $295, but bigger clients, such as Pottery Barn, might pay
10 times that.</TE>
<TE>   But the same stores that want to guard against vandalism also want
to reap the benefits of the invasion. Boardups Unlimited always
leaves an opening for customers.</TE>
<TE>   The New Year's Eve onslaught begins in earnest at 1200 hours
sharp. That's when parade-goers are legally allowed to stake their
claims to territory along the route.</TE>
<TE>   The Tournament of Roses does not keep statistics on how many
people camp out overnight, but of the 800,000 people it says attended
the parade last year, only 125,000 sat in grandstand seats. Many of
the rest will park folding chairs, sleeping bags and coolers along
the sidewalks, behind a painted blue line that serves as the official
border between sidewalk and street, and wait until the parade begins
at 0800.</TE>
<TE>   "After 12:30 [a.m.], that place becomes a zoo," said John Mackay,
a deliveryman for Bryan's Cleaners. On New Year's Eve, Mackay makes
his rounds of the condos and homes close to the parade route early to
avoid the madness.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Hunt Club on Colorado Boulevard is so deep into its
parade party preparations that it must shut down on Dec. 31 to handle
the crowds Jan. 1. About 900 club members line up for brunch during
the parade and then chili and chowder before heading for the Rose
Bowl football game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our biggest day of the year," said David Mole, the club's
chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing a party is a strategy that many Pasadenans employ.
Residents along the western part of the route say that the Tournament
is generous about giving out extra parking passes -- which allow the
holder to enter sealed-off zones early on New Year's Day -- so that
they can invite friends and family for breakfast and float-viewing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it comes with the territory when you buy a place on
Orange Grove," said Maria Mallace who, along with her husband, Sandy,
marks the morning with smoked salmon, sweet rolls and 90 friends
watching the parade from their penthouse condo at the corner of
Orange Grove and Ellis Street.</TE>
<TE>   But long before Mallace's guests greet New Year's morning with
strong coffee -- and perhaps bloody marys -- around the corner, the
Ralphs store at 320 W. Colorado will close at 1600 hours on the 31st,
part of an arrangement between the supermarket and the parade's
parking and seating vendor.</TE>
<TE>   The market usually stays open until 0200. On New Year's Eve, it's
just as well that it closes early, said the store director, Mike
Moore. "Because the streets are so crowded, we are just a glorified
7-Eleven, with everyone coming in to use the restrooms, buy a Coke or
a bag of potato chips."</TE>
<TE>   The yearly invasion is in full force at 2200 hours, when the
floats begin lining up on Orange Grove. By then revelers will be
strolling the streets around Orange Grove and cars will clog Colorado
Boulevard, honking horns and illuminating the street with the red
tinge of brake lights.</TE>
<TE>   As the calendar turns and the floats rev their engines in
anticipation of the final parade judging at 0300, many locals will
join the crowd of out-of-towners in the streets, exchanging greetings
and examining the floats up close. It is a moment, many residents
say, when all of the inconvenience seems worth it, and the throngs of
people seem to coalesce into an immense, yet intimate, neighborhood
shindig.</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopes Less Lott Means a Lot More to California
Republicans</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lott, Schmott. The political plight and mutterings of a Mississippi
mossback have little relevance to the lives of people out here in
California. Except that:</LD>
<LD>   The flap had all the signs of another setback for the California
Republican Party. And this reverse, unlike most, wasn't even
self-propelled.</LD>
<LD>   The blow was blunted because Trent Lott surrendered his position
as Senate Republican leader rather than fight on awkwardly until
canned by colleagues. Even more damaging for the party --
particularly in California -- would have been his somehow clinging to
the post and remaining the dominate face and voice of the GOP in
Congress.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost a guy we could have kicked around for a while," notes
Darry Sragow, an L.A.-based Democratic strategist. "Lott would have
wound up in every Democratic speech as long as he was in a leadership
position. We would have never let him off the hook. If we had, we
would have been committing political malpractice.</TE>
<TE>   "Trent Lott is the personification of everything wrong with the
Republican Party, especially in California. There's nothing like a
good foil in politics."</TE>
<TE>   A good foil, for example, like former Gov. Pete Wilson, whom
Democratic pols skillfully demonized among Latinos after he
aggressively promoted the anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187
while running for reelection in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the California GOP has tried to "reach out" to
minorities, with only minimal success, after nasty campaigns pushing
Props. 187 and 209. The latter, in 1996, quashed affirmative-action
programs based on racial preferences.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, voters approved both measures by wide margins, but
Republican politicians became so skittish of the fiery issues they've
avoided them ever since. So the GOP lost twice. First it alienated
minorities -- then failed to follow up on issues that aligned it with
the broader electorate.</TE>
<TE>   But the last thing California Republicans needed now was for the
Senate GOP leader in Washington to be pining, seemingly, for the good
old days of Dixie segregation while crowing that his state once
backed a racist for president.</TE>
<TE>   Many Californians -- white swing voters as well as people of color
-- suspect conservative Republicans of intolerance anyway. The
comment that rolled off Lott's lips at Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th
birthday fete merely fed their suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican leaders I talked to were deeply disturbed," says
state GOP spokesman Rob Stutzman. Lott's capitulation Friday was
"welcome news."</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hoffenblum, a former GOP consultant who publishes the Target
Book, which handicaps political races, notes that only white males
have been supporting Republican candidates in recent statewide
elections. "If any group needs a different face," he says, "it's
California Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   That new face may be President Bush's, many think.</TE>
<TE>   Although too conservative for most Californians on such gut issues
as environmental protection, abortion rights and gun control, the
former Texas governor has been a godsend for the GOP on reaching out
to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is popular [among Latinos], Republicans are not," says Harry
Pachon, a Claremont Graduate University professor and president of
the Tomas Rivera Institute. "That's what our surveys show."</TE>
<TE>   On the 10th anniversary of the L.A. riots in April, the president
accepted an invitation to speak at a round table in South-Central
L.A. "I was impressed. He really exceeded my expectations," says
Operation Hope Chairman John Bryant, an event organizer. "First and
foremost, he showed up."</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent dealings with the White House, adds Bryant, an
African American, "I don't get the sense I'm talking to Republicans.
I'm talking to reasonable people."</TE>
<TE>   Investor Gerald Parsky, Bush's main man in California, says,
"We've been on a mission to change the dynamic out here so we can win
in '04 (after losing badly in 2000). Everything's oriented toward
demonstrating that we are inclusive....</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the president's swift and direct statement [denouncing
Lott's comments] was illustrative of how strongly he feels."</TE>
<TE>   "That was just beautiful for George Bush," says Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   But "it's no silver bullet" for the California GOP, asserts
Assemblyman Abel Maldonado (R-Santa Maria), a Republican rising star.
"We've got our work cut out. The California Republican Party isn't
what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   It's still better off, however, than if Bush hadn't throttled Lott
and defused a Confederate cannonball.</TE>

<HD>Activists Want Councilwoman on Coast Panel</HD>
<DH>They're campaigning for Debbie Cook of Huntington Beach, an
attorney who is accomplished on environmental issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Sierra Club and local environmentalists are mounting a
campaign to put Debbie Cook, a Huntington Beach councilwoman and
environmental attorney, on the state Coastal Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Cook is among a handful of candidates to replace Shirley S.
Dettloff, a former member of the same city council who steps down
next month after four years on the commission.</LD>
<LD>   "Debbie Cook would make an incredible commissioner," said Mark
Massara, the Sierra Club's manager of California coastal programs.
"When you talk about strong environmentalists, Debbie's name comes
right to the top."</LD>
<TE>   Cook, 48, has been a leader on various environmental issues in
Huntington Beach, including Measure C, a successful initiative
prohibiting city leaders from approving development on parkland or
beaches without majority support from the voters.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Cal State Long Beach, Cook got her law degree from
Western State University College of Law and joined the bar in 1994.
She has served on the city Planning Commission and General Plan
Advisory Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Cook also spearheaded lawsuits against developers of the Bolsa
Chica wetlands and the Huntington Beach waterfront, said Jan
Vandersloot, a physician and Orange County environmentalist.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have someone on the Coastal Commission who would be
protective of the coastal resources, and Debbie has shown in the past
she would be protective," Vandersloot said.</TE>
<TE>   Massara said other elected officials with strong environmental
credentials who have been suggested for the seat include Manhattan
Beach Councilman Jim Aldinger, Irvine Councilman Chris Mears and
Laguna Beach Mayor Toni Iseman.</TE>
<TE>   Vandersloot said a number of Orange County environmental groups
have faxed letters recommending Cook to state Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   "Burton has always given us the best votes on the commission,"
Vandersloot said, "but we cannot take this appointment for
granted.... It is necessary that Shirley's replacement be strong on
coastal protection."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors has recommended that board
members Tom Wilson and Jim Silva also be considered for the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The commission regulates use of land and water along the state's
1,150-mile coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Dettloff earned kudos among local and statewide environmentalists
for being outspoken for coastal protection, especially on the Malibu
coastal plan and Bolsa Chica preservation.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not have successfully concluded the hearing process, and
the decision over Bolsa Chica couldn't have been reached, without
her," Massara said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the commission has been in tumult. Environmental
activist Sara Wan stepped down last week as commission chairwoman
after it became clear that Gov. Gray Davis and Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City) wanted her replaced.</TE>
<TE>   And a property-rights attorney has asked a state appellate court
to declare its composition unconstitutional. He argues that the
commission violates the state Constitution's separation-of-powers
doctrine because the Legislature appoints two-thirds of a panel that
acts as an executive agency by granting or denying building permits.</TE>

<HD>Teen Tutors Connect With Seniors</HD>
<DH>Volunteers young enough to be their grandchildren teach
older adults in Van Nuys how to surf the Internet, send e-mail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Schwartz, 16, practically grew up with a computer mouse in his
hand, so he doesn't think twice about the high-speed benefits of
e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Ruth Smith, 76, came of age writing letters in painstakingly
precise cursive, then waiting several days for a response.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the tech-savvy teen and the traditional senior have been
matched in an innovative one-on-one computer class designed to narrow
the generation gap.</LD>
<TE>   Brian is one of three teens teaching seniors at Onegeneration
Senior Center in Van Nuys how to surf the Internet and e-mail family
and friends. The Chatsworth youth has been tutoring since he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "In the very beginning, they were very surprised to be taught by a
kid," said Brian, a wiry teen with braces and a hint of a beard.
"They'd say, 'Aren't you too young to be in this place?' But after a
while, it didn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the center said that the program has been beneficial
to both teenagers and seniors because it creates an atmosphere for
mutual understanding and learning.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a magic that happens when these two generations meet
that is not seen in single-generation programs," said Donna
Deutchman, executive director of the senior center.</TE>
<TE>   Brian said he wasn't worried about teaching seniors because he
visits his grandparents regularly and sees himself as his students'
surrogate grandson.</TE>
<TE>   He said he understands that the technology can be frightening.
Some seniors using a computer for the first time are afraid they
might hit the wrong key and cause the machine to blow up.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them to feel free to explore," Brian said. "They can't
break it unless they really try."</TE>
<TE>   One of his great joys is watching his students learn to send and
receive e-mail. "When they actually receive their first e-mail from
their grandchildren, their faces light up."</TE>
<TE>   Once they've mastered the basics, Brian said seniors perform
advanced Internet searches, such as looking at passenger lists for
names of relatives who arrived in the U.S. through New York's Ellis
Island, finding prescription drug information or checking stock
quotes.</TE>
<TE>   "I taught one guy how to download Hungarian folk music," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian admits he doesn't know everything about computers, but the
junior at Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City considers his
limited knowledge an advantage. "It's good that I don't know too much
of the terms and vocabulary, so I don't confuse them with too much
information."</TE>
<TE>   Carmine Schiavoni, 78, of Tarzana, took Brian's class three years
ago when he wanted to learn how to use a search engine and chat with
other seniors online. With 21 grandchildren, he said he had no
problem relating to someone so young.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian is a very patient person and he answered any question I
asked," Schiavoni said. "He has such a long list of people waiting to
see him now that I can't get in."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Brian and Ruth Smith, a tall, slender woman
with salt-and-pepper hair, were holed up in a tiny office at the
Victory Boulevard center. Smith wanted to learn how to add names to
her electronic address book.</TE>
<TE>   A look of wonder came over Smith's face as she entered her
friend's name and it appeared in the address book.</TE>
<TE>   "This is such a whole new world," Smith said. "It's so much fun."</TE>
<TE>   Brian said he comes back to the center year after year because he
likes ushering seniors into the Information Age.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I am helping them to make a connection to a
fast-moving world that they don't always feel a part of," Brian said.
"This is a big way for them to feel connected."</TE>

<HD>Fullerton's Rowdy Frat Row Needs Taming, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Longtime problem flared this month when a rented Greek
house was trashed after a party. Fraternity council president vows
change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having a collection of fraternity houses for a neighbor has its
moments, many of them bad. Just ask Amanda Tuccitto, who manages an
apartment complex an empty beer keg's toss from Cal State Fullerton's
frat row.</LD>
<LD>   "There was an ongoing summer party. When summer ended, they
celebrated that. Then they celebrated the start of school. Then there
was rush," said Tuccitto, whose 48 units in the Atlanta Pacifica
apartments are separated from the fraternities by an alley. "It was
quite something to behold."</LD>
<LD>   For 30 years, neighbors of the off-campus fraternities on Teri
Place have contended with the flotsam of passing college weekends.
Empty beer bottles littering lawns and broken furniture clogging the
alley. Loud music filling the night air and illegally parked cars.</LD>
<TE>   But the vandalism early this month of a fourplex rented by Sigma
Pi fraternity went far beyond the street's rowdy reputation. The
Greek group was on suspension from the university and being evicted
for not paying rent, when, police say, more than $100,000 in damage
was done to the house during a final party. Holes were punched in
walls; furniture, bathroom fixtures and windows were smashed and
paint splattered inside and out.</TE>
<TE>   The incident, which Fullerton police are investigating, stunned
city and university officials, who now are discussing what can be
done to bring order to a neighborhood where partying is a rite of
passage and police respond to scores of complaints each year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fearing a crackdown, Greek members are trying to
burnish their image, raising money for the owners of the trashed
property and trying to distance themselves from what they say is a
handful of troublemakers who have sullied their image. Plans for a
traditional blowout to celebrate the end of the semester last weekend
were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get rid of the stigma that all fraternities are like
them," said Rudie Baldwin, 20, president of the campus
Interfraternity Council. "What I fear will happen is that people in
political power will take this bad event and generalize it to say all
fraternities are bad and try to get rid of us."</TE>
<TE>   The tension has long been brewing.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that every few years, there's an event that goes beyond
the tolerance level of the community," Fullerton City Manager Chris
Meyer said. "There's a long, long history here."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, a spike in complaints led the city to require
recognized fraternities to obtain conditional use permits. These
mandate fire inspections, limit occupancy and set other rules that
officials concede aren't always followed to the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the permit process has given the city a tool to
limit the size of frat row and weed out the biggest troublemakers.
The city forbids any new fraternity house from being within 1,000
feet of an existing one. And in the last decade, two fraternities
were denied permits because of rowdy behavior, while another had its
permit revoked by the City Council. Some homes now are regarded as
"stealth fraternities" -- not officially recognized Greek houses, and
therefore immune from the regulations. The vandalized Sigma Pi house
had, in effect, become just that.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't discriminate against people wanting to live together,"
said Joel Rosen, Fullerton's chief planner. "If they comply with the
basic housing laws and building codes -- which are pretty liberal --
they can operate close to the edge of being a fraternity ... without
officially being one."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said that in coming months, the city's Neighborhood
Enhancement Team -- a committee of police, fire, code enforcement and
planning officials -- will discuss what more can be done on frat row.
Strategies could include more proactive inspections for code
violations and toughening the city's permit code.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure there's a solution," Meyer said. "Even if you could
legally run all the fraternities out, that would not solve the
problem. It's an area that has a high concentration of students, and
students have parties.... All we can do is to try to keep things
under control."</TE>
<TE>   Kandy Mink, the university's acting dean of students, said
meetings between fraternity members and residents in the community
could be one answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to do something," she said. "We have to
be continually working, educating students in the community on what
it means to be a good neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend marked the end of the fall semester. Normally, Teri
Place would have been awash in T.G.I.O -- Thank God It's Over --
parties. This year, the weekend was quiet, police say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Greek life advisor talked to the fraternity leadership and
gave them advice," Mink said of the decision to cancel the bash.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, whose fraternity recently held a toga party -- outside
the neighborhood -- took the advice to heart.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't do things like we did them before," he said. "Everybody
in the neighborhood is fed up. I don't see a problem with that.
Things are going to have to change."</TE>

<LD>The Garden Grove Freeway was closed in both directions for more than
seven hours Sunday after police found the body of a man who had been
shot to death, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man was found in a light green or aqua Honda in the eastbound
lanes near Beach Boulevard in Garden Grove. Police withheld his name
pending notification of relatives.</LD>
<LD>   Officials received a report of a single-vehicle accident about 5
a.m., said Sgt. Dennis Ellsworth, a spokesman for the Garden Grove
Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The freeway was reopened at 12:55 p.m. "It caused quite a snafu,"
said a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Police are asking anyone who witnessed the incident or knows
something about it to call the Garden Grove Police Department at

<LD>For many years, those looking for the fringes of the Ventura art
scene veered to the fringes of town, to the studio and gallery space
known as Art City.</LD>
<LD>   The compound sprawled on the edge of the Ventura River lost its
gallery space at the end of last year, though, leaving artists and
art aficionados high and dry.</LD>
<LD>   But the opening in October of the San Buenaventura Artists' Union
Gallery has helped fill the avant-garde gap, while allowing the city
to fulfill its arts goals.</LD>
<TE>   The gallery, next to the Holiday Inn and a stone's throw from the
Pacific Ocean, occupies half of a space most recently used as a gift
shop and a restaurant. Before that, it housed the popular jazz haunt
Charlie's.</TE>
<TE>   Photographer and gallery member Stephen Schafer said the new
gallery grew, in part, out of Art City's absence.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that Art City is not there anymore, there was a vacuum for
contemporary art in Ventura," he said. "We put that to the city. They
said, 'Well, we've got this space.' "</TE>
<TE>   The space turned out to be prime oceanfront real estate, available
because the city's 1998 Cultural Plan called for a contemporary art
space in the city's downtown cultural district. It was offered to the
artist union for the bargain price of $1 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Being offered the space, Schafer said, "was the kick in the pants
we needed to open up. I told everyone, 'This is the chance to make it
or break it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The union, whose membership has wavered but now stands at 35
active members, has been around for a decade without a gallery space
to call its own. A few years ago, it nearly did find a home, on the
third floor of Ventura City Hall. Hopes were high, but structural
problems prevented the space from becoming an official gallery.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the new Artists' Union Gallery has a much higher
public visibility than the third-floor gallery.</TE>
<TE>   In this neighborhood, unsuspecting and curious passersby are
common. One recent day, a couple peered into the closed gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Schafer, who was working inside, urged them to sign up for a
mailing list. "We come down here often but never knew this existed,"
the woman said.</TE>
<TE>   Said poet Phil Taggart, currently the union president, "It's an
incredible shock that we've become so visible, probably more visible
than we'll ever be again. The city of Ventura is to be commended."</TE>
<TE>   Inaugurating the gallery space in October was an exhibit of work
by union members, with the title "The Yet Unnamed Gallery." The
second, current show is on the theme of "Time," curated by Meg
Linton, head of the Contemporary Arts Forum in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The ticking sound you hear in the gallery comes from the
clock-based assemblage pieces by Schafer himself, deviating from his
usual medium of photography.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the show is an abstract sculpture called "Histories
Prayers a Sentinel," by Paul Lindhard, the founder and head of Art
City, who is now the artist union's vice president. Another familiar
name from Art City is union treasurer M.B. Hanrahan, whose piece in
this show is called "Tragedy Timing." A vaguely tense triptych
painted on unstretched canvas, the work hangs high on a wall and
casts an air of mild dread amid the vivid colors and imagery.</TE>
<TE>   An upstairs gallery is a fine small space of its own, suitable for
smaller shows. It can also provide a safety net for shows that may
contain images unsuitable for general walk-up traffic. Next up in the
gallery schedule is an exhibition called "Love and War," basically a
continuation of the annual erotic art shows held at Art City for many
years.</TE>

Schafer said. "It's sort of a risky business when you're in a city
space. It's so public."</TE>
<TE>   The union plans to use the space for more than just art. Last
week, Taggart kicked off what he hopes will be a monthly poetry
reading, and performances will become part of the gallery action.
It's also taking proposals for future exhibitions, for both group and
solo shows, hoping to bring in art from outside Ventura as well as
within.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the exposure to tourist traffic on the beachfront
promenade, catering to commercial interests is low on the members'
list of priorities. Art City's philosophy of presenting art primarily
for its own sake continues in the Artists' Union Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about good art," Schafer said, "and secondarily it's
available for selling."</TE>

<HD>Immigration Attorney for 7 Detainees Lashes Out at INS</HD>
<DH>Lawyer says the Patriot Act has been applied unevenly,
resulting in 'atrocious and inhumane' treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>An immigration attorney Sunday accused the Immigration and
Naturalization Service of subjecting her clients to "atrocious and
inhumane" treatment after they were arrested last week as part of the
USA Patriot Act registration program for men from five Muslim
countries.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego case also brings up an issue that the federal
government has yet to fully address -- reports of widely differing
treatment accorded detainees, depending on where they live.</LD>
<LD>   Banafsheh Akhlaghi, an immigration attorney from San Francisco,
said her seven clients, all from the Bay Area, are "shackled at the
hands and waist" and denied permission to see their families.
Akhlaghi said she does not quarrel with the law but finds its
application differs greatly in different locales.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, she noted, most men who were detained after
voluntarily appearing at INS facilities Monday were later allowed to
post bail. Most were "over-stayers," which is government jargon for
people who have remained in the U.S. after expiration of their
temporary visas.</TE>
<TE>   But in the San Francisco Bay Area, Akhlaghi said, those who were
detained were subjected to a multi-state odyssey as federal officials
hunted for empty jail cells. Her clients, she said, were bused to
Oakland and then flown to Arizona, Chicago, Kentucky and Bakersfield
before returning to Oakland for the flight to San Diego, where they
are being held in a privately run jail under contract to the city of
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials have conceded that their system was swamped by the
last-minute crush of young men and boys from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria
and Lybia seeking to comply with the law. The crush, officials said,
has caused problems in finding space for those being detained.</TE>
<TE>   The INS registration program, mandated for people from the five
countries who are in the United States on temporary visas, led to the
detention on immigration violation charges of as many as several
hundred, some of whom had nearly completed the process for legal
residency.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to see the INS clear up some of the procedure,"
Akhlaghi said. "It doesn't seem like they know what they are doing.
We just want uniformity and fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Nilo Mukhtar of San Francisco, an immigrant from Afghanistan, came
to San Diego in hopes of seeing her husband, an Iranian who was
detained because his visa has expired.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is absurd," Mukhtar said. The INS, she said, is "not
giving us any answers or letting us know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Akhlaghi said she would attempt to gain her clients' release by
going to immigration court today, although she does not have an
appointment on the court calendar. With two of three immigration
judges on vacation, her clients may not get a hearing until Jan. 9 or
10, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The court system does not even recognize them," Akhlaghi said.
"They still have rights as noncitizens."</TE>
<TE>   The plight of the Bay Area detainees has gained the sympathy of
Rep. Mike Honda (D-San Jose), who was sent to an internment camp with
his family during World War II. Honda, in a prepared statement, said
he questions "whether it is wise to seemingly punish persons who
voluntarily agreed to cooperate." He added, "I doubt that persons
guilty of terrorist activities would voluntarily cooperate with the
INS."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests, he said, "have unnecessarily caused more fear and
distrust" among immigrants from Muslim countries.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Sunday, more than 100 protesters from San Diego's Iranian
community demonstrated outside the downtown federal courthouse,
carrying signs decrying the INS roundup. "We're in support of steps
the government is taking to prevent terrorism, but this is going too
far," said Samira Rostami, 17, a high school senior. "This isn't what
America is supposed to be about."</TE>

<LD>The people at Haven Hills saved her life.</LD>
<LD>   That's how a 48-year-old victim of domestic violence named Krista
describes the help she has received from the 25-year-old San Fernando
Valley shelter for abused women.</LD>
<LD>   Krista, who is still being stalked by a former boyfriend and
doesn't want her last name printed, found Haven Hills after a friend
told her about the West Valley center. "I was emotionally killed,"
she said. "I'm coming back to life with the help of Haven Hills."</LD>
<TE>   This year, Haven Hills received a $5,000 grant from the Los
Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, the newspaper's seasonal fund-raising
drive.</TE>
<TE>   The money was used to help expand operation of its Domestic Abuse
Response Team, which works with Valley divisions of the Los Angeles
Police Depart- ment.</TE>
<TE>   "Individual support from people is the difference from being here
and not being here," said Betty Fisher, executive director of Haven
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization relies heavily on volunteers and
operates on a $1.8-million annual budget, much of which is
underwritten by government service contracts. But about a third of
the budget is covered by community support, Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Haven Hills' start came by accident in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Canoga Park Women's Club needed to perform a
community service to maintain its status with a women's club
federation. So club leaders decided to screen a movie on domestic
violence, Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't think there was a problem out where they were. But
they put a little blurb in the newspaper. They were surprised when
200 people -- service providers, police, social workers -- showed up,
thinking that somebody was starting something they could refer women
to," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   So the Canoga Park women went to work and created the shelter,
which today includes a 30-day crisis program with 36 beds that
handles about 165 women and 260 children a year; an 18-month
transitional living and employment program that helps 32 women and 73
children annually; a 24-hour crisis hotline that answers nearly
23,000 calls a year; and programs for children.</TE>
<TE>   Krista credits Haven Hills' counseling clinic with motivating her
return to college. She is studying to become a chemical-dependency
counselor. And when she begins drawing a paycheck, she intends to
become a financial supporter of Haven Hills, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, "There's a bag of clothes in the back of my car that I'm
taking them," Krista said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Holiday Campaign was established in 2000 and is a part
of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The McCormick Tribune Foundation matches the first $700,000 raised
at 50 cents on the dollar, and the foundation and The Times absorb
all administrative costs.</TE>

<HD>Housing Prices Climb Higher</HD>
<DH>The hot Ventura County real estate market continues to
sizzle with a $343,000 median for November, up nearly 18% from a year
ago.</DH>
<SE>The Region</SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The price of a typical Ventura County home hit a record $343,000 last
month, and November sales increased 8.8% from a year ago, putting the
county on track for its biggest year since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The latest figures, released by DataQuick Information Systems,
show the median home price resuming its climb after stalling for five
months in the mid-$330,000s.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 1,364 new and existing homes and condominiums sold in
November, 110 more than the same month a year ago. The median price
-- the point at which half the dwellings sold for more and half for
less -- was up $52,000, or 17.9%, from November 2001.</LD>
<TE>   DataQuick analyst John Karevoll said he expects December's median
to exceed $350,000, because home prices historically increase in the
final month of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Through Nov. 30, 16,326 homes had been sold in Ventura County,
8.3% more than in the same 11-month period last year and only about
100 homes short of the total sold for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Though 71 fewer new homes sold last month than a year ago, their
median price was up 12.8% to $440,000. Resale homes were up 16.2% and
condos were up 24%.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength of Ventura County's market continues to surprise
me," said Bill Watkins, executive director of UC Santa Barbara's
Economic Forecast Project.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep expecting the rate of growth to slow down, but it hasn't
happened yet. This speaks to the very dynamic nature of the Ventura
County economy."</TE>
<TE>   Demand continues to grow, while relatively little home building
limits supply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll, who has monitored technical benchmarks in the local
housing market for months, said rising prices and strong sales will
likely continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen no indication that the housing market is going to
act any differently in the next six months than it has in the last
six months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among signs of potential trouble, Karevoll said, would be the
number of people defaulting on mortgages, which remains relatively
low.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's record home price is in line with median prices
in six Southern California counties, which all reached highs in
November. The regionwide median increased to $288,000, up 21%
compared with November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Baker, president of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors,
said nearly every home offered for sale in his area is snapped up
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as interest rates stay low, we would expect demand to
remain high and for prices to continue to increase," he said. "I
don't see any negative side to the market at all."</TE>
<TE>   Several Ventura County communities now have median prices above
$400,000. Sales are up in all price ranges, and even entry-level
buyers have an opportunity to make a deal, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is actually not a bad time to buy, because of the low
interest rates which makes financing easy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With rates below 5.7% for a 30-year loan, Karevoll said it
actually costs less to buy a typical home at today's higher prices
than it did 13 years ago -- near the top of the last housing boom.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage for today's
median priced home, based on a 20% down payment, is about $1,579, he
said. In the spring of 1989, the median price in Ventura was
$228,000, but the monthly payment was $1,782 because of interest
rates of more than 11.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Interest rates are so good that people don't have to push their
finances out on thin ice to buy a home, like they had to do 10 or 15
years ago," Karevoll said.</TE>

<HD>Median Home Price Hits High of $343,000</HD>
<DH>The November midpoint increases nearly 18% over a year ago,
as limited supply and low interest rates keep market buoyant.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The price of a typical Ventura County home hit a record $343,000 last
month, and November sales increased 8.8% from a year ago, putting the
county on track for its biggest year since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The latest figures, released by DataQuick Information Systems,
show the median home price resuming its climb after stalling for five
months in the mid-$330,000s.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 1,364 new and existing homes and condominiums sold in
November, 110 more than the same month a year ago. The median price
-- the point at which half the dwellings sold for more and half for
less -- was up $52,000, or 17.9%, from November 2001.</LD>
<TE>   DataQuick analyst John Karevoll said he expects December's median
to exceed $350,000, because home prices historically increase in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Through Nov. 30, 16,326 homes had been sold in Ventura County,
8.3% more than in the same 11-month period last year and only about
100 homes short of the total sold for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Though 71 fewer new homes sold last month than a year ago, their
median price was up 12.8% to $440,000. Resale homes were up 16.2%;
condos were up 24%.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength of Ventura County's market continues to surprise
me," said Bill Watkins, executive director of UC Santa Barbara's
Economic Forecast Project. "I keep expecting the rate of growth to
slow down, but it hasn't happened yet. This speaks to the very
dynamic nature of the Ventura County economy."</TE>
<TE>   Demand continues to grow, while relatively little home building
limits supply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll, who has monitored technical benchmarks in the local
housing market for months, said rising prices and strong sales will
likely continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen no indication that the housing market is going to
act any differently in the next six months than it has in the last
six months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among signs of potential trouble, Karevoll said, would be the
number of people defaulting on mortgages, which remains relatively
low.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's record home price is in line with median prices
in six Southern California counties, which all reached highs in
November. The regionwide median increased to $288,000, up 21%
compared with November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Baker, president of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors,
said nearly every home offered for sale in his area is snapped up
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as interest rates stay low, we would expect demand to
remain high and for prices to continue to increase," he said. "I
don't see any negative side to the market at all."</TE>
<TE>   About a half a dozen communities in Ventura County now have median
prices above $400,000. Sales are up in all price ranges, and even
entry-level buyers have an opportunity to make a deal, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is actually not a bad time to buy, because of the low
interest rates which makes financing easy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With rates below 5.7% for a 30-year loan, Karevoll said it
actually costs less to buy a typical home at today's higher prices

<HD>Woman Is Slain in Car; Irvine Police Jail Driver</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man police say shot and killed a woman inside his car, wounding
himself in the ankle, was arrested in Irvine on Sunday afternoon
after a brief standoff with officers.</LD>
<LD>   David Benjamin Rodgers, 37, of Lancaster was booked into Orange
County Jail on suspicion of murder after he was treated for what
police believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Jeff
Noble of the Irvine Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that he shot the passenger while they were inside the
car," Noble said, adding that police were still trying to determine
the relationship between Rodgers and the woman.</LD>
<TE>   Coroners officials didn't release her name because they had not
notified her relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists near Alton Parkway and Sand Canyon Avenue heard gunshots
about 11 a.m. and called police from their cell phones, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they then saw Rodgers' gray Pontiac Grand Am jump a
curb and run into shrubs in a field near the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   A witness thought the vehicle was involved in an accident and went
to check on the two people inside. When he saw Rodgers clutching a
handgun, he walked away and called police.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Am was quickly surrounded by officers, and watched from
a police helicopter. Officers ordered Rodgers to toss his gun from
the car and surrender.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers gave him commands but he refused to listen," Noble
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like he was on his cell phone, and at one moment he was
waving it, but he didn't say anything to us."</TE>
<TE>   After 15 minutes, Rodgers threw the gun out of the window and
crawled from the car, limping, Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said three bullet holes in the car's windshield may be from
Rodgers' gun. Noble said none of the eight officers fired their
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   An Irvine police officer responding to the shooting was injured
when his vehicle collided with a car at Alton Parkway and Jeffrey
Road. Three passengers were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa
Ana. The fourth passenger and the officer were taken to Irvine
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Injuries ranged from minor to
moderate.</TE>

<HD>Red Tape Hampered Probe of Doctor</HD>
<DH>Board spent five years on inquiry into man who
overprescribed pills to celebrities, others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between the time the first patient complained about Dr. Jules Mark
Lusman's penchant for prescribing addictive narcotics and when the
cosmetic surgeon was forced to give up his California medical
license, five years came and went.</LD>
<LD>   With a star-studded cast including Winona Ryder, a singular lack
of cooperative witnesses and a dramatic finale, the case took longer
than most and has drawn far more public attention. For all of its
distinctiveness, however, the case illustrates some commonplace
delays that hamper the Medical Board of California as it polices the
state's nearly 90,000 doctors.</LD>
<LD>   For example: The board, overwhelmed by complaints that seemed to
pose greater danger to patients, at first didn't assign the case the
highest priority. Medical records were hard to obtain, requiring
drawn-out court battles. What ended as a barrage of evidence
initially arrived in trickles.</LD>
<TE>   Two of Lusman's lawyers quit; his legal defense dragged on for
months. Expert testimony was difficult to coordinate, and the burden
of proof -- "clear and convincing" under California law -- was high
and hard to meet.</TE>
<TE>   Delays like these have gummed up the works of the medical board
for more than a decade, some board critics say. And far too often,
they say, the discipline ultimately delivered is too light, falling
well short of the revocation that ended the Lusman case. Just 38 of
the state's doctors had their licenses revoked last year, although
the board opened 2,608 investigations and referred 589 cases to the
attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes too long, there are too many steps, and very few
complaints end up with any discipline," said Julianne D'Angelo
Fellmeth, administrative director of the University of San Diego's
Center for Public Interest Law, which has monitored the board and
pressed for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lusman case, state regulators had the advantage of a
warning. The doctor was disciplined in South Africa in 1986 for
overprescribing addictive medications, and for that reason,
regulators here placed him on probation for his first two years of
practice. Yet, after his probation expired, it took multiple
allegations of wrongdoing before the same behavior derailed him in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Wrongdoing Denied</TE>
<TE>   Lusman, whose license was revoked Dec. 6 after an administrative
hearing, has denied wrongdoing and is appealing the board's decision
in California Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Joseph, the medical board's executive director, said the case
was not at all typical. "We worked as well as we could under the
circumstances, but it was a complicated case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Lusman case in many ways is emblematic of
inappropriate-prescription complaints, which are hard to prove and a
growing concern in California, other state regulators say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the tip of a major iceberg facing California: the
whole area of pain management and the number of patients who are
addicted," said Dr. Ronald H. Wender, president of the board's
Division of Medical Quality.</TE>
<TE>   A recent board report noted that the agency has too few experts in
pain management to review those cases.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, the Lusman case comes as the medical board is under
intense political scrutiny, and as it is launching some significant
reforms. Partly because of the spotlight on the board itself, and
partly because of the Lusman case's high profile -- it involved
patients including Ryder and musician-actress Courtney Love --
reformers are raising questions about why it took so long to
adjudicate.</TE>
<TE>   "Why five years? That's what everybody's going to be asking," said
state Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), who sponsored a bill to reform
the system that becomes law next month. "It's alarming."</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa headed a routine legislative review last spring that led
to a critical report on the board's enforcement record. Board
officials and critics alike label her reform law -- which calls for
an independent enforcement monitor to evaluate the disciplinary
system and increases public disclosure about problem physicians -- a
victory for consumer protection.</TE>
<TE>   Independently, the board created "strike teams" to expedite the
most severe cases, and reorganized the complaint unit so that cases
involving the quality of patient care are fast-tracked. The board
also is changing the way it collects data in hopes of pinpointing
clogs in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Many delays are outside the board's direct control -- as when
doctors themselves drag out legal proceedings, or when the board's
prosecutors from the state attorney general's office run into
problems obtaining records. (Doctors are entitled to challenge
accusations in proceedings before administrative law judges, who then
make disciplinary recommendations to the medical board.)</TE>
<TE>   Mixture of Delays</TE>
<TE>   If a case takes a year to investigate "because it took 10 months
and a lot of court maneuvering to get the records, then there's a
problem with the legal aspect of the system," said Wender, who heads
the board's enforcement committee.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, we'll have to take responsibility for those
things under our purview. If it took four months for the expert to
review the case, then that's not an expert we're going to be able to
use."</TE>
<TE>   As with many cases, Lusman's included a mixture of delays, many
outside the medical board's control.</TE>
<TE>   The first patient complaint arrived in 1997, from a woman who
claimed that she became addicted to Demerol under Lusman's care. The
case was handed to the attorney general's office for prosecution
after a year, but by then the patient was no longer talking.</TE>
<TE>   The court battle for access to her medical records dragged on for
nearly three years. Meanwhile, another patient who complained -- in
February 1999 -- cooperated only partially, again forcing
investigators into court for a subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't one tip that took five years to complete," said Joseph.
"There were a series of patients who went through the 'I'm mad at my
doctor' phase, and when we were ready to go to hearing they weren't
mad at their doctor anymore."</TE>
<TE>   After records were in hand, a medical expert's review took still
more time. It wasn't until the summer of 2001, when another doctor
came forward to complain, that the case broke open, said Dave
Thornton, the board's chief of enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Suspecting risk to a greater number of patients, investigators
worked with the California Board of Pharmacy, which conducted an
audit and found that Lusman was writing multiple prescriptions for a
number of patients in the same week or even day, state records show.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators then got a search warrant for Lusman's office and
home, taking patient files. Lusman's case moved relatively fast after
that and, by last March, investigators won an interim order
suspending his right to prescribe.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the hearing to determine whether his license would be
pulled was plagued by 10 months of delays. Expert witnesses had
scheduling conflicts, Lusman's first lawyer bowed out, and Lusman
injured himself in Mexico, said Deputy Atty. Gen. E. A. Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lusman, whose second lawyer had quit, got a four-month
reprieve to assemble his defense.</TE>
<TE>   In this case and others, legal delays outside the medical board's
control were compounded by the board's essentially reactive role. It
generally waits for complaints to arrive, for witnesses to come
forward and for patterns to emerge before it seeks subpoenas or takes
other aggressive action.</TE>
<TE>   Other regulators are less hampered. The Board of Pharmacy has the
authority to inspect pharmaceutical records with no subpoena, and can
therefore more easily uncover the types of abuses that led to
Lusman's undoing.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Cooperation</TE>
<TE>   In a report to the board in October, Wender, the enforcement
committee chairman, cited other common hindrances. He found that
investigators and prosecutors don't cooperate closely enough.</TE>
<TE>   And expert review -- generally the keystone of patient care
investigations -- has suffered due to a dearth of some specialists, a
lack of imposed time limits to complete reviews, and -- in some cases
-- the poor quality of reviewers themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In general, watchdog groups say, California's enforcement record
against doctors is mediocre compared to other states.</TE>
<TE>   "California has just never broken into the [ranks of] better
states," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group in Washington, D.C. The agency ranks states
according to the prevalence of serious disciplinary actions -- from
probation to revocation of licensure.</TE>
<TE>   California was 25th last year, up from 42nd place a decade ago but
down from its peak at 18th in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even the harshest critics say that the California board has
made progress. It is a far cry from the panel of a dozen years ago,
when top officials ordered hundreds of unattended complaints
dismissed or destroyed to conceal a backlog. Though disciplinary
actions have dropped since 1997, the overall trend over the decade
has been upward.</TE>
<TE>   One setback is a hiring freeze that has limited the investigative
staff to about 70, down from a peak of 95 last year.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators and prosecutors have managed to speed up their
work, state records show. In 1995, it took an average of nearly four
years from the time a complaint was received to the time action was
taken. That's down to a little over two years.</TE>
<TE>   Though no organization tracks the time it takes to complete cases,
Dale L. Austin, chief operating officer of the Federation of State
Medical Boards, said most states average between nine and 18 months.</TE>

<HD>Epicenter of Dissent</HD>
<DH>Near South Coast Plaza is the site of choice for peace
activism -- the same corner where the Vietnam War was decried</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Protester Mike Mang peers through his gasmask at the sea of
headlights coming at him during rush-hour traffic, with horns blaring
like a discordant symphony.</LD>
<LD>   "This big opera of horn honkers is music to my ears," said Mang,
an antiwar activist and retired high school teacher, who can
distinguish the horns of hostile drivers from those against war on
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "A year ago, they were flipping us off, but I think they're
warming up to us."</LD>
<TE>   Mang is one of about 100 rain-or-shine demonstrators at the corner
of Anton Boulevard and Bristol Street in Costa Mesa each Friday
night, rallying for peace and continuing a long tradition of
demonstrations at this spot since the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   How this corner emerged as Orange County's soapbox central for
liberal-minded causes has stumped local historians. Some say the
corner is strategic because it's along an access route to three major
freeways. Across the street loom South Coast Plaza, ritzy
restaurants, five-star hotels and an arts center, where pedestrians
bustle.</TE>
<TE>   The stylish holiday shoppers loaded down with parcels are a stark
contrast to Mang and his cohorts. Take protester Chuck Anderson, a
key organizer who wears a beret, a body bag and a sign that reads "No
War for Oil." Or Silvia Soto and Sandy Hill, who drape themselves in
black burkas, mourning bloodied baby dolls wrapped in bandages to
call attention to women and children devastated by war.</TE>
<TE>   The faces of grass-roots activists young and old, students,
teachers and parents who have committed one hour of every week to
call for peace at this corner have caught the attention of passersby.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the only spots I know of in Orange County where
there's a lively populace voicing their freedom of speech," said Cris
Gross, a daily commuter who works nearby and usually honks in
support. "Since I moved here 20 years ago, there have been protesters
there looking for support with some kind of message, and they're
doing it in a really tough market.</TE>
<TE>   "They're kind of a regular thing there now, but they haven't lost
their impact," he added. "Whether you agree with their message or
not, it's their enthusiasm that you pick up on."</TE>
<TE>   Protesters say this vibrant, progressive pulse began in the 1960s
and continued sporadically through the next decades over a variety of
issues: Kosovo, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, abortion rights, animal
rights, the nuclear arms race, aid to the Contra rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The Left Bank it's not. And it lacks Berkeley's peacenik vibes.
But Mang recalls how this nondescript intersection helped shaped his
grass-roots activism 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, during the Vietnam War, this got to be the place people
came to rally for peace," said Mang, 62, of Corona del Mar, who first
stomped the street corner in anger over that conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Orange County still had large swaths of rolling fields of
lima beans and strawberries, and livestock grazing the bluff side. It
was the place where Richard Nixon earned his political chops. The
hard-line conservatism ran so deep in the heart of Orange County that
one of the left-leaning challengers to Nixon for the U.S. Senate,
Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas, dubbed the "Pink Lady," had fruit,
eggs and tomatoes thrown at her during a 1950 campaign visit, Mang
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very conformist and conservative [in] the establishment.
It was a time when a Democrat was considered almost a Communist,"
said Mang, who grew up Republican on wealthy, conservative Lido Isle
and staunchly supported Barry Goldwater in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam as Impetus</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Mang was teaching U.S. government and world history.
From 1968 to 1975, the Vietnam War was the primary topic in his high
school classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my students were up for the draft, and they had a vested
interest in what was going on in Vietnam," Mang said. "They were
open-minded, and as a government teacher, I wanted to present all
political views. And one of the views was activism, the protests out
at Anton and Bristol at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Mang switched to the Democratic Party in 1969, and in 1988 to the
Green Party.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no place in suburban Orange County for people to come
together and congregate in large numbers, and it seemed like a good
place to demonstrate," Mang said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds would eventually fade, then sprout up again as a new
issue emerged. The latest spate of demonstrations began with the
bombing of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what brought me back," said the white-bearded Mang. "After
Sept. 11, the Bush administration wanted to go after Osama, which was
fine. But then when we expanded into Afghanistan and bombed a lot of
innocent civilians -- that's what got me going. I don't want to sit
around and feel helpless to all the injustices and wars I read about
in the headlines."</TE>
<TE>   Some protesters demand broader justice in the Mideast, such as for
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters have strayed from this spot, but with little success.
They've tried the traffic circle in Orange, Disneyland's front
entrance, Fashion Island and the Laguna Beach boardwalk. "But those
always fizzled, and we seem to always end up at Anton and Bristol,"
Mang said.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say their grass-roots protests are a breath of fresh air
after a sobering midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy isn't only about going to a voting booth and voting;
it's everything that happens in between elections," said Cal State
Fullerton assistant professor Jarret S. Lovell, 30, of Balboa Island.
He teaches criminal justice by day and joins the protests at Anton
and Bristol after work.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a long-sleeve denim shirt, tie and khakis, Lovell holds
placards that read "Stop the Bombing" and "Ask Us Why We're
Protesting."</TE>
<TE>   "Voting is one of the more passive acts of democracy. Democracy is
about organizing, debating and the public exchange of ideas," he
said. "When people honk at us, they're exchanging ideas with us.
Really, though, it's intimidating to stand across from a shopping
mall in Orange County and carry political signs.</TE>
<TE>   "But we want to get people thinking around the clock -- on their
way to work, home, school or shop. The U.S. military war machine
doesn't stop when you're doing shopping. This is a place where people
don't typically expect to see this kind of activity with a message
sent out to them."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping It Loose</TE>
<TE>   The group is informal, loosely organized as the "No War on Iraq"
committee. No names and phone numbers are taken. No addresses are
listed. No fees are required. There is no treasury and no governing
body. Just meet at the same time, same place. Recruitment is
serendipitous. Mang recalls one evening when a carful of Palestinian
women drove by, saw the protesters and decided to join in.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each lively, hourlong demonstration, protesters
gather to hear about other issues and opportunities for activism,
whether it's raising wages for Taco Bell workers or fighting
exploitation of Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Several peace movements have spun off from this Costa Mesa bunch,
forming in such cities as Laguna Beach, Riverside and Pomona.
Demonstrators here have joined busloads of other protesters at
gatherings in San Francisco and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   But for Mang, returning to the Anton and Bristol scene is like
visiting an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   "This will never be Berkeley or the Left Bank, because it's too
conservative here and the roots are very conservative, and the
establishment does not want a Berkeley here," he said. "But, oddly
enough, out of the bowels of this conservative Orange County beast is
this progressive anomaly."</TE>

<HD>Did They Think Pete Wilson Was a Democrat?</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a new mag for new Dems -- Blueprint, published by the Democratic
Leadership Council.</LD>
<LD>   The November/December issue's cover story on President Bush and
his political advisor Karl Rove features a cartoon captioned "Bush's
World," a Steinberg-New-Yorker-like perspective of the view from the
White House. This part of the country is labeled "Californians (they
don't like me)." Well, at least by a margin of 1.3 million votes in
2000, Californians preferred Al Gore to Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Which is not to say that the fact-checkers at Blueprint are
exactly on top of the Golden State's game either. Another story,
about the good news for Democrats in the 2002 elections, cited the
reelection of Gray Davis, "the first Democrat to win a second term in
the Golden State since Jerry Brown...." Yoo-hoo, you people 3,000
miles away in the Beltway bubble: Gray Davis is the first Democrat to
win even a FIRST term since Jerry Brown. Post-Moonbeam, California
elected and reelected only a pair of Republicans, George Deukmejian
and Pete Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   It's the Running That Counts</TE>
<TE>   Something like 17 men and women who ran for office hoping that the
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood would secede (so there would be
offices for them to hold) declared their intention to run for seats
in the Los Angeles city government they once sought to dissect, but
only a few have stayed the course to make it to the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Three of them crowd into the 12th District council race to replace
the bon-voyage-bound Hal Bernson, but none of the six who'd intended
to run for the 6th District council seat, soon to be left empty by
termed-out Ruth Galanter, ended up certified for the ballot. And
three are running for two community college board of trustee seats.</TE>
<TE>   'Two's Company,' a New Sitcom?</TE>
<TE>   Al Franken could have a spinoff even before he has a series.</TE>
<TE>   As you read here recently, Franken -- the guy whose 1996 book,
"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot," set about to let some hot air out
of the conservative talk showman -- was already at work on a Capitol
Hill sitcom. The premise: the real-life adventures of four
congressmen sharing a D.C. townhouse during the week and hurrying
home on the weekends. Among the plot complications -- dueling
bedtimes, piles of unwashed dishes (and presumably unlaundered
campaign contributions).</TE>
<TE>   Now for the spinoff, "The Sisters Sanchez" (Las Hermanas Sanchez).
The first sisters ever elected to Congress -- Democrats Loretta (a
morning person) and Linda (a late-night person) -- will be sharing
living quarters.</TE>
<TE>   They still haven't found a place. While the cost of living in the
Hill-adjacent neighborhoods of D.C. is roughly comparable to that in
Orange County -- which is to say, ridiculous -- there are
distinctions. Linda Sanchez would like a place with a garage, but her
sister will no doubt soon wise up the honorable freshwoman to the
fact that D.C. cabs are cheap, and they're everywhere, unlike in
Southern California. Also unlike in Southern California, the subway
really goes a long way.</TE>
<TE>   The Latest on the California GOP</TE>
<TE>   Update on California Republicans:</TE>
<TE>   One: Yes, indeed, they have a pulse.</TE>
<TE>   Two: Brooks Firestone, former assemblyman and, according to his
news release, "leader of the mainstream of the Republican Party in
California," is the name at the top of a list of 10 state GOPsters --
none of them officeholders -- who called on Mississippi Sen. Trent
"Vote Thurmond" Lott to resign as Senate Republican leader, or, as
the release put it incorrectly, "as the parties Senate Leader." (Lott
belongs to more than one party?)</TE>
<TE>   Three: The California GOP is still as split as a Thanksgiving
wishbone. Shawn Steel, chairman of the state GOP, was censured
unanimously by the 20-member board of directors of his own party
after he gave a speech saying he'd try to recall any GOP legislator
who votes to raise taxes to help close the mind-boggling billions of
the state budget deficit. (They may not have disagreed with him, but,
according to a party spokesman, "the rub" was that, if anybody's
entitled to make that threat, it's the elected GOP legislative
leaders, not the party chairman -- who, by the bye, will not be
running for reelection to that job.)</TE>
<TE>   Four: The Republicans gleefully pointed out that the low-key Jan.
6 inauguration planned for Gov. Gray Davis redux is still seeking
"platinum sponsors" willing to donate $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Getting an Early -- Very -- Start</TE>
<TE>   Has the Los Angeles mayor's race already started three years
early?</TE>
<TE>   What may have been a warmup for the first mayoral debate was a
Dec. 16 exchange between Mayor Jim Hahn and Assemblyman Keith
Richman. Richman is a Northridge Republican who got more than half of
all the votes among the 10 candidates for mayor of a San Fernando
Valley city, which didn't get the good-to-go vote, so he went back to
being an assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was in Encino to hear ideas from the 70 or so people --
including Richman -- who ran for spots in the proposed Valley and
Hollywood cities' governments. The cities didn't get voted in, so
neither did the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Richman got up and accused Hahn of trying to "circumvent" someone
else's question about a planning rule change in Chatsworth, then
swung into a major-issues speech that sounded to more than a few ears
like someone inaugurating a campaign for something.</TE>
<TE>   "He directly challenged the mayor," recounted Carlos Ferreyra. "He
was laying out what he's going to ding the mayor on in the campaign.
That was definitely a campaign speech."</TE>
<TE>   Let's All Get Along</TE>
<TE>   Truce time in Orange County: In the spirit of bipartisanship, UC
Irvine is hosting a fund-raising dinner next month to set up two new
fellowships at its School of Social Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Ta-aaa! The Willie L. Brown Jr. Fellowship, named for the
almost-speaker-for-life Democrat who is now the mayor of San
Francisco, and the James L. Brulte Fellowship, for the Republican
state Senate leader from Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   They'll have to live together under one roof -- the Center for the
Study of Democracy at UCI. Both will be guests at the dinner,
speaking on "understanding the budget" (waiter, more coffee, please).
The top-dollar ticket is $25,000; the belt-tightener's special is
$200.</TE>

<HD>Prison Tries to Put Cork in Inmates' Illegal Brew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a full-bodied wine with a bouquet redolent of moldy peaches and
a finish that can evoke everything from all-purpose bathroom cleaner
to uric acid.</LD>
<LD>   In prisons, it is known as pruno -- cellblock wine made from
fruit, sugar and mess-hall punch. It is potent, easy to brew and has
been around for ages.</LD>
<LD>   But officials at Los Angeles County's only state prison have come
up with a plan to make pruno as rare as a 1945 Chateau Latour
Bordeaux.</LD>
<TE>   In October, the maximum-security lockup in Lancaster removed fresh
fruit -- the preferred base for pruno -- from the boxed lunches
delivered daily to the cells of its 4,000 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, prison spokesman Lt. Ron Nipper said, is to reduce
violent incidents at the institution. In the first nine months of the
year, 102 assaults on staff and 122 inmate-on-inmate violent
incidents were reported.</TE>
<TE>   "With a lot of our serious incidents, the inmates are drunk,"
Nipper said. "We've got to put a serious damper on making alcohol."</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown is not only an attempt to make the prison safer but
also part of a push by the state Department of Corrections to make
prisoners healthier and reduce long-term medical costs. Since 1999,
the state's 33 prisons have been phasing in standardized "heart
healthy" menus that feature balanced meals, low-fat foods and fresh
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, Sacramento asked wardens to crack down on pruno,
arguing that dietary health gains are nullified when prisoners
consistently get drunk and turn violent.</TE>
<TE>   The move is also part of a broader campaign to treat inmates with
substance-abuse problems. About 85% of the state's 160,000 inmates
were addicted to drugs or alcohol when they committed their crimes,
state corrections spokesman Russ Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last seven years, the department has increased from 400 to
8,500 the number of prison beds set aside for substance-abuse
treatment. And while some prison guards once turned a blind eye to
drunk inmates, they are increasingly realizing that substance-abuse
treatment and tougher anti-liquor enforcement may help reduce
recidivism rates.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to get them free of what they're addicted to,"
Heimerich said. "And people who are clearheaded are more likely to
make more rational choices -- including whether to commit violent
acts."</TE>
<TE>   State corrections officials are considering taking the fresh fruit
ban systemwide. Prisons already are prohibited from serving three
popular pruno ingredients -- oranges, raisins and sugar packets. But
a state report determined that creative prisoners can make pruno from
yams, flavored gelatin, honey, hard candies -- anything with sugars
that can be converted into alcohol in the fermentation process.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated prison officials say they can't ban everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Some institutions have tried, and they've found that about the
only thing they can serve is meat," Heimerich said. "You can make
[pruno] out of ketchup. Some inmates were even using the frosting off
of cakes. It's pretty much an unwinnable battle."</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster prison officials say it's too early to tell whether the
new regulation is having a direct effect on pruno production. Because
of a number of recent violent incidents, some of the yards have
remained locked down for months, which means that for now, some
prisoners receive all meals in their cells.</TE>
<TE>   Though under normal conditions prisoners would no longer have
fresh fruit in their living quarters, they still receive fruit at
cafeterias during breakfast and dinner. It's a solution, Nipper said,
that avoids any conflict with the Corrections Department's guideline
that prisoners receive 15 servings of fresh fruit each week.</TE>
<TE>   They are also hoping the policy helps them avoid a problem that
occurred at Salinas Valley State Prison earlier this year. When
officials there replaced fresh fruit with canned juices and fruit
cocktail, inmates invoked the 8th Amendment, citing its ban on cruel
and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit Back on Menu</TE>
<TE>   The state inspector general's office conducted an investigation in
March and sided with the inmates, forcing officials to reintroduce
fruit on the menu, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At San Quentin, officials rely on cell searches to combat pruno
production. They also keep sugar and yeast -- which speeds the
fermentation -- away from inmate prison workers, said spokesman Lt.
Vernell Crittendon.</TE>
<TE>   Even at Lancaster, corrections officers concede that it will be
difficult to stop pruno production. The basic recipes are simple and
require only a rudimentary knowledge of the fermentation process, in
which sugars are broken down into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide in
the presence of yeast.</TE>
<TE>   In his self-published book, "The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible,"
author Leon Kania offers a pruno recipe that calls for sugar, water
or juice, baker's yeast and raisins or grapes.</TE>
<TE>   San Quentin death row inmate Jarvis Masters calls for fruit
cocktail, oranges, white sugar and ketchup in his 1992 poem "Recipe
for Prison Pruno" -- a PEN award-winning work that intersperses
precise brewing instructions with Masters' execution sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Most prison brewers let the ingredients ferment in a plastic bag,
then share the potent results with cellmates who have contributed
their fruit to the mix. The end result, by most accounts, is best
gulped quickly while holding one's nose, though Roger Howard, a
former inmate of the Oregon state prison system in the 1950s, said he
was able to produce a few pleasant pruno vintages.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Howard, who grew up in a family of bootleggers, was
sent to prison in 1952, he had already learned the tricks of his
parents' trade. He made his pruno in the prison boiler room, where he
was assigned to a work detail. He and fellow inmates would smuggle it
back to their cells in their boots.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, now 67, still recalls the effects of pruno, which may help
explain its enduring popularity. "It'd get you up and running. You'd
just lay back and make sure you have a cellmate, someone to [talk]
with, and not let the guards catch you. You know -- you sort of had
an out, there, for a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hughes, a corrections officer at Lancaster, said pruno
consumption in state prison mirrors drinking habits on the outside,
with increases at Christmas, Fourth of July and Cinco de Mayo.</TE>
<TE>   In the state system, inmates caught with alcohol can receive a
number of punishments, ranging from criminal charges to a loss of
good-time credits.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Rick Adams, who heads the Men's
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, said that pruno is a bigger
problem than drugs at the 6,800-inmate facility. For years, the jail
has been so overcrowded that it is too dangerous to serve meals in
cafeterias. Because all meals are delivered to cells, pruno is
everywhere, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The searches are ongoing. But you know how they have to paint the
Golden Gate Bridge? They have to start painting at one end before
they're done painting at the other. That's us. We're constantly
finding gallons of the stuff."</TE>

<HD>State Park Rangers in Harm's Way</HD>
<DH>Urban ills are spilling into the nation's largest parks
system. For the first time, a ranger has been shot on the job in
once-tranquil preserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dana Jones was in her second month on the job as superintendent of
Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area near Tracy, Calif., when she
discovered a methamphetamine lab operating in an abandoned mine.</LD>
<LD>   It was to be her introduction to the realities of life at a
California state park. When she wasn't being shot at or threatened,
she was arresting drunk drivers and trying to settle domestic
disputes in campgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   It's a familiar story throughout the nation's largest state park
system. Even as park employees reacted with horror at the news
earlier this month that a ranger in the Santa Cruz Mountains had
become California's first park ranger to be shot on the job, few were
surprised.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a sign of the times," said Jones, who is the incoming
president of the California State Park Rangers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers have watched as urban ills have spilled into the state's
once tranquil parks and beaches.</TE>
<TE>   This month's incident at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park may have
been the first in which a ranger was shot, but rangers are routinely
shot at, beaten, run over and threatened.</TE>
<TE>   With the parks drawing increasing numbers of visitors, arrests
have increased more than 100% in three years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, attacks and threats against National Park Service
personnel increased by 940% in 2001 from the previous year, and
violent incidents involving Forest Service employees increased 136%,
according to statistics compiled by Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility, a nonprofit group based in Washington,
D.C., that advocates on behalf of park rangers and other employees of
the Department of the Interior.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting near Santa Cruz occurred Dec. 10 as the ranger,
Sharon Galligan, attempted to cite a man for illegal camping.
Authorities say the man emerged from a car and shot Galligan, who
also fired her gun. Galligan, a 16-year veteran, was wounded in the
knee.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, David Melberg, was arrested Dec. 11 in San Jose and
has pleaded not guilty. Galligan is recovering at her Santa Cruz
home.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the incident reverberated through the close-knit ranger
community, where, Jones said, "Everyone knows everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a big family," said Jones, who has worked with
Galligan. "It hits close to home."</TE>
<TE>   All California park rangers are trained as peace officers and
qualified to carry guns.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Jones said, rangers are expressing concern that the job
they hoped would take them into the serenity of nature has put some
in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Stearns, a state parks department spokesman, said the agency
is examining the possibility of assigning partners to rangers who
patrol remote areas alone. He said that, in those areas, it can take
more than an hour for backup help from other rangers or law
enforcement to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "But, like most things, that will require more money, which we
certainly don't have," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   To some, conflict seems inevitable at cramped state parks that
altogether host 85 million visitors a year. Rangers and others say
societal ills are migrating to public lands.</TE>
<TE>   They point to an incident at San Onofre State Beach three years
ago in which a man hijacked a taxi and drove it into the park. He was
shot and killed by rangers.</TE>
<TE>   In a fatal encounter last year, a man at Morro Strand State Beach
killed another man and his 11-year-old nephew after a squabble over a
parking spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the same type of offenses you see in society at large,"
said Jim Fitzpatrick, the state parks superintendent for emergency
services.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick, a 20-year veteran, said he was a park ranger less
than a month before he was spit on and kicked while arresting a drunk
driver.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the parks. Authorities responsible for public lands
report increased conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the angry encounters with Bureau of Land Management
employees last year were violent, according to the report by Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most contentious slices of public lands in the nation
is the Imperial Dunes, managed by the Bureau of Land Management.
During recent holiday weekends, tens of thousands of off-road-vehicle
enthusiasts swarmed across the vast sand dunes in the southeast
corner of the state. Last year's rowdy gathering left two people dead
and more than 200 injured and led to numerous arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard it described as 'Mad Max on meth,' " said Eric
Wingerter, national field director for Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility. He was among a group of observers at
the dunes last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The rangers were getting roughed up and there was no backup," he
said. "People were throwing bottles.... It was ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Patrolling can be especially risky in the Southwest, where border
crossings by illegal immigrants and drug runners have led to fatal
encounters with park rangers. Rangers have begun wearing body armor
and carrying automatic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a ranger at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument was
killed while helping Border Patrol agents track fugitives from
Mexico. He was the third National Park Service ranger killed on the
job in four years. For the second year in a row, a park rangers'
organization has named Organ Pipe the nation's most dangerous
national park.</TE>
<TE>   In the remote and vast state and national forests, where rangers
are spread thin, lawlessness often goes unchecked. The forests'
isolation is its own lure. Some areas become refuges for criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "Lytle Creek is known as a place where people go up in the canyons
and dump bodies," said Kathy Johnson, a ranger at the Lytle Creek
station in the San Bernardino National Forest, 50 miles northeast of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're close to Ontario and Rancho Cucamonga. People can get on
the freeway and drive up into the deep canyons and do pretty much
anything. It's still a remote place."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who has worked in the forest for 12 years, said her job
has gotten more dangerous in the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to think twice about going some places by yourself," she
said. "I try to stay in constant radio contact. You don't take
anything for granted."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Guns Fired Only Five Other Times</TE>
<TE>   California Department of Parks and Recreation officials say that,
until this month's exchange of gunfire, park rangers had fired their
weapons only on the following occasions:</TE>
<TE>   * Nov. 30, 1989, at Lake Perris State Recreation Area. A man
appeared to point a gun at a ranger, who shot and killed him.</TE>
<TE>   * Aug. 14, 1990, at Huntington State Beach. A driver entered the
park on the wrong side of the road. A lifeguard tried to stop the
driver, who emerged from his vehicle firing a gun. The lifeguard shot
and killed the man.</TE>
<TE>   * Dec. 25, 1999, at San Onofre State Beach. A man armed with a
knife hijacked a taxi and rammed into the side of the park entrance
station. He got out of the taxi waving the knife and ran toward park
rangers, who shot and killed him.</TE>
<TE>   * Nov. 2, 2000, near Anza-Borrego State Park. A park ranger joined
California Highway Patrol officers in pursuit of a suspected bank
robber, who was shot and killed.</TE>
<TE>   * July 8, 2001, at Morro Strand State Beach. A dispute over a
parking place led to the fatal shooting of two campers. The suspect
was shot by a park ranger.</TE>

<HD>No Holiday From Homework</HD>
<DH>Ventura County schools assign plenty of studies to children
on long trips to Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was only mid-December, but already teachers like Michael Wittlin
were bidding some of their students a holiday farewell. Off they
went, on extended family vacations south of the border.</LD>
<LD>   But before they left Wittlin's Ventura County classroom for rural
Mexico, he gave them something to remember him by: homework.</LD>
<LD>   Lots of it.</LD>
<TE>   Eight-year-old Jasmin Martinez didn't mind. The shy third-grader
said she loves school and had already put a dent in some of her math
assignments before packing up for the long journey.</TE>
<TE>   She was excited about the trip and planned to finish most of the
assignments during a 36-hour drive to her parents' hometown of San
Mora in the north Mexico farming state of Michoacan.</TE>
<TE>   When she's done with the math, she has some science and reading to
do. Then she has to practice her cursive writing. Finally, every
night, there is a journal assignment she must complete. For that, she
must write about the places and people she'll visit during her
monthlong stay with Grandma and Grandpa.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing what we can to keep these kids' skills at a certain
level," explained Wittlin. "If the kids are gone for three weeks and
don't pick up a book the entire time, they're just not as sharp when
they get back. I'm trying to prevent that."</TE>
<TE>   Jasmin is one of the hundreds of Latino kids in Ventura County --
and thousands across California -- who return to their parents'
childhood homes for a traditional Christmas holiday. They leave for
as few as 10 days or as long as two months.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows for sure precisely how many students make this annual
pilgrimage, since neither school districts nor state officials keep a
tally, officials said. But the numbers are believed to be large.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a major issue, because of ADA," said Tom Mangione, head
of the Los Angeles Unified School District's pupil services office,
referring to student attendance, which triggers state payments to
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Many districts receive full payment for students during the
December trips by assigning them work through independent study
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Funds and Learning</TE>
<TE>   Educators also try their best to ensure that the absences don't
compromise learning.</TE>
<TE>   "We would prefer if they stayed, but we don't try to dissuade them
from going," said Principal Barbara Ybarra of Rio Real Elementary
School in Oxnard. This month, Rio Real teachers handed thick homework
packets to Jasmin and about 30 other students to take on their trips.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that it's a culturally significant time," she said,
"and that for some of these parents, it's part of their family
responsibility to return home."</TE>
<TE>   For many families, the holidays are the only opportunity to visit
sick relatives, care for elderly parents and handle legal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to Mexico because it was the only time my mother could
help my grandparents with mortgages and documents. They were aging
and she had to make sure they had what they needed for the upcoming
year," said Yolanda Benitez, superintendent of the Rio School
District near Oxnard. "It's a hard thing for parents to even consider
leaving their children while they are away."</TE>
<TE>   For other families, the yearly journey to a place they once called
home is as central to the holidays as Christmas trees and mistletoe
are to much of the rest of America. It's a time for families to be
together and for children born in the United States to get a glimpse
of their ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is when there's all types of festivities in Michoacan," said
Jasmin's mother, Marta Martinez. "We sing to the Virgin, we dance, we
play all kinds of games. I want the children to experience all this."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez hasn't been to Michoacan in 13 years. Her husband finally
got the time off work, so the kids can finally meet their extended
family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to miss my friends," Jasmin said, "but I can't wait to
see my grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   The holiday trips are nothing new, educators say, but in this era
of standardized testing, it's more important than ever for parents to
know about the short-term independent study programs that schools
offer.</TE>
<TE>   As state aid dwindles and daily attendance dollars become even
more crucial, administrators such as Ivette Posada at Oxnard's
Hathaway Elementary School spend part of their days on the phone
explaining the independent programs or trying to discourage trips.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and teachers sign an agreement stating that the children
will receive school credit for work completed during their vacations.
The arrangement allows administrators to save slots for students
while they are away. If the kids successfully complete their
assignments, school districts collect state money for the absent
students.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to scare the parents, but we want to make sure they
come in and sign a contract, at least," Posada said. "Sometimes there
are some children who, academically speaking, really need to stay."</TE>
<TE>   The same is true at the high school level, where counselors such
as Paul Johnson spend December explaining the process to parents.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really all I've been doing the past two weeks," said
Johnson recently.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-December, he had approved about 90 independent study
applications at Hueneme High School alone. Although Johnson is strict
about certain requirements, he said he tries to keep the process
informal so parents won't be scared away.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be as flexible as possible," Johnson said. Otherwise,
"We'll have families who'll just leave without getting any work for
the students."</TE>
<TE>   But educators stress that there is no replacement for actual time
spent in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The state has set standards, and if you're not in your seat, it's
not something that can be done by stuffing worksheets in a folder. We
can't underestimate the effect of even missing one day," said
Hathaway Principal Helen Cosgrove. "Our hope is that we start seeing
less and less of these trips."</TE>
<TE>   Educational Experience</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade teacher Gloria Valdez, who had four students leave for
Mexico this year, sees things differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider the trips a form of enrichment, such as music or art,"
Valdez said. "These parents really value their children's education,
and they're not just pulling them out of school."</TE>
<TE>   At Jasmine's house before her trip, her mother read instructions
the girl's teacher had written in Spanish: She must make sure Jasmin
writes in her journal. And she has a list of questions to ask after
the little girl completes each reading assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about the classes they'll be missing, but that's
why I'm making sure they complete all their homework," Martinez said,
as Jasmin and her brothers and sisters loaded the family's white
truck.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very excited," the mother said, "but she hates missing
school."</TE>

<LD>A weekend storm dropped an additional half an inch of rain on Ventura
County, bringing the season total to nearly 10 inches at the county
Government Center, the flood control district reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy El Nino storms have already brought more than twice as much
rain to the county as fell all last winter, and the rainfall total is
two-thirds the normal amount for an entire rainy season, weather
officials said. Last year, the county received 3.5 inches of rain
during the rainy season; the average amount is 15.35 inches.</LD>
<LD>   The county will have a chance to dry out today, but the next storm
is expected to move in on Christmas Eve, when there will be a 70%
chance of precipitation, said Bill Hoffer, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in Oxnard.</LD>
<TE>   In Saturday's storm, half an inch of rain fell at the Government
Center in Ventura and more than a quarter of an inch fell at Moorpark
College. The snow level dropped to 4,500 feet in Lockwood Valley.</TE>

<HD>Christmastime Spirit by the Yardful</HD>
<DH>A Fountain Valley neighborhood's traditional holiday
display offers lights, delights and snow by the roll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ray F. Herndon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some say the neighborhood has lost some of its luster, and the
thousands who forsake their cars for a walking tour of Fountain
Valley's "winter wonderland" this week won't see as many elaborate
Christmas displays as in years past.</LD>
<LD>   But if the volume of imitation snow blanketing lawns in the
seven-block area is an accurate gauge, this is the neighborhood's
whitest and brightest since the residents began staging their annual
Christmas spectacle more than 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   And one who helped start the tradition in 1969 thinks today's
visitors merely need to walk a little farther to view the
eye-catching displays of mechanical Santas and toiling elves that
once were clustered on only two streets, but are now scattered
throughout the tiny tract of 1960s- and '70s-era homes.</LD>
<TE>   The area has lured so many Christmastime visitors over the years
that the Fountain Valley police in 1990 began closing the streets to
nonresidents' cars between 6:30 and 10 p.m. during the two weeks
before Christmas. Police say the ban on outside vehicular traffic has
been relaxed since 2000, because of declining need.</TE>
<TE>   This year, limitations were imposed on the Friday, Saturday and
Sunday nights of the two weekends before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Brashear, 37, whose frontyard features a miniature ski
station with a tiny ski lift, has spent most of his life in the
neighborhood. His parents' home is just two doors from his on
Shadbush Street at Dandelion Circle.</TE>
<TE>   He said residents pleaded for the restrictions when the traffic
became unbearable, and idling cars belching exhaust fumes began to
detract from the almost magical atmosphere of the place.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little like trying to enjoy Main Street at Disneyland
with cars all over the place. Not much fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But now, he said, he can't imagine "a better neighborhood than
this when it comes to Christmastime. I was out walking the streets
the other night after the police had blocked traffic into the
neighborhood. That's the best time. You see people walking around
with their families and stuff. People being together, being happy.
It's what Christmas should be."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Finnell, 69, lives next to Brashear and has become the
neighborhood supplier of giant rolls of white polyester batting. The
batting, normally used in quilts or cushions, adorns dozens of local
lawns, creating the illusion of snow that doesn't come naturally to
this part of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Finnell is generally credited with being the first resident to
erect an elaborate Christmas display in the neighborhood, thus
starting what became an enduring tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we ordered 90 rolls of batting. And they're big rolls
-- 10 feet wide by 90 feet -- enough to cover an entire frontyard and
then some. That's the most we've ever bought," Finnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Unimpressed with the decorations that were commercially available,
the retired McDonnell-Douglas engineer created and installed
traveling Christmas lights around the eaves of his home long before
it became popular.</TE>
<TE>   And he still talks about the engineering challenges he faced 25
years ago creating a yard display that has become an annual favorite
-- a mechanical youngster who throws Styrofoam snowballs at another
every six to eight seconds, prompting the youngster who gets hit to
spin around to look at his attacker.</TE>
<TE>   An informal competition among neighborhood residents grew more
intense in the mid-1970s, shortly after Julie and Rocky Fleeman moved
into their home on Dahlia Circle, a blocklong cul de sac that is the
showcase of the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to simply string lights around the eaves like most people
do. But then, on a trip to New Orleans more than 20 years ago, we
spotted a mechanical Santa Claus at a sidewalk sale. It was broken.
But my husband said, 'Oh, that's no problem. I'll just tear open his
chest and put a new motor in it.' That was the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we did escalate the war, so to speak," Julie Fleeman
said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Fleemans' home has three animated displays in
upstairs windows that would make the window-dressers at Macy's in New
York City proud. One features the mechanical Santa rescued from New
Orleans, another features Mrs. Claus, while a third has a pair of
dancing bears.</TE>
<TE>   The Fleemans' snowy white yard has a wishing well this year. In
years past it has been populated with human-sized gingerbread men.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, John and Patricia Laur have transformed their lawn into
a scene from "101 Dalmatians," a theme chosen by their grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "We just happened to have the coloring book, and my wife and I
bought a projector," Laur said. "We started projecting the images up
on 4-by-8-foot sheets of plywood, and ending up making 23
characters."</TE>
<TE>   Laur is among those in the neighborhood who think that as years go
by, fewer and fewer families are erecting fancy Christmas displays.
He believes this is largely due to the changing ethnic makeup of the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Census figures show that the number of foreign-born residents in
the tract, most of them from east Asia, increased from 20% in 1990 to
30% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Fleeman said Christmas is always an exciting time in the
neighborhood, as residents begin to erect their displays, some
requiring weeks of work. Her own is so elaborate that she borrows a
hydraulic cherry-picker lift to arrange some of the lighting that
graces her home's facade.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people coming all the time and telling us they first saw
our house when they were little kids. And now they're coming back
with children of their own," Fleeman said.</TE>
<TE>   "What else could you do that gives so much pleasure to so many
people? It makes your heart warm."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan's Neighbors Vow Not to Interfere in Its Affairs</HD>
<DH>Leaders sign a pact intended to commit the nations to a
laissez-faire policy, after years of pursuing political and economic
agendas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Seeking to end an era of conflict, Afghanistan's six neighbors
promised Sunday to halt the meddling that has helped make this nation
a battleground and basket case for more than 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from Iran, Pakistan, China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan joined Afghan leaders in signing the nonintervention
agreement, proclaiming that "Afghanistan should enjoy security,
stability, prosperity, territorial integrity, democracy and human
rights after so many years of conflict and deprivation."</LD>
<LD>   That may seem a simple enough premise, but Afghanistan's neighbors
have a long history of pursuing political and economic agendas here
using armed factions as proxies. The new declaration in essence aims
to bind the neighbors to a laissez-faire policy.</LD>
<TE>   Afghanistan's armed resistance to the 1979-89 Soviet occupation
and the ensuing civil wars in the 1990s were all, to some extent,
fought by factions financed by outside interests, including the
United States. The new Afghan government sees the accord as an
important step in the long-term process of establishing its
legitimacy while disarming the regional militias that control most of
the country outside the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Timed to coincide with Sunday's one-year anniversary of Hamid
Karzai's swearing-in as leader of the transitional government, the
so-called Kabul Declaration was pushed by the United Nations and the
Group of 8 industrialized nations as a way of bolstering
Afghanistan's territorial and political integrity.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the accord was being signed, a wave of violence that
has shaken Afghanistan in recent days continued. A remote-controlled
bomb apparently exploded near a car carrying three Afghan soldiers in
the southern city of Kandahar. One was killed and the others were
wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The declaration, signed by the foreign ministers of four of the
neighboring nations and the ambassadors of three others, is another
step out of the shadows for a country that just 15 months ago, under
the Taliban regime, was a global pariah. It then had diplomatic
relations with only one country, Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "A secure, peaceful, friendly Afghanistan is a key to our
collective success," Karzai said. "We need to strengthen our bonds of
brotherhood and friendship and work for a region that is free of
terror, extremism and backwardness."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah, who goes by one name, said at a
news conference after the signing, "The agreement is representative
of a new phase of relations Afghanistan has entered with all
neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   In the view of many Afghans, the neighbor most culpable of
meddling is Pakistan, which supported the Taliban. Responding to a
reporter's question of whether it will now respect Afghan
independence and beef up security along its border to check the
movement of remnant Taliban forces into and out of Afghanistan,
Pakistani Foreign Minister Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said his
country is committed to nonintervention.</TE>
<TE>   "We have deployed 60,000 to 70,000 troops along the border of
Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that was at a time when we had tension
on our border with [India].... That should be evidence to the
international community of the level of our commitment to
nonintervention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations' special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi,
said Sunday's agreement will help "consolidate peace in Afghanistan
and the region."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we have entered a new phase, a new chapter in the history
of the relations of Afghanistan with its neighbors," Brahimi said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Kabul, Brig. Gen. Werner Freers, commander of the
German contingent of the 4,700-soldier international peacekeeping
force patrolling the capital, said German air force forensic teams
would soon begin investigating the cause of a helicopter crash that
killed seven German soldiers Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reports suggested that the crash was caused by mechanical
failure, not an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Kabul said Saturday that the crash also killed two
youths on the ground; however, Freers and other peacekeeping force
officials disputed that Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Germany's Defense Ministry in Berlin said that
"the two girls who were originally reported missing have returned to
their parents," although he added that the possibility remained that
Afghan victims could be found under the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred in an industrial park where some vacant
buildings have been turned into housing for refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The crash took place the same day a U.S. soldier was fatally shot
in eastern Afghanistan, apparently by remnant Taliban or Al Qaeda
forces. The body of Sgt. Steven Checo was flown to a U.S. air base in
Germany on Sunday en route to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   A Mass was said for Checo on Sunday morning in Elizabeth, N.J.,
said the Rev. Ronald Newland of St. Mary's of the Assumption Roman
Catholic Church, where the family attends services.</TE>

exploded at French troops for blocking an advance.</LD>
<LD>   Three rebel factions are to meet today to mull whether to go on
the offensive against the French, who opened fire to stop insurgents
from taking a key junction in the cocoa-growing region. Ivory Coast's
war sprang from a failed Sept. 19 coup. Hundreds of people have been

<HD>Djiboutians See No Payoff for U.S. Presence</HD>
<DH>Surrounded by poverty, the U.S. military sticks to its
secretive base in the Horn of Africa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DJIBOUTI</DL>
<LD>Just beyond the barbed-wire berms and guard posts that mask the U.S.
military's secretive special-operations base, past a cratered road
strewn with scrap heaps and human waste, Kadija Omar expects the
Americans to deliver.</LD>
<LD>   Like her desperate nation, the 40-year-old mother of six has been
waiting for American jobs, food, money, schools, medicine and even a
bit of U.S.-style democracy, said Omar, who earns $5 a month
smuggling diesel fuel into neighboring Somalia.</LD>
<LD>   But for the moment, she and her 2,000 neighbors in a parched
squatters' patch of tin, plywood and sand in the shadow of the U.S.
military's Camp Lemonier would settle for a few engine parts to get
the pump in their well up and running. It has been broken since
August, leaving a vegetable crop to wither.</LD>
<TE>   Villagers asked the American soldiers for help weeks ago, she
said, when their Humvees rumbled through on a security patrol. But
still, Omar said, sighing as she cradled a baby covered in flies, "we
are waiting."</TE>
<TE>   A full year after the Djiboutian government quietly gave the U.S.
military free land, free rein and full secrecy for a forward base to
hunt Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups in troubled East Africa,
even senior officials grumble that they have gotten precious little
in return. The U.S. must do more to contribute to this deeply
impoverished Muslim nation, they and others said, or it will soon
lose the hearts and minds of a country that is culturally,
linguistically and socially almost identical to neighboring Somalia
-- the failed nation where U.S. soldiers were savagely beaten to
death and dragged through the streets in a fierce battle that ended
America's last military venture in East Africa nearly a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military's return to this turbulent region through a
strategic beachhead in so needy a land says much about the
often-conflicting priorities in America's global war on terror. It is
a portrait of what ensues when a superpower meets superpoverty in a
quirky, little-known nation suddenly thrust onto center stage in a
new kind of war.</TE>
<TE>   "We are poor. We have nothing," said Mahmoud Ali Youssouf,
minister of international cooperation. "We readily enrolled in this
global war on terror after 9/11, and we've given the Americans
everything they have wanted. But for the time being, we haven't seen
anything from the United States in return."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, a visiting U.S. delegation added insult to
injury, Youssouf said. The Agency for International Development
offered his government just $4 million in development aid for this
nation of 600,000 people. Three-fourths of it was earmarked for
upgrading security at Djibouti's international airport.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so angry," Youssouf said. "Don't give us $3 million for
security at our airport when we need schools, jobs, clinics, wells
and roads. I told them: 'We don't want this money. Take it back to
Washington.'</TE>
<TE>   "We're not begging for such money. But if you're going to spend
money here, spend it more effectively. We have basic needs."</TE>
<TE>   The scene from dawn until dusk at the corner of Athens and London
streets in downtown Djibouti, the capital city, is testimony to the
most basic need: Hundreds of young men waving resumes and trade
certificates gather each workday at the Personnel Management Agency.
The tiny storefront allots the precious few menial jobs the American
base has on offer.</TE>
<TE>   "America! America! We want a job," they chanted one day last week,
crushing against the entrance. A manager later explained that
thousands had applied for 250 day-labor jobs that the base had filled
three weeks before. "And still they come every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since independence from France in 1977, Djibouti has survived on
foreign aid; its main domestic product is salt. Official corruption,
which is as endemic here as cholera, has kept much of the aid from
those who need it most.</TE>
<TE>   Djibouti has the highest rate of malnutrition in all of Africa, a
chronic condition that draws none of the emergency food given to its
neighbors fighting famine. The U.S. gives Djibouti about 8,000 tons
of food a year through the United Nations in an aid program that long
predates the American military base.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-nine of every 1,000 Djiboutians die at birth, and the
maternal death rate is triple that of Rwanda -- the result of a bad
diet, widespread maternal anemia and rampant female genital excision.
About 60% of all Djiboutians are unemployed. Female rural illiteracy
tops 85%. And the average Djiboutian lives just 51 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The needs are enormous here," said Jorge Mejia, the resident
representative of UNICEF. "All the economic indicators are extremely
low."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Skewed Economy</TE>
<TE>   The prices of Djibouti's consumer goods also top the list for
Africa. Everything is imported and heavily taxed. The result is a
skewed, split-screen national economy, where Cabinet ministers and a
tiny elite of powerful businessmen dine on lobster and steak au
poivre with European dignitaries on crisp linen in fine French
restaurants, while most Djiboutians cook vegetables and pasta over
open fires fed with scrap wood outside tin shacks. A block from the
sweltering job seekers at the U.S.-base employment agency, foreigners
and wealthy Djiboutians pay $3.50 an hour for Internet access at
air-conditioned workstations in the Filga Foire Informatique, a cafe
that even features private Web cameras.</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, U.S. aid for Djibouti appears to be targeting
America's most basic needs. The airport-security funds that U.S. AID
officials recently offered are for an international airport that
abuts the new Camp Lemonier, which reportedly houses the most
secretive Army, Navy and intelligence forces in the terror war.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has also committed an additional $2 million to
renovate state-run Radio Djibouti, along with $100,000 in annual
rent, in exchange for a strategic transmission station the U.S. is
building for the Voice of America just outside the capital. The
targeted audience: Yemen and the southern regions of Saudi Arabia --
rich recruiting grounds for Al Qaeda and home to more than half the
Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   America also is spending $500,000 to help finance next month's
Chamber of Deputies elections here, which diplomats say will be a
lightning rod for Djibouti's democratic aspirations -- and for a
possible anti-American backlash if the polls are seen as unfair.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watershed Vote</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first multiparty election in Djibouti's
quarter-century of independence, and U.S. officials are hoping it
will usher in a stable era of democracy. After the French ended
colonial rule, the country became a typical, one-party African
autocracy. A new constitution ratified in 1992 -- the year that also
marked the beginning of Djibouti's nine-year civil war -- called for
the multiparty system to begin now. An opposition, five-party
coalition launched its first campaign last month.</TE>
<TE>   "These elections are very, very important for the future of this
country because we are in a situation that cannot continue," said
Daher Ahmed Farah, a former political prisoner and newspaper editor
who leads the opposition Party for Democratic Renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very, very angry. Until now, the anger is generalized.
People want change, and we are determined not to allow the government
to steal the election."</TE>
<TE>   Farah, who is known as Daf, for his initials, said he has warned
Western diplomats: "If you want this military platform to continue to
be quiet, you have to help us make sure these elections are
transparent. So if people are unhappy, anything can happen. An
explosion is possible, just like the one that happened over there" in
Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Farah stressed that Djiboutians remain a peaceful and welcoming
people, and most diplomats here played down the likelihood of an
anti-American backlash. But they too cautioned that the potential for
it is compounded by the lack of tangible U.S. assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The American troops live in a closed system," Farah added. "We
have no positive communication with them. They just stay in their
base. Their only communication with the people is through their
power, when they go to the countryside and fire their weapons during
their exercises.</TE>
<TE>   "They come, they do as they like, they disturb our peace, they
give us no jobs and, finally, the impression is negative."</TE>
<TE>   President Ismail Omar Guelleh said in an interview Saturday that
"it is normal that we should get something" in exchange for allowing
the U.S. military to have a base in Djibouti. Negotiations for a
formal base agreement that will fix those benefits are underway and
will be signed in January, he said, but he ruled out any
anti-American backlash by the Djiboutians if the U.S. falls short.</TE>
<TE>   Guelleh, a former police intelligence officer, said his people
were likely to be merely disappointed. "We are a peaceful country."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Marine Maj. Gen. John F. Sattler, commander of the region's
new military forces, said he would fight the shortcomings in American
aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Guilty as charged," he said on his command ship that arrived near
Djibouti's shores just a week ago. "If we just build a camp, and we
stay inside that camp, and we don't bring folks in to work in the
camp, and there's no distribution of wealth outside by virtue of
spending our money in the Djiboutian economy, I would feel the same
way they did."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Different Spending</TE>
<TE>   A beer in town costs $6, a pizza $17 -- prices that have helped
keep the U.S. troops at Camp Lemonier off the streets and largely
confined to a camp that brings in its own supplies and contributes
almost nothing to the economy. That American dearth contrasts sharply
with a French largess that has accompanied the thousands of soldiers
and French Foreign Legion troops Paris has maintained here since
independence.</TE>
<TE>   The French forces are credited with preserving Djibouti as a
nation. Without them, it probably would have been swallowed by
neighboring Somalia or Ethiopia, which coveted its seaport. And
unlike the Americans, the French have been ubiquitous, buying from
local markets, using local services and renting local houses, until
they opened a modern French compound that is a virtual city within
the capital a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   According to one U.N. calculation, Djibouti's annual per-capita
income is $800 when the salaries of the 2,800 French troops stationed
here are included. When they're not, that figure is cut almost in
half.</TE>
<TE>   Even the German navy, which is part of the coalition task force
patrolling the region for terrorists, has spent a fortune here. On
average, a spokesman said, it has contributed $2 million a month to
the local economy since its 800-strong force arrived in February.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, only a fraction of that has trickled down to the impoverished
grass roots.</TE>
<TE>   Eight miles outside town, near the future site of the VOA
transmitter, sits the squalid Pointe Kilometre 12 squatters' city.
Among the few concrete foreign-aid projects that these 10,000 people
have seen since they were scooped up by police in the capital and
shipped out to a barren stretch of desert 20 years ago is a mosque
built by Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The mosque is a rare solid structure in PK 12, as the locals call
their village. It's part of a Saudi project that has financed
hundreds of new mosques throughout Djibouti, Pakistan, Yemen and
other impoverished Muslim countries. The program is largely meant to
export Saudi Arabia's fundamentalist Wahabbite form of Islam -- the
religion shared by most of the Sept. 11 hijackers and Al Qaeda chief
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care about this Wahabbism. We Djiboutians are far too
moderate for all of that," explained Mohammed Nour, 30, who helped
organize a village development committee in a squatter city that
lacks electricity and running water but does feature a school built
by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. also has given us some sewing machines and training, and
that is a good start. But what we really need is sustained vocational
training, a factory where we can produce something. Maybe even some
old computers, and a generator to run them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy to meet the Americans. We need the Americans. We
have been trying to find them. But until now, they're invisible."</TE>
<TE>   Minister Youssouf agreed. "We'd like to keep the Americans in this
country because we believe there is a great potential for us, and for
them," he said. "But if the Americans do not play this kind of game,
or use this kind of strategy, it is they who will be the ultimate
loser, not we."</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Airlines to Fly to Mainland China</HD>
<DH>Although they will run for less than two weeks, the flights
are seen as a significant step.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>For 10 days beginning late next month, Taiwan-based airlines plan to
operate flights to the Chinese mainland for the first time since the
Communists took power in Beijing more than half a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   The charter flights, which will bring home for the lunar new year
holiday some of the estimated 1 million Taiwanese living on the
mainland, are one more sign that economic imperatives are eroding
political barriers that have separated the two adversaries for so
long.</LD>
<LD>   But the controversial nature of the initiative, its carefully
limited scope and the debate about how the aircraft should be routed
underscore how arduous the political journey remains before the two
sides can establish normal trade, communications and travel across
the Taiwan Strait.</LD>
<TE>   Taiwan has had no direct links with the mainland since Nationalist
Party leader Chiang Kai-shek established his government here in 1949
after fleeing the Communists. Beijing today views this island as a
renegade province and counts its reunification with the mainland
among its top political priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the political standoff, the attraction of China as one of
the world's preferred low-cost industrial production centers has led
hundreds of Taiwanese companies to build factories and relocate staff
there in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The charter flights were proposed last month by Nationalist Party
legislator John Chang. All six Taiwanese airlines are eligible to fly
the Shanghai-Taipei route, and under current plans, each would
operate one round-trip flight per day. Although the flights will be
run for less than two weeks, Chang argues that they are highly
significant.</TE>
<TE>   "It will help make people feel more confident, more comfortable
about the idea of permanent direct flights," said Chang, Chiang's
grandson and Taiwan's former foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   Added a Taipei-based diplomat: "Taiwanese commercial planes on the
ground in mainland China is important symbolically. It's a
precedent."</TE>
<TE>   The charter flights were envisioned as a convenient way to ease
the crush of lunar new year travel, which has grown steadily in
volume. With no regular direct commercial flights, travelers must
change planes in Hong Kong or Macao. It is an ordeal that turns what
would be a 90-minute flight from Shanghai to Taipei into a six-hour
odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   However, Taiwanese domestic political wrangling seems likely to
eliminate most potential gains in convenience and speed. The
Taiwanese government has insisted that the planes still stop briefly
in Macao or Hong Kong for a "security check." The only difference
from a scheduled commercial flight, officials admit, is that
passengers won't have to switch aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council,
said direct flights required a special resolution passed by
parliament, which is deeply divided on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Chang complained that the stops are "totally unnecessary" and
nullify much of the charters' benefits. He suggested that the planes
make touch-and-go landings, in which the planes would spend only a
few seconds on the runway before taking off again.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been equally painstaking in other areas of
cross-strait relations.</TE>
<TE>   When China and Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization nearly a
year ago, there was hope that the move would result in diplomatic
contacts that could serve to build the trust needed for bolder
political initiatives. After all, trade between the two totals about
$30 billion a year, despite the lack of direct contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the two spent much of the year sparring over whether
Taiwan's representation at the WTO's Geneva headquarters should be
called a mission or an office. The first official contact between
representatives came only this month, and that took place in a
carefully chosen neutral venue: a Geneva hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "At least we got it started," Tsai said.</TE>
<TE>   Trade and transportation links established two years ago between
the mainland and Taiwan's small outer islands of Quemoy and Matsu
remain intact, but they have failed to generate the hoped-for trade
volume, Taiwanese officials said.</TE>
<TE>   With Beijing still apparently unwilling to deal with Taiwanese
President Chen Shui-bian, whose party has anti-unification
sympathies, analysts expect no major breakthrough in relations before
the island's presidential election in March 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some incremental steps to ease things for the business
community, but nothing major," summed up a Western diplomat.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Rally for Hong Kong Law</HD>
<DH>Demonstrators cite security as a reason to back proposed
anti- subversion measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>More than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rallied in support of a
controversial anti-subversion law Sunday, in opposition to critics
who say it would roll back freedoms and rights.</LD>
<LD>   Waving miniature flags, they broke into patriotic songs, clapping
and cheering as prominent pro-China politicians spoke in favor of the
legislation.</LD>
<LD>   "The country's security is everybody's responsibility!" they
chanted, sitting on the ground in the former British colony's
Victoria Park.</LD>
<TE>   The demonstration involved trade unions, political parties,
schools, and civic and grass-roots groups and followed a massive
march last Sunday by protesters who denounced the legislation as
undemocratic. Organizers of last Sunday's rally estimated that crowd
at 60,000, while police said 12,000 turned out initially.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's constitution requires it to enact such a law, which
Beijing is eager to see introduced to keep hostile, foreign forces
from using the Chinese territory as a base from which to subvert
mainland China. Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's passage though the mainly pro-China legislature is
practically assured.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, people could be jailed for life for treason,
sedition, subversion of and secession from the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong rights groups fear the law could be abused by
authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have repeatedly said the law would not be used to
repress political dissent and that legal concepts from the communist
mainland would not be used to curb rights.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said there were 40,000 participants at the rally,
although police estimated the number at 16,000.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent survey of more than 600 local journalists, 56.2% said
the subversion law would affect their work and 10% said they would
quit the profession when the law was passed.</TE>

<HD>Baghdad Fights Back With Words</HD>
<DH>Hussein invites the U.S. to send CIA agents to direct arms
inspections and urges the world to halt war buildup. Washington holds
firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq launched a public relations offensive against the United States
and Britain, saying it had nothing to hide and that Washington was
even welcome to send in CIA agents to direct U.N. arms inspectors to
any suspect sites.</LD>
<LD>   President Saddam Hussein and his officials said Sunday that Iraq
was doing all it could to cooperate with the United Nations, and he
urged the world to halt the American-British war machine.</LD>
<LD>   Washington was unmoved. "While we have not given up on disarming
Iraq through the United Nations, we are now entering a final phase in
how we compel Saddam Hussein to disarm," a White House official said.
He declined to comment on the offer to accept CIA agents.</LD>
<TE>   Gen. Amir Saadi, one of Hussein's top advisors, told a news
conference in Baghdad that U.N. inspections during the last four
weeks had shown U.S. and British charges that Iraq possesses weapons
of mass destruction to be "lies and baseless."</TE>
<TE>   Saadi challenged Washington and London over statements that there
were holes in the arms declaration Iraq presented to the United
Nations two weeks ago, and he said Baghdad was ready to answer
questions from the Western allies.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not even have any objections if the CIA sent somebody with
the inspectors to show them the suspected sites," he said, making it
clear that Iraq stands by statements that it does not possess weapons
of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein accused the U.S. of trying to harass him. "The world
should tell America now there is no need for more aggression and
sanctions on Iraq in order to let it cooperate freely" with the U.N.,
he told a group of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   From maneuvers to planning, the U.S. and Britain have made no
secret of preparing for possible war to back up demands that Hussein
come clean -- nearly 12 years after the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   London has been Washington's staunchest ally on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The United States last week condemned Iraq's arms declaration as
incomplete and therefore a "material breach" of a U.N. Security
Council resolution adopted in November.</TE>
<TE>   Defying the resolution carries the implicit threat of war.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is forging ahead with a buildup that may put more than
100,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region by February.</TE>

<HD>Turnout Invalidates Montenegro Vote</HD>
<DH>Opponents of candidate who favors breaking with Serbia had
called for a boycott.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PODGORICA, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>A popular politician who wants to move the republic of Montenegro
toward a full break from Serbia appeared to have won the most votes
in presidential elections Sunday, but he conceded that the vote was
invalid because of low turnout.</LD>
<LD>   Former Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic blamed a boycott by
opposition parties in favor of ties with Serbia for a turnout that
failed to reach the 50% of voters required by law.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of the huge destructive influence of those who called for
a boycott, this round of voting has not succeeded ... but Montenegro
will get a president in January, and I'm sure it will be me," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   A government official said balloting would probably be repeated
Jan. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement, coming just weeks after a similar outcome in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's other republic, was a bitter blow for Vujanovic.</TE>
<TE>   Vujanovic, who belongs to the governing party, campaigned on
separating Montenegro from Serbia and promising his people a fast
track to European Union and NATO membership. His party, the
Democratic Party of Socialists, won a landslide in recent
parliamentary elections.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott was led by the main opposition party, the Socialist
People's Party, which supports maintaining the link to the much
larger Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   With the opposition out of the race, Vujanovic faced only a few
minor candidates in Sunday's vote. Official results were not expected
before today.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Democratic Transition, an independent monitoring
group, put Vujanovic overwhelmingly ahead, with 86% of all ballots
cast.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Ratchets Up Its Nuclear Efforts</HD>
<DH>The regime unseals a storage facility for fuel rods that
could provide plutonium for weapons, monitors say. The U.S. expresses
deep concern.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea took another serious step toward reactivating its nuclear
program Sunday, disabling surveillance devices and breaking locks on
a storage facility for some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, the
International Atomic Energy Agency said. Plutonium can be extracted
from the rods and processed for use in nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The move came a day after the IAEA, which monitors nuclear
activities for the United Nations and has its headquarters in Vienna,
announced that North Korea had broken seals and disabled monitoring
devices on a previously mothballed nuclear reactor.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea's actions triggered a new round of international
rebukes, expressions of worry and a flurry of weekend diplomacy as
concerned Bush administration officials weighed how to respond even
as they consider a war against Iraq for allegedly developing weapons
of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke by phone with his
counterparts in China, South Korea and Russia on Saturday and Japan
and others on Sunday, said Louis Fintor, a State Department
spokesman. U.S. officials expressed deep concern about the
developments and appeared pessimistic that a quick diplomatic
solution could be reached.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea's action today, disrupting the arrangements for IAEA
monitoring of the spent fuel rods, raises further serious concerns
and belies North Korea's announced justification to produce
electricity," Fintor said. He urged the nation to replace the
equipment. South Korea and Japan issued similar messages.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, in a statement from its official news agency,
attributed its actions to "U.S. imperialist policy," specifically
citing the recent decision by Washington and its allies to suspend
fuel donations to the secretive regime. The donations were being made
under a now-collapsing 1994 agreement in which North Korea pledged to
repudiate its nuclear ambitions in exchange for energy assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The United States blocked the oil assistance this fall after North
Korea acknowledged that it had a secret uranium-enrichment program.
Enriched uranium, like processed plutonium, is used in the
manufacture of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea said Sunday that restarting its nuclear program was
necessary in order to produce electricity because the U.S.
"unilaterally abandoned its commitment to supply heavy oil."</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear experts, however, give no credence to North Korea's
explanation that it unsealed the reactor to generate electricity. The
5-megawatt plant creates too little power for electricity purposes,
but its spent fuel can be used to make weapons-grade nuclear
material. The plant was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for that
purpose, according to IAEA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Baradei, director-general of the IAEA, criticized North
Korea's moves, saying they were "of great nonproliferation concern."</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang said Dec. 12 that it would reopen its shuttered nuclear
facilities and asked the IAEA to remove its monitoring equipment, but
there were hopes in Washington that the often-provocative regime was
bluffing and would move slowly to follow through on the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang's quick move to actually remove the monitoring equipment
appeared calculated to ramp up pressure on the United States and
Asian neighbors at a crucial juncture.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is focused on its showdown with Iraq over what U.S.
officials say is Baghdad's refusal to give up weapons of mass
destruction; meanwhile, South Korea on Thursday elected a new
president, Roh Moo Hyun, whose resolve to seek improved relations
with North Korea will surely be tested by Pyongyang's latest action.</TE>
<TE>   "Their whole strategy is to force Washington to talk to them, and
they are coming on hard and fast," said a Western diplomat in Seoul.
"It is classic brinkmanship."</TE>
<TE>   The downward spiral in recent weeks is reminiscent of 1993-94,
when North Korea's nuclear ambitions nearly led the Clinton
administration to launch preemptive strikes. The crisis was resolved
by the 1994 deal, brokered by former President Carter.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge from North Korea, an unpredictable, totalitarian
regime fighting for its survival, is potentially more explosive than
that of Iraq. The CIA believes North Korea might have already
produced one or two nuclear weapons. In addition, Pyongyang is
thought to have an array of chemical and biological weapons and is
known to have enough conventional artillery near the demilitarized
zone to inflict devastating casualties on South Korea and on the U.S.
troops stationed there. Its missiles could also reach Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Outside experts have been urging the administration to find a
face-saving way to talk to the North Koreans. But White House
officials have insisted that the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear
program is a prerequisite to negotiations. North Korea has hinted
that it would be willing to negotiate and would seek concessions such
as a nonaggression pact.</TE>
<TE>   On "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), incoming
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined those
urging the administration to engage North Korea in a dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot take an attitude, I believe, in which we just simply
say they are wrong -- that is, the North Koreans," he said. "We're
all going to have to talk, talk continuously to South Korea, to North
Korea, to Japan, be heavily engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar acknowledged that it would be "a tough thing" to focus on
North Korea "while we're dealing with Iraq." But he urged the White
House to "do two things ... simultaneously."</TE>
<TE>   On the same program, the outgoing chair of the committee, Sen.
Joseph L. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), said, "This is a greater danger
immediately to U.S. interests at this very moment, in my view, than
Saddam Hussein is."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's incoming president must also figure out how to deal
with Pyongyang's actions. "They are of course testing Roh Moo Hyun,"
said Kim Tae Woo, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for
Defense Analyses in Seoul. "We now have a president-elect who claims
to be sympathetic to the North Koreans, and they would like to see
how he will react. They are going step by step, pushing harder each
time."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from Roh, who had taken the weekend
off after the election and who has not yet named a transition team.
However, the South Korean government and the ruling Millennium
Democratic Party urged the North to reseal the facilities before it
is too late for negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has several nuclear installations at Yongbyon, 55
miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, whose activities were frozen
under the 1994 agreement. Of concern are three facilities: the
5-megawatt reactor, the facility for storing spent nuclear fuel rods
and a reprocessing plant to extract the plutonium from the rods.
Plutonium can be extracted from the rods and reprocessed into
weapons-grade material within weeks, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If they remove the seals from the fuel rods, that is really a
critical action that could push us into a crisis," said Kim, the
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The rods are stored in canisters in a cooling pool and until this
weekend were under 24-hour camera surveillance monitored by two IAEA
inspectors who live at the site to ensure compliance with the '94
accord.</TE>
<TE>   "If they lift the seals on these canisters," Biden said, "they're
going to be able to build four to five additional nuclear weapons
within months if they begin that reprocessing operation -- that's
within a year."</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors reported that the seals attached to the locks at
the sites had been broken and that the cameras had been turned away
and covered, said Mark Gwozdecky, the chief spokesman for the agency.
However, the inspectors themselves had not been asked to leave. They
were in regular contact with the Vienna headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Shim Yoon Jo, an official at South Korea's Foreign Ministry, urged
North Korea to restore the seals and monitoring equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We will apply diplomatic pressure through close cooperation with
the United States, Japan, China, Russia and the international
community so that North Korea takes measures for restoration," Shim
said.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi told a news conference
that North Korea's moves were "extremely regrettable."</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned," she said.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Indefinitely Postpone Vote</HD>
<DH>'We cannot hold elections while under occupation,' the
information minister says. Israel says it bears no responsibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Saying it is impossible to stage a vote while Israeli troops and
tanks occupy the major cities and towns of the West Bank, Palestinian
officials on Sunday indefinitely postponed a general election that
had been scheduled for Jan. 20.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot hold elections while under occupation," said
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo, announcing the
decision after a gathering of top Palestinian officials in the West
Bank town of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   The postponement of what would have been the first Palestinian
general election since 1996 had been widely expected, but it
nonetheless cast a pall over prospects for reforms within Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat has been under virtual house arrest in his shell-pocked
Ramallah headquarters since late May, and the governments of both
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Bush have refused
to engage in dealings with him.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said Sunday that it bore no responsibility for the delay in
balloting.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the Israeli presence, but the fact that Yasser Arafat
refuses to engage any actions that could lead to peace," said Sharon
advisor Raanan Gissin.</TE>
<TE>   The election date was chosen in September, largely in response to
pressure from the U.S. but also amid growing internal calls for
change. At the time, Palestinian anger over corruption and
inefficiency in Arafat's government had begun to resurface after
being pushed aside amid the crisis atmosphere that characterized the
first months of the current Palestinian uprising, or intifada, which
began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had made it clear that it hoped the vote
would result in a leadership change. "Peace requires a new and
different Palestinian leadership so that a Palestinian state can be
born," Bush said in a key speech in June, though he did not mention
Arafat by name. "I call on the Palestinian people to elect new
leaders not compromised by terror."</TE>
<TE>   However, over the course of 27 months of bitter fighting, the
73-year-old Arafat's popularity has tended to surge when he is
perceived to be under external threat. His stature among Palestinians
has grown whenever Israeli troops have invaded his Ramallah compound.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has resisted calls from more conservative members of his
government to deport Arafat. Although the prime minister has a long
and bitter personal history with Arafat and has said privately that
he would like nothing better than to expel him, he is thought to be
acceding to U.S. wishes that he refrain from inflaming passions in
the Arab world in the run-up to a potential U.S.-led war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon promised the U.S. months ago that Israel would not hurt or
kill the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has said in recent weeks that voting could not be held
until at least 30 days, and possibly as long as 90 days, after
Israeli troops had withdrawn from the West Bank's major population
centers.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Cabinet said Sunday that elections would not be
held until Israeli forces withdrew to positions held before the
outbreak of fighting in 2000. Israel says any decision about troop
movements will be dictated solely by its own security needs.</TE>
<TE>   The army moved into the West Bank in force after a particularly
deadly wave of suicide bombings in Israeli cities in June, and it has
maintained an intermittent presence in and around major Palestinian
cities and towns since then. Tight curfews impede travel within and
between cities and towns. Many people find it extremely difficult to
get to work and school, or to visit family members.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, soldiers have been staging pinpoint raids that
have resulted in the arrests of hundreds of Palestinians wanted in
connection with planning attacks against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians held their first and only popular vote for the
presidency and the Legislative Council, or parliament, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat won overwhelmingly then, and polls had suggested that
despite deep unhappiness with their lot, Palestinians would probably
have again supported him for president.</TE>
<TE>   Many ordinary Palestinians say that even if they are dissatisfied
with Arafat's leadership, they do not wish to be dictated to by the
United States or Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the delay in elections came as Palestinian leaders were
scrutinizing the latest draft of a "road map" aimed at achieving a
negotiated settlement to the violence.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has reportedly differed with its so-called Quartet
partners -- the European Union, Russia and the U.N. -- over some
provisions of the plan, as well as the timing of its formal
presentation to the parties.</TE>
<TE>   The initial Palestinian response to the draft proposals was
lukewarm.</TE>
<TE>   Abed-Rabbo, the information minister, on Sunday called them "not
bad, but not good enough."</TE>

<LD>American soldiers offered prayers Sunday for a French television
reporter killed in an accident during the biggest U.S. military
exercises since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   The exercises ended late Sunday with a display of tracer fire,
antitank missiles and machine-gun rounds lighting up the northern
Kuwaiti desert for more than an hour as rampaging M1A1 Abrams tanks,
Bradley fighting vehicles and soldiers attacked imaginary enemy
targets during nighttime exercises.</LD>
<LD>   The maneuvers ended two days of live-fire exercises involving
thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, troops from the U.S. Army's 2nd Brigade, 3rd
Infantry Division offered prayers for French journalist Patrick
Bourrat, killed while covering the exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Bourrat, who was in his 40s and worked for TF1, was struck during
exercises Saturday while crossing the path of a tank and was thrown
15 feet into the air. He died at a hospital early Sunday of massive
internal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody feels terrible about this," said Chaplain Ron Cooper of
Saginaw, Mich. "It's been a real shock, especially when we had heard
that he had just broken a couple of ribs and had been talking to his
family."</TE>

<HD>Mandela's Holiday Party Is Mobbed</HD>
<DH>About 20,000 children and parents come to see the
ex-president and his guest, Oprah.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>QUNU, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Nelson Mandela played Father Christmas with U.S. talk show queen
Oprah Winfrey by his side at a special Yuletide bash that turned
chaotic as thousands of children flocked to his home in the Eastern
Cape.</LD>
<LD>   About 20,000 children and parents, many of whom had walked for
miles, lined up outside Mandela's rural home for the annual party --
three times as many as last year.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, the crush became so great that security guards had
to cut through a fence to relieve the pressure. Two children were
slightly hurt.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't anticipate 20,000 people showing up. We had to call for
support from the defense force and the police force," Mandela
spokeswoman Zelda la Grange told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   For many it was the first chance to meet the beloved 84-year-old
ex-president, whom they fondly call by his clan name "Madiba," and
the African American television star.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a South African and have never been up close with Madiba.
This is exciting. We only see her [Winfrey] on TV, now we get to see
her live," said Daniel Njapha, who drove for several hours with his
two toddlers.</TE>
<TE>   Mandela has hosted the Christmas party at his home village since
1990 when he was released after 27 years in apartheid jails. That
first occasion attracted 500 people, and the party has been growing
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey later told reporters that the situation could have easily
spiraled out of control.</TE>

<LD>   It's a dirty little place about an hour off the main highway in El
Salvador. There's gang graffiti on the whitewashed walls, potholes in
the crumbling street and hopelessness in the air.</LD>
<LD>   Except here, in the neon pink church that fills the center of
town. Inside, just off the nave, is a tiny chapel filled with
flowers, a friar's robe stiff with blood and a sense of expectation.</LD>
<TE>   "People come here from all over," said Jilma Contreras, at 76 the
town's historian. "They come to be cured of many sicknesses, even
cancer."</TE>
<TE>   The robe belonged to Father Cosme Spessotto, one of two priests
known to have been killed at prayer during the bloody civil war in El
Salvador that ended a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   He was shot point blank while preparing to say evening Mass in
June 1980. His death came just three months after a similar, though
far more infamous slaying, that of Archbishop Oscar Romero, the
nation's highest-ranking Roman Catholic Church official, as he
celebrated Mass in the capital, San Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   The killings of the two priests in the early days of the war were
a prophecy of just how vicious the conflict would become. By the time
peace accords were signed in 1992, more than 75,000 people had been
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some two decades later, the killings have turned from a
moment of horror into a point of hope. Church officials hope to make
Romero and Spessotto El Salvador's first saints.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than a dozen Catholic priests and nuns killed during
the war, the two men are the first for whom the long process of
sainthood has begun, starting with beatification.</TE>
<TE>   "We are moving ahead one by one," said Msgr. Rafael Urrutia, the
bishop leading the move to canonize the men. "It's a titanic
undertaking."</TE>
<TE>   In this town, the quest to canonize Spessotto -- known best as
Father Cosme -- has rallied a community that in many ways is still
struggling to recover from the war and its scars.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Nonualco sits in the shadow of the dormant San Vicente
volcano, in the heart of a region that once belonged to one of the
country's few indigenous groups.</TE>
<TE>   The country's first indigenous rebellion began here last century,
when locals rose up to overthrow land-owning elites. The rebellion
was quickly crushed.</TE>
<TE>   The social unrest and sense of injustice continued, however, and
San Juan Nonualco became a stronghold for leftist rebels during the
civil war. The region became the scene of some of the first massacres
of the war, committed by Salvadoran army troops against suspected
guerrilla sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a region that Spessotto knew like the Lord's Prayer.</TE>
<TE>   A Franciscan monk, he came to El Salvador from Italy in 1950. At
the time, he spoke no Spanish and had never before been a parish
priest. After a few years at a nearby town, he arrived in San Juan
Nonualco on a hot autumn day in October 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, his arrival is remembered with precision.</TE>
<TE>   "He arrived on a motorcycle, a Vespa scooter," said Contreras as
she recounted the priest's story in her home a block from the church.
"He was covered with dust, because in those days, the roads weren't
paved."</TE>
<TE>   Spessotto quickly inserted himself in the community. He made a
point of going from house to house in the first few days, to meet
everyone he could.</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning that hundreds of couples were living together
unmarried, he organized mass weddings where he united dozens of
couples at a time.</TE>
<TE>   He raised money to build health clinics, a second school and the
present-day church, which replaced an existing structure of sticks
and mud.</TE>
<TE>   When the war came, Spessotto was determined not to take sides. The
conflict was a Cold War battlefield pitting leftist rebels backed by
Cuba and the Soviet Union against government troops backed by the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   When the guerrillas took over a nearby church, holding priests
hostage, Spessotto negotiated their release, then castigated the
rebels. And when the army was accused of committing a massacre in a
nearby village, Spessotto met personally with the local commander for
an accounting of the act.</TE>
<TE>   "The father was worried about so much slaughter going on both
sides," said Domingo Del Lago, the current local parish priest who as
a young man knew Spessotto. "He was threatened every day, though he
was simply a pastor committed to doing good."</TE>
<TE>   On June 14, 1980, he had just finished saying a Mass for a local
university student who had been killed in the war. He then knelt at a
small altar in front of the church to begin preparing for evening
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   A second priest in the church's apse heard a noise, then three
shots. When he rushed outside, Spessotto was lying in a pool of
blood. The acrid smell of gunpowder filled the air. There was a
bullet pock in one of the church's columns. It is there today, a
reminder of the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon, pardon," were Spessotto's last words, according to Father
Filiberto Del Bosco, who administered him last rites.</TE>
<TE>   Spessotto's killers were never caught, and it is still a mystery
whether guerrillas or right-wing assassins were responsible for his
death.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether the left killed him or the right killed him, the man is a
martyr," Urrutia said. "He was opposed because of the work he was
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Spessotto's bloodstained robe and black beret and the
cotton balls used to stem the bleeding are kept in a glass case to
the side of the altar. He is buried within the church.</TE>
<TE>   Homemade plaques line the walls, dozens of them, a testament to
Spessotto's healing powers. A woman who visited from Los Angeles said
her granddaughter was hospitalized. After she prayed to Spessotto,
the girl recovered.</TE>
<TE>   A man named Arturo Romeo recounted how he had been in prison when
a riot broke out. Two prisoners came looking to kill him, he said,
but he hid behind a small cabinet and prayed to Spessotto, who made
him invisible to his would-be assassins.</TE>
<TE>   "People come here from as far away as the United States, most from
Los Angeles but also from Virginia and New York," Del Lago said. "It
seems fantastic, but it's true."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the living testimonials. Berta Medina, 80, was
diagnosed with breast cancer 30 years ago, she said. A local doctor
said she had between six months and six years to live.</TE>
<TE>   Spessotto held a special healing Mass for her, to which she
credits her existence.</TE>
<TE>   "He put his hands on my head and said a beautiful, beautiful
prayer," Medina said. "He gave me my life."</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church has submitted a list of the testimonies of
Spessotto's miracles, a requirement for sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   Marcelina Beltran visited the tomb one recent Sunday. She began
crying when she recounted how Spessotto visited her in a dream and
cured her of a lung disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I never miss coming here on Sunday," she said, weeping. "I have
prayed to him every day since his death."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified Brings Style to School Building Boom</HD>
<DH>The district seeks designs that match campuses to
neighborhoods while encouraging learning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This isn't your grandma's schoolhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Designs for Central High School No. 10 look more like a dot-com
firm flaunting a worker-friendly image than an inner-city campus of
the Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   When completed in three years, the $90-million school near
downtown will have six buildings clad in glass or curved metal
sidings of vibrant green, reds and blues, clustered around stepped
courtyards. A music classroom will open onto a patio for performances
and a culinary arts room onto a vegetable garden. A bridge will span
3rd Street, linking athletic fields to the gymnasium.</LD>
<TE>   As L.A. Unified prepares to build as many as 120 schools in 10
years -- the largest such building program in district history and
one of the biggest in the nation -- it is trying to do more than ease
its overcrowding. L.A. Unified is hiring 80 architectural firms to
give different looks to different neighborhoods, recasting parts of
the city's landscape along with the public's idea of the American
school.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are no longer coming out of cookie cutters," said Robert
Timme, the dean of USC's architecture school who is chairman of a
council that advises L.A. Unified on school designs.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which anticipates spending $3.6 billion on the
building program's first five years, is taking advantage of a recent
boom in funds. With the passage of two state and local bonds on Nov.
5 -- and two earlier school construction propositions -- L.A. Unified
may reap $7 billion in all. And the district is already preparing an
additional $2-billion local bond initiative in 2004 to leverage a
planned $12-billion statewide bond that year.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of accusations that the district mismanaged construction
dollars in the past, officials say they are aiming for efficiency as
much as appealing to the public imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not getting the low end, but you're not getting anything
luxurious either," said Kathi Littmann, the district's deputy chief
for school planning. The schools will be efficient and built to last,
"but they're not monuments with things like granite facades and
terrazzo floors."</TE>
<TE>   Containing costs became all the more important in recent weeks, as
the district discovered an earthquake fault running directly beneath
two of the six unfinished buildings at the seemingly star-crossed
Belmont Learning Center, which already is the most expensive high
school project in America. The site may have to be scrapped -- and
district officials have vowed to carefully screen other potential
sites for similar problems, which may increase costs.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits of the massive building project will extend beyond
schools, supporters say. Many new campuses will include exhibition
spaces, playing fields and auditoriums accessible to the public in
the evenings and on weekends. And planners are looking to locate
schools close to parks and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do this well, we will have the extraordinary possibility of
pulling the city together -- people of color and Anglo, rich and
poor," said school board member Genethia Hudley Hayes. "These schools
are going to anchor communities and get people to start asking
questions: What other amenities can be clustered around them?"</TE>
<TE>   The diversity in school designs is driven, in large part, by
big-city congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new urban school sites are too tight and oddly
configured for standard campuses. The denser urban grid has forced
the district to plan multistory schools on top of underground parking
garages on two-acre campuses and to share land with other users. For
example, a proposal to build an 800-student school at Wilshire
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue would combine retail, housing and a
subway station on seven acres.</TE>
<TE>   The designs also tend to be more child-friendly, more filled with
color and light, than schools of building campaigns in the 1920s and
'50s. They emphasize energy efficiency and environmentally friendly
designs. And all will be wired for multimedia and high-speed Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions to the plans have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these designs are extraordinary," said Michael Lehrer, a
Los Angeles architect and member of a committee overseeing use of the
Proposition BB district construction and repair bond measure passed
in 1997. "Some are very important architecturally, some are trendy,
some ... are silly-jazzy, and some are clunky and poorly
proportioned."</TE>
<TE>   Some people are worried that the district, which hasn't finished a
comprehensive high school since Richard Nixon was president, is
moving too fast on too many projects at once. Five schools have been
completed in the last two years, 75 more are in various stages of
planning or early construction and 40 others are expected to follow.
That means breaking ground on a school every month or so for the next
few years.</TE>
<TE>   Some architects complained that austere finances, bureaucracy and
frantic deadlines snuffed out some of the most adventurous design
ideas, particularly on classroom interiors, where the district sought
conformity as much as possible. Some designers wanted to experiment
with rounded spaces instead of standard rectangular classrooms. In
one case, safety concerns nixed plans for exposed ceilings: Students
might try to hang from the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   The most pointed criticism so far has been aimed at the district's
choice of building materials, which some architects consider
insufficiently durable. Most of the schools will have wood frames
instead of steel; vinyl tile floors, no marble.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean that with a good maintenance program they won't
be in use 50 years from now," said district Facilities Director Jim
McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the schools may remind passersby, at first glance, of
shopping malls, museums, office complexes or airport terminals. That
may be disorienting to people expecting schools to resemble
authoritarian monuments or be sprawling green campuses of one-story
buildings. But they reflect a national trend, played out on a big
scale in Los Angeles, to commission more daring public school
architecture.</TE>
<TE>   The library of Manual Arts New Elementary School No. 3, for
example, is expected to lean into the corner of Jefferson and
Catalina. A parallelogram with a window as wide as a movie screen,
the structure showcases the students and allows them to view their
neighborhood near Exposition Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to do a more neutral school and then have the
residents do a mural," said Christopher Coe of Arquitectonica
International, the firm that designed the $20-million campus, where
construction is scheduled to start next spring. "But the community
told us that it was OK to be more colorful."</TE>
<TE>   Central High No. 10 -- numbered schools may get new names later --
at the corner of 3rd and Bixel streets just west of downtown, is
among the most ambitious designs. (The campus, where construction is
supposed to start next summer, will be on a hill above the district's
biggest embarrassment, the unfinished Belmont.)</TE>
<TE>   Central High No. 10's designers adopted a strategy similar to
Universal CityWalk: cutting off undesirable urban elements like
traffic and homeless encampments while trying to create a town center
for the 2,000 students. Separate buildings for offices, library,
cafeteria and auditorium will line the courtyards.</TE>
<TE>   With the courtyards and other touches, "we're kind of blurring the
traditional lines between the classroom and the street -- we're
saying education happens in both places," said its architect, Scott
Johnson, of Johnson Fain Partners. "We're also saying that something
communal and social has to happen here." Another unusual project, the
$50-million Science Center Elementary School under construction amid
museums at Exposition Park, will recycle the 1926 former Armory shed.
A new, low-lying classroom building will be built beside it,
camouflaged by berms and grassy rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   "The school disappears into the landscape environment," said its
designer, Thom Mayne of the Morphosis firm. "It literally becomes an
extension of the park."</TE>
<TE>   That project pooled money from L.A. Unified, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and a state park bond. But the 13 years of planning
and discussions with neighboring USC and museums showed how difficult
sharing property can be, Littmann said, adding that it is more likely
for schools to be built close to recreational and cultural
facilities, not on the same sites.</TE>
<TE>   History shows that school construction, though essential, need not
be dull. Past construction booms, such as those in the 1920s and
'50s, produced some designs so distinctive that the district now has
at least 49 schools considered worthy of historical preservation
status.</TE>
<TE>   "These schools were built at a time when institutions garnered
more respect, and the buildings that expressed those institutions
were seen as places that honored the institution and the city," said
architect Lehrer.</TE>
<TE>   But as Proposition 13 hampered districts' ability to pay for
maintenance and new schools, many campuses fell into disrepair.
Architects say that allowing these buildings to become run down
offends communities and dehumanizes students.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Logan, 8, agrees. She said her former campus, Sylvan Park
Elementary in the San Fernando Valley, used to be vandalized by
students. "People used to spray the walls," she said. "They threw
rocks at the windows."</TE>
<TE>   After she moved to the new Columbus Avenue Elementary School in
Van Nuys this year, she noticed that the students showed more
respect.</TE>
<TE>   With slanted roofs and clean lines designed by the
Leidenfrost/Horowitz architecture firm, Columbus Avenue's two-story
layout clusters several groups of six classrooms around a common
teachers' office and supply room. Individual tutoring can be held in
those rooms while teachers watch their classes through windows.</TE>
<TE>   The interiors are efficient, if not warm, with linoleum floors and
particle-board shelves. The white board is also a projection screen,
and shelves and a television are hidden behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Thibodeau, Columbus Avenue's principal, said she wishes
the classrooms were somewhat larger. But she said she and teachers
feel fortunate to be in the new school.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, she said, she thinks the new architecture will
help students focus on learning. "I want to say it will," she said.
"Time will tell."</TE>

<HD>Advisors Put Under a Microscope</HD>
<DH>The Bush team is going to great lengths to vet members of
scientific panels. Credentials, not ideology, should be the focus,
critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When psychologist William R. Miller was asked to join a panel that
advises the National Institute on Drug Abuse, he thought he had been
selected for his expertise in addiction. Then a Bush administration
staff member called with some unexpected questions.</LD>
<LD>   Did Miller support abortion rights? What about the death penalty
for drug kingpins? And had he voted for President Bush?</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, Miller said, he did not give enough right answers. He
had not, for example, voted for Bush. He was never appointed to the
panel.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers are complaining with rising alarm that the Bush
administration is using political and ideological screening to try to
ensure that its scientific consultants recommend no policies that are
out of step with the political agenda of the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say they are merely doing what their
predecessors have always done: using appointment powers to make sure
their viewpoints are well-represented on the government's scientific
advisory boards, an important if unglamorous part of the
policy-making process. There are more than 250 boards devoted to
public health and biomedical research alone, composed of experts from
outside the government who help guide policy on gene therapy,
bioterrorism, acceptable pollutant levels and other complex matters.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the Bush administration is going further than its
predecessors in considering ideology as well as scientific expertise
in forming the panels. A committee that merely gives technical advice
on research proposals, as opposed to setting policy, has even been
subject to screening, something the critics say was unheard of in
previous administrations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any administration has penetrated so deeply into
the advisory committee structure as this one, and I think it
matters," said Donald Kennedy, past president of Stanford University
and editor of Science, the premier U.S. scientific journal. "If you
start picking people by their ideology instead of their scientific
credentials, you are inevitably reducing the quality of the advisory
group."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the complaints concern agencies within the Department of
Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 10, the Food and Drug Administration rejected a nominee
for an advisory board who is known for his support of human cloning
in medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Also recently, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson's staff rejected a
nominee to a board of the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health who supports federal rules to curtail repetitive stress
injuries in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The nominees had been chosen by officials within the FDA and
occupational health agency but were then rejected by more senior
officials. No specific reasons were given, but Bush opposes human
cloning and last year signed a rollback of Clinton-era rules designed
to limit repetitive stress injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Those rejections followed incidents this fall in which public
health advocates and Democratic lawmakers alleged that the
administration had placed people sympathetic to industry on two
panels at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One panel
advises CDC officials on the prevention of lead poisoning in
children. The other makes recommendations on issues ranging from
environmental toxins to bioterrorism preparations.</TE>
<TE>   "They're stacking committees to get the advice they know they want
to hear, which is a charade," said David Michaels, a professor of
public health at George Washington University, who served in the
Clinton administration. "Why have an advisory panel if you know what
everyone is going to say, and they agree with you?"</TE>
<TE>   Some critics also complain that Thompson has added an ideological
cast to the mission of some advisory panels.</TE>
<TE>   To the applause of antiabortion groups, the administration in
October directed a panel to study what protections are offered to
embryos during medical experiments, using language that equated
embryos with "human subjects." Health officials said their intent was
to add protections to pregnant women who participate in experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Pierce, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services
Department, said Bush and Thompson were trying to add balance to the
committees.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole idea of a grand conspiracy here or a litmus test --
it's just not true," Pierce said. "When you look at the totality of
any of these committees, you'll find that they are highly qualified
and represent a broad section of the thinking, so that you have a
spirited discussion of the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Others said that some of the complaints may reflect a difference
in style between Thompson, who as former governor of Wisconsin is
familiar with using all the levers of power, and his predecessor in
the federal government's top health slot, Donna Shalala.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a four-term governor. This is not an academic, as Dr.
Shalala was," said Dr. John Howard, director of the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. "This secretary
scrutinizes appointments."</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas Murray, president of the Hastings Center, a New York
bioethics center, said he saw a pattern in the rejection of nominees
to health panels, including his own nomination to the Biological
Response Modifiers Advisory Committee, an FDA panel that considers
protein drugs, gene therapy and other matters.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they would even bother to blacklist me is ...
deeply sad," Murray said. "It portends a distortion of the process of
determining what the facts are on a health topic or in environmental
policy."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the incidents, several scientists say the most
disconcerting involved a panel at the occupational safety agency.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Safety and Occupational Health Study Section, the
panel reviews applications for research grants, ranking them based on
their scientific merit. The process is known as peer review.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Loomis, a professor at the University of North Carolina who
is chairman of the panel, said Thompson's office gave no reason when
it rejected three proposed members several months ago. The nominees
had been chosen last year by Loomis, the panel staff and other
officials, and they were approved by the then-director of the
occupational safety institute.</TE>
<TE>   But the reasons "seem clear enough in at least one case: One of
the rejected nominees is a respected expert in ergonomics who has
publicly supported a workplace ergonomics standard," Loomis wrote
this month in a letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Bush last
year repealed such a rule, which was aimed at requiring employers to
do more to reduce repetitive stress and related injuries.</TE>
<TE>   That nominee, Laura Purnett, a professor at the University of
Massachusetts in Lowell, wrote to Kennedy that she had been subjected
to "an ideological litmus test" that presumed she could not be
objective in her panel work.</TE>
<TE>   A second nominee, Catherine Heaney, an associate professor of
public health at Ohio State University, said she had no clue why she
was rejected. But she noted that her most recent research has focused
on ergonomics.</TE>
<TE>   In a related incident, a researcher who was nominated to the panel
more recently said a member of Thompson's staff called her in an
apparent attempt to gauge her views on ergonomics and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a neutral view" on ergonomics, said Pamela Kidd, a
specialist in workplace injury prevention at Arizona State University
in Tempe, who is now a member of the panel.</TE>
<TE>   A range of scientists and research advocates said they were
particularly disturbed that the administration would ask such
questions of nominees to a peer-review panel. These panels do not set
policy or make funding decisions, they said, but merely determine
whether scientists who want federal funding have designed credible
experiments that can truly answer the questions they are studying.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal here is to fund the best science, the best-designed
experiments," said Anthony Mazzaschi, an assistant vice president at
the Assn. of American Medical Colleges. "To stack peer-review panels
based on political preferences rather than scientific competency is
doing everyone a disservice."</TE>
<TE>   Loomis, the panel chairman, said the screening "tends to stifle
the scientific spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what the intention was, this creates the appearance
that review panel members are being politically scrutinized, which is
directly opposed to the philosophy of peer review, which is supposed
to be nonpolitical and transparent," Loomis said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and public health advocates have been vigorously
complaining about changes to the two CDC advisory panels.</TE>
<TE>   They challenged several new appointments to the Advisory Committee
on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention, saying the new members were
too closely aligned with industry interests and might weaken
protections for children against lead poisoning. The new appointees
included Dr. William Banner Jr., an Oklahoma physician who, according
to critics, has testified that lead is harmful only at levels well
beyond the government's current standards.</TE>
<TE>   Another member, Dr. Sergio Piomelli of Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center in New York, announced at the committee's first
meeting in October that he was nominated to be on the committee by
"someone from the lead industry," whose name he could not remember.
But Piomelli, a pediatric hematologist, also said he had conducted
studies that were criticized by the lead industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Advisory committees are supposed to give the government and the
public expert, unbiased advice based on the best possible science,"
Sen. Kennedy said. "By stacking these important committees with
right-wing ideologues instead of respected scientists, the
administration is putting the health and well-being of the American
public at risk."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the administration chose not to reappoint 15 of the
18 members of the National Center for Environmental Health Advisory
Committee whose terms had expired. The committee advises the Centers
for Disease Control on a range of issues, including bioterrorism
preparedness and safe drinking water standards.</TE>
<TE>   One of the new appointees is a former president of a research firm
funded by the chemical industry, and another "has made a career
countering claims of links between pollutants and cancer," said Sens.
Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) in a letter to Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Burke, an environmental health specialist at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore who until recently was chairman of the
committee, said: "I understand that this is the political process,
and the pendulum swings. This is definitely a swing of the pendulum."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, the Health and Human Services Department's spokesman, said
the critics were singling out the few panel members whose views
differ from their own, "and then attributing to them some superhuman
ability to overwhelm everyone else on the committee."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce also said that the staff member who queried Miller, the
addiction researcher, is no longer with the department. "To my
knowledge," he added, "'we do not ask those questions."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University
of New Mexico in Albuquerque, said he received a call early this year
asking whether he would serve on the National Advisory Council on
Drug Abuse, which guides funding and policy decisions at a unit of
the National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the call from someone at Thompson's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The first question he asked me was, 'Are you sympathetic to
faith-based initiatives?' I said yes, and he said, 'OK, you're one
for one.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then the caller asked Miller about his views on needle exchange
programs, the death penalty for drug kingpins and abortion, keeping a
running tally of where his views agreed with those of the White
House. Finally, the caller asked whether Miller had voted for Bush.
When Miller said he had not, the caller asked him to explain.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to admire the audacity," Miller said last week. "It
seemed rather clear that the White House wanted to make sure they
wouldn't receive any advice inconsistent with their own positions."</TE>
<TE>   "In an ideal world, you'd choose people based on their scientific
credentials, their knowledge of the literature," he said. "Maybe
that's too ideal a world."</TE>

<HD>Baltimore Bans BB Guns for Minors</HD>
<DH>Giving or selling such a weapon to an underage individual
can result in a $500 fine and jail time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The BB gun is a traditional Christmas gift that always has come
wrapped in a certain risk. Now, the toy carries a threat that has
nothing to do with putting an eye out: a $500 fine and two months in
jail.</LD>
<LD>   It is a misdemeanor in Baltimore to sell or give a BB gun to
anyone younger than age 18, under an ordinance adopted by the City
Council this month.</LD>
<LD>   In one of America's most deadly cities, where juvenile homicides
are up 50% this year compared with last, officials are fed up with
toy guns that look like the real thing.</LD>
<TE>   "We're dealing with a different element now," said council
President Sheila Dixon. "If you give it to a minor and we trace it
back, that person will be fined or charged with a crime."</TE>
<TE>   Forget the romance of the Red Ryder, the wooden-stock BB rifle
designed in 1938 and portrayed as a boy's to-die-for holiday gift in
the 1983 movie "A Christmas Story." Some of the most popular BB guns
these days don't resemble the guns of the Wild West, but the
semiautomatics packed by street thugs.</TE>
<TE>   And instead of playing with the guns -- taking target practice at
soda bottles or, at worst, terrorizing squirrels -- some Baltimore
residents use them to prey on people, police say.</TE>
<TE>   City police do not track how often BB guns are used to commit
crimes, but they say they're turning up more often in the hands of
offenders. The toys are much easier to obtain than real weapons,
police say, and won't result in gun charges in the event of an
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Gun-rights advocates say the city has bigger problems than BBs.
They point to recent high-profile crimes -- including a family of
seven killed in an October fire police believe was set to punish them
for reporting neighborhood drug-dealing -- and call a crackdown on
toys silly.</TE>

<HD>Pitching U.S. to Others a Tough Sell</HD>
<DH>Former ad executive has difficult task of trying to stop
the hatred overseas that leads to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- She assumed office shortly after Sept. 11, a former
advertising executive whose new post at the State Department took on
a sense of urgency after that day's deadly attacks.</LD>
<LD>   As undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs,
Charlotte Beers' mission was broad: to help quell the hatred toward
Americans that became all too evident after the terrorists struck. As
one scholar put it, the problem of "why they hate us" was translated
into "how we reposition the brand." Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell asked why he would recruit a Madison Avenue-type who early in
her career handled advertising for Uncle Ben's rice, replied, "Didn't
you buy Uncle Ben's rice? And that's exactly what I want ... somebody
who can get out there and mix it up in the kind of world we're living
in."</LD>
<LD>   Beers is the only executive to have served as head of two of the
advertising industry's top 10 agencies: J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy
&amp; Mather. But she is a novice at the internecine turf wars over
policy and personnel that define Washington and a newcomer to the
hostility that often greets U.S. policy abroad. About 15 months into
her government service, she is on the defensive from inside and out.</LD>
<TE>   A series of heart-tugging television ads she developed to showcase
America's religious tolerance has been rejected by some Arab
countries. The ads, which feature Muslim Americans talking about the
acceptance they feel in the United States, have run in Malaysia,
Indonesia and on some regional outlets such as Middle East
Broadcasting Co. But Egypt Television, which last month aired a
controversial series based on the anti-Semitic Protocols of the
Elders of Zion, declined the U.S. buy, saying it does not accept paid
advertisements from foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   The latest poll numbers show a continuing slide in Arab public
opinion about the United States. In the last two years, according to
a poll released this month by the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, favorable ratings are down 22% in Turkey over the last
two years, and down 13% in Pakistan. In Egypt, those with a favorable
opinion of the United States stand at 6%.</TE>
<TE>   And most telling of all, many question Beers' very strategy of
pitching American values to an audience that hates American policy,
particularly its stalwart defense of Israel in the conflict with
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Public diplomacy is intimately linked to our foreign policy,"
said David Morey, a Washington consultant who co-chairs the Council
on Foreign Relations Task Force on Public Diplomacy. Quoting veteran
broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, who also served as director of the U.S.
Information Agency, Morey added that those selling American policy
abroad need to be involved in making American policy at home. "They
have to be in on the takeoffs as well as the crash-landings," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Satloff, policy director at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, put it more directly. The campaign to win the
hearts and minds of Arabs overseas has faltered, he said, because it
"put a premium on a well-intentioned but highly counterproductive
effort to be liked, at the expense of public advocacy."</TE>
<TE>   To Beers' defenders, the criticism ignores the full menu of
initiatives she has launched, including a first-ever call to
Washington last spring of 150 embassy employees who specialize in
public diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Satloff acts as if the only thing we do is talk about warm and
fuzzy stuff," said Christopher Ross, an Arabic-speaking former
ambassador who, in addition to being a regular defender of U.S.
policy on the Al Jazeera Arabic news network, is Beers' top advisor.
"Most of our effort goes into policy explanation."</TE>
<TE>   But even those sympathetic to the effort question whether a
message of shared values will convince Muslims in Arab countries that
their widely held presumptions are untrue: that the United States is
contemplating war in Iraq in an effort to capture its oil, or that
Washington backs Israel because Jewish officials are influencing U.S.
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government spends about $1 billion annually for public
diplomacy, including international broadcasting, compared with about
$379 billion for defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain perceptions of the United States, particularly in some
media markets, are just not amenable to even the most brilliant
public relations campaign," said Richard N. Perle, who chairs the
Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, a panel of outside advisors. "This
whole thing was initiated out of a sense that we are misperceived. It
doesn't hurt to try, and at the level we're investing, it's not even
very expensive. But it's an impossible task."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Beers is mindful of the criticism from the experts.
She calls it "the elephant in the room," the problem that no amount
of advertising glitz or public relations savvy can erase: Arab
dislike for U.S. policy in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   She counters that by saying that "it really helps the extremists
when we say nothing." Waiting until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is resolved, she added, may be "tempting," but "it's even more
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Beers also makes no apology for the effort to showcase American
values, particularly as they are shared by Arabs in Muslim countries
-- an emphasis on families, on the importance of religion, on a
better quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "Any dialogue, any small door opened, any misperception corrected,
is worth doing," she said last week at a much-anticipated appearance
at the National Press Club. "We really have to get beyond the rather
stratified conversation we have with elites in government ... and get
to the people who've been told every day their definition of who we
are."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, her office is developing a new magazine targeting
Arab teenagers, one that reflects a positive view of the United
States. She was in New York recently, talking with "Sesame Street's"
nonprofit arm, Sesame Workshop, about a television show that would
teach English and computer skills to youngsters in Egypt. Her office
is working with the Smithsonian Institution to develop a virtual
"American Room" to allow audiences at embassies or schools to
experience the U.S. And she has attracted 15 notable authors to write
essays on what it means to them to be an American.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is "thrilled" by her campaign to advertise the shared
values between Americans and Arabs, said spokesman Richard Boucher,
adding, "The secretary felt very strongly that it was a good
message."</TE>
<TE>   To complicate matters, Beers is competing for funds and focus with
other agencies and more high-profile projects. The International
Broadcasting Bureau has pioneered some new outreach efforts. Voice of
America has replaced its Arabic service, for instance, with an FM
station called Radio Sawa (Radio Together), a program aimed at
attracting a young Arab audience not with news but with American
music. In Iran, broadcasters have just launched Radio Farda (Radio
Tomorrow), a Persian-language AM, digital and shortwave station
designed to give the young Iranians now demonstrating for democracy
in the streets of Tehran more news, information and public affairs,
as well as entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Tucker Eskew was brought in to direct an
Office of Global Communications, a sort of rapid response team for
explaining U.S. policy. And the Pentagon, with a generous new budget
for defense spending, keeps trying to apply military resources to the
information game. In February, Pentagon officials floated the idea
for an Office of Strategic Influence, which Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld quickly dismantled when critics protested the idea of
spreading disinformation in foreign countries. Then last week came
news that the Pentagon was considering a covert propaganda plan to,
among other features, pay journalists in foreign countries to write
favorable articles, fund moderate Islamic schools and hire advance
people to organize pro-American rallies.</TE>
<TE>   When she speaks of the Defense Department, Beers' voice turns a
bit tense. She notes that there is careful coordination to ensure
that everything "going out over our various channels is the truth."</TE>
<TE>   She is also careful these days not to portray her efforts as akin
to selling Uncle Ben's rice, even though she still uses the lingo of
advertising. "Just because I come from Madison Avenue doesn't mean I
think I'm selling," she said. "There is no assumption that we have a
ready buyer out there. [We are trying] to create a dialogue, which is
really a different starting point than a pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics remain doubtful. "Al Jazeera is like a long-running O.J.
Simpson trial," said Francis Fukuyama, political economist at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. "Unless we
get those pictures of Palestinian victims off the evening news,
nothing she's doing is going to make a difference."</TE>

<HD>Fearing a Field of Genes</HD>
<DH>The food industry loves engineered crops, but not when
plants altered to 'grow' drugs and chemicals can slip into its
products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The field had just been harvested, the soybean plants cut down to
brown nubs, when a federal inspector arrived. He paced the small plot
in southeastern Nebraska, eyes on the furrowed dirt.</LD>
<LD>   Then he saw them: a few crumpled corn stalks strewn among the
brittle bits of beans.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery rattled America's food industry, for this was not
ordinary corn. It had been genetically engineered to produce an
"edible vaccine" to protect piglets from diarrhea. And now the
stubble on the ground suggested that it had been swept into the
autumn soy harvest -- mixed with beans that would soon be processed
into dozens of groceries, from ice cream to salad dressing.</LD>
<TE>   The manufacturers that make those groceries have been staunch
supporters of engineered food. But the mix-up last month in Nebraska
infuriated them. After years of backing biotechnology, they drew the
line -- and raised an alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Joining forces with the antibiotech activists they have long
viewed as the enemy, food lobbyists are pushing for much tougher
restrictions on the latest advance in the genetic revolution:
engineering crops to "grow" pharmaceuticals and chemicals. They fear
a threat to public health -- and to their business interests, as well
-- if crops bearing a hepatitis vaccine or a cancer drug slip into
the food supply. So, they are demanding federal regulation to
strictly limit where and how the experimental plants are grown.</TE>
<TE>   From baby formula to margarine to chicken soup, about 70% of
processed food on the country's shelves contains engineered
ingredients, such as soybeans genetically modified so they can be
grown with fewer herbicides. Deconstructed, the biotech crops sound a
bit freakish: The beans, for instance, are spliced with DNA from a
cauliflower virus and a petunia plant. But they are extensively
tested and approved for human consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Corn that produces a swine vaccine is not.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one of the strongest defenders of using biotechnology in
agriculture. But this is something different," said Rhona Applebaum,
executive vice president of the National Food Processors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists tinkering with DNA transfers are developing crops that
will produce insulin, chemotherapy drugs, herpes treatments, blood
thinners -- even enzymes used to make laundry detergent. They're
testing them in dozens of "biopharm" fields across the country, from
California to Maryland, North Dakota to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The experimental crops look in every way like normal corn, rice or
barley. And that makes them "an intolerable risk" to the food supply,
said James Bair, vice president of the North American Millers' Assn.,
which represents grain processors.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most strident critics of "biopharming" acknowledge that
in most cases, consumers would probably suffer no ill effects if
trace amounts of these new crops made their way into groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biopharm products mimic antibodies naturally found in
the human body. Others are effective only if injected into the
bloodstream; eaten, they would dissolve harmlessly in the gut.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of the experimental crops has been subjected to food
safety tests. Some could, conceivably, be dangerous in high doses.
Others could trigger allergic reactions.</TE>
<TE>   "With some vaccines, there could potentially be a threat of
overdose [although] it's not something I would stay up late worrying
about," said Charles Arntzen, a plant biologist at Arizona State
University who is growing a cholera vaccine in tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the health risk may be low, the FDA will not allow the
food supply to be tainted by any compound that has not been approved
for human consumption. If even a few biopharm cornstalks were
mistakenly sent to a processing plant, every grocery made with that
mill's cornmeal would be recalled. Food manufacturers envision an
economic disaster, with consumer confidence plunging at home and
foreign markets for U.S. groceries slamming shut.</TE>
<TE>   "If their product goes awry, that doesn't just damage [the biotech
company's] stock. It has the potential for a very broad ripple
effect," said Stephanie Childs, a spokeswoman for the Grocery
Manufacturers of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concerns are obvious," said Mark Dollins, a spokesman for
Quaker Oats.</TE>
<TE>   That anxiety is heightened because there is no way to test whether
a given batch of corn headed to a grain mill contains a swine
vaccine, or a contraceptive, or an enzyme used to tan leather.</TE>
<TE>   Such tests exist for the engineered crops used in groceries; food
processors routinely analyze their ingredients with DNA probes that
can detect a single biotech kernel in a bin of 50,000. It would be
fairly easy to develop similar tests for biopharm products, but only
if the scientists engineering them release the details of their DNA
modifications. The federal government does not require them to do so,
and so far, none has.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had calls from food processors asking, 'What about our
cornmeal? How can we be sure [biopharm grains] aren't in it?' And at
this point in time, they can't be sure," said John Fagan, president
of Genetic ID, a biotechnology testing firm.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Nebraska contamination was so unsettling to many in
the food industry. The biopharm corn, engineered to protect baby pigs
from a gastrointestinal disease, was grown in the summer of 2001 for
ProdiGene, a leading biotech firm based in College Station, Texas.
The firm paid a Nebraska farmer to grow the corn under conditions
laid out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It was isolated from
nearby crops and surrounded by a buffer of sterile plants to catch
any drifting pollen.</TE>
<TE>   The corn crop grew well, and ProdiGene harvested it in the fall
for testing. A few months later, in the spring of 2002, the farmer
who owned the test field planted it with soybeans, for sale to food
mills. The USDA required ProdiGene to regularly inspect the field to
make sure no leftover biopharm corn had taken root amid the soy.</TE>
<TE>   ProdiGene sent inspectors to look over the field several times
last summer, according to Anthony Laos, the company's chief
executive. Finding no stray corn, they discontinued inspections in
late August. But a few dormant seeds apparently sprouted in early
fall.</TE>
<TE>   USDA inspectors, who visit most test fields just once a growing
season, spotted the errant cornstalks in October and ordered the
farmer to pull them. Laos can only surmise that the farmer missed a
few because, when the USDA returned a month later, the stubble on the
ground suggested that the corn had been harvested along with the soy.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA soon tracked the harvest to a storage elevator in Aurora,
Neb. By then, the beans had been mixed with the bounty from several
farms. The agency incinerated all 500,000 bushels -- a harvest worth
nearly $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the USDA ordered ProdiGene to pay for the destroyed
beans. The company must also pay an unprecedented $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech backers warn against using the incident as an excuse to
quash a promising new industry. Biopharming, they argue, can
revolutionize health care. Developing nations short on clean syringes
could distribute edible vaccines instead. Pharmaceutical production
could be sped up and simplified -- a matter of seeding a few acres,
rather than building a $500-million factory.</TE>
<TE>   "There are selfish and powerful [food industry] trade groups in
Washington who want to be overly safe," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley
(R-Iowa). "I'm concerned that any new regulation be based on science,
not emotion."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman has signaled that she
understands that concern, telling a farmers' group this month: "We
don't want to stifle growth, but we have to have a strong and
credible regulatory system."</TE>
<TE>   She is requesting comments on a 15-page list of proposed
guidelines for the industry -- all phrased as suggestions, not
mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Among the reforms under consideration: moving experimental fields
out of the Midwest's Corn Belt; marking biopharm plants as distinct,
perhaps by dyeing their leaves a different color, and setting aside
fields and equipment exclusively for experimental crops.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech firms could support some of those measures "to make sure
these plants stay where they belong," said Lisa Dry, a spokeswoman
for Biotechnology Industry Organization, a Washington-based industry
trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The one proposal they refuse to consider: requiring scientists to
use non-food crops for their experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Some biopharm engineers are testing tobacco, cotton, even weeds.
But corn is by far the most common medium. It's considered the
easiest to work with because its seeds are stable, it's easy to store
and its biology is so well understood. Several companies, including
ProdiGene, say they will not give it up.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a non-starter," Dry said. "We believe these crops can be
managed."</TE>
<TE>   Those calling for a ban on biopharm food crops are not so
confident. They see the mix-up on the Nebraska soybean field as the
latest in a troubling string of slips that cast doubt on the
industry's ability to keep experimental crops off dinner plates.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks before the Nebraska mix-up, for instance, the USDA
had warned ProdiGene about a close call with another field, this one
in Iowa. The circumstances were remarkably similar: A farmer had
planted soy after ProdiGene's crop of swine-vaccine corn was
harvested. But he neglected to pull stray cornstalks. Concerned that
biopharm pollen could have drifted into adjacent fields, the USDA
ordered 155 acres of nearby food crops burned.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, biotechnology giant Monsanto has been struggling for
two years to track down a strain of genetically modified canola that
was inadvertently mixed with seeds distributed to farmers. The
herbicide-resistant canola had not been approved for planting,
although regulators now say it is perfectly safe.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic lapse occurred two years ago, when biotech corn
approved only for animal feed made its way into more than 300 brands
of taco shells, corn breads and other processed foods. The corn,
known as StarLink, was not designed to produce drugs or chemicals,
but regulators were concerned it could cause allergies in humans.</TE>
<TE>   "It showed how easy it was for a gene we thought we had under
control to get into the food chain," said Jane Rissler, a member of
the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group skeptical of
biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to risk another such slip, food industry lobbyists now
demand an ironclad guarantee that no trace of any biopharm compound
will ever get into the food supply. In one voice, they insist on 100%
protection.</TE>
<TE>   That's a standard that Laos, the ProdiGene chief executive, deems
unattainable.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing we do in this world," he said, "is risk-free."</TE>

<LD>Just days after thieves stole the Christmas gifts meant for women and
children at a Davenport domestic violence shelter, the center's gift
collection is overflowing thanks to an outpouring from the community.</LD>
<LD>   About $1,200 worth of goods were taken from the shelter. "We've
got children who have been victimized twice," said Police Capt. David
Struckman.</LD>
<LD>   After media reported the theft Saturday, the gifts began pouring
in. By that night, the shelter had collected more than $5,100 in cash
and about 10 van loads of toys.</LD>

<LD>President Bush showed no ill effects from his smallpox vaccination,
taking a morning jog at Camp David before going to church.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is feeling "absolutely, positively fine," said White House
spokesman Adam Levine.</LD>
<LD>   Experts estimate 15 out of every 1 million people vaccinated for
the first time will face life-threatening complications, and one or
two will die. Reactions are less common for those being revaccinated,
as Bush was on Saturday. On Dec. 13, Bush directed as many as 500,000
U.S. troops to get vaccinated, part of an effort to guard against
bioterrorism.</LD>

<LD>Evidence in the sniper case points to teen John Lee Malvo as the

death sentence for the older suspect, John Muhammad.</LD>
<LD>   "There is not much pointing to Muhammad, and that is going to make
it really hard to show that he was the triggerman," a law official
told the New York Times. Muhammad, 41, and Malvo, 17, are charged
with 13 shootings that left 10 dead and three hurt in the Washington

<HD>GOP Senators Seek to Stay Course on Race Issues</HD>
<DH>They urge the party to continue to oppose quotas in the
aftermath of the Lott debacle. The outgoing leader says he fell into
enemies' 'trap.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Key Republican senators, looking beyond the Trent Lott debacle, urged
President Bush and the GOP on Sunday to steer a continued
conservative course on civil rights -- including opposing "quotas and
preferences" in a pending affirmative action case in the Supreme
Court and renominating U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr.
of Mississippi to a federal appellate court.</LD>
<LD>   In a round of television interviews, Republican leaders said the
GOP should not switch directions on civil rights after Lott's
decision Friday to resign as Senate Republican leader because of
comments that seemed to endorse segregation.</LD>
<LD>   The issue of race has split Republicans and Democrats for more
than two decades.</LD>
<TE>   While Democrats have supported affirmative action plans that give
an edge to blacks and Latinos, Republicans have opposed giving an
explicit advantage to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that Republicans are going to start endorsing
quotas and preferences," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the incoming
Senate majority whip, said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   "The president has done a terrific job of reaching out to ...
African Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans. We think
we've got a good record that can be sold to those voters."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans plan to elect Bill Frist, a heart surgeon from
Tennessee, as their new leader during a conference call this
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) described Frist as offering "a
different face" and a "more moderate approach to things."</TE>
<TE>   But on ABC's "This Week," Hatch denounced as "pure b.s." the
"attitude that only Democrats care about minorities.... I think every
Republican is working hard to try and be good to minorities and do
what's right. But we can't support some of the far-left, extreme
approaches toward race."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch strongly urged the Bush administration to file a brief in
two cases, to be argued before the Supreme Court in March, opposing
the race-based admissions policy at the University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the most important issues of the day, and the
administration should weigh in on it," said Hatch, who will chair the
Judiciary Committee when the 108th Congress is sworn in next month.</TE>
<TE>   "Affirmative action is good if its consists of outreach ... and
opportunity programs," he said, but not "if it amounts to quotas."</TE>
<TE>   University of Michigan officials say they give "bonus" points to
all minority applicants but set no fixed quota. The Center for
Individual Rights, a conservative law firm in Washington, is
challenging these "racial preferences" as a violation of the
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</TE>
<TE>   The White House does not have to take a stand in the Supreme Court
case, but several Republican senators said they hoped the
administration would use the opportunity to clarify its position.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the president has a very tough decision to make,"
said Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) on CBS' "Face the Nation." He
described "traditional affirmative action approaches" as "racially
divisive. What the president's talked about is equal opportunity and
using other kinds of things to get away from quotas and focus more on
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), on the same program, said Lott
lost support among his Republican colleagues when he endorsed
affirmative action in an interview Monday night on Black
Entertainment Television.</TE>
<TE>   It was "disavowing the conservative approach," Inhofe said. "This
affirmative action thing that they talk about, I find it to be
insulting.... Different standards for different people are not just
un-American. It's immoral."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican senators said they favored the renomination of
Pickering to the U.S. appeals court in New Orleans. Last year, in a
Democrat-controlled Senate, Pickering's nomination was defeated in
the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote of 10 to 9.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very badly treated," Hatch said. "I think he deserves
renomination."</TE>
<TE>   Pickering's hearing focused on a series of incidents involving
race. In the 1960s, he testified against an imperial wizard of the Ku
Klux Klan, a stand that Republicans said showed his courage.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrats revealed that as a federal trial judge in 1994,
Pickering secretly pressed prosecutors to go along with an unusually
lenient sentence for a man convicted of burning a cross outside the
home of mixed-race couple. He and two other white men also fired a
bullet at the house, narrowly missing the couple's baby.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering called the incident a "drunken prank" and refused to
impose a seven-year prison term set by federal sentencing guidelines.
He ultimately gave the man a 27-month prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats were also chafing because three of President
Clinton's nominees -- one black and two Latinos -- were blocked by
the Republicans for the same appeals court seat that was sought for
Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell, who will be the Senate's second-ranking Republican,
said the furor over Lott's comments will not prove to have a lasting
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long sweep of American history, this is going to be a
blip," he said. "I think this will present no handicap whatsoever in
our ongoing effort to convince the nonwhite citizens of our country
that the Republican Party is the place to be."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Lott told Associated Press on Sunday that he had
only himself to blame for his fall from the Senate leadership, but he
noted that "there are people in Washington who have been trying to
nail me for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're from Mississippi and you're a conservative and you're
a Christian, there are a lot of people that don't like that," Lott
said. "I fell into their trap and so I have only myself to blame." He
would not identify his political enemies.</TE>

<HD>Lugar Now the Man in the Middle</HD>
<DH>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's new leader will
have clout. Centrists hope he will offset hawks in the Bush
administration.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the Great Rolodex Reshuffle that takes place in this town after
every election, one man's card has been moved to the front of the
stack.</LD>
<LD>   It belongs to Sen. Richard G. Lugar, the 70-year-old Indiana
Republican whose views are suddenly being sought by the White House
and foreign emissaries.</LD>
<LD>   Lugar is due to take over next month as chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, vowing to make it a more potent platform
from which to advise, assist and nudge the Bush administration. As a
respected foreign policy expert in a narrowly divided Senate, Lugar
is positioned to wield tremendous clout.</LD>
<TE>   Centrists are hoping the moderate, multilateralist Lugar will
align himself with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to temper the
influence of the administration's hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be a strong voice on the Powell side of that equation,"
said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who was also a
leader on foreign policy. "He needs to balance the role of being a
partner and a critic."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar, said fellow Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, a Democrat, has
"literally been preparing his entire life for this assignment. He'll
help take some of the rough edges off the Bush administration."</TE>
<TE>   The senator, however, demurred, describing himself in a recent
interview as a "friend of the family" who has good ties with all
members of the fractious administration.</TE>
<TE>   Though he is close to Powell, Lugar pointedly reminisced about
times past, when Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz -- one of
the administration's most prominent hawks  -- enlightened him about
the Philippines, and when, as mayor of Indianapolis, Lugar was chummy
with then-Rep. Donald H. Rumsfeld of Illinois. With a chuckle, Lugar
waved off a question on the tension between the war hawks and the
diplomacy-minded Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest of the country is that all of these folks pull
together," Lugar said. "At the end of the day, they do not want to be
perceived as warring....To the extent that they want to visit with me
or I can be helpful, I'm going to be."</TE>
<TE>   But "helpful" does not mean "rubber stamp." Lugar pointed out that
"a friend of the family can say, essentially, 'This really isn't good
enough.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 27-year Senate veteran said his first project will be
to turn up the heat on a problem he thinks the administration has
placed on the back burner: Who runs Iraq if the U.S. succeeds in
ousting Saddam Hussein?</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of Lugar's new status, Washington's most powerful already
have begun paying their respects. Wolfowitz stopped by Lugar's office
on his way back from Turkey to brief the senator for more than an
hour on efforts to win logistical support for a war on Iraq. Powell
telephoned from Colombia to swap notes on Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The staid Lugar -- anything but a sound-bite man -- is suddenly
getting top billing on the television talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   He weighed in on Iraqi weapons inspections on CBS' "Face the
Nation" and told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week" that the
administration should start negotiating with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists from more than two dozen countries are lining up to
interview him on every major world issue. Others, too, are paying
court, as recent visits by the foreign ministers of Mexico and Russia
attest.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Lugar is widely respected for his intellect and
command of foreign policy -- a subject that, in the post-Cold-War
era, has been shunned by most members of Congress as something
removed from the workaday concerns of their constituents and
irrelevant to their reelection prospects.</TE>
<TE>   One sign of that shift is the diminished prestige of the Foreign
Relations Committee itself, which was a sought-after assignment for
senior senators more than a generation ago when it was a bastion of
opposition to the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   Now, fewer senior members want to join, in part because Senate
rules force them to choose between that panel and such other elite
committees as Appropriations and Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar recently tried to win a change in Senate rules that would
make it easier to attract senior members, but the effort died.</TE>
<TE>   With the GOP having regained a Senate majority in last month's
midterm elections, Lugar will take over as chairman from Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.); the senior Republican on the committee, Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), retired.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar will be bolstered by one of the Senate's rising stars,
Charles Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who shares Lugar's
internationalist instincts. Biden, who has worked closely with Lugar,
will stay on as the ranking Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar is a throwback to a more bipartisan era of the Senate, when
moderate Republicans were not an endangered species. A key question
is whether he will be able to sustain that bipartisan approach in the
face of the Senate's narrow partisan division and the
administration's bent against compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has very good prospects of making the committee a
coherent, bipartisan, collaborative body to a degree that has not
been witnessed in decades," said Alton Frye, a veteran Washington
watcher at the Council on Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   When the 108th Congress convenes in January, Lugar's first order
of business will be to hold hearings on the future of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The former Rhodes scholar wants to make sure the administration
has carefully thought through the huge task of what it would take to
run a potentially hostile nation the size of France. He wants to
persuade the public that such a big commitment of American lives and
treasure is not being undertaken lightly. And he wants to engage a
detached Senate on the key foreign policy issues he sees as most
vital to U.S. security: Iraq, Afghanistan and the international
efforts to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan looms as a model of what can happen when an
administration that scorned U.S. involvement in "nation-building"
found itself forced to build a country out of rubble, Lugar said.</TE>
<TE>   "The military improvised brilliantly," he said. "Ever since, we've
been trying to figure out how that country can be a success, and who
else will help....The improvised quality of this situation is a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar plans to apply his newfound clout to the disarmament and
nonproliferation issues that have been his passion since he and
former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) launched the Nunn-Lugar program 11 years
ago that sought to destroy the Soviet nuclear arsenals made obsolete
by the end of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq is indeed an acute problem, but it is one proliferation
problem among many," Lugar said last fall. "We must pursue the
containment and elimination of weapons of mass destruction on a
global basis with the same intensity that has characterized our
debate on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar was tenacious on the need to liquidate weapons of mass
destruction for a decade before the Sept. 11 attacks made his views
seem mainstream. He named a lengthy agenda of items he is determined
to pursue, including making sure that Russian programs to destroy
chemical weapons succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "This man has stamina of extraordinary degree, and it helps him
prevail on a lot of issues," said Frye, who argued unsuccessfully
against NATO expansion while Lugar backed it.</TE>
<TE>   One question is whether Lugar will challenge the administration --
and to what effect.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, his record is rife with evidence of his willingness
to stand up to members of his own party. He defied President Reagan
on U.S. policy toward the Philippines and South Africa; he feuded
openly and repeatedly with Helms over issues from the United Nations
to foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Lugar contradicted President Bush's position on
North Korea, saying the U.S. should continue food aid and
negotiations with the Communist regime. Bush has refused to negotiate
until North Korea scraps its nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   But Lugar's career has also been pockmarked by failure. He ran for
president and Senate majority leader, but both campaigns flopped --
largely under the weight of a ponderous seriousness and lackluster
style, particularly on the stump. He lost a power struggle with Helms
that kept Lugar from the senior GOP position on Foreign Relations
until the North Carolinan retired this year. Lugar was once passed
over for the GOP vice presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, he and Biden were able to slightly narrow Bush's
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, but in the end
the president got most of the powers Lugar had sought to curtail.</TE>
<TE>   "He is always touted as having disagreements, but he rarely wins,"
said one conservative Republican who asked not to be named. "For a
guy who's as successful as he is at getting himself elected, I don't
think he's particularly astute" within the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar's career challenges the view that American politics has
deteriorated into all style and no substance. He is arguably one of
the most stilted speakers in the Senate. He can infuriate Republicans
back home when he shows up at a big political event -- and then
proceeds to give a dense speech on nuclear nonproliferation to an
audience that would rather talk tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a back-slapping, hail-fellow-well-met kind of guy," said
one foreign policy expert who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what endears Lugar to his allies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be very exciting," said Joseph Cirincione,
director of the nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee may not control any
purse strings, but it is hardly irrelevant on security issues
important to America. "Yeah, they've got clout. You control money,
you control nominations, you control treaties, and you control the
microphone," he said. "That's a lot of power in Washington."</TE>

<HD>Bush and Civil Rights: Words Matter, but Actions Talk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What exactly is President Bush trying to achieve on civil rights?</LD>
<LD>   Against the backdrop of the racial controversy that cost Trent
Lott (R-Miss.) his job as Senate majority leader, Bush's own
intentions have come under closer scrutiny. But the president has
sent such mixed signals that some critics believe he's playing a
double game -- moderate on decisions that can be traced directly to
him and much more conservative on judicial appointments that will
profoundly affect the reach of civil rights law, but only gradually
and far away from the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Bush drew praise even from his staunchest critics in the
traditional civil rights community for his strong condemnation of
Lott's wink toward segregation. Indeed, while the White House always
said publicly that Bush didn't want Lott to resign, the president's
sharp rebuke during a speech in Philadelphia probably did more to
doom the Mississippi senator than anything else that happened since
Lott's remarks at Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party Dec. 5.</LD>
<TE>   But since Bush's speech, the liberal civil rights community has
repeatedly insisted that the president's stirring words in defense of
equal opportunity needed to be measured against his actions. Just
minutes before Lott stepped down Friday, a coalition of civil rights
groups held a news conference in Washington to pound at that message.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives rightly argue that support for the agenda of the
liberal civil rights community isn't the only measure of commitment
to equal opportunity. But it's reasonable for the civil rights groups
to insist that a president's actions should always be weighed more
heavily than his words.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Bush has moved cautiously on the civil rights issues most
directly under his control. He has appointed conservatives to most
key civil rights positions, and liberals charge that the
administration isn't enforcing the laws as aggressively as Bill
Clinton did when he was president.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's record hasn't generated the intense conflict that
characterized the liberal response to the enforcement of the civil
rights laws under Ronald Reagan, and even Bush's father. William L.
Taylor, chairman of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, a
leading liberal group, says that Bush's record shows "a policy that
is largely inert, not moving forward, and in a few areas is
regressing." Considering the source, that's mild criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Bush moved to retrench the key federal programs that
promote affirmative action -- policies meant to expand opportunities
for minorities in hiring and government contracting. For years,
conservative thinkers have viewed these programs as unfair to whites
and counterproductive -- a group entitlement that exacerbates social
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has made no effort to repeal the executive order
requiring federal contractors to establish goals and timetables for
hiring women and minorities. Conservatives have long accused that
program, which affects fully one-fifth of all workers in America, of
encouraging quotas. Nor has the administration retrenched the
programs providing minorities preferences in federal contracting. In
all, Bush has done little to disturb the "mend it, don't end it"
balance on federal affirmative action programs that Clinton
established in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, even before Lott, the administration was hesitant about
joining a lawsuit opposing racial preferences in admissions at the
University of Michigan now heading toward the Supreme Court. After
Lott, officials say, it's even less likely that Bush will use the
suit to argue for a sweeping rollback of affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has had such a hands-off policy on these issues that
conservatives are starting to grumble. "Conservatives are going to be
very disappointed if two years from now there hasn't been any
positive movement," says Roger Clegg, general counsel of the Center
for Equal Opportunity, a conservative group.</TE>
<TE>   Clegg probably shouldn't hold his breath. While Bush has always
declared himself against quotas and preferences, he's never shown any
enthusiasm for direct combat on this front. His calculation seems to
be that conflict over affirmative action would eclipse efforts to
reach minority voters on other issues, such as education and
homeownership. "Once you enter this thing," one Bush political
advisor says, "it's hard to move the ball on anything else."</TE>
<TE>   But liberal groups take little comfort in Bush's cautious approach
to direct action. Their fear is that Bush is filling the federal
courts with conservative judges who will reshape the civil rights
laws in ways he wouldn't risk through executive or legislative
initiatives that carry his fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an unreasonable fear. Many of Bush's judicial nominees
have records on civil rights much more conservative than the views
Bush has expressed. Civil rights groups argue that Bush appellate
court nominees such as Carolyn Kuhl, Jeffrey Sutton and Charles W.
Pickering Sr. have displayed a determination to narrow the way civil
rights laws are enforced.</TE>
<TE>   All of these nominations will generate fireworks in the new year
(especially if Bush fulfills his promise to renominate Pickering,
whom the Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee rejected last year
largely around accusations of racial insensitivity). But this
conflict will really come to a head if Bush receives an opportunity
to nominate a Supreme Court justice.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big one," insists Ralph Neas, president of People for
the American Way, a liberal advocacy group. "If they get a firm
[conservative] Supreme Court majority, it will render the progressive
agenda moot for decades. This is the whole ballgame for them. That's
why they are willing to make compromises legislatively or in the
executive branch."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is under no obligation to support Neas' agenda on civil
rights. But voters have a right to demand accountability from elected
officials. If Bush wants to roll back affirmative action, it's hard
to explain his executive actions; if he doesn't, it's hard to explain
his court nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is sending dissonant signals, perhaps intentionally. But in
the end, it's his decisions on the courts that will speak loudest.
Words matter, but words fade. When he condemns Lott, Bush is writing
in sand. When he picks judges, he is carving in granite.</TE>

<HD>A Powerball Win Would Be a Dandy Gift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Somewhere in a Christmas stocking or holiday card could be a lottery
ticket worth nearly $300 million.</LD>
<LD>   The multistate Powerball lottery drawing is on Christmas, and with
no winner Saturday, the prize is rising to what is expected to be its
third-largest jackpot and largest Christmas jackpot since it started
in 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Figuring deductions for a lump-sum cash option and taxes, a single
winner would receive about $92 million -- enough to buy about 4.6
million Rapunzel Barbie dolls.</LD>
<TE>   The jackpot amounts are driven by ticket sales, so it's impossible
to predict exactly how much the jackpot will be by Christmas, said
Nebraska Lottery spokesman Brian Rockey. But from Wednesday to
Saturday, the pot grew by $54.5 million to $217.8 million -- nearly
$3 million more than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "It would certainly make for a jolly Christmas," Rockey said.
"Usually during the holidays, we see sort of a drop-off in sales
because people are off their normal routines."</TE>
<TE>   But this holiday season, the chance at millions and a flood of ad
campaigns in several states could boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska lottery officials are promising buyers a complimentary
holiday card and envelope if they spend $10 or more on tickets. In
Pennsylvania, which joined Powerball in June, holiday-themed
television commercials with singer Ray Charles promote the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   The highest Powerball jackpot was $295.7 million, won July 29,
1998, by group in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   If a winning ticket is drawn Dec. 25, it would not be the first
Christmas jackpot. In 1996, Hugh and Janice Robinson of Hailey,
Idaho, were the winners of a $48.3-million Powerball jackpot drawn on
Christmas Day.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM RENO</KH>
<HD>'Biggest Little City' Strives for Rebirth</HD>
<DH>Facing a downtown in decline and competition from other
gambling locales, civic leaders hope to lure tourists with diverse
attractions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>In its heyday, downtown Reno reveled in its gamblers, entertainers
and divorcees, a fun town for the world. Now it's worried that the
world is passing it by.</LD>
<LD>   Its plight is seen in shuttered downtown buildings, tired souvenir
stores and pawnshops and decades-old casinos that pale by comparison
to Las Vegas' themed mega-resorts. Tourists, most of them retirees
arriving on chartered bus junkets, uncomfortably brush up against the
homeless and complain that even the freshest of downtown casinos
don't offer the opulent amenities found elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been wandering around looking for things to do, and we may
not come back for a long while," said Vagn Sorensen, a retired
builder vacationing from Victoria, Canada. "We're here for five days.
Turns out that's too long."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, downtown Reno has been in steady decline for years, and
civic leaders have decided it needs a makeover to keep tourists
coming. "The city was too complacent for too many years," said Chris
Exline, an urban planning professor at the University of Nevada at
Reno. "It's waking up."</TE>
<TE>   Because it can no longer compete with the more glamorous gambling
cities, Reno, with a population of about 190,000, wants to diversify
to attract a steady stream of niche audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The fixes: an inviting pedestrian promenade along the Truckee
River as it gurgles through downtown, an emerging neighborhood of
riverfront art galleries, plans for a $115-million special events
center for conventions, boxing matches and concerts, and the lowering
into a trench -- at a cost of $234 million -- of an aggravating set
of railroad tracks that runs through downtown's streets, the crawling
trains blowing their whistles at every intersection and bringing
traffic to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   The old Reno needed little such help in attracting tourists.</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of the 20th century, tens of thousands of
visitors came to Reno for its quickie divorces, capitalizing on easy
residency requirements. But as more states liberalized their laws,
Reno lost its distinction as the country's divorce capital.</TE>
<TE>   Even more people came for the gambling, which was initially banned
here, then restored in 1931. Long before Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel
began pulling celebrities to his Las Vegas casino, Reno reigned as
the nation's undisputed gambling capital. Today it is dwarfed by Las
Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., and faces competition even from
casinos in suburban Reno and nearby Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   The latest attack on downtown's gambling economy comes from the
bright new American Indian casinos around Sacramento. Reno's gambling
revenue dropped more than 6% last year, as more Californians --
Reno's biggest market -- stayed closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Regional tourism officials are promoting non-gambling attractions
such as the Basque festival, rodeo, Hot August Nights classic car
show, Great Reno Balloon Race, National Championship Air Races, a
national chili cook-off and summertime arts festivals. But many of
those tourists avoid downtown.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope redevelopment will lure those visitors
downtown, along with locals. The new convention center will replace a
$52-million bowling stadium that stands eerily quiet most of the
time, and the river walk, similar to San Antonio's popular riverfront
district, is attracting strollers and lunchtime brown-baggers
enjoying the sights.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be difficult [to redevelop downtown], but if we sit on
our duff, Indian gaming will kill us," said Mayor Bob Cashell, a
veteran casino executive who specializes in saving struggling
casinos. "We've got to make our downtown more inviting."</TE>
<TE>   Downtown's plight was evident in the fate of the historic Mapes
Hotel, which opened in 1947 as Nevada's first hotel featuring a
casino, entertainment and dining. During the 1950s and '60s, it
hosted the likes of Mae West, the Marx Brothers, Sammy Davis Jr. and
Tony Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   The city bought the aging riverfront hotel in 1996 but, unable to
find a partner to renovate it, razed it three years ago. An outdoor
ice skating rink stands in its place today, not so much because the
city couldn't find a better use, but to give another reason -- along
with a new movie theater complex -- for suburbanites to eschew malls
for downtown.</TE>
<TE>   A block away, a developer plans to build a riverfront condominium
complex, and the city purchased a bank building to serve as a new
City Hall to flood downtown with more midweek diners and shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen small art retailers and coffeehouses have opened
alongside the river, and the empty Riverside hotel-casino has been
converted into apartments for working artists.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Bobay was so buoyed by the success of her 700-square-foot art
gallery, which she opened two years ago, that she launched her much
larger River Gallery in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, the city was fractured in its direction and
priorities," Bobay said.</TE>
<TE>   "And casino executives were busy fighting for their own lives. But
now everyone seems to be getting on board. We realize we depend on
one another to provide downtown diversity, because we share customers
who want to do something besides gamble."</TE>
<TE>   Casino executives agree. Phil Satre, chairman of Harrah's
Entertainment Inc., said casinos were too busy competing against one
another to worry about downtown's overall economic health.</TE>
<TE>   But with the nationwide spread of gambling, "we're in a squeeze
play," Satre said. "We need to work on a broader vision to build a
downtown that is brighter and more attractive to a different kind of
visitor."</TE>
<TE>   Kelli Nicolato had enough faith in downtown's resurrection that
she quit her job as a personal fitness trainer to open La Bussola,
where she sells works of 30 local artists, from wall hangings to
handbags.</TE>
<TE>   She and other store owners sponsor monthly "wine walks" where
customers buy a $5 etched wine glass and meander from one store to
another, sipping as they shop. "The response from locals to the
promotion was, 'Oh my, I had no idea you were even down here.' "</TE>
<TE>   The new downtown, Nicolato said, will prove popular to locals and
tourists alike.</TE>
<TE>   "Reno used to be all about gambling, but it can't be anymore," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People should come now for the art, the food, the scenery. The
best thing that ever happened to Reno was the threat of Indian
gaming."</TE>

<HD>Nerve Gas Might Have Long-Term Effects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Low levels of sarin nerve gas affected behavior and organ functions
in laboratory animals at least a month after exposure, suggests new
research that may provide clues to the mysterious illnesses of
Persian Gulf War veterans.</LD>
<LD>   In separate Army-sponsored studies, scientists observed behavioral
problems, brain changes and immune system suppression in the animals
many days after exposure to doses that caused no immediate effects,
such as convulsions or pupil constriction.</LD>
<LD>   Both studies involved rodents, and "that's a big leap to human
beings," said Melinda Roberson, a behavioral neuroscientist involved
in a study still underway.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, the studies provide new data in an area where a lack of
research has made it impossible to conclude whether the illnesses of
Gulf War veterans are linked to low-level sarin gas exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "They are pushing back the frontiers of biological effects of low
levels of sarin. The evidence is building," said Dr. Francis
O'Donnell, a medical consultant for the Defense Department who helps
track research into Gulf War illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans of the 1991 war have suffered from various illnesses they
believe are linked to their service in the gulf. Symptoms include
chronic fatigue, diarrhea, migraines, dizziness, memory problems,
loss of muscle control and loss of balance.</TE>
<TE>   Most scientists have blamed stress. Some veterans attribute the
health problems to toxic substances they encountered in the gulf,
including sarin, a toxic chemical weapon that is lethal at high
levels. Others suggest it may be a combination of the factors.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has identified about 130,000 troops it believes were
exposed to low levels of sarin in 1991 when U.S. forces destroyed a
weapons depot at Khamisiyah in southern Iraq. Some veterans believe
other sarin exposures occurred.</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, the Pentagon tells veterans that "current medical
evidence indicates that long-term health problems are not likely."</TE>

<HD>Christmas Gift Will Protect Views of Smokies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>More than 700 acres bordering Great Smoky Mountains National Park
will remain natural and undeveloped thanks to a Christmas gift from
the land's owners.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Alexander, Tennessee's Republican senator-elect and a former
governor, and several of his neighbors are giving away millions of
dollars in development rights to preserve the forested tract.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been acquiring this land for 25 years in order to protect
this scenic view of the Smokies and to create a buffer zone to
protect the park," Alexander said. "We hope others will want to do
the same."</LD>
<TE>   The gift, announced Sunday, is the largest private donation of its
kind, both in size and value, in Tennessee, said Randy Brown,
executive director of the Foothills Land Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The conservation easement covers 769 acres between Foothills
Parkway and the park's southwestern edge, about 30 miles south of
Knoxville. It will provide a development buffer as much as two miles
wide along two miles of the park's 70-mile Tennessee border.</TE>
<TE>   The Smokies range over a half-million acres in Tennessee and North
Carolina. It is the country's most visited national park, with nearly
10 million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   The property will continue to be owned by Alexander and his
associates, but the right to subdivide it will be transferred to the
Foothills Land Conservancy and the Conservation Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the deal include Sandy Beall, founder of the Ruby
Tuesday restaurant chain.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothills Land Conservancy, which is devoted to preserving the
rural character of eastern Tennessee, has protected 13,350 acres
since its founding in 1985.</TE>

<HD>3 Whistle-Blowers Get Time Magazine Honors</HD>
<DH>It names women its 'Persons of the Year' for doing 'right
just by doing their jobs rightly.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Three female whistle-blowers -- an FBI agent who wrote a memo
blasting intelligence failures after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and two executives who exposed corporate corruption -- are Time
magazine's Persons of the Year for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   In its issue reaching newsstands today, Time said Coleen Rowley,
Cynthia Cooper and Sherron Watkins were selected "for believing --
really believing -- that the truth is one thing that must not be
moved off the books, and for stepping in to make sure that it
wasn't."</LD>
<LD>   Time's 2002 picks are unusual in that most people cited by the
magazine in the past have been well-known public figures. Last year's
selection was New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for his conduct in
the aftermath of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   "They were people who did right just by doing their jobs rightly
-- which means ferociously, with eyes open and with the bravery the
rest of us always hope we have and may never know if we do," Time
said of its 2002 choices.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, 48, was the FBI agent based in Minneapolis whose scathing
memorandum to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III in May said that
agency headquarters ignored her pleas in the weeks before the Sept.
11 attacks to aggressively investigate Zacarias Moussaoui, now
charged as an accomplice. In later Senate testimony, Rowley charged
that the FBI was plagued by "careerism" and bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary people do find themselves in those types of situations,
and certainly government employees do," Rowley said Sunday on ABC's
"This Week," where the three honorees appeared in a group interview.
"And it's going to be beneficial to everyone to bring out the
concerns earlier rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, 38, was an internal auditor at WorldCom who alerted the
telecommunications firm's board of directors to $3.8 billion in
accounting irregularities. A month later, WorldCom declared the
biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. Investigators have
since uncovered more than $9 billion in accounting fraud at WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, 43, was a vice president of Enron who warned company
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in 2001 that the firm could collapse as a
result of extensive false accounting. Enron also filed for
bankruptcy, and Watkins resigned last month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an amazing recognition.... It's still sinking in," Watkins
said Sunday. "It is mind-boggling and amazing, because we are just
ordinary average Americans."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier interview with Time, Rowley, Cooper and Watkins said
some colleagues now hate them for exposing the mistakes of their
bosses. "There is a price to be paid. There have been times that I
could not stop crying," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   The women symbolized a critical struggle in the U.S. to restore
trust in disgraced institutions, from business firms to the Roman
Catholic Church, Time managing editor Jim Kelly said.</TE>

<HD>The Wrong Message for Black Male Athletes</HD>
<DH>NCAA report buttresses view that many youths are encouraged
to neglect school for sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton and Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Malcolm Wooldridge grew big and quick, when he became a high
school football star, everyone said the same thing. Classmates and
teachers told him. So did people around his Florida hometown.</LD>
<LD>   You've got it made, they said. You'll get a college scholarship.</LD>
<LD>   The recruiters who came to watch him play only reinforced this
notion. Suddenly homework and grades seemed less important as the
6-foot-2, 300-pound teenager devoted himself to taking care of
business on the football field.</LD>
<TE>   "My mom would sit there and talk to me about school," he recalled.
"I was like, 'Yeah, right.' "</TE>
<TE>   For years, African American educators have worried that young
black men such as Wooldridge are especially prone to getting the
wrong idea, latching on to sports as the best -- if not only -- path
to college. Now, these experts say, a recent report from the National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. lends credence to their suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Ten percent of black males enrolled as undergraduates at the
nation's largest universities were identified as scholarship
athletes. That percentage was at least four times greater than for
any other ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   And statistics show that young black men, having played their way
onto campus, are more likely to struggle in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Not that educators want to throw sports out with the bathwater.
They still see athletics as a way to get young men into college and
give them a chance to become good students.</TE>
<TE>   But they also see universities recruiting blacks as athletes
first. They see sports playing a disproportionate role and question
the influence of parents, culture and the earliest years of
schooling.</TE>
<TE>   Genethia Hudley Hayes, a Los Angeles Unified School District board
member, said black teens are encouraged to develop their athletic
skills but are rarely challenged academically, often placed in the
easiest classes possible. "We're not preparing them to be admitted or
compete [in college]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wooldridge's parents feared as much. They tried to counteract the
adulation from all around, pleading with him to strike a balance
between athletics and academics. But, as he recalled, "you don't
listen until something bad happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Shame'</TE>
<TE>   With college football in its bowl season -- an annual gala of
marching bands, brightly painted fields and nationally televised
games -- the NCAA has touted its annual report as evidence of an
overall rise in graduation rates among student-athletes in the
nation's 324 largest (classified as Division I) schools.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are gleaned from statistics colleges supply each year
to the U.S. Department of Education. But a close examination reveals
a less-than-encouraging story for black males.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000-01 academic year, black males numbered only 122,854
out of 3 million, about 4%, of the overall student body at Division I
universities. White males, by comparison, numbered more than a
million, or about 33%.</TE>
<TE>   In athletics, the 10% participation for black males was
significantly higher than rates for white (2.3%), Hispanic (1.5% of
81,950) and Asian (0.6% of 102,658) males. The rate for black females
was 2.3%, roughly the same as the overall percentage.</TE>
<TE>   The situation at the two major local universities was even more
lopsided. At USC, there were 337 black males in a student population
of 15,057 (2.2%). At UCLA, the number was 370 of 23,873 (1.5%). At
both schools, almost 16% of black males participated in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Intercollegiate athletics are an important part of college life,
"so participation is terrific," said Michael Nettles, an education
professor at the University of Michigan. But he considers the
statistical imbalance worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   Professor John H. Stanfield II, chairman of African American and
African Diaspora Studies at Indiana University, has another term for
it: "a shame."</TE>
<TE>   Stanfield believes the African American community tells girls:
"Take care of yourself, get as much education as you can, become
professionally independent." He said boys get a different message.
"The notion that sports is the only meal ticket is what parents tell
kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case with Wooldridge.</TE>
<TE>   His parents grew concerned when his name appeared in the newspaper
and people recognized him in restaurants because of his football
exploits. Even Wooldridge suspected he was receiving passing grades
for minimal work. "Man, the teachers bent over backward to keep you
on the field," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he graduated from Olympic Heights High in Boca Raton as a
prized recruit, but his standardized test scores were not high enough
to satisfy NCAA requirements. Instead of going to college, he
enrolled in a military academy for what amounted to a fifth year of
high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes culture will send you explicit messages and subtle
messages," mused his father, David, who played football at Murray
State University in Kentucky. "Malcolm had some decisions to make."</TE>
<TE>   A year at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia got Wooldridge his
qualifying scores but did little to change his attitude.</TE>
<TE>   He is a massive young man with a smile to match, articulate and
pleasant. After he enrolled at USC in the fall of 2000, he and
several teammates came to the aid of a female student who fell from
her dorm room window and was impaled on a fence.</TE>
<TE>   But he often coasted in practice, his coaches complained, and he
could be seen running extra laps as punishment for skipping classes.
"I still thought I'd get grades just because I played football," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Opportunity Wasted</TE>
<TE>   Wooldridge was about to join another statistical group that
troubles educators -- young men who reach college on athletic
scholarships but fail in class.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 58% of students at Division I schools graduate in six
years. The NCAA was touting its recent survey because
student-athletes now graduate at a rate of 60%.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to black male athletes, that rate drops to 43%.
In football and basketball -- where the great majority of black males
play -- the numbers are 45% and 35%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only are poor black children failing," Stanfield said, "even
middle-class blacks are failing."</TE>
<TE>   Like the professor, USC cornerback Darrell Rideaux suspects the
problem might begin in homes where parents have no college
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about sports because they know sports," the Long Beach
native said. "When it comes to academics, those parents might be
uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Educators grumble that many young players display effort and
discipline on the field, but do not transfer these qualities to the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   There is also an issue of culture. Experts such as Stanfield
wonder whether the glorification of sport -- which crosses boundaries
of color -- is especially prevalent among blacks. Hudley Hayes
suspects black men underachieve because society expects less of them
in school.</TE>
<TE>   Stanfield places some blame on universities. He sees a lack of
"academic programs to attract black males and retain them."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, for example, recruits at local high schools that are
underrepresented in its student body but "we do not target any
specific students because of race or ethnicity," said Vu Tran,
director of undergraduate admissions.</TE>
<TE>   From his perspective, Wooldridge sensed a problem but -- like the
experts -- stumbled for an answer. "The white players were totally
different," he said. "For some reason they did better in school. I
don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   His father has also wrestled with the issue. He has concluded that
if anyone should be blamed, it is the young men who squander their
opportunities for a college education. Young men such as his son.</TE>
<TE>   White kids on Malcolm's high school teams "went through the same
thing," David Wooldridge said. "They were treated special by
teachers, other students, by people in the community. This issue has
nothing to do with how kids are treated, it has to do with kids not
having their priorities straight."</TE>
<TE>   That is why many educators still consider sports a valuable
resource. They believe young men drawn to college solely by athletics
can eventually become good students. Teenagers from low-income
families might have no better chance to attend an expensive
university.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't tell someone not to go out for the team," said Ronald
Ferguson, an economist who studies education at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University. "Those guys deserve to be
on the team."</TE>
<TE>   Local athletes such as UCLA tight end Marcedes Lewis and USC
middle linebacker Mike Pollard consider themselves examples. If not
for his football scholarship, Pollard figures he would be living with
his parents and might not be in school.</TE>
<TE>   The senior, majoring in international relations, said: "As long as
you end up getting your degree, it doesn't matter how you got to
college."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Lesson Learned</TE>
<TE>   Still, educators fret over the numbers. If sports play a
disproportionate role in the lives of young black men, athletes are
not the only ones who suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It tends to make black males who are not athletically inclined
assume they have no options," Stanfield said. "It's telling them they
can't be thinkers or intellectual."</TE>
<TE>   Kellen Winslow knows all about the message that resonates through
the African American community. He was a standout tight end at the
University of Missouri and in the NFL for many years. His son, Kellen
Jr., plays for the University of Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tendency for people to be drawn to an industry ...
because they have role models in that industry," he said. "There are
not enough [black] role models in medicine, law, politics, on and on.
In sports, kids understand success is carrying a football or
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   While his son was in high school and being courted by numerous
universities, the elder Winslow made a point of asking recruiters
about academics on their campuses and reminding Kellen Jr. "you have
to do something besides play sports."</TE>
<TE>   Parents can play a key role in addressing the concerns raised by
the recent NCAA statistics, experts say. Church and community groups
can also help stress the importance of academics.</TE>
<TE>   "The black community has to stand up and say this portrayal of us
is not who we are as a people," Hudley Hayes said. "We have to be
willing to reach out."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Lewis, the UCLA tight end. Some of his former teammates
can only watch from the sideline these days, because they did not
qualify academically.</TE>
<TE>   "They paid the price," he said. "They're sitting at home."</TE>
<TE>   That's where Wooldridge is.</TE>
<TE>   His grades at USC were low enough that he and his coaches agreed
he should leave school last winter. While the Trojans enjoy one of
their best seasons in decades -- they face Iowa in the Orange Bowl on
Jan. 2 -- he is finishing the fall semester at Harper College in
Palatine, Ill., near his family's new home.</TE>
<TE>   The adulation has not gone away. Recruiters are knocking on his
door because he was a junior college All-American this season. But
his grades have improved because he no longer expects preferential
treatment. The 22-year-old says he will approach university life with
a different attitude this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking a lot more about academics, not just football," he
said. "I've learned my lesson."</TE>

<CX>   Black athletes -- The percentages in a graphic in Section A on Monday
on black male athletes were correct, but the lines corresponding to
the percentages pointed to the wrong segments in the pie charts
shown. As the chart stated, the percentage of black male students
enrolled in NCAA Division I schools who receive some sort of athletic
scholarship is 9.95%. At UCLA, that figure is 15.68%; at USC, 15.73%.</CX>

<HD>Schottenheimer Has the Blues in Kansas City</HD>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>When it comes to word association, "Marty Schottenheimer" and "Kansas
City" usually produce "disappointing endings." Sunday was no
different.</LD>
<LD>   Schottenheimer took his San Diego Chargers to Kansas City, back to
the city where he coached from 1989-1998. It was a 10-season run that
consisted mostly of winning football and sellout crowds, but will be
remembered for sour aftertastes: a 3-7 record in the playoffs,
including two seasons when they couldn't convert 13-3 regular-season
records into a playoff victory.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, he lost to a team without the top offensive weapon in the
league, on a field goal kicked by a guy who hadn't put one through a
pair of NFL uprights in two years.</LD>
<TE>   The last bit of ignominy came courtesy of Michael Husted, a late
replacement for the injured Morten Andersen. Husted drove home a
38-yard field goal with 1:08 remaining to provide the winning margin
in Kansas City's 24-22 victory at Arrowhead Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kansas City and San Diego have 8-7 records and faint playoff
hopes, which the Chiefs prolonged and the Chargers practically
wasted. Victories in its final two games would have assured San Diego
a berth.</TE>
<TE>   This was like a playoff game in that the Chargers had to win to
avoid needing everything short of divine intervention to qualify for
the postseason. And it was like a playoff game in that Schottenheimer
cranked up his intensity beyond rational and into the realm of
pressing too hard. When you want to win that badly you sometimes do
things that don't make sense -- such as calling for replay to
challenge the placement of the football.</TE>
<TE>   With the Chiefs trailing by a point and driving in San Diego
territory, Kansas City running back Mike Cloud carried the ball just
beyond the first-down marker at the Charger 36 on fourth and one.
Schottenheimer tossed out his red flag, the officials reviewed the
play and concluded there was not indisputable evidence that the spot
was wrong. Is there ever?</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Schottenheimer sounded ready to blame the TV producers.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem they're having is they're not getting the looks out
of television that they need," he said. "That certainly was one that
we had to challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Losing cost the Chargers their third timeout. So after Husted (a
guy who has been cut twice this year, including once by the Chiefs
three games into the season) kicked the go-ahead field goal, the
Chargers had to move into field-goal range from their 35 with 1:01
remaining and no timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   On the Chargers' third play, quarterback Drew Brees found Reche
Caldwell over the middle, but Caldwell fumbled and Shaunard Harts
recovered to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "To be so close and for something like that to happen, it rips
your heart out," Brees said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it shouldn't have been so close in the first place. The
Chiefs came in with the last-ranked defense in the league. Running
back Priest Holmes, who has scored 24 touchdowns this season and
accounted for more than 40% of the team's yardage -- was sidelined
because of a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   As Charger linebacker Donnie Edwards said, "It's very
disappointing, because we had a great opportunity ... these
opportunities in the NFL don't come along that often. When you get
that opportunity you have to go after it, and we failed to achieve
it."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dick Vermeil seemed to have his team better prepared for the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs moved down the field on their second possession and
scored on an eight-yard pass from Trent Green to Marc Boerigter.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City forced San Diego into third-and-long situations
throughout the first half, one reason the Chargers converted only two
of 12 third downs. They had only two field goals to show for their
first three trips inside the Kansas City 35.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Chiefs put together an 88-yard drive, capped by a
six-yard pass from Green to Omar Easy out of the backfield. That was
the only easy thing about it; the drive took 13 plays and 6:45.</TE>
<TE>   The real easy way came in the third quarter. The whole field in
one play. After a Darren Bennett punt pinned the Chiefs on their two,
a false start penalty moved the ball half the distance to the goal
line.</TE>
<TE>   No problem. Green lofted a pass over defensive back Rogers Beckett
to Boerigter, who outraced Beckett to the end zone for the ninth
99-yard touchdown in NFL history and the Chiefs led, 21-6.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Chargers came to life, scoring two touchdowns and a field
goal in about 11 1/2 minutes. (A two-point conversion on their first
touchdown failed.)</TE>
<TE>   But they couldn't finish off the Chiefs, not even when they had
them pinned on their three-yard line with 5:23 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we aren't fine-tuned the way we need to be fine-tuned
to make these plays that I talk about all the time," Schottenheimer
said.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to blowing the big ones, Schottenheimer was in
peak form.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 24, CHICAGO 14</KH>
<HD>Panthers Are Untaunted at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Booed off their own field a year ago, the Carolina Panthers made
winning back their fans a priority in their slow rebuilding process.</LD>
<LD>   They made a small stride Sunday with a 24-14 victory over the
Chicago Bears to finish the season .500 at Ericsson Stadium -- where
they were winless last season and were humiliated in their final
game.</LD>
<LD>   "When you are trying to build something, [winning at home] was
real big for us," said first-year Coach John Fox. "Our fans have been
patient to say the least. We are making strides and building some
type of momentum."</LD>
<TE>   The win proved how far the Panthers (6-9) have come under Fox, who
inherited a team that set an NFL record with 15 consecutive losses in
a season and closed the 2001 season by being blown out at home, 38-6,
by the New England Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd that day was dominated by Patriot fans and the few
Carolina supporters in attendance showered the Panthers with jeers
and taunts that were heard loud and clear by management.</TE>
<TE>   So Fox spent most of the week stressing to the Panthers that they
had to win their home finale for the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans have been through so much the past few years with us and
they deserve to see us play well and to see us win," tight end Wesley
Walls said.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers got two touchdown runs from Dee Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears (4-11) lost their seventh consecutive road game.</TE>

<HD>At Least One Rave Review for T.O.'s Show</HD>

<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrell Owens elicits emotions from friend and foe alike for his
brand of celebration, be it spiking the ball on the Dallas Cowboys'
midfield star, pulling out a Sharpie or grabbing a cheerleader's
pompoms. Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News on the San
Francisco 49er receiver:</LD>
<LD>   "What next, pulling a live mike from his sock and performing an
upcoming rap release called 'Another Cornerback, T.O.A.'? Or
summoning 'Up With People' from a stadium tunnel for a halftime-style
extravaganza titled 'Me!'?</LD>
<LD>   "I'll admit I've gotten a kick out of Owens' premeditated
celebrations. Millions have. Owens is as amazed by the national
reaction as many fans are by his line-crossing audacity. The more we
gape, the bolder he gets."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: What are the last two NCAA Division I men's
basketball teams to be undefeated through a regular season?</TE>
<TE>   Say what? On a recent "Best Damn Sports Show Period," Michael
Irvin was lauding Desmond Howard for being "the only man on the
planet" to win both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP.
Apparently, Jim Plunkett and Marcus Allen were in orbit aboard the
international space station that day.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1951, Norm Van Brocklin's 73-yard
touchdown pass play to Tom Fears in the fourth quarter gave the Los
Angeles Rams a 24-17 victory over the Cleveland Browns for the NFL
title.</TE>
<TE>   From Phoenix to Philly? Pedro Gomez of the Arizona Republic has an
inkling that Arizona Diamondback starter Curt Schilling covets a
return to the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   "He hears how [Philadelphia] management wants a veteran No. 1
starter to anchor the staff and mentor the younger pitchers. And
that's a role he'll never have in Phoenix," Gomez wrote. "It's fairly
well known throughout the Diamondback clubhouse that Schilling is
bothered to no end that he has had the two greatest seasons of his
career and still hasn't been able to unseat [Randy] Johnson as the
staff's ace.</TE>
<TE>   "Schilling, always the manipulator, has worked this angle before.
He belly-ached his way out of Philadelphia in 2000 and wound up
exactly where he wanted, with the Diamondbacks and with a chance to
win the World Series. He knows what to say to whom and how to act
when he wants things a certain way, which could turn this into a
drawn-out soap opera."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Indiana State, which went 29-0 in 1979, and Nevada
Las Vegas, which was 30-0 in 1991. Both schools, though, lost in the
Final Four. The Larry Bird-led Sycamores fell to Magic Johnson and
Michigan State, 75-64, in the championship game; the defending
champion Rebels were upset in the semifinals by Duke, 79-77.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ron Kantowski of the Las Vegas Sun on David slaying
Goliath in college basketball: "The Big Sky fell on the Pac-10 this
week. In what had to be the biggest news to hit Big Sky Country since
Mark Fuhrman of the LAPD ran away to his own private Idaho, Montana
beat No. 17 Stanford 70-68 at Maples Pavilion ... followed ... by
Northern Arizona's equally stunning 67-63 victory over UCLA at Pauley
Pavilion. All I know is I wouldn't want to be playing Eastern
Washington in a pavilion."</TE>

<HD>Oregon Capitalizes to Beat Minnesota</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fifth-ranked Oregon Ducks took advantage of their opportunities
even though they weren't at their best.</LD>
<LD>   Ian Crosswhite scored 18 points and Luke Ridnour had 15 points,
five rebounds and five assists to lead the Ducks to a 90-81 victory
over No. 25 Minnesota on Sunday at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon capitalized on first-half foul trouble for Gopher star Rick
Rickert. The Ducks went on an 18-3 run -- including 14-0 at one point
-- to take the lead for good with Rickert on the bench with three
fouls.</LD>
<TE>   "We were a very tired basketball team," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent
said. "This team needed to let its character rise up and show through
the adversity."</TE>
<TE>   Luke Jackson had 10 points, seven rebounds and five assists for
the Ducks (8-1), who won their 22nd consecutive home game, one off
the school record set from 1937 to '39. The streak is the
fifth-longest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to this game was the team effort," Crosswhite said. "We
stuck together, even when it was getting tough. I just go out and do
whatever I can to help."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Esselink led the Gophers (6-2) with 18 points, all on
three-point baskets. Jerry Holman had 17 points and Rickert, who had
a career-high 28 points last year against Oregon, scored eight points
in 16 minutes before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're on the road against a team of this caliber, you've
got to take some chances," said Minnesota Coach Don Monson, who
formerly coached Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   McArthur Court was sold out for a nonconference game for the first
time since Notre Dame visited in 1984. The Gophers are the first
ranked nonconference opponent to appear in Eugene since 1996, when
then-No. 13 Fresno State was upset, 87-75.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Notre Dame 93, Canisius 75 -- Matt Carroll scored 25 points
on 10-for-12 shooting and Dan Miller had a career-high 23 points for
the Irish (10-1), who defeated the Golden Griffins (5-4) at South
Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame shot 57% from the field and made 12 of 26 three-point
shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish (10-1) are off to their best start since going 12-1 to
start the 1978-79 season, when they were ranked No. 1 for a month.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Texas 57, Princeton 54 -- Chris Ogden made the go-ahead
three-pointer and T.J. Ford made four free throws in the last 21
seconds to help the Longhorns (7-2) hold off the Tigers (3-5) at
Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Ogden swished his only basket from deep in the right corner to put
Texas up, 51-48, with 3:57 left.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Mouton led Texas with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 North Carolina 69, Florida State 48 -- Jawad Williams
scored 10 of his 16 points in the second half at Tallahassee, Fla.,
to help the Tar Heels (7-2) defeat the Seminoles (6-2) in their
Atlantic Coast Conference opener.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina started the second half with a 9-2 run to go up,
39-32. The Tar Heels went ahead, 54-38, with 11:24 left and held
their largest lead, 69-44, in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Pickett led Florida State with 15 points and 11 rebounds, but
he was one for 10 from three-point range. The Seminoles were one for
16.</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Connecticut 82, St. Joseph's 48 -- Diana Taurasi and
freshman Barbara Turner scored 17 points apiece for the Huskies (9-0)
in a victory over the Hawks (3-5) at Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Vanderbilt 101, Tennessee Martin 77 -- Ashley McElhiney
nearly had a double-double by halftime and finished with 15 points
and 13 assists to help the visiting Commodores (7-1) past the
Skyhawks (3-6).</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Minnesota 69, Northern Iowa 62 -- Lindsay Whalen scored 27
points for the Gophers (9-0) in a win over the Panthers (4-4) at
Cedar Falls, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   DePaul 64, No. 21 George Washington 46 -- Khara Smith had 13
points and 10 rebounds as the Blue Demons (9-3) upset the Colonials
(4-3) at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Arizona 101, Nevada Las Vegas 73 -- Dee-Dee Wheeler scored
19 points, Shawntinice Polk had 18 points and 17 rebounds and the
Wildcats (6-2) beat the Rebels (6-3) at Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Backups Answer the Call</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A handful of former backups and a kickoff specialist helped the
Kansas City Chiefs pull out a last-minute victory.</LD>
<LD>   Four key players in the Chiefs' 24-22 victory over the San Diego
Chargers on Sunday were backups two weeks ago. Two made their first
starts Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   And the final hero hadn't kicked a field goal in more than two
years.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Husted, a kickoff specialist who became Kansas City's
kicker a few days earlier when Morten Andersen went out with a
nagging knee injury, made a 38-yard field goal with 1:08 left to lift
Kansas City (8-7).</TE>
<TE>   The field goal was Husted's first since Oct. 7, 2000, when he was
with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is not to have too much going on in your mind," Husted
said. "That's when the preparation of the night before, the week
before -- in my case, the year and a half before -- comes into play."</TE>
<TE>   Playing without all-pro running back Priest Holmes, the Chiefs
clinched their first non-losing season in three years and handed San
Diego its third consecutive loss. The Chargers, in their first season
under Marty Schottenheimer, fell to 8-7 after starting 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that right now we aren't playing well enough
to win," said Schottenheimer, whose 10-year tenure in Kansas City
ended with his resignation after the 1998 season. "That's an obvious
statement."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Chiefs' scoring drives, including the game-winner,
started at or inside their three-yard line. The first time, Trent
Green passed to Marc Boerigter -- who became a starter two weeks ago
-- for a 99-yard touchdown that tied the NFL record for longest
completion.</TE>

<LD>Starting today, the Clippers have five days to rest, relax and
recover from an injury-filled first 28 games. They are scheduled to
practice today, Tuesday and Thursday before facing the Suns on Friday
at Phoenix, although they may not have enough healthy bodies to
scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to be able to do much at all," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "We're not going to have training camp-type practices. We'll
shore up some things mentally."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry hopes to soon have Elton Brand and Eric Piatkowski back
from calf and abdominal strains and believes Quentin Richardson, who
sprained his left ankle last week, will be sound.</LD>
<TE>   What's more, Lamar Odom is scheduled to return Saturday against
the Golden State Warriors, ending an 11-month layoff because of wrist
and ankle sprains. Odom said last week he thought he could play
Friday, but is expected to say today that his return will be
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get those guys back, we have to incorporate them back into
the team again," Gentry said of getting his starting lineup healthy
again by the weekend. "I just want us to get healthy so we can have
some kind of consistent rotation."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers haven't looked like themselves recently, with
Tremaine Fowlkes and rookie Chris Wilcox starting at the forward
spots and Marko Jaric filling in at point guard, shooting guard and
small forward.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's victory over Denver, Fowlkes scored a career-best 16
points in 46 minutes and Jaric had 22 points, six steals, three
rebounds and two assists in 43 minutes.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks may not have a group of well-known defensemen but
when it comes to getting the job done on both ends of the ice, their
blue-liners are not taking a backseat to anyone this season.</LD>
<LD>   Not only are they shutting down offenses, the Duck defensemen are
scoring. Led by Niclas Havelid's two goals, they accounted for three
points in Anaheim's 4-0 victory over Phoenix on Sunday night at the
Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   "[Keith Carney is] generating offense for us; Havelid is
generating offense for us; [Pavel] Trnka, in his few number of games,
is generating offense for us; and [Ruslan] Salei generates more goals
than he does offense. And Freddy [Olausson] is here to be the
offensive guy," said Duck Coach Mike Babcock, whose team is tied for
sixth in the league in goals allowed with 81.</LD>
<TE>   "You look at it that way, we're getting good defense and offense
from our D. That's the idea, everyone plays offense and everyone
plays defense."</TE>
<TE>   With more than a month to go before the NHL All-Star break, the
Ducks' defensemen have combined for 17 goals and 53 points, compared
to 23 and 101 all of last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively, we're playing well as a team," Carney said.
"Everyone is working hard and you have the puck a lot more than the
other teams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Mike Commodore, who was recalled from minor league
Cincinnati on Saturday, did not play.... Sunday's victory over
Phoenix was Anaheim's first against a Pacific Division opponent this

<HD>Duck Victory Is Home-Grown</HD>
<DH>Havelid scores twice as Anaheim dominates Phoenix, 4-0, for
sixth straight win at the Pond to set franchise record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Records continue to fall for the Mighty Ducks, who established a
franchise mark for consecutive home victories with a dominating 4-0
win over the Phoenix Coyotes on Sunday night at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks stretched their home winning streak to six and their
home unbeaten streak to nine (6-0-3), which equals the longest in the
NHL this season. Not bad for a team that began the season 3-4-1 at
home.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Niclas Havelid scored twice and goaltender
Jean-Sebastien Giguere earned his fifth shutout of the season and
13th of his career with 24 saves for the Ducks, who improved to five
games over .500 in front of an announced crowd of 12,267.</LD>
<TE>   "We moved the puck and we skated, which is something that we
haven't done since the first period against St. Louis [a 5-2 win on
Dec. 18]," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to see us get back and get rolling, and obviously, to
have a winning streak like we do at home right now ... is real
important."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also helped themselves with another strong power-play
effort. They scored twice in five man-advantage situations against
Phoenix. It gives the Ducks eight power-play goals in three games and
a power-play goal in seven consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked a lot about the power play because we know it's a
big part of the game," Havelid said. "Before we were more stagnant
and stayed in position, but now we're trying to roll around a little
bit more and shoot the puck."</TE>
<TE>   With key defensemen Keith Carney and Ruslan Salei back in the
lineup after sitting out Thursday's 5-4 loss to the Kings, the Ducks
were clicking early against the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Rugged winger Mike Brown, recalled from minor league Cincinnati on
Friday, scored his first NHL goal to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead 6:36
into the first period. Linemates Jason Krog and Dan Bylsma completed
two skillful passes to set up Brown, who beat Phoenix goaltender
Brian Boucher from outside the right post.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix, which entered with a three-game unbeaten streak and a
3-1-2 record in its last six games, had a chance to tie the score
minutes later only to have Giguere swat away a short-handed breakaway
shot by Daymond Langkow.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a totally different game [if Langkow scored]," Babcock
said. "It's something that you don't think about [in a 4-0 win]."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks made the Coyotes pay with a power-play goal when Paul
Kariya snuck a pass through traffic to Matt Cullen, who scored his
sixth goal to give Anaheim a 2-0 lead at 9:54.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than three minutes later, the Ducks continued their dominant
first period with a goal from Havelid at 12:51. Cullen set up the
score with a nifty pass from the backboards after beating two Phoenix
players to the puck.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks did not score in the second against backup goalie Zac
Bierk, who replaced Boucher after Havelid's score, but they still
controlled play for the majority of the period.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, the Ducks added Havelid's second goal. On a Duck
power play, Havelid gathered in a cross-ice pass from center Steve
Rucchin before shooting in his seventh goal of the season at 4:01.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time we played Phoenix [a 2-2 tie Nov. 27], we let it
get away from us ... with two odd-man rushes down the stretch,"
Babcock said. "Tonight, we didn't give up anything down the stretch,
which was nice to see."</TE>

<LD>John Gagliardi picked up his office phone not long after his 114th
career defeat and sounded, well, defeated.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't like to take those losses," he said. "You've got to be
careful you don't analyze yourself into a depression."</LD>
<LD>   With stadium gates closed on his 50th season at St. John's
(Minn.), the old coach was going to need a little down time to
recover from the Johnnies' recent semifinal-round defeat in the
Division III playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   I was in Collegeville five years ago and could fairly imagine
Gagliardi sitting there in his office, shoes off, staring out the
window toward a melancholy winter -- how come the losses hurt more
than the wins feel good?</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi's 114th defeat, it has to be noted, came one week after
he recorded career win No. 400, against Linfield College of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   That victory left the 76-year-old Gagliardi eight shy of Eddie
Robinson's record total of 408, a milestone likely to be passed next
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on my health," Gagliardi said. "I'm not going to
retire, I'll tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed an odd twist that Gagliardi earned his 400th victory
just as ESPN started its 24/7 publicity blitz for "The Junction
Boys," the cable movie that chronicled the brutal 1954 Texas A&amp;M
football training camp led by first-year coach Paul "Bear" Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   It is now part of semi-fictionalized cinematic lore, the tall tale
of Bryant busing the Aggies west for 10 days of torture. The Junction
survivors, like war veterans, retell their stories in round-table
discussions -- although always mindful to absolve the beloved Bryant,
arguably the greatest college football coach.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of Gagliardi because, as he is poised to become
football's winningest coach, I knew he had spent a half century
debunking the boot-camp mentality shared by Bryant and other
contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi took over at St. John's in 1953, the year before Bryant
arrived at Texas A&amp;M, and watched, aghast, as coaches employed
hard-headed tactics to teach kids the tough lessons of football and,
if you believed the rationale, life.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way coaches thought it had to be done," Gagliardi
said. "There was no other way. That was a time when parents beat
their children and employers were tough on their employees. I don't
know, it was a different world."</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi could only change his small corner of it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, after his coach at Trinidad (Colo.) High was drafted into
World War II, the 16-year-old Gagliardi took over as player/coach.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing Gagliardi did was let his players drink water at
practice -- considered a sign of weakness.</TE>
<TE>   "I was living in a coal mining community and I saw the mules and I
said, 'Hell, they let those mules have water,' " he said. "The miners
knew you've got to let them have water or they die."</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi's novel approach to the game eventually evolved into a
system he called "Winning with Nos."</TE>
<TE>   At St. John's, there are no blocking sleds, no mandatory
weightlifting requirements, no whistles, no jumping jacks, no
tackling during practice, no spring practice, no practice if there
are too many gnats, no practices longer than 90 minutes, no calling
the coach "coach" and no training camp that remotely approaches
Junction.</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi's system produced three national titles, 34 consecutive
winning seasons, and not one player who jumped a fence at midnight to
escape football hell.</TE>
<TE>   "I always questioned a lot of things," Gagliardi said. "I never
believed everything. I always knew calisthenics did nothing. People
just thought it was impossible to function without those things."</TE>
<TE>   For years, people told him his tactics could never work at higher
levels of football.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why not," Gagliardi still argues. "We're not that
far removed from it. We're obviously not a Division I school but,
what the hell, we're not playing soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Former Minnesota Viking coach Bud Grant, a football neighbor for
years, subscribed to many of Gagliardi's ideas, but few others
strayed from football's meat-grinder blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Gagliardi said. "Probably because Vince Lombardi
and Bear Bryant, a lot of these guys were successful, but they might
have been successful the other way too. I think a lot of it was
because of the military. They were military guys and the military did
it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi is down after his most recent defeat, deflated but not
out. By the end of our conversation he was talking about a Johnnie
squad that next year returns five players on offense and seven on
defense.</TE>
<TE>   He looks forward to breaking Robinson's record but not to the
fanfare. He thinks his most impressive accomplishment is never having
been fired; others would look to Gagliardi's remarkable staying
power.</TE>
<TE>   Even the great Robinson lost his grip at Grambling near the end
and essentially was forced out, yet St. John's football, like its
coach, has aged gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   The Johnnies appeared in the Division III championship game two
years ago and advanced to the semifinals each of the last two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, St. John's has posted a record of 132-23-2. Florida
State has gone 137-23-1 in the same span.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of Bobby Bowden, Joe Paterno and myself as just hitting
our strides at age 70," Gagliardi joked.</TE>
<TE>   He says winning 400 football games has been as much about survival
as success.</TE>
<TE>   "Your health has got to stay pretty good," he said, "but you'd
better keep your great players healthy too."</TE>
<TE>   With the countdown to 408 on hold until next fall, Gagliardi stops
to reflect and replenish -- hydration is the key! -- before resuming
this most unconventional journey.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's all settled, and you have whatever you have, it's
pretty good," he said of his accomplishments. "But I've been one of
the few who ever won 300, and they haven't put up any statues of me,
so I don't know what this will do. I don't see my life changing. My
wife still expects me to take out the garbage. Nothing changes."</TE>
<TE>   Not true.</TE>
<TE>   At a small college in Minnesota, a long, long way from Junction,
everything changed.</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 36, DETROIT 15</KH>
<HD>Falcons Can't Take Giant Step to Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Falcons did all they could to clinch a playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Giants wouldn't cooperate.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Quentin McCord, Jay Feely and -- of course -- Michael Vick,
the Falcons moved a step closer to their first postseason berth since
1998 with a 36-15 victory over the woeful Detroit Lions on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Atlanta (9-5-1) was hoping to make the playoffs with a week to
spare, but the Giants (9-6) stayed alive with a 44-27 victory at
Indianapolis. Now, it comes down to the final weekend of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disappointing," said McCord, who had a career day with
seven catches for 182 yards and a touchdown. "We wanted to clinch it
this week, but it will be nice to clinch it next week."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons did move ahead of New Orleans (9-6) in the NFC
wild-card race after the Saints were shocked by Cincinnati</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta will be assured of getting in with a victory at Cleveland,
or if the Giants or Saints lose.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept our eyes on the scoreboard," Vick said. "We were hoping
the Giants would fall a little bit. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.
Now, we've got to take care of our business."</TE>
<TE>   McCord's big day boosted Vick to a career-high 338 yards passing,
even though the left-hander didn't look especially sharp much of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Vick completed 20 of 38 passes, including a 20-yard touchdown to
McCord and a late 44-yard scoring play to Brian Finneran that helped
Atlanta end a two-game losing streak.</TE>

<HD>Dockett Is Suspended for the Sugar Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida State defensive tackle Darnell Dockett was suspended for the
Sugar Bowl, the latest in a string of Seminoles punished this season.</LD>
<LD>   "He broke one of our rules and is suspended for this ballgame,"
Coach Bobby Bowden said Sunday. "He will not make the trip."</LD>
<LD>   Bowden wouldn't elaborate, but Dockett's lawyer, Stephen Dobson,
told the Tallahassee Democrat that police are investigating something
that happened at a store in Tallahassee's Governor's Square mall.</LD>
<TE>   Police Lt. Sandra Garber declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State already is without its top two quarterbacks for the
Sugar Bowl against Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Rix was suspended for missing a final exam, and Adrian
McPherson was kicked off the team after being accused of stealing a
check and is now being looked at in a gambling investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Dockett started all 13 games for Florida State and led the
defensive line in tackles with 58. He will be replaced by senior Tony
Benford in the Sugar Bowl, Bowden said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Brett Bell was suspended, and linebacker Broderick
Williams injured a knee, leaving Wisconsin without two key players
for the Alamo Bowl against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Barry Alvarez wouldn't specify why Bell, a sophomore, was
punished, saying only it was for "disciplinary reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a junior, was hurt in practice last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers left Sunday for San Antonio to get ready for the
Saturday game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Wesleyan (Conn.) University football players were arrested
after a foot chase with police and charged with robbing a Gap
clothing store at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Young Douglas, 21, the team's leading rusher, and Daniel Quinones,
20, a linebacker, were arrested shortly after the store was robbed
Friday night, police said. Police said $2,600 was taken from the
store.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sloshing through the snow in Idaho last year wasn't much fun for
Clemson center Tommy Sharpe, even though the Tigers beat Louisiana
Tech in the Humanitarian Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Southern boys," he said. "We don't like to go up in the
cold."</TE>
<TE>   He won't have that problem this year. Clemson (7-5) plays Texas
Tech (8-5) today in the Tangerine Bowl at Orlando, Fla., where the
forecast calls for a sunny sky and temperatures in the 70s.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers will have to contend with Kliff Kingsbury, the Red
Raider quarterback. Kingsbury led Division I-A with 4,642 yards
passing, and threw 42 touchdown passes while running Coach Mike
Leach's wide-open offense.</TE>
<TE>   Leach is 0-2 in the postseason since joining the Red Raiders, and
they're 0-4 since beating Air Force in the 1995 Copper Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson won three of its last four after switching quarterbacks,
as redshirt freshman Charlie Whitehurst replaced junior Willie
Simmons. Whitehurst completed 63% of his passes and threw eight
touchdowns and one interception.</TE>

<KH>N.Y. GIANTS 44, INDIANAPOLIS 27</KH>
<HD>Toomer Is Key to Big Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Jeremy Shockey got the New York Giants started Sunday. Kerry Collins
and Amani Toomer finished off their most important win of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Toomer had a career-high 204 yards receiving and caught three
second-half touchdowns from Collins, while Shockey caught seven
passes for 116 yards and the Giants took a big step toward the
playoffs with a 44-27 win at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "We've showed glimpses of this all year," said Collins, who had a
season-high 366 yards passing. "Look at our guys, these are guys who
can play. The pieces are all there."</LD>
<TE>   Now the Giants (9-6) are putting the pieces in place to make a run
for a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   New York got exactly what it needed as it won for the third
consecutive time -- big plays on offense, a stifling defense and a
little help when the Cincinnati Bengals beat New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   For New York, the combination could not have been better. Three
weeks ago, few gave the Giants any hope of reaching the playoffs. If
they win Saturday at home against Philadelphia, they will be in.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not too late, I'll get a Christmas card off to them in
the mail right now," Coach Jim Fassel said of the Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Had Indianapolis (9-6) won Sunday, it would have earned its third
playoff berth in four years. The best the Colts can do now is hope
for a wild-card spot when the Jaguars visit next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts were held to 50 yards rushing. Two-time rushing champion
Edgerrin James ran only 10 times for 13 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Peyton Manning became the first quarterback in NFL history to pass
for 4,000 yards in four consecutive seasons, breaking a tie with Dan
Marino and Dan Fouts.</TE>
<TE>   Manning completed 30 of 46 passes for 365 yards with three
touchdowns. He threw two interceptions.</TE>

<HD>On-Track Business Falls Off</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Park's autumn meet ends with lowest average
attendance in its 22 years of existence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood Park sustained substantial on-track business declines at
the 35-day fall meet that ended Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Average attendance was 6,458 a day, lowest since the Inglewood
track added to its spring-summer season with abbreviated fall meets
in 1981. This fall's on-track handle averaged $1.4 million, a drop of
close to 14% from a year ago. Attendance, which was down 24% after
opening weekend, was off 10.5% for the meet. The handle was down 26%
after the first weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "The inclement weather opening weekend proved too much to
overcome," said Rick Baedeker, president of Hollywood Park. "The
opening Friday night [marred by heavy rain] was a near total loss.
After that, we rallied but fell short."</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood Park was able to boost the handle somewhat because of
telephone betting, which was available at the fall meet for the first
time. Phone/Internet betting added $13.1 million to the total, an
average of $374,000 a day. Total handle from all sources averaged
$9.6 million, a 2.5% drop from last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug O'Neill may have won the Hollywood Park training title by a
five-race margin over Bobby Frankel, but he knows the competition
will stiffen when Santa Anita opens its 66th season Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran a lot of horses at Hollywood," O'Neill said, "and a lot of
the big boys -- guys like [Bob] Baffert and [Bill] Spawr -- didn't
fire as many shots as they're capable of. They'll be loaded for bear
at Santa Anita. We'll have our work cut out for us."</TE>
<TE>   The O'Neill barn cranked out 16 wins, starting 64 horses for an
average of almost two a day. O'Neill's horses also posted 16 seconds
and 13 thirds for a 63% in-the-money showing. This was the first meet
title at a major Southern California track for O'Neill, 34, who took
out his license in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill has two starters on Thursday's card, including
Excessivepleasure, a 2-year-old gelding who's moving from a maiden
win at Hollywood in his first start to the $125,000 California
Breeders' Champion Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   The Breeders' Champion is one of three stakes on the card, which
will be highlighted by the $200,000 Malibu, the opener in the
three-race Strub series. Eleven horses are entered, including Sunday
Break, Mayaovsky and U S S Tinosa, all returning from long layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, winning one race on closing day, tied Victor Espinoza
for the meet riding title. They had 34 wins apiece. Solis has won or
shared nine titles at Hollywood.... The windup stake, the $85,970
Dayjur Handicap, went to Echo Eddie, who gave Pat Valenzuela his
meet-high fifth stakes win. Echo Eddie, who has won nine of 20
starts, was offered by David and Rita Milch at their dispersal sale
at Keeneland last month, but they kept him after bidders fell short
of the pre-sale minimum price.... Golden Gate Fields, which has been
hit recently by more than 12 inches of rain, called off its races
Sunday after the jockeys deemed the racing surface "unsafe and
unfair." ... With five racing days left in December at Santa Anita,
Frankel is $282,930 short of Wayne Lukas' purse record, $17.8
million, which was set in 1988. Frankel has entered three horses for
opening day, one of them Inesperado in the $75,000 Sir Beaufort
Stakes.</TE>

<HD>Phaler Looks to Bulk Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sean Phaler is adept at waiting to grow into things.</LD>
<LD>   As an eighth grader, he was offered a $60,000-a-year job as a
graphic designer by a company that had seen his work on the Internet.
The kid had to hold off on a shopping spree when the company's
background check revealed his age, but the talent was already there.</LD>
<LD>   The talent is already there on the basketball court for Phaler,
the UCLA-bound senior forward from Villa Park (6-4) with the deft
outside shooting touch. The only question is whether the standout
will grow the inches and add the pounds necessary to become a
front-line college player or remain more of a perimeter threat.</LD>
<TE>   At 6 feet 9 and 185 pounds, Phaler is as stick-thin as a runway
model. He has tried everything from weight training to fattening
foods, yet has the body fat of a dragonfly. Repeating the eighth
grade to physically mature didn't help either.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken three shakes a day," Phaler said. "I've tried every
meal, been to three different nutritionists, everything. Nothing's
worked."</TE>
<TE>   Phaler is aware of what his lack of bulk could mean at the college
level after getting pushed around during summer workouts with Jason
Kapono and Ray Young of UCLA</TE>
<TE>   "They're just physically way too strong for me," said Phaler, who
is weighing whether to sit out next season as a redshirt. "I'm not at
UCLA's level yet."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to making shots from the perimeter, Phaler is at a
high level. His wingspan makes it difficult for other big men to
guard him near the three-point line, where he often camps out and
knocks down shot after shot. He is averaging 19 points and 11
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park Coach Kevin Reynolds said Phaler could probably make an
impact in college as a perimeter threat or someone who draws post
players outside, then drives past them to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never going to be a power post guy. We know that," Reynolds
said. "What he needs to do is a good job flashing and slashing to the
post, making the mismatch more difficult [for his defender]."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds is demanding more from Phaler to get him ready for UCLA.
The coach said he used the same tactic with Eric Chenowith, who
blossomed into the Big 12 Conference freshman of the year at Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It might seem odd to covet a matchup against a team with a 3-6
record, but that is how Los Angeles Pacific Hills players approached
their nonleague game against Beverly Hills on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The schools are within three miles of each other. Some Beverly
Hills students attend Pacific Hills for summer school, and players
from each team have scrimmaged against each other. One mutual alumna
is Monica S. Lewinsky, who attended Beverly Hills and then
transferred to Pacific Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Although Beverly Hills' enrollment is about 10 times larger,
Pacific Hills (7-4) won, 54-44. Pacific Hills Coach Kevin Kelsey
likened the triumph to a little brother beating a big brother.</TE>

<KH>THE TIMES' ALL-STAR GIRLS' TENNIS TEAM</KH>
<HD>Expectations Pay Off for Determined Exon</HD>
<DH>Woodbridge senior overcame pressure of No. 1 seeding to
become school's first singles champion in Southern Section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Exon looked at her lofty seeding going into the Southern
Section girls' tennis individual tournament and hoped she could live
up to it.</LD>
<LD>   After defeating Calabasas junior Celia Durkin in three sets in the
semifinals, the Irvine Woodbridge senior began to believe she could.
And with a remarkably well-played final match, she did.</LD>
<LD>   Exon beat Lindsey Nelson of Villa Park, 6-4, 7-6 (6), to claim the
section singles championship earlier this month at Sea Cliff Country
Club in Huntington Beach and cemented her selection as The Times'
girls' tennis player of the year.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever had such a great match, rally-wise," said
Exon, a four-year varsity standout who became the first Woodbridge
player to win the singles title.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I've had moments, of course, and matches where I've
played well. But that match was incredible. She played great, I
played great. It was just unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Susanna Lingman, the only other finalist in school history, lost
to Corona del Mar's Brittany Reitz in the 2000 championship match.</TE>
<TE>   Exon had come close to winning it before. She advanced to the
semifinals in her sophomore and junior years, but still was surprised
to find herself the top-seeded player in this year's tournament, a
position she thought might go to Nelson, the 2001 runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I truly thought I would lose in the first round,"
Exon said. "Except for high school, I haven't really been playing
tennis that much lately. That's why winning [the section individual
singles title] was so exciting to me."</TE>
<TE>   In the final, Exon won the first set after converting a break in
the fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   In the second set, she trailed, 3-0, and Nelson had five set
points, but Exon turned away each one and finally won in the
tiebreaker when Nelson hit out on her last four shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was like a heavyweight match," Woodbridge Coach Ric
Barth said. "I told everybody I talked to that I thought she'd win it
this year."</TE>
<TE>   Exon finished 59-1 in regular-season dual-match sets, 79-2 in sets
overall and led the Warriors (19-4) to the Division I quarterfinals
of the team playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Exon also won the Ojai tournament's girls' 18 division singles
championship and the South Bay and Whittier tournaments on the U.S.
Tennis Assn. junior circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "She played her very best tennis at the end of the year," Barth
said. "She had a great season and it was a great way to end it. And
the best thing about her is, she's a total high school team player."</TE>
<TE>   Exon agreed, saying the championship put an exclamation point on a
prep career she treasured. She carries a 4.3 grade-point average and
made a point to fit tennis into the rest of her life, not vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   "Tennis, of course, is very important to me, but it's not life or
death. And it almost has to be if it's the biggest thing in your
life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The junior circuit is so competitive. There are girls who it's
the only thing in their life, it is their life. But not me. I'm so
happy with how I did it, in moderation."</TE>
<TE>   Exon has earned a scholarship to Michigan, so her plan paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Just like the one she used to win the section title.</TE>

<LD>A final look at the top girls' tennis teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Palm Desert (SS-Div. II, 21-0)</LD>
<LD>   Aztecs dominated en route to Division II title and were deep
enough to have won Division I, too, if they'd been in it.</LD>
<TE>   2. Calabasas (SS-Div. I, 22-2)</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 28, JACKSONVILLE 10</KH>
<HD>Titans Clinch Division Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>One moment, the Tennessee Titans made the playoffs. The next, they
won the division.</LD>
<LD>   At this rate, there's no telling how far the Titans might go in a
season that seems to get better by the minute.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie George ran for two touchdowns and Steve McNair threw for
another Sunday to help the Titans embarrass Jacksonville, 28-10 -- a
loss that probably sent Jaguar Coach Tom Coughlin closer to
unemployment.</LD>
<TE>   With their ninth win in 10 games, the Titans (10-5) became the
first team in the jumbled AFC to wrap up a playoff spot. A few
minutes later, the New York Giants closed out a 44-27 win over the
Indianapolis Colts, which made Tennessee the first champion of the
AFC South.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we expected to do at the beginning of the season, and
obviously, we've still got a lot of work ahead of us," Titan Coach
Jeff Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars (6-9) were guaranteed their third consecutive losing
season, and Coughlin was booed frequently by an announced crowd of
51,033 in the last home game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if he's the head coach or someone else is the
head coach," Jaguar cornerback Fernando Bryant said. "[Tennessee]
beat us, and it wasn't because the stands were half full or anything
else."</TE>
<TE>   The Titans pushed the Jaguars around on both sides of the ball.
George ran for 89 yards in 21 carries. Playing with sore ribs, McNair
ran for a season-high 58 yards and threw for 115 more.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee outgained Jacksonville 298-214, held the ball for 11
more minutes and had four sacks. It was hard to believe this was the
team that didn't send a player to the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've been playing with a chip on our shoulder the whole
year," linebacker Keith Bulluck said. "For this team to be one of the
hottest teams in the NFL, and for no one to go to represent Tennessee
in Honolulu is absurd. People are just going to have to feel the
wrath."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the three players Jacksonville depend on to make big
plays -- Mark Brunell, Jimmy Smith and Fred Taylor -- didn't play for
portions of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Brunell left in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and 114
yards passing. Taylor (ankle) ran for 17 yards and Smith (shoulder)
had three catches for 14 yards.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK JETS 30, NEW ENGLAND 17</KH>
<HD>Pennington Again Comes Through</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Chad Pennington saved the New York Jets' season again and Wayne
Chrebet took a leap toward redemption.</LD>
<LD>   The Jets kept their playoff hopes alive with a 30-17 win Sunday
night over the New England Patriots, one week after they fell to
lowly Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "Last week we didn't think we were going to be breathing, but now
we're breathing," said Pennington, who threw three touchdown passes
and improved to 7-4 as a starter.</LD>
<TE>   Chrebet is breathing a lot easier after his 15-yard touchdown
catch gave the Jets a 27-17 lead with 8:45 left. In the 20-13 loss to
the Bears, he lost a fumble deep in Chicago territory with about a
minute left when he tried to jump over defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had games where we've made one mistake and the other team
had none and they beat us," Chrebet said. "Tonight, they had one."</TE>
<TE>   It came after the Patriots tied the score on the opening drive of
the third quarter, a 16-play, 66-yard march ending with Tom Brady's
six-yard scoring pass to Christian Fauria. Then the Patriots forced
the Jets to punt.</TE>
<TE>   But Troy Brown fumbled the punt and Nick Ferguson recovered at the
New England 19. John Hall's 23-yard field goal, one of three he
kicked, made it 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   "It just kills you. It takes a lot of momentum from your team,"
Brown said. "It's one of the worst plays I've ever had in my career.
It was just a bad decision" not to call for a fair catch.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets were 1-3 behind Vinny Testaverde, including a 44-7 rout
by the Patriots in the second week of the season. Then Pennington
took over. Now New York is 8-7 and in second place in the AFC East
behind Miami (9-6).</TE>
<TE>   "We've come along too far to not say we're going to finish it,"
Jet Coach Herm Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   New York also had a strong ground game. Curtis Martin became the
second NFL player to rush for at least 1,000 yards in each of his
first eight seasons. Barry Sanders did it in his first 10 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Martin had 106 yards in 26 carries, pushing his total to 1,011
this season.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Michael Cammalleri, who has not scored in his last six games and has
been scratched from the Kings' last two, might soon be back in the
minors.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray has hinted for weeks that a demotion could be in
the offing for the 20-year-old rookie from Toronto, who gave up his
senior year of eligibility at the University of Michigan to sign with
the Kings last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Before benching Cammalleri, Murray severely cut the rookie's ice
time.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to be concerned when you have a young player that's
getting [only] six, seven minutes [of playing time]," Murray said.
"We would think in his development that he's further ahead playing
more minutes down there ....</TE>
<TE>   "What happens is, when you're a 20-year-old and it doesn't look
like you're improving, people will say, 'Well, he's a 20-year-old; he
needs to play more.' And where's he going to play more? Probably with
the farm team. You have to prove people wrong and hang onto your
position."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of rookies, Murray said that defenseman Joe Corvo is "on
trial here," an unfortunate choice of words considering that Corvo,
25, faces charges in Boston for allegedly sexually assaulting and
attacking a woman in a bar last month.... Derek Armstrong, who has
sat out the last six games because of a groin injury, was available
to play Sunday night against the Chicago Blackhawks but remained on
the injured reserve list. "We're going to wait a bit," said Murray,
adding that Adam Deadmarsh probably will go on the injured list if
Armstrong is activated today.</TE>

<HD>Kings Make Quick Exit at Chicago</HD>
<DH>Blackhawks score two goals inside the first 31/2 minutes
and coast to a 3-1 victory. Eric Rasmussen averts a shutout with a
goal in the third period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>For nearly 57 minutes Sunday night, the Kings played the Chicago
Blackhawks on even terms, limiting the Blackhawks to only a handful
of scoring chances while generating numerous opportunities of their
own.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for the Kings, the outcome had already been decided.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei Berezin and Kyle Calder scored in the first 3 minutes 13
seconds, sending the Blackhawks to a 3-1 victory in front of 15,588
in the United Center, most of whom spent the rest of the night urging
the Blackhawks to pour it on.</LD>
<TE>   Any further suspense ended early in the third period, when Eric
Rasmussen's goal ended goaltender Jocelyn Thibault's bid for his
fifth shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a terrible start," Coach Andy Murray said. "We beat them
last time in L.A., gave them only 13 shots [in a 4-1 victory Nov.
30], and we knew they were going to come in here pretty hungry
tonight....</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus today in preparation was to have a solid start, knowing
how the Hawks start here. And then we cough up two goals in the first
three minutes?"</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only one caught by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had won five of six, their most successful stretch since
they won six in a row in March, and only a disputed goal in a 2-1
loss to the Phoenix Coyotes on Dec. 15 stood between them and a
six-game unbeaten streak.</TE>
<TE>   But that meant little after Berezin, with a great second effort,
scored on a rebound of his own shot at 1:22 of the first period and
Calder jammed in a shot from in front at 3:13, goaltender Felix
Potvin having lost sight of the puck.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be better than that to start the game," defenseman
Mathieu Schneider said later, between bites of pizza. "I thought we
played all right, but that's not good enough to win on the road.
You've got to elevate your game, and I just felt throughout the night
that we weren't able to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "We played at the same comfortable level. We have to raise our
game and make them play at an uncomfortable level. We just didn't do
that.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too easy a game for them."</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 11 goals in two games, the Kings put only one of 25
shots past Thibault. Ziggy Palffy's point-scoring streak ended after
seven games, his frustration showing in a third-period roughing
penalty against Steve Poapst.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks, 6-1-1 since Dec. 6, increased their lead to 3-0
when Eric Daze scored at the end of an odd-man rush at 16:46 of the
second period, taking a drop pass from Mike Sullivan and ripping a
shot past Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   Rasmussen's third goal of the season, scored from in front off a
deflected pass from Jaroslav Modry, kept the Kings from being shut
out for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Not including the playoffs, when Patrick Roy of the Colorado
Avalanche blanked them twice in the last four games of a seven-game
first-round series last spring, the Kings have not been shut out in
their last 42 games, a stretch that dates to a 4-0 loss March 26 at
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   But Rasmussen's goal was of little consolation to the Kings, who
end their two-game trip tonight against the St. Louis Blues.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't give ourselves a good chance," Mattias Norstrom said.
"We talked about how important the start was to this game. They start
hard, especially in their own building, but we put ourselves behind
the eight ball. I think we recovered a little ... but too little too
late."</TE>

<LD>   "Sean Elliott came into the locker room [as part of] the ESPN crew
[Friday]. He was talking to the coaching staff about the
[Philadelphia] game with the other reporters. They were talking about
the role players. [Elliott] said, 'One time I was guarding Michael

ball. [Kerr] went away, back to the other side of the offense. After
the game I asked why he didn't give it to Michael. He said, 'If we
throw the ball too much to him, Phil gets mad at us and takes us out
of the game because we're not supposed to toss him the ball so much.
We're supposed to stay inside of the offense.'</LD>
<LD>   "So, it kind of reminded me of when I was probably a more
disciplined coach, how I used to make the team stay inside the system
a little bit more than relying on the superstars in the offense.
They're going to find their own way to score without it. They don't
need an offensive system to score. But the other players do need a
system to score and if they run the system then they're going to find
a way to score inside the system. If Shaq and Kobe break it down and
play too much one on one, if the ball stops when it hits their hands,
then it destroys the rhythm for those guys to score."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That being said, Jackson said, his players have asked him to be
harder on them. He sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't ask me to hold their feet to the fire all the time,"
he said. "You hate to have to be a [jerk] all the time when you're a
coach. It just bothers you."</TE>

<TE>   Devean George did not play Sunday because of a sprained right
ankle, suffered early in Friday night's loss in Philadelphia.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Look Anything but Fit for Kings</HD>
<DH>NBA champs need overtime to beat Raptors and are 11-18
going into Christmas date with Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Seemingly intent on attacking a fourth consecutive championship by
balancing inconceivable defeat with indefensible victory, the Lakers
moved on to another airport after another grasp for the truth here,
having won a game but not an explanation for what they do.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Horry brought the bad news Sunday night, after the Lakers
required overtime to defeat the Toronto Raptors, 109-107, at Air
Canada Centre, Kobe Bryant and Horry scoring the final three points
of a trashy game.</LD>
<LD>   As he gathered himself for the flight away from a trip that began
with three losses and ended with the sole victory, Horry sat in his
yellow corduroy suit and his blue mood, like everyone annoyed at how
the Lakers continue to disappoint themselves, and shook his head.</LD>
<TE>   "Awful," he spat. "Shouldn't have been an overtime. Terrible, man.
Just flat-out terrible.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit there and wonder why. How."</TE>
<TE>   They have arrived at their Christmas Day game against the
Sacramento Kings with 11 wins, eight of them with Shaquille O'Neal in
the lineup, and 18 defeats, nine of those with O'Neal in the lineup.
They have arrived with questions about their execution on offense and
their desire on defense and their willingness to follow their coach's
instructions and their spotty play behind O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   So, a touch on the vulnerable side.</TE>
<TE>   The latest near-cataclysmic failure came along after they led by
11 points in the first quarter, 12 in the second, 11 in the third and
by five with 1:11 left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Jerome Williams made a jump shot, Bryant missed one of
two free throws, Alvin Williams made a jump shot and Morris Peterson,
as the clock passed 10 seconds, made a long jumper that was not a
three by the toe of his shoe. They went to overtime tied, 102-102.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that same old stuff that we do all the time when we get up
on teams," Horry said. "It stems from last year when we think we can
go outside the stuff we do on offense and we lose a lead and get
careless on defense. They come down and one person gets a shot and
[another] person gets a shot and they get hot. That's what's been
happening to us all year. We get complacent. We need to just buckle
down on defense and start playing better and stop feeling so sorry."</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for their mediocrity continue to be moving targets,
but team defense and accurate shooting are most often offered.
Against the Raptors, who played with starters Vince Carter and
Antonio Davis wearing suits on their bench, the Lakers shot a
season-high 53.2%. Bryant and O'Neal each scored 31 points, Rick Fox
(17) and Derek Fisher (12) reached double figures.</TE>
<TE>   And still the Raptors, losers now of seven of eight games, stayed
close. Something about their offensive rebounds (17) and the Lakers'
turnovers (14, 10 after halftime) and O'Neal's free throws (one for
10 at halftime, seven for 18 for the game).</TE>
<TE>   Peterson scored 27 points and Lindsey Hunter, the former Laker,
scored 17. The Raptors lost by 20 to the Miami Heat in the same
building Friday night, looked beaten in the first half, and somehow
found themselves at the doorstep of dealing the Lakers their first
0-4 trip in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   They did not, however, score after Jerome Williams' three-point
play with 1:52 remaining in the overtime, following that with two
turnovers, a missed leaner by Alvin Williams, two missed free throws
by Hunter (the second intentionally) and then another turnover, when
Hunter stumbled over Brian Shaw's feet.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter pleaded for a foul to be called but was ignored, and the
Lakers killed the final second.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't begrudge any win right now," Fox said. "Some haven't
been pretty, and there [are] only 11 of them, but we've had our share
of other things."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson had asked for two wins on the trip and got one, after
big losses in Minnesota and New Jersey and narrow defeat, in
overtime, in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   He looked into cameras afterward, said, "We certainly threatened
to fade again," and again lacked explanation for the Lakers'
wandering focus.</TE>
<TE>   "It stems from last year," Horry said. "You can be complacent
because in your mind you think you're good. And you go out there and
you're doing things that just doesn't do it on the court. Plain and
simple."</TE>

<HD>Mills Suspended for Three Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golden State forward Chris Mills was suspended for three games
without pay by the NBA on Sunday for fighting with Portland's Bonzi
Wells after a game, going after him in the locker room and even
blocking the Trail Blazer bus.</LD>
<LD>   "Chris Mills engaged in some actions at the conclusion of the
game, and well after the conclusion of the game, that quite frankly
we cannot accept and will not tolerate," NBA senior Vice President
Stu Jackson said.</LD>
<LD>   Mills' suspension began with Sunday night's game at Sacramento.
He'll also miss games against Toronto and the Clippers and will be
eligible to return Dec. 30 against Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   Wells was suspended two games on Saturday by the league for
throwing a punch at Mills after Friday night's game, which the
Blazers won 113-111 on Rasheed Wallace's last-second jumper. The
altercation started a brawl involving players from both sides, and
Wallace was fined $15,000 for trying to go after a fan who had thrown
a wad of gum at him.</TE>
<TE>   After both teams left the floor, Mills reportedly tried to get
into the Trail Blazers' locker room but was restrained. Later,
witnesses said Mills parked his car in front of Portland's bus, then
got out with several friends and challenged the Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 103, Golden State 88 -- Chris Webber had 20 points, 12
rebounds, six assists and four blocks to lead the Kings over the
Warriors at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Kings' 12th straight victory over the Warriors, dating
to March 9, 1998. Golden State lost its second straight and has
dropped five of six.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 92, New York 84 -- Eddie Jones scored 22 points and Mike
James had a career-high 17 to lead the Heat at New York. The Heat won
its third straight game for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 103, Memphis 74 -- Karl Malone and Matt Harpring scored 17
points each at Memphis, Tenn., and the Grizzlies had their home
winning streak stopped at five games.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oracle of San Francisco advanced to the America's Cup challenger
final by defeating Seattle's OneWorld Challenge by 1 minute 4 seconds
today to sweep their best-of-seven semifinal repechage at Auckland,
New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   Oracle will face Alinghi of Switzerland in the final starting Jan.
11.</LD>
<LD>   OneWorld is eliminated, though it is still awaiting the resolution
of a case in front of the Cup's international jury that questions the
legality of a military radar system used by Oracle in all of its
races.</LD>
<TE>   OneWorld led by 48 seconds halfway through the 18.5-nautical-mile
race. On the fourth leg of the six-leg race, OneWorld headed to the
right of the course while Oracle bore away and chose to sail closer
inshore.</TE>
<TE>   The yachts reached a maximum separation of more than a kilometer,
a hazardous prospect for the leading yacht. The decision was made
worse when Oracle sailed into a fuller breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to gamble because there were only two legs to go," Oracle
starting helmsman Peter Holmberg said. "It was tricky out there. The
left was winning all day. We got round the top mark and the right
started to come back and we gained."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle steadily reduced OneWorld's lead, then drove past to an
advantage of 38 seconds at the second leeward mark, a single-leg
turnaround of 1:26.</TE>
<TE>   The breeze stabilized, leaving OneWorld with few tactical options.
Oracle was able to lead around the last mark, by 41 seconds, and
finished more than 300 meters ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Count out Robin Roberts from the proposed meeting between
Commissioner Bud Selig and the Hall of Fame's 58 living members
regarding Pete Rose's possible reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really want to be a part of it," the former Philadelphia
pitcher said. "That's something to be worked out between the
commissioner and Pete. Until he's off the banned list, there's no
point talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Hall already has started contacting its members, hoping to set
up a meeting Jan. 17 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star reliever Ugueth Urbina signed a one-year deal with the
Texas Rangers. Urbina went 1-6 with 40 saves and a 3.00 earned-run
average for Boston last season.... Former Gold Glove infielder Neifi
Perez signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants....
The Colorado Rockies re-signed free-agent pitcher Scott Elarton to a
one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Bode Miller of the United States won a World Cup giant slalom at
Alta Badia, Italy, holding onto a first-run lead for his first
victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's combined time of 2:33.81 seconds was more than a second
ahead of runner-up Davide Simoncelli of Italy (2:34.87) for his fifth
World Cup win. Christian Mayer of Austria was third, 1.07 seconds
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic champion Janica Kostelic won a World Cup slalom and
combined after almost failing to make it down the course because of
wet goggles at Lenzerheide, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   The Croatian won easily in 1:42.97, finishing 1.23 seconds ahead
of Tanja Poutiainen of Finland. Claudia Riegler of New Zealand was
third.</TE>
<TE>   Sven Hannawald of Germany won a World Cup ski jump event for the
first time this season, soaring 133 meters, followed by an effort of
132.5 for 282.9 points at Engelberg, Switzerland.</TE>

<TE>   "I know I have another angel looking down on me," said Holliday,
who pointed toward the sky after each of his sacks. "I know today his
presence was there and he gave me that extra push, that extra
passion."</TE>
<TE>   Holliday's cousin, Marcus Warren, died in Hilton Head, S.C., after
collapsing during a high school basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   "In our family we certainly thought he was the next superstar in
basketball or football," said Holliday, who had to break the tragic
news to a large group of extended family members who made their
annual trek to Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Holliday's first forced fumble led to Green Bay's only touchdown,
and his last one ended Buffalo's hopes with 1:13 left and the Bills
at the Green Bay 17.</TE>
<TE>   He collapsed on the field, then again on the sideline, crying.</TE>
<TE>   Holliday, hampered by a torn chest muscle and a sprained knee this
season, had only one sack coming into the game. He broke Bryce Paup's
club record of 4 1/2 sacks set Sept. 15, 1991, against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay lost its best defender in safety Darren Sharper, who
sprained his right knee on his league-leading seventh interception
return in the first half. Sharper took a helmet to his knee and will
be re-examined today.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Favre improved to 35-0 at home when the temperature at
kickoff is 34 degrees or lower.</TE>
<TE>   Favre's 114 yards passing were the fifth-lowest in his career and
his 39.2 quarterback rating was the sixth-worst in his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home Sweet Home</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers are 8-0 at Lambeau Field this season, the
11th time they have finished a regular season undefeated at home. A

<KH>WEEK 16 IN THE NFL MIKE PENNER</KH>
<HD>Playoff Picture Still Out of Focus</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One week, the Indianapolis Colts are watching one of their wide
receivers break the league record for most catches in a season. The
next, they're dropping the ball against the New York Giants.</LD>
<LD>   One week, the New Orleans Saints are losing an impossible-to-lose
home game to the Minnesota Vikings. The next, they're outdoing
themselves by undoing themselves in an unfathomable loss to the worst
team in the league, yielding two touchdowns to a 265-pound backup
fullback who hadn't carried the ball in an NFL game before Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Needing a victory to clinch a berth in the AFC playoffs, the Colts
lost at home, 44-27, to the Giants as Amani Toomer had a career-high
204 receiving yards and three second-half touchdowns and rookie tight
end Jeremy Shockey caught seven passes for 118 yards. It wasn't a
total debacle for the Colts. They did manage to hold Kerry Collins
under 400 yards, five touchdown passes and an 80% completion rate.</LD>
<TE>   Needing a victory to virtually assure a berth in the NFC playoffs,
same as they stood a week ago against the Vikings, the Saints lost to
the Cincinnati Bengals -- the previously 1-13 Bengals -- in front of
a half-empty Paul Brown Stadium, 20-13, as a roly-poly, reserve-squad
obscurity named Nick Luchey rushed for 59 yards and two touchdowns in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Luchey runs like, and is uncannily built like, a bowling ball, but
you could have knocked New Orleans Coach Jim Haslett over with a
feather after the ground stopped shaking.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't us out there," Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy was left muttering after
the Giants -- 6-6 and out of it when December began -- embarrassed
his Colts in front of a stunned home crowd, "I don't know the
answer."</TE>
<TE>   Dungy isn't alone. After 16 Sundays of you-take-it, no-you-take-it
hot-potato football, who can answer definitively about anything
involving the Super Bowl tournament field?</TE>
<TE>   In the NFC, Philadelphia (12-3), Green Bay (12-3), Tampa Bay
(11-3) and San Francisco (10-5) are in -- but no one has clinched
home-field advantage yet, and three teams still have chances to win
it, or back into it, in Week 17.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta defeated Detroit, 36-15, which moved the Falcons to 9-5-1
but decided nothing. Because the Falcons lost at home last week to
Seattle, they still haven't clinched a playoff spot, and still could
miss the postseason if they lose to Cleveland and the Saints (9-6)
and the Giants (9-6) win their final games against Carolina and
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC, Oakland (10-5) and Tennessee (10-5) are in, both
clinching division titles Sunday. The Raiders swept Mike Shanahan's
Denver Broncos, 28-16, to win the AFC West championship and the
Titans, with no players selected to the Pro Bowl, won for the ninth
time in 10 games, 28-10 over Jacksonville, to claim the AFC South
title.</TE>
<TE>   But neither team has wrapped up the AFC's home-field advantage.
And neither team knows who will join them in the six-team AFC playoff
field after Miami's 20-17 upset loss to Minnesota on Saturday,
Indianapolis' loss to the Giants and New England's 30-17 loss to the
New York Jets on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   After the Raiders and the Titans, 10 teams enter the last week of
the regular season scrambling for the four remaining AFC playoff
berths.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh (8-5-1) can clinch the AFC North championship with a
win at Tampa Bay tonight or a home victory against Baltimore in its
finale.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland (8-7), which improved its road record to 6-2 with a
14-13 victory at Baltimore, can still win the AFC North title if the
Browns beat Atlanta and the Steelers finish 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Miami (9-6) can win the AFC East championship by beating the
Patriots in New England -- but the Dolphins couldn't beat the Vikings
in Minnesota and are 2-5 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   New England (8-7) can win the AFC East if the Patriots beat the
Dolphins and the Jets lose to Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets (8-7) can win the AFC East if they beat Green Bay and New
England beats Miami, forging a three-way tie at 9-7. Since the three
teams would all be 1-1 in head-to-head games, they would move to the
second tiebreaker, record within the division, which would eliminate
the Dolphins and send the Jets and Patriots to the third tiebreaker,
record against common opponents. There, the Jets would edge the
Patriots, 8-4 to 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis (9-6) can earn a wild card by beating Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   By losing at Kansas City, 24-22, San Diego dropped into a
three-way tie for second place in the AFC West at 8-7 with the Chiefs
and Broncos. All three remain in contention for a wild card,
depending on the outcomes of their final regular-season games:
Seattle at San Diego, Kansas City at Oakland, Arizona at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Also still mathematically possible: Eight teams -- half the AFC --
could finish 9-7, with the Steelers 8-7-1. Should that happen, it is
believed the first three tiebreakers would be a) penalty kicks, b)
blind straw draw and c) pistols at dawn.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this insanity, a few individuals managed to lift themselves
above the rabble Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon broke Warren Moon's single-season
completion record with 411, although he managed only 201 yards
against Denver and now needs 475 in his last game to break Dan
Marino's single-season yardage record. The Raiders play host to the
Chiefs in that one, so Gannon still has a fighting chance.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis wide receiver Marvin Harrison, who set the
single-season receptions record last week, caught 10 more passes to
move the new mark to 137. If he had caught 10 more, the Colts might
have pushed the Giants into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair joined Steve Young, Randall
Cunningham, John Elway and Fran Tarkenton as the only quarterbacks to
pass for 18,000 yards and rush for 3,000 during their NFL careers.</TE>
<TE>   And, on a somewhat dubious note, Houston quarterback David Carr
broke Cunningham's 16-year-old record for most times sacked in a
regular season, Bruce Smith wrapping his arms around Carr for
historic sack No. 73 during the Texans' 26-10 loss at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At least young Carr can hold his head up, knowing that he was
victimized by a future Hall of Famer at the expense of a rag-tag
expansion-year offensive line. Unlike the Colts and the Saints, who
stepped onto the field with everything to gain and promptly sacked
themselves.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's not a big deal.</LD>
<LD>   That's what most of the Golden State Warriors said. Just a little
bit of temper, just a little posturing, just a little punching and
shoving and taunting.</LD>
<LD>   Just a little bit of Chris Mills with a car full of buddies
pulling in front of the Portland team bus.</LD>
<TE>   Just a little bit of shouting threats and punching on bus windows
in the parking lot of a public arena in Oakland, where some fans were
still leaving after the Friday night game between Golden State and
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Just a police escort needed so that the Trail Blazer team bus
could leave for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Just what the NBA needs.</TE>
<TE>   Friday Night Fights.</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Bonzi Wells received a two-game suspension and Golden
State's Mills three games for their parts in the fight that started
in the arena and ended in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   What happened Friday at the Arena in Oakland is what happens on
city streets in places like Oakland and Los Angeles all too often.</TE>
<TE>   Street violence that starts with insults and maybe punches and
ends in serious violence.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody was lucky Friday. The police escorted the bus away. But
Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks called the situation "scary" and
"frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this is a moment where an athlete could make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his fine, it would be nice if the NBA would counsel and
encourage Mills, a native of Los Angeles, to speak to kids at high
schools in L.A. and Oakland about the dangers of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland had the highest per-capita murder rate in the state last
year. Last month, in a three-week period, 20 people were killed in
South Central Los Angeles, including a 14-year-old Crenshaw High
basketball player.</TE>
<TE>   This episode wasn't so serious. It started at the end of a close
game. Wells punched Mills. Players left both benches. There was
brawling and then there was Mills trying to get into the Trail
Blazers' locker room and being stopped by security.</TE>
<TE>   But what does it say about Mills that he couldn't end it, couldn't
go back to his own locker room and cool off?</TE>
<TE>   Why could he not let go? By some accounts it was Wells who threw
the first punch but by some accounts it was Mills who started the
fight. Plenty of blame for both players. There is no arguing that
Wells wasn't an out-of-control hothead who deserved his punishment,
the suspension meted out Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, if we expect our sports stars to live by the code of
"boys will be boys," it might be understandable that Mills went
stomping off to the Portland locker room in a fury, still looking for
his chance to get in the last punch since he didn't get the first.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no excusing or explaining Mills' chasing a bus,
blocking the bus, making threats to the passengers on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks told the Oregonian: "I've never seen anything like that.
I've seen guys get into fights and when they fight on the court, they
usually leave it there. I've never seen a guy do something like that.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, that can be kind of scary, be kind of frightening,
because you don't know what's going through a guy's mind like that.
It was like a movie."</TE>
<TE>   One suspects the movie on Cheeks' mind wasn't "It's a Wonderful
Life."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make too much of this," Warrior forward Antawn Jamison
said. "It was just some emotions getting a little out of hand after a
close game."</TE>
<TE>   It is the culture of the NBA, though, that so many teenagers
adopt. The clothes, the attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The fight started after Rasheed Wallace hit a shot at the buzzer
in Portland's 113-111victory. Wallace ended up being fined $15,000
for going into the stands after Warrior fans had pelted Trail Blazer
players with cups, beverages, ice and chewed gum.</TE>
<TE>   When this happens next at a high school game, no one should be
surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were trying to break things up," Jason Richardson of the
Warriors said Sunday night before his team played Sacramento. "Yeah,
it was a bad scene, a lot of people could have gotten hurt. But the
league looked at the tape, they saw what guys were trying to do. No
one was out there looking for a fight."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not at the start. But Mills was looking for something in
that parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't bring his friends and block a bus just for fun.</TE>
<TE>   A three-game suspension is a pittance. A $15,000 fine is
meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   A confrontation in a parking lot between players stoked up on
pride and anger and some misbegotten notion that manhood can only be
defended by fists and fighting and more deserves to be taken more
seriously by the league, by the teams, by the players.</TE>
<TE>   Mills has a chance to make a difference. If he wants to.</TE>

<HD>The Raider Way</HD>
<DH>Third consecutive AFC West title falls right into place for
Oakland with a 28-16 victory over Denver after Chargers lose to
Chiefs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OAKLAND -- Everything seems to be breaking the right way for the
Oakland Raiders lately.</LD>
<LD>   Consider this: In the second quarter of Sunday's victory over
Denver -- a 28-16 stomping that assured Oakland of its third
consecutive AFC West title -- Raider quarterback Rich Gannon dropped
back at the Bronco eight-yard line, saw that receiver Jerry Rice was
tied up with a defender, then tried to throw the ball away to avoid a
sack. He tossed it toward the back corner of the end zone, out of
everyone's reach.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone's reach, that is, but Charlie Garner's. The Raider
running back didn't hear Gannon changing the play at the line of
scrimmage, ran the incorrect pass route, and, to the quiet delight of
his quarterback, wound up making a beautiful catch for a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, I was not trying to throw the ball to
Charlie," Gannon said. "I mean, how could I anticipate Charlie
running the wrong route?"</TE>
<TE>   Wrong pattern. Wrong receiver. Right result.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder Deion Sanders wants to hop aboard this train?</TE>
<TE>   Whether that all-pro cornerback can or will come out of retirement
to bolster the Raider secondary was up for debate Sunday -- he
sparked the talk by announcing on CBS that he and the Raiders have
had discussions about him coming out of retirement -- but this much
we know:</TE>
<TE>   * The Raiders (10-5) clinched the division title with a victory,
combined with San Diego's loss at Kansas City. Not since the 1979-81
Chargers has an AFC West team won three division titles in a row.</TE>
<TE>   * The Raiders can assure themselves of home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs by beating the Chiefs in Oakland on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   If their offense goes silent -- as it did in the third quarter
against Denver -- the Raiders can rely on their defense to pick up
the slack.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Denver quarterback Brian Griese about that defense. He was
clobbered in the second quarter by former teammate Bill Romanowski
and left the game for good because of a re-injured left knee. Ask his
replacement, Steve Beuerlein, who was sacked on his first two plays
of relief. Ask receiver Ed McCaffrey, who leaped for a high pass over
the middle -- the type of toss John Elway used to call a "hospital
ball" -- and took a helmet to the ribs that kept him on the ground
for two minutes. Or ask tight end Shannon Sharpe, who was crunched
repeatedly but still finished with a team-high seven receptions for
84 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard that Shannon Sharpe had my picture in his locker all
week," Romanowski said. "I wonder if it's going to stay in there."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Romanowski's image is burned into the brains of the
Broncos, as is the sight of safety Rod Woodson wrapping his hands
around yet another Griese pass. Woodson, who returned an interception
98 yards in a victory at Denver last month, had one of Oakland's two
first-quarter picks in the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the first quarter, Griese had three completions and
two interceptions. In 1 1/2 quarters of work, the quarterback with a
$12.6-million signing bonus had a 14.7 passer rating. Asked about
Griese's performance, Coach Mike Shanahan said: "I'll have to look at
the film."</TE>
<TE>   That's a disaster flick for the Broncos (8-7), and it stars some
Raider matinee idols such as cornerback Charles Woodson, who logged
eight plays despite a broken bone in his right leg; linebacker
Travian Smith, who incorporated a break-dance spin into his sack
dance; and Gannon, who had a modest passing day (201 yards) but ran
three yards for a touchdown in the first quarter that will live
forever on his highlight reel.</TE>
<TE>   On that run, he dropped back to the 10, scanned the horizon for an
open receiver, then zig-zagged up the middle, juking ultra-quick
linebacker Ian Gold before diving into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs felt really good today," Gannon said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown, meanwhile, was using his hands to do more than catch
passes. He was high-fiving teammates until he came across Rice, owner
of three Super Bowl rings.</TE>
<TE>   "I just sort of patted him on the back," Brown said. "I said, 'I
know you've got bigger and better plans. But let us guys who don't do
this often enjoy this moment.' The guys like Jerry just shrug it off

and responded with a 57-yard touchdown drive composed of six
consecutive runs. Imagine that, a team that throws 64% of the time
and began this game with the fourth fewest number of runs in the
league, getting the job done on the ground.</TE>

<HD>Hasselbeck Stays Sharp</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Seattle Seahawks are making a late-season surge behind improving
quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.</LD>
<LD>   Hasselbeck threw for 303 yards and one touchdown, and the Seahawks
defeated the St. Louis Rams, 30-10, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "Matt's a good guy and he deserves to have a few good things
happen to him," Coach Mike Holmgren said. "He's making plays. You see
what he can do. He has played pretty well in these few weeks, and I'm
happy for him."</LD>
<TE>   Hasselbeck was 20 for 32 without an interception in getting his
third 300-yard passing game since replacing the injured Trent Dilfer
eight weeks ago. Seattle (6-9) is 5-4 since then and won for the
second consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams (6-9) were stunned by the loss of Marc Bulger.</TE>
<TE>   Ram quarterback Marc Bulger, who had been 6-0 as a starting
quarterback, suffered a back injury on the team's fourth play from
scrimmage. He was taken to a hospital, where a CT scan revealed no
broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Martin took over, completing 31 of 48 passes for 259 yards
with one touchdown and three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all set for these things that Marc does, and then I have to
reload a little bit because I'm not sure where Jamie is with some of
these things," Coach Mike Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk, who has a high ankle sprain that has slowed him
the last six weeks, had 13 yards in nine carries. The Rams (6-9) had
17 yards rushing.</TE>

Mark Campbell with 29 seconds left, and Phil Dawson's conversion gave
Cleveland an improbable 14-13 victory over the Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<TE>   "This team has been in those situations all year long, and we've
come out on top quite a few times," Couch said. "As long as you have
the chance to score and get back in the game, you've got to always
believe."</TE>
<TE>   The victory kept the Browns' playoff hopes alive. In the process,
Cleveland practically eliminated its most-hated rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens left the stadium still alive in the wild-card chase,
albeit only mathematically.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great opportunity to prove something to a lot of people,
and we were so close," Raven quarterback Jeff Blake said. "To lose
like that is tough."</TE>
<TE>   This was the Browns' 11th game that came down to the final minute,
and on this day Cleveland (8-7) pulled out a victory by ripping
through a defense that dominated since the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Down 13-7 and taking over on their eight with 2:18 left, Couch
calmly jogged onto the field supremely confident.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out in the huddle and we knew our season was riding on
that drive. It's either you go down and score or you go home," Couch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland needed only eight plays to reach the end zone. The key
moment came when Couch connected with Jamel White for a 28-yard
completion, and a late hit by Chris McAlister moved the ball to the
13.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be smart.... It's unfortunate to do that at that
time," Raven Coach Brian Billick said.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays after the penalty, Couch connected with a wide-open
Campbell to beat the Ravens (7-8), who were vying to get over .500
for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Baltimore's dream of reaching the playoffs for a third
consecutive season virtually disappeared.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 26, HOUSTON 10</KH>
<HD>Redskins Win on the Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>Expansion opponent or not, the Washington Redskins needed a victory
to improve the sagging morale that comes with a three-game losing
streak. They got it by thumping the Houston Texans, 26-10, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in 17 seasons, the Redskins had two 100-yard
rushers in the same game. Their defense gave up a season-low 166
yards and the special teams got a safety.</LD>
<LD>   .</LD>
<TE>   "When you've lost three in a row, certainly it means a little
more," Coach Steve Spurrier said. "Basically, that was our battle cry
this week. Let's try to have a victory party Sunday night."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskin defense also sacked David Carr three times, giving him
a dubious NFL record of 73 times sacked in a season. Carr passed the
record held by Randall Cunningham, sacked 72 times with Philadelphia
in 1986. Bruce Smith got two of the sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to break some NFL records when I came into the
league, but hopefully not that one," Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins (6-9) also scored their most points in eight weeks.
Patrick Ramsey threw two touchdown passes and got his first victory
as a starter. Ladell Betts (20 carries, 116 yards and a touchdown)
and Kenny Watson (20 carries, 110 yards) became the first 100-yard
duo since Keith Griffin (164) and George Rogers (124) on Nov. 3,
1985.</TE>

<KH>CINCINNATI 20, NEW ORLEANS 13</KH>
<HD>Ain't It the Truth: Saints Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Every so often, another New Orleans Saint muttered a cuss word under
his breath, breaking the silence but not the melancholy in the locker
room.</LD>
<LD>   The Saints couldn't fathom how they had just out-bungled the NFL's
biggest bunglers, possibly costing them a playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   New Orleans played more like the league's worst team Sunday,
losing, 20-13, to the Cincinnati Bengals. Nick Luchey scored two late
touchdowns that will torment New Orleans for a week -- and maybe much
longer.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big, strong gut-check about us now," said Aaron Brooks,
who failed to complete his last 11 passes.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans (9-6) fell behind Atlanta (9-5-1) and the New York
Giants (9-6) for the last two playoff berths. The Saints, to get in
the playoffs, have to beat Carolina on Sunday and hope the Falcons or
Giants lose. The New Orleans loss also handed the NFC South title to
Tampa Bay, which plays Pittsburgh tonight.</TE>
<TE>   It came down to the Saints' inability to put away the Bengals
(2-13) -- the league's symbol of ineptitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was in our court today, but we were the Aints and they
weren't the Bungles," tackle Kyle Turley said after the Saints' third
consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   They were known as the Aints during their 20-year run without a
winning season. Only eight days ago, they were poised to clinch their
second playoff berth in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Then they made a trip down memory lane, blowing fourth-quarter
leads against last-place teams.</TE>
<TE>   Daunte Culpepper's touchdown pass and two-point conversion run
with five seconds left gave Minnesota a victory last Sunday, denying
the Saints a chance to clinch on their home field.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Bengals pulled one out with their best player on
the bench. Corey Dillon bruised his left elbow, leaving it to Luchey
-- who changed his name from Nick Williams before the season -- to
provide the next gut wrench for the Saints</TE>
<TE>   Williams' three-yard touchdown run with 1:46 to play gave the
Bengals their first home victory this season and their first win over
an established team. The other came against expansion Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Losing to Minnesota was bad. This was beyond belief for the
Saints.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing," receiver Joe Horn said. "Everybody in the
nation and their mamas knows that. We shouldn't be in this situation.
We're making all these teams out of the playoffs feel good about
their off-season."</TE>
<TE>   Well, it made the Bengals feel good about themselves for one day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why we weren't doing it all year," linebacker
Brian Simmons said. "That's the confusing part of this year."</TE>

<HD>Raiders Could Be Ready for Prime Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Prime Time" or prankish tease?</LD>
<LD>   Deion Sanders is talking about coming out of retirement for a
playoff run with the Raiders and said he recently discussed the
matter with team officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I may come back to a playoff team," he said Sunday on CBS Sports'
"NFL Today," where he's a studio host. "I've made contact, I've
spoken with my attorney, we have spoken to the Oakland Raiders."</LD>
<TE>   Raider executive Bruce Allen neither confirmed nor denied the
report, but did say Sanders "is having way too much fun with this"
and a "fit of imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders is the latest in a line of TV analysts flirting with a
return to the game. It started when Cris Carter left HBO to become a
Miami receiver. Then, Troy Aikman's name surfaced as a potential
quarterback in Miami or Philadelphia. Now, Bill Parcells has
confirmed he has had conversations with Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry
Jones, who reportedly is on the verge of firing Coach Dave Campo.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders would need to get some help from Washington in order
to sign Sanders, 35, who played one season for the Redskins and
currently is on their reserve/retired list. That means the Redskins
have retained his rights and would need to waive him in order for
another team to sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said he has no reservations about his ability to step in
and contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I've always said, I could roll out of bed tomorrow morning,
and be able to cover," he said. "That will never go away. What was
missing was my desire to do it. I mean, I left the game on my own
[terms], because the fire wasn't there. But here's a team in the
playoffs, with a real chance to go to the Super Bowl, and an owner
who always wants to win. I always felt like I might look good in
black and silver, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders could use the help. Pro Bowl cornerback Charles
Woodson is playing sparingly on a broken leg, cornerback Tory James
is sidelined because of a similar injury, and rookie cornerback
Phillip Buchanon is out for the season with a broken wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "We need help," Woodson said. "Everybody in our secondary's banged
up. If it's true they're trying to get 'Prime Time' to help us win
the Super Bowl, why would I have a problem with that?"</TE>
<TE>   SAM FARMER</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nick Luchey, who scored two late touchdowns in Cincinnati's 20-13
win over New Orleans, isn't exactly a household name.</TE>
<TE>   Even people in Cincinnati's Paul Brown Stadium were confused as
Luchey led the Bengals to victory. With the public-address announcer
mispronouncing his name after each carry, Luchey (it's LOO-chee, not
loo-SHAY) ran eight times for 52 yards on the winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   Luchey, a 6-foot-2, 265-pound running back who changed his name
from Nick Williams before the season, finished with 59 yards in 12
carries. He also did an impromptu "Ickey Shuffle" after his second
career touchdown put the Bengals ahead. "That was my shout-out to
Ickey," he said. "I wear his jersey number [30], and he's a friend of
mine. I respect what he and [Tim] Krumrie and Boomer [Esiason] and
guys like that did for this franchise 10 to 12 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jim Haslett said the Saints -- who had only one timeout left
-- let Luchey score on the final run so they'd have a chance to get
the ball back. See, Luchey gets no respect at all.</TE>

<HD>Toluca Title Courtesy of Cardozo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paraguayan striker Jose Cardozo completed a magical season for Toluca
by scoring the championship-winning goal as the Red Devils routed
Morelia, 4-1, in the second leg of the Mexican league final to win
their seventh title.</LD>
<LD>   Cardozo's strike brought his tally to a record 36 goals in 25
matches in a season in which, at one point, he scored in 15
consecutive games.</LD>
<LD>   Morelia had won the first game of the two-game series, 1-0, at
home Wednesday, ending Cardozo's scoring streak, and the Monarcas
increased their advantage Saturday when striker Adolfo Bautista
scored in the first minute at Toluca to silence most of the 25,000
fans on hand.</LD>
<TE>   But Toluca, attacking in numbers, first tied the game on a
32nd-minute goal by Salvador Carmona, then tied the aggregate score
three minutes before halftime on an Israel Lopez goal.</TE>
<TE>   Cardozo's goal five minutes into the second half won the title,
with Rafael Garcia adding the fourth in the 65th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca also won the championship in 1967, 1968, 1975 and, after
Mexico switched to holding two championships a year, in 1998, 1999
and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   China Gets Haan</TE>
<TE>   Former Dutch World Cup midfielder Arie Haan, 54, was named China's
national team coach Sunday and said his aim is to duplicate the
success of fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink, who led South Korea to
fourth place at the 2002 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of confidence because otherwise I wouldn't come to
so big a country," Haan said in Beijing. "Everybody was looking in
Western Europe, especially Holland, at what a fine job he [Hiddink]
was doing. I can only hope I do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Matthaeus Move</TE>
<TE>   Lothar Matthaeus signed a contract to coach perennial Yugoslav
power Partizan Belgrade, the league's defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   The defender, who was captain of Germany's 1990 World Cup-winning
team but has yet to prove himself as a coach, was given an 18-month
contract worth more than $770,000, according to Germany's Bild am
Sonntag newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   As he did when playing for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars
during a brief and unimpressive stint in Major League Soccer,
Matthaeus will be given a luxury car and an apartment as part of the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   He replaces Ljubisa Tumbakovic, who resigned Thursday after 10
seasons, during which Partizan won the league title six times and the
Yugoslav Cup three times.</TE>
<TE>   Sukur's Bad Break</TE>
<TE>   Turkish World Cup striker Hakan Sukur, who joined Blackburn Rovers
only three weeks ago, broke his leg while training Saturday and as a
result failed to make his English Premier League debut against
Manchester United on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel earned a shutout as
Blackburn edged Manchester, 1-0, to end United's eight-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sukur, 31, will be sidelined for about eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi's Choice</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona announced that Coach Louis Van Gaal would remain in
charge of the team despite a series of poor results in Spanish league
play, thereby paving the way for Carlos Bianchi to return as coach of
Boca Juniors in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi, who led Boca Juniors to three Argentine championships,
the Copa Libertadores and the Toyota-Intercontinental Cup during his
first spell at the club from 1998 to 2001, had been offered his old
job on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But the coach was reportedly waiting to see if an opening occurred
at Barcelona, where Van Gaal was said to be on shaky ground.
Barcelona's announcement Sunday that "the coach stays and there are
no changes at the club," leaves Bianchi free to accept Boca's offer,
which he is expected to do today.</TE>
<TE>   He would replace Oscar Washington Tabarez, under whom Boca Juniors
finished second to Independiente in this season's championship.</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Loses McGowan for Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another day, another game, another Pepperdine player out for the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Already staggered by injuries and ailments, Pepperdine has lost
energetic forward Glen McGowan for the rest of the season, Coach Paul
Westphal said Sunday after the Waves' 89-73 nonconference victory
over Lipscomb before 437 fans at Pepperdine.</LD>
<LD>   McGowan, a junior who could score inside or outside and had
developed a reputation as a big-game player, is out because of a
blood clot in his left arm.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the 6-foot-9 McGowan, 6-10 center Will Kimble is
out for the season and probably will never play again because of a
heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about as bad as I've seen," Westphal said. "It's probably
the two most irreplaceable guys for us. We don't have any guys with
size and experience after them."</TE>
<TE>   McGowan sat out the Waves' first five games while recovering from
knee surgery, then scored seven points against Oregon on Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   After that game, McGowan's left arm was swollen and a blood clot
was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The hope that McGowan would return has now been replaced by the
reality that Pepperdine begins West Coast Conference play Jan. 9 at
Portland without an established low-post presence.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are big men we needed," said guard Terrance Johnson. "These
are things we need to fight through."</TE>
<TE>   McGowan averaged 9.8 points last season and was especially
effective in big games against WCC rival Gonzaga. McGowan had 19
points and nine rebounds at home against the Bulldogs last season and
followed that with 26 points at Gonzaga. The Waves tied Gonzaga for
the regular-season WCC title last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He had shown top quality against the top teams we've played,"
Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine had other problems before the game against Lipscomb.
Senior Jimmy Miggins, the Waves' leading scorer, was benched for the
first nine minutes because he missed a pregame meal.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't really matter.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine took a 31-9 lead with 6:37 left in the first half on a
three-point play by Miggins, and was never seriously threatened by
Lipscomb, an NCAA independent located in Nashville that will join the
Atlantic Sun Conference next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lipscomb managed to close within 12 in the last few minutes, but
the Waves (6-4) extended their lead without much stress.</TE>
<TE>   Miggins scored 20 points and guard Alex Acker had 17 for
Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Taking into account the competition, Pepperdine played better than
it did in a 77-61 loss Friday against Utah, where the Waves were
badly outrebounded and made three of 22 three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we were going on a break [until Dec. 28] and we knew we
needed this game," Westphal said.</TE>

<DH>Big waves, big names, big money, big crowds: Oahu's
'seven-mile miracle' is a surfing magnet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pete Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HALEIWA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Peter Cole first visited northern Oahu in 1958. The flight from Los
Angeles to Honolulu, via Oakland, took nearly 11 hours. The drive
from Honolulu to the small town of Haleiwa, before the roads were
what they are today, took two more.</LD>
<LD>   There were no hotels. This rarely visited region was all about
agriculture. But Cole and some friends found the only reason they
needed to have made the journey -- and to keep making it again and
again.</LD>
<LD>   Really big waves. The biggest and best known at the time.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew from the first day I was here -- that first day I rode
Sunset Beach -- that this was where I belonged," says Cole, 72, who
now lives on the beach near his favorite break and who still surfs
three or four days a week. "I realized I'd never go back."</TE>
<TE>   What none of them realized, however, was that their daredevil
exploits on those waves -- made famous by the makers of the first
surfing movies -- set the stage for what today has evolved into a
wild, months-long spectacle that all but turns this part of the
island upside down.</TE>
<TE>   A phenomenon called, simply, "the North Shore winter."</TE>
<TE>   Surfers today come not by the dozens but by the thousands, from
all over the world, young and old, amateur and pro. They begin
arriving in early November and keep coming long after Christmas,
taking up residence along a lush coastal corridor that has retained
its country feel, offering little in the way of resort living and
nothing in the way of big-city nightlife.</TE>
<TE>   The surfers come only to surf and to surf some more -- and to look
like surfers when there is no surf because the North Shore winter,
from an industry standpoint, is about much more than the mere act of
riding waves.</TE>
<TE>   During the peak months of November and December, photographers
line all the popular beaches. Surfwear company representatives, here
to showcase their stars and recruit new talent, are everywhere, and
usually talking on cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, they milk the season for all it's worth -- and it's
worth millions as the surfers appear in the photos that sell the
magazines that sell the fun-in-the-sun lifestyle and the clothing,
equipment and other products associated with that lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like renting a sky box at Indy," says Randy Rarick,
53, a Sunset Beach resident and director of the Vans Triple Crown of
Surfing, a six-week pro surfing extravaganza and a North Shore
centerpiece for the last 20 years. "Everybody's got to be here. It's
imperative that they have a presence here because if you don't,
you're going to lose your edge. They're all looking for their little
niche and how they can one-up each other."</TE>
<TE>   What do the surfers get out of all this? Plenty, if they're good
enough and have the right look. Sponsorship levels vary from simple
freebies and expense money to multiyear contracts worth millions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where you build your credibility as a surfer, and a lot
of companies are building their marketing around that," says Kelly
Slater, 30, the sport's most successful athlete and the poster child
for Quiksilver Inc. in Huntington Beach. "It's beautiful, warm and
blue; everyone wants to come to Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody's happy with such a drastic departure from the lazy
days of spring and summer, when the surf is nil and the tranquil blue
sea provides a stunning contrast to the deserted white-sand beaches.
Those beaches become overrun with surfers, just as the highway
becomes overrun with automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   The North Shore population swells from about 12,000 to nearly
40,000. With so many people comes only a slight rise in crime, police
say. But with more people coming every year, with more contests and
with the better surfers trying so hard to get noticed, catching waves
is becoming increasingly difficult.</TE>
<TE>   As for Cole, a former Santa Monica lifeguard and swimming star at
Stanford, he sighs when he gazes out at the sea of surfers. But he's
not altogether disheartened.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of my old age, the surfers usually give me waves by
myself," he says, "and one good ride keeps me happy for a week."</TE>
<TE>   Seven-Mile Miracle</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii definitely can make or break your career -- and it can
definitely make or break your board or body too.</TE>
<TE>   -- Fred Patacchia Jr., 20,</TE>
<TE>   Haleiwa resident and rising star</TE>
<TE>   The jagged ribbon of coast between Haleiwa and just beyond Sunset
Beach is often referred to as the seven-mile miracle. It's ideally
situated to receive fast-moving swells generated in the North
Pacific. Its many reefs, likewise, are well positioned to take those
swells and throw them shoreward as perfect waves.</TE>
<TE>   When the storm pulse is not strong, some of the reefs -- at Waimea
Bay, Banzai Pipeline and Sunset Beach, for example -- don't even
break. But others do and are under constant assault by surfers of all
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   When the pulse is mighty, when the waves at every break boom like
thunder and the roar of rushing water is constant, only the seasoned
veterans have business in the water. And it's serious business.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most challenging situation in the world for a
lifeguard," says Jim Howe, chief of operations for the Ocean Safety
Division of the Hawaiian Lifeguard Assn. "You've got the best surfers
in the world out here and who do you think they're relying on to save
their lives?"</TE>
<TE>   Fatalities rarely occur, Howe says, because of the heavy lifeguard
presence on both Jet Skis and in the towers, but also because the
fear factor is so intense, for good reason, during the really big
days that it turns many into mere onlookers.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2001 high-surf season, the last for which statistics
are available, lifeguards logged 875,000 beach visits to Waimea Bay.
They made only 88 rescues and recorded only 44 medical emergencies
that required hospitalization, but took 15,000 preventive actions,
which ranged from simple advice to ordering people out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunset Beach, there were 600,000 visitors, 88 rescues, 21
medical emergencies and 12,000 preventive actions; at Pipeline there
were 500,000 visits, 46 rescues, 63 medical emergencies and 12,000
preventive actions. There were no deaths by drowning at any of the
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proud to say that whether it's Kelly Slater or just Kelly
Girl out there, we're in good position to keep an eye on them and
help them out," Howe adds.</TE>
<TE>   At some of the bigger breaks, there's another kind of interaction
of an intense and often intimidating nature, between locals and
non-locals, experienced and inexperienced.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that more apparent than at Pipeline. There are only so
many sweet spots in the lineup, and because the hollow wave is so
dramatic and breaks so close to shore, it is a favorite haunt of
photographers and thus offers surfers in those sweet spots the best
chance of getting their pictures in the magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Also, because the left-breaking wave is so fast and moves out over
sharp and jagged coral reef that runs the length of the impact zone,
it is highly dangerous and requires responsible behavior on the part
of all who paddle out.</TE>
<TE>   "When Pipe is good, the pack comes out and you've got to know
who's who," warns Patacchia, gazing seaward for signs of an incoming
swell. "When it's good, you want to sit on the beach and watch and
wait. You want to make sure you know who is out there, getting the
good ones, so you're not in his way."</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguard Johnny Angel, stationed at Pipeline, says a popular
weeding-out tactic employed by locals is "to punch the kid in the
face, flip his board over and knock his fins out," leaving him no
choice but to paddle in.</TE>
<TE>   "As years go by, more of those victims want to get the police
involved," adds Angel, 32, son of legendary big-wave surfer Jose
Angel.</TE>
<TE>   "But the police aren't going to get wet over it. Then, they want
us to get involved. We'll patch them up, but otherwise it's up to
them to press charges with the cops, if that's the way they want to
go."</TE>
<TE>   That night, under a big yellow moon, the swell everyone had been
expecting arrived, broadcasting its presence loudly and with a
resonance that seemed to shake the island.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, the sun revealed what everyone knew was there, along with
a briny mist that wafted along the shore. Surfers were diving in atop
their boards, scratching toward the horizon. It was a mass exodus
from land to sea that spanned the length of the North Shore.</TE>
<TE>   At Haleiwa, the first leg of the Triple Crown, the $100,000
Haleiwa Pro, was called a go, with wave faces measuring as high as 18
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The world's top surfers were featured, including Slater, who drew
the loudest applause when he carved a 360-degree turn on a steep,
shifting canvas and somehow maintained his footing, finishing his
ride with a series of smashing off-the-lips.</TE>
<TE>   Tube rides, cutbacks and floating reentries seemed to come easily
to those who do this for a living.</TE>
<TE>   Oahu's Sunny Garcia, 32, would go on to win the event, despite a
torn knee ligament and a gash on his head, suffered during a wipeout
in an earlier heat.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds were fairly small, which was not surprising. The
lineups from here to Sunset Beach and beyond were teeming with those
starving for waves of their own.</TE>
<TE>   At Pipeline, there were about 100 in the water. Those in the sweet
spots were catching waves while those on the fringes mostly sat,
hoping for opportunity in the form of a wayward peak.</TE>
<TE>   On the beach, the spectators were as one, applauding every
successful tube ride, gasping at every wipeout. "I came because I
wanted to see a wave like the one on 'Hawaii Five-0,' " said Joan
Greene, making a circular motion with her hand.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Howard, vacationing in Waikiki to celebrate
their 35th anniversary, were fortunate to have picked this day for a
drive to the North Shore. They got what they came for and then some.</TE>
<TE>   Living the Dream</TE>
<TE>   It really is like living at a college frat house. I go house to
house every day, seeing what all the other surfers are up to. It's
the best lifestyle I can imagine and I wouldn't trade it for
anything.</TE>
<TE>   -- Andy Irons, 2002 world champion</TE>
<TE>   The North Shore is still country. The string of small communities
from here to Sunset Beach has successfully opposed any large
development projects. The only hotel is the upscale Turtle Bay Resort
north of Sunset Beach in Kahuku.</TE>
<TE>   The surfers, by and large, flop where they can close to the waves:
in small apartments, rented houses or rooms within the houses, on
couches, even on floors.</TE>
<TE>   The more fortunate ones are the hundreds of sponsored pros
shuffling in and out of homes vacated by their owners and leased --
for as much as $15,000 a month -- by the surfwear companies. The
bigger the company, the better the location.</TE>
<TE>   Irons, 24, is staying at the Red Bull house in front of Off the
Wall, a right-breaking wave only steps from Pipeline. Next door is
the Oakley house. Overlooking Pipeline is the Quiksilver house and
next door is the Volcom house.</TE>
<TE>   There are the O'Neill house, Billabong house, Rip Curl house and
so on. There's even a diamond in the rough: the Roxy house, a big
yellow manor on Sunset Point. It's full of young female riders and
thus one of the more popular houses around.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love the North Shore -- I think it's cool," says Kassia
Meador, 20, a Roxy surfer. "You walk down the street and everybody
says hello. If there are waves, everybody's buzzing, and if there are
no waves, everybody's going to each other's houses and having
barbecues and parties. You breathe in the warm air and you're just
stoked."</TE>
<TE>   Meador, of Westlake Village, doesn't recall exactly when she got
discovered. "One thing just led to another," she says.</TE>
<TE>   That's often how it happens.</TE>
<TE>   Strider Wasilewski, 30, captain of the Quiksilver team, made his
first trip here when he was 12. He and two older friends (they were
14) "fooled" their parents into believing the trip was supervised by
the surfboard company for which Wasilewski had been competing.</TE>
<TE>   Wasilewski sprang for the airline tickets, using money he'd made
as a child model. They caught a plane from Los Angeles to Honolulu,
and a cab to the North Shore. The cab driver dropped them off in the
dusty lot of a small market.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, Wasilewski recognized a pro surfer walking
across the lot. He introduced himself. The surfer said they could
stay with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know where he was taking us," Wasilewski says. "We
walk in through the back of the house, walk out the front and he
says, 'See that? That's Pipeline and that's Back-Door and that's Off
the Wall. And that's all you're going to need to know for the next
15-20 years.' "</TE>
<TE>   Those words rang true. Wasilewski continued the annual pilgrimage
and slowly gained the respect of locals and older, more experienced
surfers who dominated the sweet spots in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on a thunderous day at Pipeline, he took off on the biggest
wave of the afternoon at the outer reef. He made the bottom turn and
stood on his board in awe as the face of the wave warped inward and
the lip flew out, over and well beyond him.</TE>
<TE>   So impressive was his tube ride that it was a cover shot on Surfer
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It ended up being the start of my pro career," Wasilewski says
with a smile. "It was my dream come true."</TE>

<LD>The Bruins are off until an afternoon practice Christmas Day. Jason
Kapono and T.J. Cummings did not accompany the team back from Kansas
after the 87-70 loss to the Jayhawks on Saturday, taking flights
elsewhere to spend the holiday with family and friends.</LD>
<LD>   "When we start practicing again, we have to practice with a
purpose," Cummings said. "We've been working hard in practice,
everybody has, but we need to concentrate on the things that are
lacking."</LD>
<LD>   That would be defense and offense.</LD>
<TE>   Or, if the Bruins (2-4) prefer, offense and defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We need work on both ends of the floor," Cummings said.</TE>

<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin, an eternal optimist, compared UCLA's woes to
the early season problems of local professional teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in as deep a hole as the Lakers are in, or as big a

title, he said. "We'll come back Christmas night and practice.</TE>

basketball to be played.... There's enough time to turn it around."</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The behavior of players is a concern in Las Vegas, especially because
UCLA does not have a permanent coach on hand to enforce rules. The
Bruins did not have a curfew until tonight, the theory being that
players can get their fill of the bright lights and taper off the
reveling in time for the game.</LD>
<LD>   And they must report to practice bright-eyed at 9 a.m. each day.</LD>
<LD>   Eight New Mexico players, however, found themselves in serious
trouble before leaving Albuquerque.</LD>
<TE>   Fake Oklahoma driver's licenses for the players, all freshmen,
were found beside a photocopier in a copy store several days ago.
Police have begun an investigation; no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   The eight color copies, plus one for a ninth man not on the team,
had Oklahoma markings, including Oklahoma addresses, along with
photos of the freshmen players.</TE>
<TE>   The players under investigation accompanied the team to Las Vegas
and no disciplinary action is planned until after the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karl Dorrell is the new UCLA coach, but Sunday he was focused on
his last day of employment with the Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   And the receivers coach remained that way after a loss to the
Oakland Raiders, refusing interview requests from reporters who
wanted to ask him about UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell will begin assembling his coaching staff today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A fleet of UCLA players dressed in blue-and-gold warmups attended

<TE>   UCLA is the third Pacific 10 Conference team to play in the

<HD>Hutchinson Is Out With Ankle Sprain</HD>

<LD>X-rays of Robert Hutchinson's injured right ankle were negative,
trainer Mark Pocinich said Sunday, and the USC senior point guard was
diagnosed with a sprain.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans were off Sunday and no timetable has been set for his
return, although he will not practice today. Hutchinson will have
plenty of time to rest because the Trojans do not play again until
opening Pacific 10 Conference play Jan. 2 at Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchinson's ankle was rolled over by a pile of players in a scrum
for a loose ball in the first half of the Trojans' 89-63 victory over
La Salle on Saturday night, only 40 seconds after he checked into the
game.</LD>
<TE>   Hutchinson first sprained the ankle at UC Santa Barbara on Dec. 3
and had to sit out the Trojans' loss to Missouri in the Wooden
Classic four days later.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Hutch has been through the trenches," Coach Henry Bibby
said of the experience USC lost when Hutchinson was helped off the
court. "He's played in the Elite Eight ... in front of 20-some
thousand people so we know he's going to be OK and he's not going to
get rattled."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Derrick Craven, who started against La Salle, may have
lost ground in the battle for the point guard spot. He was scoreless,
had one assist, one turnover and one steal before fouling out in 15
minutes.... Junior guard Desmon Farmer, USC's leading scorer, had
eight points on three-for-12 shooting. It was the first time he was
held to single digits in scoring this season.... USC has won 24
consecutive nonconference home games.</TE>

<HD>Last Practice at Home Sinks in With Seniors</HD>

<LD>USC seniors anticipate a range of emotions today when the Trojans
practice for the final time this season at Howard Jones Field.</LD>
<LD>   "It is going to feel kind of weird, kind of sad," Derek Graf, a
fifth-year senior center said Sunday. "I remember how exciting it was
the first day I stepped on that field for my first practice. So I'm
going to make sure I take the time to appreciate the last one."</LD>
<LD>   As a salute to former assistant coach Marv Goux, USC players tap
the top of the doorway every time they pass through Goux's Gate to
enter the practice facility. Senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly said
he would continue to tap in at practice sites as a pro.</LD>
<TE>   "It reassures you," he said. "You leave all your problems behind
and focus on the job at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "These four years have gone by fast. It's hard to believe this is
the last one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said that he spoke again with
Kentucky Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart regarding the school's
head-coaching position but declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Barnhart also reportedly spoke with Central Florida Coach Mike
Kruczek and South Carolina defensive coordinator Charlie Strong on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said the Trojans should not have problems
dealing with the distractions of Miami at the Orange Bowl after
playing a bowl game in Las Vegas last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas was an extraordinary environment, the most difficult
place you could possibly go to," Carroll said. "Miami is a wonderful
place, but you still have to work hard to avoid incidents."</TE>
<TE>   USC will take its own security detail to Miami and will augment it
with officers from South Florida. The Trojans are staying in a hotel
closer to Fort Lauderdale than South Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really worried about the guys having a good time,"
Carroll said. "You can't help but have some fun. But it's clear we're
going down there to play real good football and see if we can finish
this season up right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll identified freshman tight end Dominique Byrd, defensive
linemen LaJuan Ramsey and Van Brown and defensive back William
Buchanon as players who made significant strides during the last two
weeks of practice.... The Trojans will be off Tuesday and Wednesday
before leaving for Miami on Thursday.</TE>
