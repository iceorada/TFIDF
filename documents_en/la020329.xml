<HD>Marketer Taps Bush's Trademark Phrases</HD>

<LD>In most Democratic circles, President George W. Bush isn't revered as
a clever orator. But his speeches after the Sept. 11 attacks really
moved Rebecca Kotch, 35, a registered Democrat with a marketing firm.
When she heard Bush talk about how he wanted to "rid the world of the
evildoers" and describe his mandate to "smoke 'em out and get 'em
running and bring 'em to justice," Kotch saw dollar signs. To her,
Bush's language sounded bankable.</LD>
<LD>   Kotch, whose marketing know-how has informed promotions for Nike,
Microsoft and the House of Blues, sees her newest venture as
"anti-propaganda propaganda."</LD>
<LD>   "It was like 'Wow! I see something that can be turned into a
product,'" she said during a phone call from her Los Angeles office.</LD>
<TE>   Six months later, Kotch launched the product line BushWares, which
features everything from coffee mugs to underwear emblazoned with the
president's fighting words: "Smoke 'Em Out, Bring 'Em to Justice"
"Make No Mistake" and the word "evil-doers" with a slash through it.
For now, the merchandise is available on www.bushwares.com. (When
apprised of Kotch's venture, the White House had no comment.) "It's
marketable in the sense that it uses the simple language that has
become the fabric of our world today in a way that everyone can
respond to," Kotch said.</TE>
<TE>   While Kotch awaits government approval to trademark several of
Bush's phrases, she's working on more products. Recently, she took a
liking to "pretty hot," a phrase Bush used to describe his reaction
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's granting a visa to a
suspected terrorist. "We're here to stay," she said. "At least for
three more years."</TE>

<TE>   An Intertwiningof Film and Family</TE>
<TE>   "Having a film open and having a baby go hand in hand," said Bart
Freundlich by phone from New York.</TE>
<TE>   The director and actress Julianne Moore are expecting their second
child in the next couple of weeks, and on April 19 Freundlich's movie
"World Traveler," which stars Moore, is scheduled to premiere.</TE>
<TE>   The movie charts the journey of Cal, a man torn between his
desires for intimacy and freedom, who eventually chooses to be a
father.</TE>
<TE>   As the film opens, Cal leaves his family.</TE>
<TE>   He has no planned route but drifts aimlessly until meeting his
father, who had left Cal when he was a young boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a character study of a guy who is very unhappy and
lost, and who does a really self-destructive thing that hurts other
people in the process," Freundlich said.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most touching scenes, Cal abandons a delusional
woman (played by Moore), who believes he has her imagined child in
his car.</TE>
<TE>   "It always breaks my heart watching it," he said, acknowledging
that the film is not "rip-roaringly funny to watch."</TE>
<TE>   But, like life and relationships, the movie consists of "the
terrible stuff and the good stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Although Freundlich and Moore's 4-year-old son is also named Cal,
the director warns about making too much of the connections between
Cal and the director.</TE>
<TE>   "This," he said, "is not my journey."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I love living in L.A--the ocean, nature, weather, the
limitlessness," says Alanis Morissette in the April issue of Nylon
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "No no-you-can't-ness. There was a lot of that in my life before.
I was in places where my ideas were seen as crazy. Here, people
embrace it all."</TE>

<HD>Creating a Spectacle</HD>
<DH>They've framed famous faces and made Melrose hip. Now the
founders of L.A. Eyeworks are expanding their empire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WEBB</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1965, when Barbara McReynolds was fresh out of high school and
hunting around for a unique pair of glasses, she persuaded a veteran
optician in Newport Beach to adapt some vintage frames. Her friends
loved the look, and she was hooked on the concept--so much so that
she went to work in the optician's office to learn everything she
could about eye wear. When he opened a branch in Irvine to cater to
students at UCI, she brought in her high school friend, Gai Gherardi,
to help run the store.</LD>
<LD>   "People were wearing Mack trucks on their faces back then," says
Gherardi. "The choice was mostly between butterfly shapes in pink
with rhinestones and basic models in black or tortoiseshell."</LD>
<LD>   Thus was sown the seed that later grew into L.A. Eyeworks,
producers of artistic eyeglasses and pioneers of a niche that now
seems inextricably linked with Los Angeles style. The duo opened its
business in 1979, and in the years since not only helped pioneer the
revival of Melrose Avenue, but also improved the four-eyed visages of
the likes of Elton John, Jodie Foster, Robin Williams and Mick
Jagger.</LD>
<TE>   They have a loyal local following. "I love being framed--by this
artful, inventive, exciting group who create spectacles for this
spectacular L.A.," says gallery owner Jan Baum.</TE>
<TE>   For Tim Street-Porter, the dapper London-born photographer,
"They're still hipper and chic-er than anyone else, with a great
sense of fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Next month, Gherardi and McReynolds will open a new store on
Beverly Boulevard at Martel Avenue in Los Angeles as a showcase for
their own eyeglass and sun-wear designs, complementing the Melrose
emporium, which will continue to sell a mix of imported eye wear. The
shop, which is still a construction site, will be the first major
building by architect Neil Denari, the recently departed director of
the Southern California Institute of Architecture.</TE>
<TE>   To have a shop devoted to their own work is the culmination of a
creative association that has occupied most of their lives. Both were
born in 1946 in Huntington Beach, and they've become almost like
twins, each anticipating the other's thoughts and finishing the
other's sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Friends describe Gherardi, whose partner of 26 years is Rhonda
Saboss, director of the Dirt Gallery in West Hollywood, as a party on
wheels, gregarious and jolly. McReynolds, who is single, is the more
serious and quieter one, with a great entrepreneurial sense and an
eye for color.</TE>
<TE>   From the first, Gherardi and McReynolds were inspired by the era's
then-burgeoning pop-music scene--Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the Lovin'
Spoonful all performed at Huntington Beach's legendary Golden Bear
Club. As they looked around for frames they could tweak, the sexiest
option they could find was the Bausch &amp; Lomb Wayfarers that
lifeguards wore, an American classic that would later be appropriated
on the silver screen by the Blues Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   They bought a bunch of the thick, dark frames, sandblasted them to
remove the shine, added vibrant colors, fitted them with prescription
lenses and sold them to young women. They also transformed other
ready-mades, discovering that a crystal frame can be dyed, plastic
can be heated and stretched into interesting new shapes and that
etching initials onto lenses can add to their appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the 1970s, the two learned their craft, earned
licenses as opticians and began to chafe at the restrictions of
working for people with less imagination than they had.</TE>
<TE>   Chance guided them to Melrose Avenue. The street, they say, was
full of mail-order electronics and furniture finishers when a friend
told them of a vacant storefront. They knew they needed to be located
on a major cross-town axis, and it seemed like a good fit.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be a diamond in the rough," says McReynolds.
"Melrose was cheap, and it wouldn't define us as a smarter street
like Rodeo or a mall would have."</TE>
<TE>   They took their first original design to France to be manufactured
because at the time no one was making frames in the U.S., they say.
Knowing nothing of the business, they placed an order for 50 frames.
The factory manager explained that the usual minimum was 500, but,
incredibly, accepted their assurance that they'd soon reorder.</TE>
<TE>   The first line sold briskly, and the store was briefly so popular
that the crowds forced them to lock the door and keep customers
waiting on the sidewalk until others left. A call from Henri Bendel
in New York for a contribution for the Christmas catalog put L.A.
Eyeworks into the wholesale business.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on those early years, the two marvel at their
luck--and their naivete. At one point, they designed a compound metal
and plastic frame and accepted orders, but it took a year to get it
produced. By the time it was in hand, a large firm had taken the idea
and flooded the market.</TE>
<TE>   On their first sales trip to the Paris trade show, they lined up
customers from almost every European country and returned with sample
frames by the hot French designer Alain Mikli.</TE>
<TE>   "Elton John came in the store [in L.A.] and wanted to buy them,
but they were the only ones we had and as precious as Picassos to
us," Gherardi recalls. "So we told him no, but finally relented and
let him buy one pair."</TE>
<TE>   Melrose proved an ideal location. By the early 1980s, the
sidewalks were jammed on the weekends with kids drawn in by the
trendy boutiques, restaurants and clubs. More than just a shop,
Gherardi and McReynolds used L.A. Eyeworks as a gallery for art and
oddball items to set off the frames, and their windows became
billboards for social and political causes. They opened City Cafe in
a sliver of space next door, bringing in first Susan Feniger and then
Mary-Sue Milliken--L.A.'s Too Hot Tamales--as chefs. Later, as
partners, the quartet launched the ambitious City Restaurant and two
Border Grills. In 1995, Gherardi and McReynolds sold their interest
in the restaurants to concentrate on eye wear.</TE>
<TE>   An advertising campaign that began 20 years ago and shows no sign
of faltering has given L.A. Eyeworks visibility coast to coast and in
Europe. The catchy slogan, "A face is like a work of art. It deserves
a great frame," was the work of Chiat/Day's Jeff Gorman; his cousin,
Greg Gorman, photographed the now-signature black-and-white portraits
of celebrities and cult favorites wearing the pair's designs. Levi
Dexter, an English rockabilly musician, was the first to appear,
followed by Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's, Pee-wee Herman and 200
more.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when you think we're all about underground performance
artists, we'll include a baseball player," Gherardi says, "and we'll
follow that with a drag queen like RuPaul, a Shakespearean actor and
then a glam rock star. We'll run all those ads in a gay magazine like
Out and in an electronic media bible like Wired."</TE>
<TE>   Even in their earliest days, there was a politically charged side
to Gherardi's and McReynolds' work. In their own creative protest
against the Vietnam War, they ground super-thick lenses for boys to
wear to their physical exams, just the look of which could
immediately disqualify the wearer from the draft. The two take part
annually in the Divine Design benefit supporting Project Angel Food,
which provides food to people living with AIDS, and they raised
$80,000 for an AIDS hospice through sales of one of their popular
frames.</TE>
<TE>   They created disposable 3-D glasses for "Monsters of Grace," an
avant-garde multimedia piece by Robert Wilson staged in 1998, and
also designed frames for a recent modern-dress production by the L.A.
Opera of Verdi's "Rigoletto."</TE>
<TE>   If their first inspiration came from the music scene and
improvised street fashion, where a strategically placed safety pin
could be a statement, their Melrose location meant they had only to
look out the door to see what Gherardi calls "a tide of humanity in
all its glory."</TE>
<TE>   Ideas often sprang from chance encounters. McReynolds returned
from a recent trade show in New York reeling from the stimulus of a
retrospective of paintings by the German artist Gerhard Richter.</TE>
<TE>   Rough sketches lead to drawings and prototypes, all done by hand.
Their goal, they say, is to reduce size and weight while maximizing
impact. They pioneered laser-cutting and employed it to match
super-thin lenses and frames, and they use laser-engraving to create
textures and patterns on the frames, including maps of L.A. Gherardi
and McReynolds need as little as an ounce and a few square inches of
material to allow the face to make a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of colors are used singly or laminated in contrasting
tones. In the current collection, a continuous loop of metal provides
a seamless frame, and titanium is dyed in lustrous colors and
combined with plastic temples in contrasting shades. The house
signature came in the rounded temple tips that Gherardi calls frog
toes--for the tree frogs that she keeps in her office.</TE>
<TE>   A second L.A. Eyeworks store opened in Costa Mesa in 1988 and is
run by Heather Gherardi, Gai's sister. The glasses sell from Japan to
Saudi Arabia, and the company has opened a corporate office in France
to coordinate European sales. Though the pair describe their
operation as "a speck" in market share, they are unwilling to give
figures on how much they have grown.</TE>
<TE>   They freely admit, however, that over the past five years the
field has become much more competitive as Gucci, Jil Sander and other
leading companies began to exploit eyeglasses as high fashion, a part
of their look, not merely something to license for profit. Specialty
companies like Oliver Peoples have also entered the business and the
shelf-life of frame styles has shortened from about four years to
one. These days, new designs are presented, like clothes, every
spring and fall.</TE>
<TE>   None of this fazes McReynolds. "Even though I have drawers of
glasses, I've dressed up for an event and not found the right pair to
match my outfit," she says. "People see your face before they look at
your feet, so you should have more eyeglasses than shoes. It's
something I feel passionately about."</TE>

<LD>The Canadian Lynx</LD>
<LD>   If you were hiking in our local mountains and saw a short-tailed
wild cat, you would probably recognize it as a bobcat. But what if
you were hiking in Alaska and saw a similar type of cat? Would it be
a bobcat too? You might think so, because bobcats look very similar
to another species of cat.</LD>
<LD>   That cat would be a Canadian lynx. It can look similar to a
bobcat, especially in the summer after it sheds its frosty gray
winter coat. One way to tell them apart is that bobcats have
white-tipped tails while lynxes' are black-tipped. Bobcats are more
aggressive than lynxes, and the two cats do not overlap much in the
wild.</LD>
<TE>   Canadian lynxes are found all over Canada, Alaska and in Northern
states such as Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
They have large, spreading feet, which act like snowshoes and help
them to chase rabbits during the winter. Their main diet consists of
snowshoe hares. They are so dependent on these animals for food that
when the number of hares goes down because of poor weather, so does
the number of lynxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Exotic Feline Breeding Compound's Feline Conservation Center
in Rosamond is home to a young Canadian lynx named Trapper. You can
learn more about lynxes and other wild felines by visiting the center
or going to its Web site at www.cathouse-fcc.org. Center hours are 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Digging for the Truth in Colson's Column</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In last week's Regarding Media, an item concerning a column by
onetime Nixon aide Charles Colson in the evangelical magazine
Christianity Today attracted attention among media watchers and
caused consternation in the Colson camp.</LD>
<LD>   The column, "Post-Truth Society," decried the ubiquity of lying in
contemporary America. Colson, who founded a prison ministry after
doing federal time for obstructing justice in the Watergate affair,
cited as exemplars of this trend football Coach George O'Leary,
Tawana Brawley, feminist Gloria Steinem, contrite ex-conservative
David Brock, George Stephanopoulos and historians Joseph Ellis and
Stephen Ambrose. The latter two were singled out for "dealing in
deceit."</LD>
<LD>   These characterizations appeared in a column under Colson's photo
and byline. But according to current and former employees of his
ministry, he did not write it. The author, they say, was Anne Morse,
one of two full-time writers Colson employs.</LD>
<TE>   In a phone conversation Monday, Colson, who was not available last
week in time to comment on the allegations, acknowledged that he had
not written his column but maintained that it reflected his thinking.
"Fifteen years ago," he said, "I realized that there just wasn't
enough time to run our prison ministry and to write everything I was
being asked to do. So I hired some folks to work with me. It has
never been a secret. It was published in Christianity Today. Since
then, I've come to realize that applying a biblical world view to
contemporary problems requires expertise in so many areas that we've
also drawn in a large number of other distinguished scholars and
theologians. We run things past them all the time. We like to make
sure we are right."</TE>
<TE>   Colson said he believes the process of collaboration and
discussion that goes into his columns, daily radio commentaries and
the 38 books he has produced makes his work "stronger and gives it
greater depth. I often recommend movies or books that I haven't seen
or read," he said. "I don't have nearly enough time to read, and I
haven't been to a movie in several years. But our listeners and
readers want some guidance on these things, and when a staff member
who has the expertise and who I trust brings a book or movie to my
attention, I have no hesitation about recommending it.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe, though, that when we Christian leaders use the
talent of others, we are ethically obligated to publicize that." In
fact, when Colson's daily radio commentary is distributed by e-mail,
a roster of his contributing staff is attached. His books
acknowledge, as he says, "both general and specific contributors."
When Colson received the prestigious Templeton Prize, he acknowledged
Michael Gerson, now a speech writer for President George W. Bush, as
the writer of his memorial lecture.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Christianity Today column, Colson says, the
process of composition began "when I read a piece on the problem in
the New York Times. I drafted a memo to the staff saying this was
something we should tackle. Later, when the Stephen Ambrose
plagiarism controversy came up, Anne drafted, and I edited, a radio
commentary. I told her I wanted to turn it into a longer piece for
Christianity Today and she did. It's a pretty good example of the way
we work."</TE>
<TE>   Why not share credit, as he did for many years with former staff
writer Nancy R. Pearcey?</TE>
<TE>   "Nancy was an excellent writer and thinker," Colson said. "I would
do an outline, and she would flesh it out. My relationship with Anne
could possibly get to that point. If she got to the point where she
was expressing her own ideas, as well as mine--as Nancy did--then I
would share credit."</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Regarding Media quoted Pearcey as saying that her name
was not originally in ads and on the cover design for a bestselling
book on which she collaborated with Colson, "How Now Shall We Live."
She was, however, given credit after what she described as several
months of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, Christianity Today's editor, David Neff, posted his
account of these events on the magazine's Web site
(ChristianityToday.com). Neff reports that after he "talked to Chuck
and to some of his staff," he concluded that "after about 18 months
of solo writing, Chuck returned to relying on his staff writers for
help with his columns." Neff reported that he is satisfied that
"Chuck was thoroughly involved in writing 'Post-Truth Society.'
Colson, he said, "orchestrated the process by which the column came
to be. The staff added illustrations, consulted the reference people
he pointed them to, and wrote smooth, easy-to-read copy for two ...
radio scripts and one [Christianity Today] column. They made a great
contribution. But Chuck didn't just sign off on a staff written
piece: the column has his fingerprints all over it."</TE>
<TE>   Colson told The Times that "Anne [Morse] was the one who finished
the column for CT. I have no problem with telling anybody that. I
complimented Anne on the job she did because I thought it was the
best work she'd ever done."</TE>

<TE>   Flanagan Leaves Legacy of Historical Fiction</TE>
<TE>   The man many regarded as America's finest writer of historical
fiction died suddenly last week in Berkeley. Thomas Flanagan was 77,
and though he was a critic and scholar of great
distinction--professor of English at Columbia University, UC Berkeley
and the State University of New York at Stony Brook--he will be best
remembered for his epic fictional trilogy recounting the evolution of
Irish national consciousness from the rising of 1798 through the end
of the civil war in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Those novels--"The Year of the French" (1979), "The Tenants of
Time" (1988) and "The End of the Hunt (1994)--made Flanagan deeply
admired by serious writers in Ireland and the United States. "Those
books," the late novelist Brien Moore once said, "are what Tolstoy
might have done--if he'd read James Joyce."</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan had recently completed the manuscript of a book on
Irish-American writers. His last critical essay--a review of William
Kennedy's most recent Albany novel, "Roscoe"--will appear in the
forthcoming issue of the New York Review of Books, which also
contains an appreciation by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney. "Since our
first meeting in 1970," Heaney writes, Flanagan "was like a father to
me and like a typical Irish son I felt closest at our times of
greatest silence and remoteness...."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Irish Times earlier this month identified Flanagan as
a "novelist and scholar," Heaney writes that when the paper "called
him a scholar, they could have been using the word in the older Irish
vernacular sense, meaning somebody not only learned but ringed around
with a certain draoicht or aura of distinction, at once a man of the
people and a solitary spirit, a little separate but much beloved."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Wills' Next Work: 'Why I Am a Catholic'</TE>
<TE>   Gary Wills is adjunct professor of history at Northwestern
University and the author of numerous books, including a forthcoming
biography of James Madison. "I have just finished going over the
galleys of my next book, which is called 'Why I Am a Catholic.' It's
essentially an answer to the many criticisms I received after the
publication of my book 'Papal Sins,' saying, 'Well, if you disagree
with the Pope, how can you be a Catholic?' In this book, I show that
Catholicism and the papacy are not the same thing and, historically,
often have been at odds. The papacy actually is a rather modern event
in the history of the Church. It took about 1,000 years to develop
into something like its current form and, even afterward many
councils were at odds with the pope and constituted a more authentic
expression of the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "I also talk about how my own attitude toward the church formed
and what it means to me to be a Catholic, which is to believe in the
creed, which contains nothing about the pope or, for that matter, the
institutional church."</TE>

<HD>Hippie, Hippie Chic</HD>
<DH>The seductive-sorceress look that late designer Holly Harp
created for such rock icons as Stevie Nicks and Grace Slick continues
to inspire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gucci's Tom Ford sent models bounding down the runway in Milan
earlier this month wearing witchy-looking silk jersey gowns and black
crucifixes, the image was unmistakable. It was vintage Stevie Nicks
with the music ("Rhiannon," "Edge of Seventeen") to match. But there
was another reference, to the standard-bearer of L.A. style in the
1960s and '70s, fashion designer Holly Harp.</LD>
<LD>   When Ford was still in diapers, Harp was one of the original
purveyors of the rich hippie look. Nicks, Grace Slick and Janis
Joplin flocked to her Sunset Boulevard boutique, ditching their jeans
for tie-dyed chiffon ponchos, fringe vests and asymmetrical matte
jersey gowns that were seductive in a rock 'n' roll sorceress kind of
way.</LD>
<LD>   Harp studied fashion at what is now the University of North Texas
in Denton. After graduating and marrying her English professor, she
moved to L.A. and opened her shop in 1968. She was always a bit of a
fashion maverick, deciding in 1978, after 10 years of presenting her
collections biannually in New York, to quit showing altogether.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think women want to change their look twice a year. I
don't think they want to change it that much every five years. They
want something that makes them look slim, feminine and chic. As a
designer, I can do this for them much better if I don't have to face
a tankful of barracudas wearing press badges," she told The Times
that year.</TE>
<TE>   Her designs grew up with her customers--Barbra Streisand, Linda
Rondstadt and Faye Dunaway--whom she described in 1978 as "women as
opposed to girls." By the late 1970s, she had abandoned the gypsy
fringe and lace of her early years in favor of more subtle designs,
including off-the-shoulder peasant tops, tunics and halter dresses in
carrot, cassis and curry-colored jersey and matte crepe.</TE>
<TE>   Harp died of cancer in 1995, but her clothing continues to
inspire. This week, actress Chloe Sevigny chose a white 1969 Harp
gown to wear to the Vanity Fair Oscar party. On April 5, Melrose
Avenue vintage emporium Decades will host a Harp retrospective in its
upstairs gallery, which runs through April 19.</TE>
<TE>   "Harp is our L.A. equivalent to Ossie Clark," Decades owner
Cameron Silver said, referring to the 1960s British fashion designer.
"Anyone who lived here in the 1970s or '80s wore Holly. She
championed that luxe version of the counterculture movement."</TE>
<TE>   Collaborating with Harp's first husband, Jim Harp, Silver
assembled a collection of her designs from the 1960s to early 1980s,
including the first dress she sold, a brown cotton voile mini-dress
with a slip.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the collection comes from Ann Hoover, Holly's
house model, and Pam Paul, her first client. Additional items come
from Julie Belafonte, a lifelong Harp fan.</TE>
<TE>   Ten percent of sales from the retrospective collection will go to
the Susan G. Komen Foundation for Breast Cancer.</TE>

<TE>   A Trio of Sweet Little Bunnies</TE>
<TE>   The best solution to the Easter bunny bulge? Forget the sugar and
opt for candy jewelry instead. New York jewelry designer Jennifer
Kellogg fashions Peeps into a pink necklace, a blue ring and yellow
pin. The silver and confection bunny pieces ($160 each) have a light
protective coating, so they aren't edible (www.jenniferkellogg.com ).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I purchased a casual outfit last summer that I
didn't know was made of rayon and needed to be dry-cleaned.</LD>
<LD>   I washed it several times, and now it's ruined. Maybe you'd like
to inform your readers to watch out for things like this.</LD>
<LD>   --LEARNED MY LESSON</LD>
<TE>   Dear Learned: Were you unaware that the outfit was made of rayon
because you didn't check the fiber-content tag, or because there
wasn't one in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   If it's the former, shame on you for not being a diligent
consumer. If it's the latter, we're surprised. By law, all garments
must include information about the manufacturer or seller, the fiber
content (in generic terms), the country where the item was made, and
care instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, you're down one summer outfit, but you've gained a
lifetime of wisdom that you're now able to share with others, and
that's a beautiful thing. The first stage of a successful shopping
trip is falling in love with something; the second should be checking
that little tag. Taking proper care of your clothes is essential for
maintaining a great wardrobe and in the long run will save you money.</TE>
<TE>   Although most content and care tags are found at the back of the
neck or on the waistband, some are sewn in odd places, such as the
middle of a side seam. As you discovered, it's worth doing a thorough
check, even turning the garment inside out if you have to. If you
still can't find anything, ask a salesperson for help.</TE>
<TE>   If you're buying recycled or vintage clothes and the tag has been
removed, take it to a good dry cleaner. Sometimes it can determine
the fiber content.</TE>
<TE>   Rayon can be a tricky fiber, said Lezlie Labhard, professor of
industrial technology and project director for the Textile Research
and Testing Laboratory at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. "Rayon is
notorious for losing its shape when it's subjected to moisture and
agitation," which means washing machines often equal death.</TE>
<TE>   Rayon, she explained, is made from wood pulp, which has to be
broken down into a solution before it's made back into a solid. That
process breaks down the length of the polymer chains, which results
in a weak fabric, whether woven or knitted.</TE>
<TE>   Labhard added that dry-cleaning--which is actually a wet
process--uses solvents, which don't cause the fibers to swell or be
pulled apart as much, and that is why it is the preferred cleaning
process. Some rayons can be hand-washed, but again, check the label
first.</TE>
<TE>   Blending rayon with other fibers such as cotton, linen or
polyester adds strength, and sometimes these clothes can be machine
washed. But first, check ... OK, you get it.</TE>
<TE>   Labhard also mentioned that a new rayon fiber called lyocell
(trade name: Tencel) is stronger than other kinds of rayon because in
the production process, "the polymer chains aren't as broken down,
and it doesn't lose its strength as much."</TE>
<TE>   The professor gave us one last great piece of advice: If you're
one of those people who habitually cuts out the tags from your
clothing, don't throw them away.</TE>
<TE>   Attach them to a piece of paper with a description of the garment
so you'll have something to refer to when it comes time for cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I just got the most comfortable shoes I've
ever owned--a pair of Dansko clogs that I ordered from a Web site. I
couldn't tell from the online picture, but they turned out to be
suede.</TE>
<TE>   My question: Is suede OK for summer? Obviously leather is fine,
but I have the sneaking suspicion that suede is not. Just so you
know, I'm pregnant and plan to wear my comfy clogs no matter what you
say.</TE>
<TE>   --NOT BUDGING</TE>
<TE>   Dear Not: You sure sound spunky and opinionated, and the last
thing we want to do is argue with a spunky, opinionated pregnant
lady.</TE>
<TE>   But you can put away that sneaking suspicion about suede in
summer, because it's perfectly OK. In fact, there is plenty of spring
and summer suede footwear available, including Spiegel's aqua suede
chunky-heel sandals, Steve Madden's black suede platform sandals, and
DKNY's faux suede sporty mules. As long as your clogs look like
summer footwear--they're a light color and aren't big and heavy--wear
them all you want. You will anyway.</TE>
<TE>   We suspect you may be hanging on to fashion rule relics that
mandated suede was suitable only for fall and winter because of its
texture. But today, suede is soft, light, and comes in pretty spring
pastels and summer brights, perfect for fashion mavericks like you.</TE>

<HD>The Urge to Write Is in His Blood</HD>
<DH>Christopher Rice also shares with mom Anne a love of dark
themes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher Rice is at home in West Hollywood, winding down as he
nears the finish of a 14-city book tour, an experience he has
approached with "healthy terror," in no small part because of the
"tiresome" questions about his mother, vampire maven Anne Rice, and
nepotism in the publishing world and all that.</LD>
<LD>   The questions are inevitable. When barely of drinking age, he
landed a two-book contract with Talk Miramax Books, a deal that he
will only say was for $100,000 to $250,000.</LD>
<LD>   But to those who insinuate that the 24-year-old is riding the
literary coattails of his mother, creator of "Interview With the
Vampire," Rice has one question: "Can I see your novel?" OK, he
concedes that "the speed with which I got an agent was amazing." (He
shares Mom's agent, Lynn Nesbit.) But, "if there was nothing to back
it up, I would have vanished in five minutes."</LD>
<TE>   He hasn't vanished. His dark 2000 coming-of-age novel, "A Density
of Souls," sold about 90,000 hardcover copies and is out in
paperback. He has followed up with "The Snow Garden," a murder
thriller set on a fictional eastern college campus.</TE>
<TE>   It is no coincidence both books center on gay characters. Rice,
who came out when he was 18, drew heavily on his nightmarish years as
a closeted gay at a prestigious private high school in New Orleans
for "A Density of Souls." He says, "It was just like my high school
experience, except for all the murders."</TE>
<TE>   His writing, published and not, always has depicted violence
against gays. "Before Matthew Shepard was killed," he says, "I
thought maybe I was going a bit over the top with it." When the
University of Wyoming freshman was brutally murdered in 1998, Rice
knew it wasn't just his imagination. Although Rice's debut novel
resonated with young gay men--"as if it was their new bible," he
says--he does not target a gay readership nor label himself a gay
author. He reserves that "title of distinction" for men like Edmund
White, now in his 60s, "who were out there when there was almost a
political imperative to tell gay stories. That void does not exist
anymore. I don't think necessarily there is a need."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Rice says, the issues "are a little muddier, not
necessarily all positive. There is a generation of young gay men who
are not the most noble creatures on the planet. They're a little
self-obsessed. They have a terrific sense of entitlement." Ironic, he
observes, in that "they haven't lived under this curtain of
repressive silence [that their elders have]. Yet a lot of them burst
out of the closet with the attitude of me, me, more, more, the world
owes me this and that."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges, "I did it. I just had a deep, built-up sense of
frustration" rooted in his teen years as a creative, sensitive kid in
a school where jocks reigned. When he did come out, after graduation,
"It was sort of like going from 0 to 100, a gay bar every weekend."
And in New Orleans, where he then lived with his mother and father,
poet-artist Stan Rice, "If you're as tall as the bar, you get in."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Rice has learned in the last two years is that being a
Rice does not make him immune to the slings and arrows of book
critics. "A Density of Souls," a story of murder, madness, rape and
suicide evolving around four friends growing up in New Orleans--the
central character being tall, blond and blue-eyed, much like
Rice--received decidedly mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times found it "scarily sincere and ultimately
preposterous." Another critic suggested it could have been written by
those proverbial monkeys with a typewriter. Ouch. But the Washington
Post lauded it for its "unexpected twists," clever plot and lingering
images.</TE>
<TE>   His new novel, set at fictional Atherton University, is a murder
mystery centered on an affair between a gay student and his married
art history professor. The mix includes a militant black lesbian, a
muckraking gay reporter for the campus newspaper and, as the
protagonist's best friend, a freshman with a dark secret to explain
her sexual hang-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Again, reaction has been across the board. Publisher's Weekly
suggested that "readers may not want to relive their freshman year
for 400 pages in order to learn whodunit." The Library Journal panned
it as "a histrionic hodgepodge," suggesting that Rice readers "stick
with Mom." But Booklist praised it as "an enthralling narrative" and
Amazon.com buyers found it "stimulating" and "electrifying in its
intensity." The novel quickly peaked at No. 12 on the New York Times
bestsellers list.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, a mature and composed young man, is quick to acknowledge
that his plots may be overwrought and there are passages in his first
novel that five years from now may make him wince. Still, he says,
"I'm never going to bill myself as a quiet, contemplative writer.
This may sound kind of young of me, but when I write a book I have to
surrender to it."</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, home to Rice has been a spacious upper duplex
in a flamingo pink Spanish-style compound just off Sunset Boulevard.
There, in a sunny living room with one wall anchored by a gigantic
TV, he pushes aside an ashtray full of Marlboro butts, settles back
and talks about becoming a writer.</TE>
<TE>   He was 6, a child fascinated with cataclysmic events depicted in
movies such as "The Towering Inferno," and had just written a
novella. "It was preposterous, as the New York Times would say. It
was about the Golden Gate Bridge catching fire and burning for two
days. Finally, my mother said, very gently, 'It can't really burn.
It's iron and steel.' I was crushed."</TE>
<TE>   After high school, he was set on being an actor and enrolled at
Brown University, where he had a rude awakening. "I auditioned for my
first play [one of his favorites, Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia"] and
didn't even get called back." Nor was he cast in a play created by
"two [students] who'd written every word while they were on acid."</TE>
<TE>   Rejected, he turned next to filmmaking at Tisch School of the Arts
at NYU. But, finding the general education curriculum limited, he
dropped out after one semester. "I just left. I didn't know what I
was going to do." So he moved to Los Angeles at 20 and "worked on
screenplays that I never showed to anyone." One day he realized, "I
was too young to be living out here. I had vague notions of doing
everything, acting, writing.... "</TE>
<TE>   Fate played a hand; he was called home when his mother went into a
nearly fatal diabetic coma. The return to New Orleans jarred him--"It
sort of squeezed all these memories out"--and there he wrote the
first draft of "A Destiny of Souls."</TE>
<TE>   His themes are dark. An inherited literary gene, perhaps? "Yeah,
absolutely. In my house, growing up, no subject was taboo. As a
result, all three of us indulged our darker sides and our worst
nightmares and all three of us have obsessive personalities." Great
for art, he mentions, but his "panic and self-doubt and fear" make
getting through each day tough.</TE>
<TE>   When Rice was 5, a family friend let slip that he'd had a sister,
Michele, who had died of leukemia at the same age. His parents had
never told him, thinking it was something a 5-year-old couldn't
absorb. "I remember a little sting," he says. "But the loss they'd
suffered was greater than anything I could experience. To me, she was
my parents' daughter."</TE>
<TE>   The first Anne Rice book he read was "Belinda," an erotic novel
she wrote under the pseudonym Anne Rampling because her Roman
Catholic father was still alive. It is the story of an older artist
obsessed with his young model.</TE>
<TE>   He began reading his mother's vampire books only after he left
home the first time and was "incredibly homesick. It was a wonderful
way to get her voice back." Until then, "I was like the kid who's the
son of the Kellogg's people and doesn't want to eat Cornflakes. I
knew the stories [already] because they were discussed at dinner."</TE>
<TE>   He scoffs at depictions of his mother as "a gothic queen devouring
bats alive. She's really upstairs in a sundress eating crackers and
cheese and watching TV. She carries a glow with her, not a cloud of
doom."</TE>
<TE>   His mother is a Catholic who recently returned to the church she'd
left in her 20s. She returned, her son says, "with a lot of questions
for the priests and has told them upfront she doesn't agree with the
church's position on homosexuality." He is himself an agnostic who'll
"be willing to believe if a ray of light falls out of the sky."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, he plans to start work on a sequel to "The Snow Garden." He
thinks there always will be gay characters in his novels, but "I see
homosexuality receding into the background."</TE>
<TE>   A night owl, he gets up late and writes from about 2 to 6 p.m.
Much of that time he is sitting in his living room, notebook on his
lap, with film soundtracks playing in the background (favorite
composers include Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) as he
scribbles at a "feverish pace."</TE>
<TE>   Out and about in Los Angeles, he observes people who may become
composites in his novels. "I've met some definite characters in West
Hollywood. L.A. is very, very ripe" for mining. But he is not yet
ready to write a novel set in the city--"Before I can write about
L.A. with any kind of authority, I need another year here."</TE>
<TE>   Favorite haunts include Book Soup and, for night life, the Abbey,
a hot gay bar. Though young and single, Rice says, "I don't really
lead a party life like I used to. But my social group kind of centers
[at the Abbey]. It's their hub."</TE>
<TE>   Often, at 9 or 10 at night, he does "this very odd thing that my
friends all think is pretty bizarre." He drives over Beverly Glen to
the San Fernando Valley, drives down Ventura Boulevard and then back
up over Laurel Canyon. "There's something about snaking through those
hills alone at night, listening to my car radio, that is kind of
liberating and frees up my mind."</TE>
<TE>   As he drives, enjoying "the sense of space and freedom that is
very much what drew me here," he is also thinking about the book he
is writing. "It's usually what I do when the plot is taking too much
shape and too many ideas are fighting for control and I have to kind
of step back and let go."</TE>
<TE>   He finds L.A. "wonderfully different" from New Orleans and the
"spoiled brat existence" living under his parents' roof. While he
remains close to his family, he says, "Here, I feel like an adult,
not the odd man out with these fantasies of being a screenwriter. I
fell into a step I'd been wanting to walk."</TE>

<LD>"Look," Sarah's mother said, "the storm is over! The clouds are
drifting away. There is even a rainbow in the sky to show us that
it's going to be a pretty day for Easter after all!"</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly Sarah's father came in from the barn, where he had been
working during the storm. He was surprised to see an empty Easter
basket and 12 baby chicks scurrying around on the rug.</LD>
<LD>   When Sarah told her father about their splashy-wet trip to the
flower garden, he patted the top of her head and said, "For a moment,
honey, I thought the 12 colored eggs in your Easter basket had
hatched!" Sarah and her mother laughed.</LD>
<TE>   Just then they all heard a "cluck, cluck, cluck" at the kitchen
door. "Brownie can't wait for me to bring her chicks back to her,"
Sarah said. So she gathered them up and put them back into her Easter
basket, which was nice and dry now. Then she carried it out into the
sunshine and set it down on the shiny green grass. Twelve chirping
chicks scrambled out. Brownie greeted them with clucks of happiness
and took them off to find wiggly little earthworms that had come out
after the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Easter!" Sarah called.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah stood still for a moment and looked at the beautiful rainbow
that reached across the sky. Then she went back inside the farmhouse.
She still had 12 beautifully colored Easter eggs to put back into her
Easter basket.</TE>
<TE>   "Mommy," Sarah said, "I think this is the very best Easter I've
ever had!"</TE>

<HD>Moreau at Her Best in 'Bay of Angels'</HD>
<DH>The seldom-seen 1963 classic about the compulsion to gamble
is a perfect showcase for several film talents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the performances that have made Jeanne Moreau revered among
actresses, her work in "Bay of Angels" is one of the most compelling
and one of the least seen.</LD>
<LD>   Directed in 1963 by Jacques Demy, "Bay of Angels" has been
unavailable theatrically in this country for nearly 40 years. But a
new 35-millimeter wide-screen print has been struck, and this
celebrated film is once again open for business, playing at the Nuart
in West Los Angeles for one week.</LD>
<LD>   This was only the second feature for writer-director Demy, one of
the more underappreciated of the French New Wave directors, and,
right from its bravura opening, the film's intense tone couldn't be
more different from the lighter romanticism that characterized
"Lola," his debut, and his later "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg."</LD>
<TE>   That credit sequence starts with a close-up of Moreau's face in an
iris circle. Then the image widens to fill the screen and the camera,
likely mounted on the back of a car, suddenly pulls away from her,
briskly and vertiginously swooping backward for more than a minute as
it travels along the boardwalk paralleling the bay in Nice that gives
the film its name.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of "Bay of Angels" is gambling. Not as a way to pass
the time or make a little money, but gambling as a compulsion as
powerful and seductive as love, a drive so strong it literally
functions as a reason to live.</TE>
<TE>   Because "Bay of Angels" reveals rather than moralizes, because its
concerns are character and psychology, it's a potent showcase for
Moreau's gifts. Her Jackie Demaistre is a mesmerizing, compulsively
watchable performance, one of the few films roles you literally hold
your breath watching. To quote a bowled-over Pauline Kael, "the
picture, almost an emanation of Moreau, is inconceivable without
her."</TE>
<TE>   Before we meet Moreau's Jackie, we are introduced to Jean Fournier
(a cool and effective Claude Mann), a Parisian bank employee. He
hasn't given gambling a thought until a friend takes him along to a
casino. Suddenly, he's won half a year's pay in less than an hour at
the roulette table, and he has the fever. His father is disgusted,
but Jean is convinced that his head is not going to be turned, that
his feet are firmly on the ground. That's when he meets Jackie.</TE>
<TE>   Impeccably dressed in a chic white Pierre Cardin suit,
compulsively smoking and constantly pushing back her thick, dyed
blond hair, Jackie is a mystery that can never be solved.
Intelligent, passionate, with a gaze so intense it is all but
intoxicating, Jackie is committed, body and soul, to placing her
bets.</TE>
<TE>   "The happiness gambling gives me," she says, "can't be compared to
any other." She's drawn not to the money, but to the action, to the
"stupid mixture of luxury and poverty" that seems to be the gambler's
life. The first time she entered a casino, she says, "I felt like I
was in a church." Having sacrificed a wealthy husband and a young
child to her religion, she has no intention of stopping.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie and Jean make an incendiary pair. She introduces him to a
lifestyle he never knew existed, to exhilarating highs of wealth and
the debilitating lows of being tapped out. Jean falls in love with
her--it's inconceivable that anyone wouldn't--but Jackie is not
exactly inclined to settle down. In her suitcase, for instance, is a
miniature roulette wheel that she keeps in reserve for the times when
she has no money for casinos. She's happily played alone, she says,
for days.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Moreau's incandescent performance and the writing and
directing that made it possible, "Bay of Angels" benefits enormously
from the contributions of Demy's collaborators, starting with
cinematographer Jean Rabier, whose crisp, indelible blacks and whites
seem to have a vivid life of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Bay of Angels" also elicited one of the best scores of Michel
Legrand's long and varied career. When the action at the roulette
wheel heats up, when Jackie and Jean start to gamble with true
abandon, it's Legrand's propulsive music that helps us feel the
exhilaration, the sense of giving yourself to the glories of the
moment, that we often hear about in gambling films but rarely get to
share.</TE>

<HD>Grammys May Make N.Y. Move</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Grammy Awards appear to be going Gotham.</LD>
<LD>   After a four-year stay in Los Angeles, the premier awards gala in
the music world looks to be returning next February to the industry's
other company town, New York.</LD>
<LD>   Grammy officials confirmed Thursday that they have scheduled a
Wednesday press conference in New York, and although they won't
discuss the topic, the site of the Grammy announcements in past years
has been a sure sign of the upcoming show's location. New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg will attend the conference as well, suggesting
an announcement of some import, such as the show's return to the East
Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Officials with the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences,
the Grammys' sponsor, declined to comment Thursday about next year's
show. "We have made no announcement whatsoever about the 45th annual
Grammys," academy spokesman Ron W. Roecker said. "We do have a press
conference scheduled in New York City next week."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, the home for the first 13 Grammys, has played host to
the event 34 times, and New York has done so nine times, five in the
1990s. L.A.'s Staples Center, designed in part with an eye to
becoming the West Coast home to the show, has been the site of the
past three Grammy shows, and the Shrine Auditorium housed the show in
1999. Based on past interviews with Grammy officials, the most likely
New York venue for the Grammys is Madison Square Garden, the site in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Garden almost became a last-minute home to the Grammys this
year. A month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan,
Grammy chief Michael Greene said he had hoped to switch the show back
east as a gesture of support for the beleaguered metropolis. The
logistics, though, proved too difficult, so the gala, defined by big
wins for New Yorker Alicia Keys and the ''O Brother, Where Art
Thou?'' soundtrack, stayed in the Los Angeles arena.</TE>
<TE>   The shift east is not a surprise, even without the ongoing
national romance with New York following the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Greene has often said the ideal approach for the show would be
alternating between the music industry hubs. There were many whispers
in the music industry that Greene, viewed as a controversial and
controlling figure in the industry, would not take the show back to
New York until former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had left office. The
fiery mayor took some public shots at Greene and his show in 1997
after some unkind comments the Grammy chief allegedly made to a City
Hall staffer.</TE>
<TE>   Greene has shrugged off any suggestion that the feud played a part
in the show's planning, but it will be Bloomberg, not Giuliani,
standing next to Greene next week. The Grammys are more than a mere
trophy for the hosting city. The show is broadcast in 161 countries
and generates an estimated $20 million to $40 million for the host
city. The show has also grown to include a week's worth of parties,
concerts and cultural events that extend well beyond its three-hour
television broadcast.</TE>

<DH>Phil Hendrie parodies talk radio by playacting a variety of
call-in guests. Listeners not in on the joke rise to the bait, dial
up--and vent.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he hears "I usually don't call in to radio shows, but I can't
believe what this guy is saying," Phil Hendrie knows he's hooked
another one.</LD>
<LD>   The caller is incredulous about the moronic or deviant suggestions
of the guest on Hendrie's program, whether it's a Catholic priest
rationalizing molestation or a columnist saying the elderly should
forgo air-conditioning during power shortages so celebrities can keep
cool. Often, Hendrie joins the outraged listener in berating the
guest. All the while, he keeps reeling in the caller, who is
thrashing and gnashing like a prize marlin.</LD>
<LD>   Then he cuts the line. The caller is mercifully gone, and Hendrie
reveals, to those few in the audience who don't already know, that
the entire thing was a comedy bit, and that it was Hendrie playing
the part of the outrageous guest--who exists solely to incite and
attract callers. Every "guest" on his show is actually a character
that Hendrie plays--he has about 40 in his repertoire--in what he
calls "interactive improv." It's not talk radio, but a parody of that
medium, and a satire of society in general.</LD>
<TE>   "The humor is dark. We deal with issues that are close to the
heart," said Hendrie, 49, whose program airs weeknights from 7 to 10
p.m. on KFI-AM (640) locally and on 89 other stations around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In his studio in Sherman Oaks, Hendrie sits at a desk examining
the day's headlines with a bank of old-style telephones arrayed in
front of him. During the show, he speaks into one as a character,
making it sound as if the guest is calling from a busy street, then
hits a switch and flashes to his own, crystal-clear microphone. On
the air, Hendrie and the guest continually interrupt each other,
almost sounding like they're talking over each other. Even to see it
in the studio, the technique is impressive and hard to believe, and
the act has attracted fans including Howard Stern and George Carlin.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from them, Hendrie's audience averages about 163,000
listeners per week in Southern California. And according to the
latest Arbitron ratings for fall 2001, he ranked second in his time
slot in Los Angeles among listeners ages 25 to 54, placing behind the
Spanish-language love songs on KLVE-FM (107.3).</TE>
<TE>   Soon Hendrie may be taking his act to television. He recently
signed a deal with NBC to develop a series, though he said he'd
rather express his creativity behind the camera than in front of it.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is doing what Phil is doing. When it's really unique and
dynamic, the likelihood of success is tremendous," said George Oliva,
the former program manager at KFI, who brought Rush Limbaugh and Dr.
Laura Schlessinger to the station, and who liked Hendrie so much, he
fired him in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I really enjoy the show. I think he shows incredible creativity,
and he's been able to make points in a very different way, using
satire," Oliva said. "I think he needed to go out and find a unique
voice. And Lord knows, he did more than that."</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, to talk about the Academy Awards, Hendrie
assumed a regular character, Doug Danger, an entertainment reporter
for the "Orange County Courier," who prefaces nearly every sentence
saying, "I am a gay man and a gay journalist." He said the big story
of the Oscars was not whether Halle Berry would break the color
barrier but whether Ian McKellen would win as the first openly gay
Oscar-nominated actor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of America is looking to see if we're going to get
the big gay win," the character said. As for African American women,
he noted that Hattie McDaniel won a supporting actress award for
"Gone With the Wind" in 1939, "so they got theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrie's characters at first seem harmless, or at worst odd. The
more Hendrie talks to them, however, the more it becomes clear that
these folks are deranged yet cocksure of their sobriety.</TE>
<TE>   The comedy comes not only from the outrageous things his
characters say, but from the sputtering exasperation and incredulity
of the disgusted people who phone in. According to Hendrie, 95% to
98% of his listeners are in on the joke, so he relies on the small
percentage who haven't figured it out, or who tune in accidentally
and feel compelled to call. And there are always plenty of callers.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrie said he knows he can go too far. During the anthrax scare
last year, Hendrie had a character say she just came from the doctor
and had been diagnosed with smallpox. After a while, she said she was
only kidding.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience was [angry]. They were really scared," Hendrie said.
"I went home that night believing I had lost a couple of radio
stations."</TE>
<TE>   He said he first became entranced by radio in 1958, when his
family took a car trip from Los Angeles to Toronto to see relatives.
His father kept the AM tuner on while driving all night, and the
5-year-old Hendrie was fascinated by the stations as they faded in
and out.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite deejay was "Emperor" Bob Hudson on KRLA. Hudson would
say he was broadcasting from a leopard-skin room where young women
fed him grapes, and at the end of the morning he ordered the peasants
to clear the freeway so he could head home.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 12 years old, I rode my bicycle over to KRLA," Hendrie
said, and discovered there was no leopard-skin room, no potentate in
ermine robes. "What I did see was a disc jockey in a sweatshirt and
bedroom slippers. Rather than being disappointed, I was thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   He saw what a man alone in a room could create with a microphone,
an audience and an imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Hendrie didn't put his own talents into play when he got
his first job, at age 19 at a tiny station outside Orlando, Fla. Nor
did he cut loose at any of the subsequent stations where he worked
around the county, leading back to Los Angeles, where he spun records
at KLSX when it was classic rock. He also did a weekend talk show on
KFI. But he was miserable, and his bosses saw that.</TE>
<TE>   He got his chance when first KLSX, then KFI, fired him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was coming to work every weekend just bored to tears. I'm glad
they fired me," he said, though that meant a few lean months looking
for work. Digging into his penny jar, with no car or bicycle, he was
walking to the post office mailing audition tapes when tiny KVEN in
Ventura gave him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "They allowed me to do anything I wanted to do. That became the
place I was able to get my chops down, and experiment with
everybody," he said. "I saw it as an opportunity to groom myself as
an entertainer, and stop being the purveyor of somebody else's art."</TE>
<TE>   In late September 1990, during the buildup to the Gulf War,
Hendrie decided to introduce Raj Feneen, an expatriate Iraqi shoe
salesman, who said Saddam Hussein was simply misunderstood. Incensed
callers wanted to vent on Feneen.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I said, 'Well, this is interesting. Let's see if we
can do this every day,'" Hendrie said.</TE>
<TE>   After 18 months in Ventura, he took his menagerie of characters to
Atlanta, Minneapolis and then Miami. When that station was sold, he
was transferred to Los Angeles--back to KFI.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really happy to come here. I was interested in proving
myself in this market," he said. But between his return to L.A. and
his deal with NBC, Hendrie jokes that he's becoming the type of
celebrity he loves to skewer.</TE>
<TE>   His first day back in Los Angeles in 1996, he said he found
himself walking down Ventura Boulevard talking on his cell phone, on
his way to meet his agent. He thought, "I haven't been in town 12
hours; I'm a cliche already."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hendrie isn't much like his on-air persona. He wants to
retire in 10 years so he's still young enough to go on archeological
digs. He's a history buff. Yet he makes flatulence jokes on the air
and basically earns his living pulling a three-hour phone prank on
America every night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thrilled to do what I'm doing for a living," Hendrie
said. "Everybody should go to work anticipating the [trouble] you can
stir up every day."</TE>

<HD>A Favorite Uncle Who Found His Medium</HD>
<DH>No wonder Milton Berle became 'Mr. Television': The format
inspired and revealed his highest gifts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES CHAMPLIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His timing was historically perfect. It was as if Milton Berle, who
died Wednesday after a brief illness at the age of 93, had spent his
life from early childhood perfecting the comedic skills that would
let him beguile television's huge yet intimate audiences.</LD>
<LD>   For its part, television needed a charismatic personality to
symbolize its new dominance as the great mass medium of
entertainment. The man and the medium found each other, to the
delight of the many millions of us who surrendered our Tuesday nights
to Berle.</LD>
<LD>   Someone, a publicist probably, once called Berle "The Thief of
Badgags." But the truth was that Berle was larger than the sum of all
the jokes he retained in his card file-like memory. Like Lucille
Ball, his nearest counterpart among his contemporaries, Milton Berle
was pure clown, a personality whose highest gifts, like Ball's,
television inspired and revealed.</LD>
<TE>   Berle had seen it coming. He said he remembered doing experimental
television transmissions in New York in, he thought, the late '20s,
wearing green makeup, which the primitive TV cameras saw best. Yet
even Berle at his most optimistic could not have guessed the day when
he could fairly be called Mr. Television.</TE>
<TE>   The most vivid memories some of us retain from his "Texaco Star
Theater" days were of Uncle Miltie in drag as the least likely female
impersonator of all time. He was a master of the delightfully
preposterous, the willing and calculated self-mockery.</TE>
<TE>   William Thomas, retired editor of The Times and a longtime friend
of Berle's, said Wednesday, "At lunch, Milton would talk about the
structure of comedy. He thought about it. He lectured about it at
universities."</TE>
<TE>   He had learned it the hard way. He had faced small and sometimes
hostile or indifferent audiences (one as bad as the other) in
vaudeville, and had learned to convert drunken heckling to laughter
in nightclubs. There was a lot of fun along the way, as he recalled
in his autobiography. Yet I find myself remembering the famous
anecdote about the English comic actor Edmund Gwenn.</TE>
<TE>   A friend, visiting Gwenn as he lay dying painfully in hospital,
said, "Eddie, it must be tough." Gwenn is said to have replied, "Yes,
but comedy is tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Although in his early days Berle was a master of the joke, jokes
in rapid-fire succession on almost any subject anybody could name, he
reached television not as a teller of jokes, but as a personality, a
characterization all his own, as Jack Benny's and Bob Hope's were all
their own. He moved through skits with a dancer's physical assurance,
and he played a man whose dignity and confidence were always in
peril, as if there were banana peels lurking at every step. Like
Ball, he did not mind making himself a figure of fun because that,
after all, was the name of the game, and he played it supremely well.</TE>
<TE>   During his days as a kid in vaudeville, magicians on the bill
would show him card tricks, and in later life Berle could have
probably made a sub-career out of hand magic. One day at lunch, he
demonstrated a trick that involved one of my fellow editors picking a
card, concealing it back in the pack and then telling Berle what the
card had been. Berle then invited my colleague to find the card in
the pack again. My friend went through the pack, card by card, while
the rest of us grinned. The card was stuck to Berle's forehead.</TE>
<TE>   He was a funny magician too.</TE>
<TE>   It is always easy to say that the end of an era has been reached.
Yet there is only Bob Hope, seriously ailing and reclusive, of
Berle's close contemporaries. The gang that used to lunch together at
the Friars Club, Jack Benny and George Burns and the other great
comics are gone too. Of his younger contemporaries, Red Buttons is
one of the few who came up the same hard-learning road via burlesque,
the Catskill hotels (themselves now an endangered and fading species)
and nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   New generations of comedians have come along, nurtured at coffee
houses and college appearances. The cleverest of them are very
entertaining, but it is not clear who among them could keep us at
home on Tuesday nights, year after year. Berle was a majestically
funny presence, and we were all fortunate to have him among us as
long as we did.</TE>

<HD>Garrett Sticks With 'Happy' Sound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can say this about alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett: He knows how
he wants his music to sound.</LD>
<LD>   Opening a six-night run at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Tuesday, he
arrived with the same players and the same musical focus present
during his appearance at the same venue a year and a half ago.</LD>
<LD>   What was new was a program of selections largely drawn from his
just released album, "Happy People." The pieces--especially the title
track and the rhythmic "Tango in 6"--added welcome contrast to a set
that might otherwise have remained too locked into a monochromatic
level of high intensity.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, Garrett's soloing, with its torrents of notes, its bold
strokes of sound and its masterful virtuosity, could hardly be
described as anything less than charismatic. At 41, he has been on
the jazz scene for more than two decades, an original improvisational
stylist virtually since the release of his first album in the
mid-'80s. Kicking off his Catalina set with a race-horse up tempo, he
displayed, virtually from note one, the combination of fast fingers
and probing musical inventiveness that has characterized his work
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Vernell Brown Jr. and bassist Charnett Moffett worked
together with the fluency of players who have performed in tandem
over an extended period. Brown's piquant blend of bop phrases with
robust chording interfaced smoothly with the dependable Moffett's
surging rhythmic flow and articulate soloing.</TE>
<TE>   As in the previous appearance of the Garrett group, however,
drummer Chris Dave seemed less a part of the rhythm team than a
free-lancing soloist determinedly following his own musical path.
Dropping rhythmic bombs randomly in the middle of solos by other
group members, generating percussive climaxes at points unrelated to
the overall musical flow, he made contributions impressive for their
technical expertise, but distracting for their failure to enhance and
support the ensemble efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the fact is that Dave's continuing association with
Garrett, while playing in essentially the same style, obviously means
that what he offers is what Garrett wants to hear. But one couldn't
help but wonder how the music of "Happy People"--which includes some
of Garrett's most engagingly melodic efforts--would have sounded in
more emotionally varied, less rhythmically repetitious
interpretations.</TE>

<HD>Love Takes Multiple Routes in 'Drift'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quentin Lee's "Drift" is a tender and acutely personal exploration of
the breakup of a three-year relationship that culminates in the
filmmaker offering three possibilities of the path the lovers' lives
take afterward. By the time Lee has set up his story and played out
his different scenarios, he has left us with a sense of what it's
like for young people to discover the possibilities, the limitations
and unexpected twists and turns of love.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan (R.T. Lee) is a nice-looking Chinese Canadian living in L.A.
and working in a coffee shop while trying to make it as a
scriptwriter. He's in a comfortable relationship with Joel (Greyson
Dayne), who designs Web sites for the Gay and Lesbian Center. Ryan is
passionate about his writing, literature and movies, while Joel is an
ordinary guy with ordinary tastes who continually tells his lover he
thinks too much.</LD>
<LD>   One day, Ryan meets a fellow Canadian, a 20-year-old student named
Leo (Jonathon Roessler) who shares his interests with the same
intensity. Now Ryan can no longer deny he's long been unsatisfied
with his relationship with Joel despite their mutual love.</LD>
<TE>   It is at this point that Lee imagines different fates for Ryan and
Joel. In doing so, he raises a variety of possibilities. What if
Ryan, after a fling with Leo, discovers he is still in love with
Joel, but that the discovery has come too late? Or what if both
lovers have flings and both discover that they're in love with each
other, with Ryan realizing he's underestimated Joel and Joel agreeing
to be more open to all that Ryan cherishes so dearly?</TE>
<TE>   Lee explores these possibilities with equal credibility, which has
the effect of underlining how difficult it is for people to know
themselves fully, let alone others. In this light, Ryan commands
respect for being honest with himself and Joel, and for not settling
for a relationship merely because it is comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "Drift" is a slender, intimate tale that is thoughtful and
revealing, nicely written, directed and acted. Desi del Valle's
Carrie and Sebastien Guy's Matt are Ryan's best friends, both caring,
sympathetic and encouraging. It is a worthy follow-up to Lee's
larger-scale debut feature, the jaunty dark comedy "Shopping with
Fangs."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are some intriguing contrasting elements at work this week in
the duo performance of clarinetist Eddie Daniels and pianist Fred
Hersch at the Jazz Bakery. The programs, all of which are being
recorded for a CD, echo a similar duet appearance last year by
Daniels and pianist Roger Kellaway.</LD>
<LD>   The Daniels-Kellaway performance was an almost symbiotic creative
encounter between players with similarly high-energy, virtuosic
styles. Daniels and Hersch make a far different combination, one in
which a rich potential for emotional layering is blended around a
similarly high degree of technical expertise.</LD>
<LD>   In Wednesday night's opening set, there were moments in which the
two players still seemed to be feeling their way through the musical
relationship. In the opening tune, for example--a gorgeous, floating
line written by Hersch, titled "Endless Stars"--Daniels and Hersch
both began their solos softly before moving into more intense,
multi-noted areas, somewhat undercutting the song's lyrical
qualities.</LD>
<TE>   Similar uncertainties popped up on other material--not surprising,
given the fact that the duo had only a day of rehearsal in which to
work out the material and, more important, find an expressive
linkage.</TE>
<TE>   Other numbers displayed considerably more creative potential, once
that expressive linkage began to come into place. One of the best was
a fascinating rendering of "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You," in
which the theme emerged through various bits and pieces of
fragmentation, building to a passage in which the melody was tossed
back and forth, and climaxing with a stunning, unaccompanied passage
by Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus: Hersch's "At the Close of the Day," based on a poem
by Walt Whitman, and tango-tinged "Canzona," along with Daniels'
"Summer's Gone," offered composed material with plenty of potential
for spontaneous variation and improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   By the close of the set, the creative, compositional and emotional
synchronization between Hersch and Daniels had come fully into focus.
At that point it became clear that what was ultimately most appealing
about their musical rendezvous was the coming together of their
differences--the manner in which each found, within his individual
art, a thematic route to connect with the other.</TE>

<HD>Those Drug Ads Have Side Effects--on Wallets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NOEL HOLSTON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sickest joke on TV the last couple of years hasn't come from
"Jackass" or "South Park." Its source is pharmaceutical
advertising--those upbeat commercials for prescription drugs that end
with rapid recitations to the effect that the pill that may relieve
your allergies or indigestion may also give you cotton mouth,
dizziness, diarrhea or ingrown toenails, meanwhile predisposing any
child you procreate to chronic diaper rash. The ads are so perversely
funny, they're like "Saturday Night Live" parodies of commercials.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it turns out, they're not so comical after all. They're the
sugar-coating on a pill many consumers may find difficult to swallow.
They may be pushing the cost of drugs to record highs.</LD>
<LD>   According to this month's AARP Bulletin, mass-media advertising by
the drug industry jumped from $791 million in 1996 to almost $2.5
billion in 2000. Retail spending on prescription drugs hit $131.9
billion, up $21 billion from 1999. Critics, including some doctors
and members of Congress, argue that the two statistics are linked.</LD>
<TE>   The guess here is that most folks don't have a clear memory of
when prescription-drug advertising began, or why. For a long time,
drug advertising on TV meant Alka-Seltzer's "I can't believe I ate
the whole thing" spots and hammers-in-your-head demonstrations on
behalf of over-the-counter headache remedies. They were so common
that singer-songwriter Ray Stevens parodied the ads in a musical
pitch for "the wonder drug that cures all your ills--Jeremiah
Peabody's polyunsaturated, quick-dissolving, fast-acting,
pleasant-tasting, green and purple pills."</TE>
<TE>   The explosion of prescription-drug commercials, complete with
obligatory and often blood-curdling disclaimers, began when the Food
and Drug Administration relaxed its rules on TV advertising in 1997.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers leaped at the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Vioxx, a Merck medication for arthritis pain, the most
recent commercials for which feature former Olympic figure skating
champion Dorothy Hamill. A study by the National Institute for Health
Care Management found that Merck spent $161 million advertising Vioxx
in 2000--more than Pepsi's $125-million ad bill for the year or
Budweiser's $146 million. It's reasonably certain that Vioxx provided
more health benefits than colas or beer. On the other hand, neither
is likely to wind up on our Medicare tab.</TE>
<TE>   The drug industry's response to spoilsports is that such
advertising informs consumers about new medications and alerts them
to health problems, thus providing a public service. And it's not as
if people who see the flashy ads can simply run out and buy the drug,
the industry line goes; it's still up to their physicians to say yea
or nay.</TE>
<TE>   What that reasoning ignores, however, is that the bulk of the
industry's overall $16-billion promotional spending in 2000 went to
free samples for doctors and courting them with free meals,
all-expenses-paid trips to conferences and other incentives to give
the advertising targets what they ask for.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so the drug companies market like mad. Where's the harm?
Critics say the ads drive up health-care costs because they push the
newest, most expensive drugs. For example, the heartburn remedy
Prilosec costs about 13 times as much as the leading generic
equivalent. If price is now mainly an issue between drug companies
and consumers, it could eventually drive up the cost of Medicare
benefits and thus affect everyone who pays taxes, not just those who
suffer from acid reflux or chronic indigestion.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has shown no indications of reversing its decision on
direct-to-consumer drug ads, nor should it, necessarily. One could
certainly argue that if TV can be used to promote foods that give
people heartburn and high cholesterol, the least the FDA can do is
give antidotes a fair shot. It would be nice, however, if the issue
got a good debating on some TV programs. This would be a great topic
for "Nightline," assuming that ABC doesn't cancel it.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the market may correct itself. There's a certain irony
in the possibility that relief may be spelled GM and Ford. They're
among a growing number of corporations that, according to a recent
article in the Wall Street Journal, have been hit so hard by their
workers and retirees' use of heavily advertised, costlier
prescription drugs that they've launched campaigns to promote
generics.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, four out of five TV critics recommend taking a chill
pill and resisting those spicy fried chicken fingers.</TE>

<LD>They zoom, they swoop, they streak. They sweat, they fret, they
anguish. They schmooze in the squadron bar.</LD>
<LD>   Cleared for takeoff on CBS is "AFP: American Fighter Pilot," a
documentary-style series, with actual fliers, benefiting from Air
Force salutes and the tailwinds of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   At the top of the show comes that terrible encore--news footage of
a commandeered jetliner slamming into one of New York's twin
towers--dissolving to President Bush saying, "A great people has been
moved to defend a great nation," and an off-camera voice announcing:
"In the end, war awaits, and the nation is calling for heroes."</LD>
<TE>   Here they are tonight, right on cue, even though "American Fighter
Pilot" was conceived more than two years ago and its eight episodes
taped mostly before last year's terrorist attacks, which seem to have
warmed audiences to movie and TV accounts of U.S. forces in action.</TE>
<TE>   Although shooting was completed, the series was updated with
interviews and other material to reflect America's biggest, bloodiest
nightmare of the young millennium. "We're not going to let that
happen again," a pilot here vows about Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing its Air Force brand and never-again fervor like campaign
ribbons, "American Fighter Pilot" raises the troubling question of
how far impresarios of prime time will go to make the world safe for
democracy. And with whom in officialdom they will collude on behalf
of putting on a profitable show with legs.</TE>
<TE>   That applies to any series or movie made with the participation
and blessing of the military or an arm of government, however
patriotic and noble the intent at a time when Americans instinctively
want to unite behind their leaders in opposing terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But surely not at the expense of entertainment shows becoming
government mouthpieces.</TE>
<TE>   "American Fighter Pilot" is the first of the post-Sept. 11
so-called "reality" series sounding a bugle for the nation's
warriors, roaring out of the blocks ahead of Pentagon-approved shows
from VH1 and ABC, whose coming "Profiles From the Front Line" is
produced by Jerry Bruckheimer ("Pearl Harbor").</TE>
<TE>   Air Force brass, who granted "American Fighter Pilot" rare access,
have seen the series. "And they love it," executive producer Tony
Scott ("Top Gun") told reporters in a conference call recently.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, for its trio of F-15 fighter pilot trainees is the
latest in a glamorizing line extending back more than 60 years to Ray
Milland, William Holden and Wayne Morris as fictional student flyboys
in "I Wanted Wings" at the onset of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The difference? Officers Todd Giggy, Marcus Gregory and Mike Love
(who at age 28 is the senior member of this group) are real--three
spotlighted fliers in a class of eight learning from instructors with
such nicknames as Bubba, Bean, Stump and Shark in 110 days of
rigorous training at Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Growls Bubba: "We don't carry briefcases, we don't use umbrellas
and we damn sure don't color our hair!"</TE>
<TE>   He means Giggy's dye job, for just as Gregory is a devout,
church-going Christian and Love the sober father of two young sons,
this cocky yellow-top is the Tom Cruise maverick competing for "top
gun" honors. He surfs, rides a motorcycle, drives a red Porsche,
calls his comrades "dudes" and returns home each night to a golden
wife. If he doesn't cut it here, there's always "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   But is Giggy too big for his flight britches? Will he wash out
before getting a chance to "kick the living crap outta any MIG-29 on
the planet?" And do tough, manly, anti-wimp Air Force guys really say
"crap" when they mean something else? Or do they tailor their
euphemisms for the cameras?</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to freshen its demographics, gray-streaked CBS is again
throwing a Frisbee into the ring to attract the younger set that most
appeals to advertisers. In line with that, "American Fighter Pilot"
tries mightily in initial episodes to build suspense about Giggy's
future as he struggles to remain alive in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about him coincides with the high-style, low-content
flash of this series, which closely resembles the youth-oriented
documentaries of MTV: fast-cutting, grainy black-and-white inserts,
big graphics and choppy sound bites driven by loud, exciting,
pulsating drum music.</TE>
<TE>   Although MTV has employed that technique successfully with
subjects as epic as the Holocaust and the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., this paean to tape editing resonates on CBS as something of a
video game.</TE>
<TE>   Although you taste a bit of the pressure they're facing, Giggy,
Gregory and Love are initially little more than pop-ups, assigned
with their instructors to roles that support military technology.
Undeveloped as characters, they take back seats to those $30-million
F-15s and the Air Force's arsenal of eye-catching training gizmos.</TE>
<TE>   Later episodes will return to the post-Sept. 11 hot war in
Afghanistan, as viewers learn the outcome of training. "At least one
of the pilots did make it through and is involved [in the war]
today," said another executive producer, Jesse Negron, during the
conference call. Negron said he couldn't disclose more because it was
"classified."</TE>
<TE>   A reporter wanted to know if Negron meant "classified" by the Air
Force or the show. He responded carefully, saying only that he was
able to "go to a neutral area and ask them [pilots] general questions
and things."</TE>
<TE>   Which is probably more access than the military grants news media
covering the anti-terrorism war. "A lot of the reasons the military
has a problem with the press" relate to "context," Negron explained.
"They trusted me that I was gonna tell the real story."</TE>
<TE>   Negron, who is best known for his work on the film "Pop &amp; Me,"
seemed to be saying that the Air Force finds entertainment producers
more trustworthy than journalists. They're surely more pliant.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Air Force checks the series to make sure nothing is
classified or can "compromise a pilot's safety," said Negron, it has
no editorial control. No need. Bank on the producers having done
nothing to offend the Air Force and endanger future access should the
series become a hit and they opt for "American Fighter Pilot 2."</TE>
<TE>   When flying high for your country in wartime, no sense shooting
yourself in the foot.</TE>
<TE>   "AFP: American Fighter Pilot" premieres tonight at 8 on CBS. The
network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children,
with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Cobham Covers the Spectrum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is drummer Billy Cobham a candidate for the "Whatever happened to
..." category? Not by a long shot, although he has not exactly been a
major presence in American jazz for far too long.</LD>
<LD>   Why the low visibility? Primarily because he's been living in
Switzerland for 23 years, appearing in Europe and virtually every
part of the world far more frequently than in the U.S. Next week he
performs at the Conga Room in one of his rare Southland appearances,
celebrating the re-release (via a DVD-A 5.1 surround sound Rhino
recording) of his 1973 album "Spectrum."</LD>
<LD>   Selected best jazz album at the time by Billboard magazine, the
recording--arguably one of the defining jazz fusion outings--featured
an ensemble that included, in addition to Cobham, guitarist Tommy
Bolin, keyboardist Jan Hammer and bassist Lee Sklar. But that's not
the group that will show up at the Conga Room.</LD>
<TE>   "I never actually took the band that did the original 'Spectrum'
recording out on the road," Cobham says. "And, of course, it's
impossible to do that now, because Tommy Bolin is dead and Jan Hammer
hasn't been willing to play a live concert in 25-plus years.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is that I hadn't played one note together with
Lee since the recording, either. He wanted me to come play with him
once in the Johnny Hallyday band in France, but that never came to
be. Then I ran into him in Australia in 1991 when he was with Phil
Collins. And he said, 'OK, you know what I'm going to say.' And I
said, 'I know, I know, we'll get together.' But it's finally
happening now."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Sklar, the current Spectrum group includes guitarist Dean
Brown and keyboardist Gary Husband--both of whom have worked
frequently with Cobham--in place of Bolin and Hammer.</TE>
<TE>   Cobham, who was born in Panama in 1946 and raised in New York from
the age of 3, has always been an artist with a creatively inquiring
mind. Fascinated by every aspect of music, he was still in his early
20s in the late '60s when jazz, rock, blues and electronics began to
coalesce into what eventually became known as jazz fusion.</TE>
<TE>   One of the vanguard artists who found a way to combine these
seemingly disparate elements, he performed with Miles Davis on
"Bitches Brew" and other important albums, worked with the jazz-rock
group Dreams and played a vital role in establishing the musical
direction of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   By the late '70s, he had become everyone's favorite versatile
drummer, capable of bringing imaginative new ideas to everything he
played. But he also began to feel too many restrictions on his own
creative notions.</TE>
<TE>   "Working in an environment where I had to really find a way to
survive made it important for me to put my nose to the grindstone and
come up with some ideas," he recalls. "And every time I did that, I'd
start to butt up against this rubber tree plant called the U.S.A.,
and I'd get knocked back.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't really do things in the way that I wanted to, because
economically it just wasn't feasible. For example, I couldn't play
locations that would justify my having a band with more than two
other people, plus maybe one person to set up the gear. And that just
wasn't quite what I had in mind artistically, so I just thought,
well, let me just try to do this someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Europe in general, and Geneva specifically, was that someplace
else. And Cobham found it to be a receptive destination.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the big pluses about being an American jazz artist is
that, if you've had any success at all, you carry a pretty heavy
torch when you leave this country. So it wasn't so tough for me to
get something happening, to sustain it and to build on it. There
were--and there are--major environments in Europe that love the
music."</TE>
<TE>   Cobham's success in establishing himself as an American jazz
artist residing in the middle of a continent that loves what he does
has opened up some attractive musical opportunities. A number of
projects produced through Cobham's Creative Multi-Media Concepts
company combine elements of art and education.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obviously superior creative opportunities that
Cobham's residence in Europe has provided, he's still not ready to
become a Swiss citizen, even though he has lived in the country long
enough to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I want that complication. I like my American
status the way it is, so I just leave everything alone. Sometimes you
need a break to take a look at what's here in America from outside
the shores. There's so much goodness in this country, but the problem
is how to use it, how to be positively effective, and how to
understand where you fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Cobham and his band perform at the Conga Room, 5364 Wilshire
Blvd., L.A., on Monday and Tuesday. Performances begin at 9:30 p.m.
and consist of two 60-minute sets. (323) 938-1696.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bowl Jazz 2002: The Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. has announced
that singer Dianne Reeves has been appointed to the newly created
post of creative chair for jazz, starting with the 2002 season and
continuing through May 2004. In addition to performing at the Bowl,
she reportedly will work to "build the Philharmonic's presence in the
musical community as a leading presenter of jazz."</TE>
<TE>   To do so, however, she will have to find a way to generate more
intriguing choices than are present in this year's lineup. Aside from
Reeves' presence on July 17 and a pair of other events--the Big Band
Blast on Aug. 21 featuring the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band and the
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, and an Aug. 28 performance with
Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Michael Brecker, Flora Purim and Airto
Moreira--it's hard to take the summer 2002 programming seriously as a
jazz schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves' evening, for example, described as a "Broadway and
Hollywood Salute to Billie Holiday" (a title that surely would have
generated a sarcastic laugh from Lady Day), also features Oleta
Adams, Alan Cumming, Lea DeLaria, Donna Murphy, Tom Wopat and
(thankfully) Jimmy Scott and the Terence Blanchard Quintet. Other
concerts are headlined by, among others, the Glenn Miller Orchestra,
salsa queen Celia Cruz, singers Tony Bennett and Natalie Cole, Isaac
Hayes, Maceo Parker and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.</TE>
<TE>   No offense to these artists, but positioning them at the Bowl as
"jazz" acts is not going to enhance the Philharmonic as a "leading
presenter of jazz."</TE>

<HD>'Rookie' Wins Without Throwing Curves</HD>
<DH>Starring Dennis Quaid, the emotional story about a
late-blooming pitcher's improbable but true success never pushes too
hard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's only fitting that "The Rookie" tells the true story of an
athlete who achieved improbable success, because this is a film that
overcomes considerable odds itself.</LD>
<LD>   Against all expectations, the Dennis Quaid-starring "Rookie" turns
out to be an unapologetically emotional film that doesn't make you
gag, one that manages to be sentimental without turning into a
shameless wallow.</LD>
<LD>   As described in Sports Illustrated and in a column by Times
sportswriter Bill Plaschke, the saga of pitcher Jim Morris defies
plausibility. A 35-year-old West Texas high school science teacher
and coach whose baseball dreams had ended 12 years earlier, Morris
became the oldest major league rookie in decades after being goaded
to try out by his players.</LD>
<TE>   The Walt Disney organization, never one to miss a marketing trick,
is pushing "Rookie" as being from "the studio that brought you
'Remember the Titans.'" This may be a crafty sales technique
("Titans" was a considerable success), but it is regrettably
misleading as well. With its old-fashioned feeling, quiet confidence
and an almost unheard-of G rating, "Rookie" has more in common with
something like "October Sky" than the excessively shameless and
simplistic "Titans."</TE>
<TE>   No one, of course, should expect an austere, somber piece of work
from director John Lee Hancock and writer Mike Rich. "The Rookie" is
not above providing assorted Hallmark moments about following your
dream, or casting the cutest kid imaginable (Angus T. Jones) as the
Morrises' 8-year-old son, Hunter. The film in general promotes the
pleasant fantasy that the world is basically a decent place where
events and people right themselves if given half a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what characterizes "The Rookie" is that this fantasy is
largely honestly earned. Both debuting director Hancock, who wrote
the Clint Eastwood-Kevin Costner film "A Perfect World," and
screenwriter Rich, whose feature debut was the treacly "Finding
Forrester," have managed not to push too hard here. They've given
"The Rookie" a lovely, relaxed feeling that makes us happy to be in
this film's company while allowing us to trust that it won't muck
things up with glibness or excess.</TE>
<TE>   Also helping to keep everything in balance is the cast, starting
with Dennis Quaid, a Texas native himself and able as always to
project a rugged, effortless decency. The equally reliable Rachel
Griffiths plays his wife, Lorri, and the protean Brian Cox, memorable
in darker roles ranging from "Manhunter" to "L.I.E.," brings the
right touch of implacability to Morris' unbending father, Jim Sr.
Even the smaller parts, like the players on Morris' high school team,
have been smartly cast by Ronna Kress.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief introduction establishing Big Lake, Texas, as a
place smiled on by "St. Rita, the patron saint of impossible dreams,"
"The Rookie" breaks its story into a trio of dovetailing sections,
each of which deals with different kinds of dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Up first is an extended flashback revealing Jim Morris' childhood
as a Navy brat forced to move frequently as a consequence of his
father's job as a Navy recruiter. The senior Morris is oblivious to,
if not actually contemptuous of, his son's dreams of athletic glory:
"There are more important things in life than baseball," he growls,
"and the sooner you figure that out, the better."</TE>
<TE>   The Morrises' last move takes them to Big Lake, a football-crazy
town that barely knows baseball exists. There we pick up the adult
Jim Morris, who is happily married and largely content with his job
as a science teacher-baseball coach. Largely, but not totally.</TE>
<TE>   For Morris, whose minor league career ended after four shoulder
operations, still goes out late at night and throws hard at a
deserted backstop. His childhood dream, we see, is still eating at
him, and the look on his face as he lets the ball go--faster, it
turns out, than he knows--shows how much bottling up that ambition
has cost him.</TE>
<TE>   When Morris chides his team after a lopsided loss, making the
classic "you quit on me, and worse, you quit on yourselves" speech,
and talks to them about not giving up on their dreams, the kids
challenge him about giving up on his. Finally, a pact is made: If his
perennially losing team gets to the state playoffs, Morris will go to
a major league tryout. (Apparently this really did happen.)</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a soothsayer to figure out what happens from here
on in, but "The Rookie" doesn't shortchange the difficulties involved
for Morris, his wife, his team, even his estranged father. The
pleasure of a film like this is not in wondering where it's going to
go, but in knowing its exact trajectory. Getting us to pull for a
foregone conclusion as if the outcome was in serious doubt is no
small sleight of hand.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sara Sugarman's "Very Annie-Mary" is an ingratiating Welsh comedy
starring Rachel Griffiths in the title role as a jaunty but repressed
and frumpy 33-year-old spinster who lives with her father (Jonathan
Pryce) behind their bakery in a row of stone houses in the quaint
village of Ogw. At 15, Annie-Mary took the top prize in Wales' most
important singing competition, which included a scholarship to study
in Milan.</LD>
<LD>   But her mother was dying, and her father, regarded locally as
Wales' greatest tenor, made it clear she was needed to stay home and
help out at the bakery. Her preening, self-important father, in fact,
has never treated his only child with anything but contempt,
reserving his greatest scorn for her singing voice. As a result, she
hasn't sung since.</LD>
<LD>   Despite her sorry lot, Annie-Mary, while a dutiful daughter, still
has spirit and hope, both for romance and especially for getting out
of her father's house. She has come upon an old house for sale that
is invitingly situated on the crest of a hill. The place can be hers
for a down payment of only 120 pounds. Just as she's figuring out how
she can get her hands on the money, a drastic turn of events looks to
crush her modest dreams--or just possibly provide her with a way to
assert herself at last.</LD>
<TE>   At 105 minutes, "Very Annie-Mary" is too long by roughly 15
minutes, but it does provide its versatile stars with highly
enjoyable roles. Griffiths--who has "Muriel's Wedding," "Hilary and
Jackie" and HBO's "Six Feet Under" among her credits--is a constant
delight as the irrepressible Annie-Mary, and so is Pryce as her
amusingly nasty father. There are numerous hearty supporting players,
and Joanna Page is affecting as Annie-Mary's only really close
friend, a dying 16-year-old who is wise and without self-pity. "Very
Annie-Mary" is familiar but winningly funny and good-hearted.</TE>

<HD>Reliving His Field Dreams</HD>
<DH>Movies: The real rookie managed to find common ground with
his on-screen counterpart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Morris recalls the magical evening he made his debut as a major
league pitcher--a turning point in the life of the 38-year-old lefty
and one that is re-created in the new true-life baseball saga "The
Rookie."</LD>
<LD>   "You have got to understand that at 12:30 that morning, I get told
I am going back to my home state [Texas] after losing the triple-A
playoffs," Morris recalls of that day three years ago. "I am getting
to wear a big league uniform and I get to see my family for the first
time in three months and do something I have wanted since I was 5
years old. Not only that, I get to play and I strike out the first
guy I faced. The day just kept getting better and better."</LD>
<LD>   The filmmakers got permission to shoot that scene at the Texas
Rangers' Arlington Stadium, where Morris first pitched in "the show."
It took place during the seventh-inning stretch of a real game last
summer "We had only a minute and a half to shoot it," recalls Dennis
Quaid, who plays Morris in the film.</LD>
<TE>   "We were re-creating the moment that was the culmination of his
lifelong dream in the very same stadium where it happened," Quaid
says. "I have seen footage of it with him running out [of the
bullpen], and when he got up to the mound, the coach was talking to
him and he was just kind of shaking his head."</TE>
<TE>   "The Rookie," which opens today, is "The Natural" filtered through
a Frank Capra sensibility. (The Disney release is also one of the
rare non-animated films to get a G rating). Directed by John Lee
Hancock from a script by Mike Rich, (who also wrote the basketball
drama "Finding Forrester"), "The Rookie" chronicles how Morris, a
high school science teacher and father of three young children, got a
second chance to pursue his dream of pitching in the major leagues.
After being drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 1983, Morris played
in the minors for five years until a severe shoulder and elbow injury
forced him to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Morris found a new career in his hometown of Big Lake, Texas, as a
baseball coach and chemistry teacher at the local high school. Three
years ago, the team members told their coach that if they won the
division championship, he would have to try out for the majors. When
the team did win, Morris pitched at a local tryout for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays and astonished the scouts by pitching 98 mph fastballs.
Although he was 35 at the time, the Devil Rays signed him to its
minor league team and he was later brought up to the majors--the
ultimate baseball fantasy trip.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting next to each other recently in the metal bleachers at a
baseball field in Rancho Park, Morris and Quaid seem to have little
in common.</TE>
<TE>   Morris is bulky with premature gray hair. Quaid is a month shy of
48--a decade older than Morris--and is slight and wiry. Morris
answers most of his questions with a "yes, ma'am." Quaid's favorite
expression appears to be "sweetie."</TE>
<TE>   But first glances are deceiving. Like Morris, Quaid grew up in
Texas. They are both lefties. And they are both fans of the 1942
baseball movie "The Pride of the Yankees." Quaid first learned about
Morris while he was still in the minors. "I saw a television news
magazine story on ABC back in 1999," the actor says. "I thought it
would make a great movie. I didn't think I would play in it. I'm in
my 40s. I am supposed to be retired from sports."</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who was a consultant on the film, was a constant presence
on the set outside Austin. "It was an asset for me to have the real
guy there," Quaid says. "Sometimes if we would get stuck with a piece
of dialogue especially in the coaching scenes with the kids, I would
just go to the guy [and say,] 'What would you do here? What would you
say?'"</TE>
<TE>   Quaid played a pitcher early in his film career in a baseball
sequence in the 1977 film "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden," but
really hasn't played the game since Little League. Although he's
played everything from boxers ("Tough Enough") to football players
("Everybody's All American," "Any Given Sunday"), Quaid admits, "I
was too small for sports in school. That's why I got into drama."</TE>
<TE>   Morris and his doctors don't know why his arm got stronger with
age. In his 20s, his fastest pitch was 85 mph. "When they fixed my
arm at 25, they didn't fix it for me to pitch," Morris says. "They
fixed it for everyday life like to play golf and play with the kids I
hadn't yet had. I took seven years off throwing anything. When I got
the head-coaching job, I started throwing batting practice. For some
reason, my arm speed picked up. I didn't know how hard I threw until
the tryout. The kids had tried to tell me, but I didn't believe them
because by the middle of the season they were hitting them. So I had
no reason to believe anything extraordinary was happening at the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Quaid quips that he "probably threw like an actress" when he
started to train for the movie about three months before production
started last March in Texas. "That was a long process that Dennis
accomplished in a short time," Morris says. "He worked with me to
break down the motion. We threw together side by side in Dodger
Stadium and they filmed us so he would go back and look at it. It's
fortunate that Major League Baseball jumped on this project, so they
gave him the game films of the games I had pitched in."</TE>
<TE>   Morris says that Quaid got so good that Tampa Bay sportswriters
told him after they saw the movie, "'We can't pick this apart.'
Dennis did a great job. He just learned how to be a pitcher. If the
sportswriters can't pick it apart, I don't think anybody can."</TE>
<TE>   The media coverage of Morris began almost as soon as he was signed
to play in triple A. Producers Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray were the
first to approach Morris after reading about him in Sports
Illustrated. Ciardi and Morris were roommates in the minors in 1983
and '84.</TE>
<TE>   "After he got called up to the big leagues, his agent got 250
calls from producers," Ciardi says. "We were in the process of
locking up the rights but had not gotten them yet. Luckily, we ended
up securing them. I would have been despondent if we weren't the ones
doing the story."</TE>
<TE>   Having played with Morris, Ciardi says, "I know he didn't throw
like that when his arm was healthy and he was a lot younger. I still
can't explain how he did what he did--98 miles per hour and
left-handed? That is pretty rare."</TE>
<TE>   "The Rookie" is a cinematic anomaly--a G-rated film that is really
more for adults than kids.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised at the G rating," Ciardi says. "We thought
about it and said, 'Why not? This would be a good film for a family
to see.'</TE>
<TE>   "So we didn't shy away from it, but people should know it is not
your typical G-movie from Disney. It's an adult movie with themes for
everyone. It is about so many more things than just baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who has a cameo in the film as a minor league umpire,
would often get emotional on the set watching scenes from his life
play out.</TE>
<TE>   He also admits crying when he saw the finished film. "I called my
mom when I walked out of the screening and I said bring lots of
Kleenex to New York for the premiere," he recalls. "It is that dead
on. My mom and my dad and my family know everything I went through
and everything I put them through."</TE>
<TE>   Quaid, he says, captured him perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   "I wear my emotions on my sleeve a lot and people can tell by
looking at my face what I'm thinking," Morris says. "I thought his
facial expression in the movie said so much without saying anything.
It was just easy to read what he was going through all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The actor grins broadly. "It's called subtext," he tells Morris.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not from Hollywood," he tells Quaid. "I don't know about
subtext."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Morris quit baseball. "I signed with the Dodgers in
December 2000. I came out here for six weeks for spring training at
Dodger Stadium and I went out to Vero Beach," Fla., says Morris, who
now lives in Dallas. "I had a little tendinitis but I could have
thrown through that. But I missed my kids."</TE>

<LD>   Dueling Anniversary Specials on CBS, NBC</LD>
<LD>   Continuing TV's current nostalgia craze--and apparently hoping to
take a little air out of similar festivities on NBC--CBS has
scheduled the two-hour special "CBS ... 50 Years From Television
City" for April 27, the first Saturday during the next ratings
sweeps. NBC's three-hour 75th anniversary special, which will range
from the network's beginnings in radio to the present day, is
scheduled for May 5.</LD>

<TE>   'Greg the Bunny' Draws Hopping Good Ratings</TE>
<TE>   Fox's "Greg the Bunny" got off to the most promising start among
three new comedies that premiered Wednesday, with the show averaging
10.2 million viewers, building on the audience for the Fox series
preceding it, "The Bernie Mac Show."</TE>
<TE>   That was enough to clearly surpass ABC's inside-TV satire
"Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)," which averaged just under 8 million
viewers, dropping about 20% off its lead-in program, "The Drew Carey
Show."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's other new comedy, "The George Lopez Show," averaged an
estimated 10.4 million viewers, falling a respectable 13% below
tune-in for "My Wife and Kids."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, NBC won the night behind "The West Wing" and "Law &amp;

<TE>   Don't Toy Around With Cajun Phrases, Suit Says</TE>
<TE>   The maker of a toy that utters six Cajun phrases has sued rapper
Mystikal for copyright infringement. The problem? The singer
allegedly used two of the phrases (including "You gotta suck da head
on dem der crawfish!") in his 2000 hit "Shake Ya Ass."</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans entrepreneur Steve Winn, owner of Cajun in Your
Pocket, says it's not only that Mystikal is reciting the phrases, but
the way he says them also duplicates his product--"a copyrighted
sound recording and arrangement of words and sayings."</TE>
<TE>   He seeks songwriter credit, retroactive profits and royalties, and
an estimated $1.25 million in damages. Sales of the toys haven't been
helped by their association with such sexually charged material, he
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Mystikal's lawyer, Roy Maughan Jr., disputes the songwriting
claim, saying that those phrases are less than three seconds of a
four-minute song. "Winn did not make up those expressions," he said.
"They've been in the language for over 100 years. Since he wasn't the
creator of them, they aren't unique to him. He can't copyright them."</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   ABC has canceled the critically acclaimed drama "Once and Again,"
announcing that the final episode will air April 15. Now in its third
season, the low-rated program has bounced around the network schedule
and been the subject of an Internet lobbying campaign.... Director
Spike Lee has accepted the newly created post of artistic director of
the graduate division of the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television
at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.... KMZT-FM (101.5)
will air all five Beethoven piano concertos on April 7, beginning at
noon.... CNN's new version of "Crossfire," with Democratic
strategists James Carville and Paul Begala aboard, premieres Monday
at 7 p.m..... In honor of the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's
death, BMG Heritage and RCA are issuing "Elvis: Today, Tomorrow &amp;
Forever" on July 9, featuring 100 tracks of what is described as
previously unreleased material.... Director Robert Altman is creating
a series of 30-second vignettes for E! Entertainment that feature
stars such as Minnie Driver, Lisa Kudrow and Ving Rhames playing
scenes from their favorite movies.... Buoyed by Tuesday's improved
ratings for its Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy "Watching Ellie," NBC has
given the go-ahead to two more episodes of the show on April 9 and
April 16 at 8:30 p.m.--a reprieve for the series, which the network
planned to pull off the air April 2. Its status for next fall's
schedule remains in doubt.... The world premiere of "Sophie's
Choice," composer Nicholas Maw's contemporary opera inspired by
William Styron's novel, will be among six new opera productions
during the upcoming Royal Opera House season.</TE>

<HD>After the Big Night, Is Change Realistic?</HD>
<DH>Oscars: Hollywood wonders if wins will mean anything to
people other than Halle and Denzel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Producer Peter Rawley recalls trying recently to get a top talent
agency to see two Indian actors. Most agents, he has found through
the years, would rather go with a sure thing than take a risk on
signing "ethnic" talent. In this case, he had to assure them that
many people in India speak English.</LD>
<LD>   "They said, 'Why would they do that?'" said Rawley, a former
agent. "I had to explain to them that English is one of the official
languages in India. Once I was at a studio and I was pitching a Simon
Bolivar story. I told them, 'You know, Simon Bolivar, the great
liberator of South America?' and they said, 'Liberated from whom?'"</LD>
<LD>   For minorities in Hollywood, change has come very slowly. The
subject once again came to the fore Sunday night at the Academy
Awards when Halle Berry and Denzel Washington won the top acting
honors and Sidney Poitier received a lifetime achievement award. In
her acceptance speech, Berry said her Oscar could open doors for
other women of color. But despite these heralded awards, real
diversity remains an elusive goal in Hollywood, according to those
who work in the industry and those who observe it.</LD>
<TE>   "The wins that we saw on Oscar night are arguably well
deserved--they gave some great performances," said agent Rob Kim of
United Talent Agency, one of a handful of Asian American agents in
town. "I don't know that it necessarily matters that much. Does
[Berry's] win mean more roles for African American women? I don't
think so. I think more people will want to hire Denzel and more
people will want to hire Halle Berry."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that the awards might have made academy members feel
good--and served as a source of pride among African Americans--but
that in terms of recognition of minority talent, it was too little,
too late.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a little too obvious--it's like all of a sudden [the
academy] remembered that we exist," said director Leon Ichaso
("Pinero"), who is Cuban. "There have been incredible performances in
the past which were totally ignored. That award should have been
given to Denzel years ago, and to many others."</TE>
<TE>   The questions facing Hollywood are complex and layered. They
include the dearth of minority representation at all levels, from
script writers to studio executives, producers, agents and managers.
Perhaps even more important in a bottom-line-driven industry is the
studios' growing reliance on the international market, where having
minorities and women in starring roles is considered a detriment,
particularly in action blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, nearly 46% of the studios' total profits came from sales
abroad, according to the weekly publication Screen International. The
so-called "event movies" or blockbusters account for 60% of the
studios' box-office revenues, according to the publication.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this is going to change the fact that you cannot package
or sell [a movie] to the world market today with a black woman," said
James Ulmer, author of "James Ulmer's Hollywood Hot List," which
tracks actors' global marketability. "I don't see [the Oscar win] as
changing an industry where white male actors drive the train of the
international marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera, minorities are just as underrepresented.
Hollywood may be seen by outsiders to be a politically progressive
enclave, but the industry's hiring practices and the opportunities
available for nonwhites have not progressed much in 30 years, said
Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at USC's School of
Cinema-Television.</TE>
<TE>   "This contradicts the perception of Hollywood as being liberal,"
said Boyd, who also wrote and produced the 1999 film "The Wood," a
coming-of-age drama about three young African Americans in Inglewood.
"If it was so liberal and on the vanguard, we would not be sitting
here 30 years later talking about African Americans being nominated.
Hollywood is really reprehensible in this regard."</TE>
<TE>   As with almost everything to do with race in America, the Berry
and Washington wins have become the subject of contention. Behind the
scenes, some academy members wondered whether too much was made about
the race issue. Some even wondered if the academy's "guilt" in
overlooking minorities for so long would play a deciding role in
granting the Oscar to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Howard, director of "A Beautiful Mind" and winner of two
Oscars Sunday night, told La Opinion last week, "The only thing that
would prevent [Russell Crowe] from winning, is that the academy, out
of guilt, try to repair the damage that it did to Denzel Washington
by not having given him the Oscar for his performance in 'The
Hurricane.'" After his win, Washington made a reference to race being
irrelevant, and pleaded with the media to recognize him and Berry as
actors and not African American actors.</TE>
<TE>   African American actors have had the most Oscar wins and
nominations of any minority group--seven. Through the years, four
Latino actors have won Academy Awards: Benicio del Toro for best
supporting actor for "Traffic" (2000); Anthony Quinn for best
supporting actor for "Viva Zapata!" (1952) and "Lust for Life"
(1956); Rita Moreno for best supporting actress for "West Side Story"
(1961); and Jose Ferrer for best actor for "Cyrano de Bergerac"
(1950). Two Asians have won Oscars: Miyoshi Umeki for best supporting
actress for "Sayonara" (1957) and Haing S. Ngor for "The Killing
Fields" (1984).</TE>
<TE>   Berry and Washington could flex their muscles by demanding diverse
casts and getting behind minority-driven productions, said Bridget D.
Davis, senior vice president of film at Edmonds Entertainment, Tracey
Edmonds' production house.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Berry] can get films made, then that would help," said Davis,
who is African American. "I don't think this is a world-changing
event but a slow change in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Some minority directors, such as Spike Lee ("Do the Right Thing")
and Ang Lee ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") have reached a level
where they can dictate who is hired for a production. And certainly,
stars such as Washington, Will Smith (an Oscar nominee for "Ali") and
Wesley Snipes (star of "Blade 2," which took in $33 million in its
first weekend) have box-office clout, at least in the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   But those are the exceptions. The major Hollywood guilds (actors,
writers, directors and producers) are 80% to 90% white, according to
the most recent statistics. Only four of the 44 partners or board
members at the town's top five talent agencies are women, and there
are no minorities. Although there are three women with the power to
greenlight movies at the major studios, there are no minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood will not change until change occurs at the top levels,
said David Park, an agent at UTA.</TE>
<TE>   "Until minorities are in a position of power and until the people
doing the buying have a vested interest, you are not going to see
many drastic changes," said Park, who is Korean American. "Directors
and show runners hire their friends--this is a town of relationships.
You hire who you know. The key is getting people of color to a level
where they can hire their friends."</TE>
<TE>   The low percentage of minorities in Hollywood comes at a time when
the U.S. moviegoing audience is becoming more diverse. According to
the Motion Picture Assn. of America, in 2001 more than 30% of the
American moviegoing audience was Latino, African American or Asian.
The Latino population is the heaviest in moviegoing, with a per
capita viewing of 9.9 films per year, representing 15% of admissions.</TE>
<TE>   For actress-turned-writer Tina Andrews, it's been a long, hard
road to acceptance. In 1977, Andrews landed a leading role in the
soap opera "Days of Our Lives"; she played a working professional and
was the first black actress to have an interracial relationship on
daytime television. As she recalls, she kissed her white colleague on
a Friday show; by Saturday, the network received 5,000 negative
letters. Eventually, she was written out.</TE>
<TE>   She says she is now working steadily as a writer (she wrote the
CBS miniseries "Sally Hemmings, An American Scandal" and is now
working on the Coretta Scott King story for CBS).</TE>
<TE>   "There are those who would say to me, 'Oh you speak so well....'
At first, I was offered only the urban contemporary city story or a
comedy," Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the eternal optimist," she added. "The [Oscar] wins were for
all of us, but we need to apply it to the bigger picture so we are
not waiting another 70 years."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of casting, most studios and production houses go through
mainstream casting agents to find talent, rather than through
boutique casting agencies that specialize in minority talent.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the studios specify the race or ethnicity of the
talent they seek or change it depending on the kind of movie they are
making. For instance, Alicia Nash, wife of John Forbes Nash Jr., the
subject of the Oscar-winning film "A Beautiful Mind," is Salvadoran.
Yet she was played by Jennifer Connelly (who was voted best
supporting actress).</TE>
<TE>   But increasingly, more studios are putting out casting calls that
are not race- or ethnic-specific. MTV and Nickelodeon have been
leaders in this regard, understanding that their young audience is
both diverse and less concerned about ethnic backgrounds. (For
example, MTV's feature film "Save the Last Dance" was about an
interracial teen romance.)</TE>
<TE>   Universal added Latino film label Arenas Entertainment to produce
and distribute films targeting Latino audiences. Although more
opportunities are opening up for minority talent, there is still a
lot of educating to do, said Ivan de Paz, executive vice president of
talent for Arenas.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen a change in attitude," De Paz said. "It's a great
challenge. But it's very empowering to be there in the forefront to
help them see what we are about."</TE>

<HD>'Images of Women': A History of Modernism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY MYERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Politically loaded and suspiciously vague, "Images of Women" is a
weighty title for a gallery exhibition. But it's fitting. With 100
works spanning nearly two centuries, the current show at Jack Rutberg
Fine Arts is a weighty endeavor all around--and probably the better
for it.</LD>
<LD>   The conceptual basis of the show is as straightforward as the
title. There are no over-arching themes or nuanced analyses, didactic
texts or clever categories. Rather, it's a collector's show, stocked
with an appealing, chronologically organized array of mostly
small-scale prints, drawings, paintings and sculptures by a
respectable assortment of artists. They include a number of household
names (Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse, Chagall, Rouault, Miro, Gorky,
Ernst, Picasso, De Kooning, etc.).</LD>
<LD>   To the extent that the show acknowledges the politics surrounding
the representation of women in art at all, it is politely
indifferent. What comes across just the same is the sheer ubiquity of
the female body--disguised as goddess, monster, siren, mother or
worker. The subject is a veritable cornerstone in the history of
Modernism.</LD>
<TE>   The female body is a manifestation of heaven-bound purity in Henri
Fantin-Latour's dreamy "Angel Ascending With a Woman" (1884), the
embodiment of dignified labor in Diego Rivera's eloquent "Textile
Weaver" (1934), and an indecipherable piece of a standard Cubist
puzzle in Hans Burkhardt's badly dated "Woman With a Wine Glass"
(1947). In a humorous 1931 line drawing by Gaston Lachaise, she
struts like a drag queen with watermelon breasts, while in a delicate
lithograph by Aristide Maillol she wades through pillows like a nude,
boudoir swamp-creature.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is a fair share of mediocre work--as might be
expected, considering the scale of the exhibition--there are plenty
of gems to keep it afloat.</TE>
<TE>   The playful line drawings of Louise Nevelson, Milton Avery, Man
Ray and David Hockney are all particularly charming. Two works by
Kathe Kollwitz (a sculpture and a lithograph) convey a degree of hard
emotion that is lacking in most of the male artists' work. And a blue
ink drawing of a classically posed nude by George Grosz, though one
of the most traditional works in the show, is simply stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Sacred and titillating, beautiful and banal, emotional and sexual,
oppressed and exalted--the as- sortment of representations offered
here is as varied as in any art history textbook.</TE>
<TE>   But here it's up to the viewer to draw connections and
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, 357 N. La Brea, L.A., (323) 938-5222,
through April 30. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Vaguely Out of Touch With 'Nervous System'</TE>
<TE>   The best quality of "A Nervous System"--an exhibition of five
young New York-based artists at Hayworth Gallery--is that it makes
for a perfectly pleasant visual environment.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Garcia-Fenech's paintings are clean, flat abstractions
that resemble images of microscopic organisms, enlarged and
tastefully simplified into a few solid forms. Mark Masyga's
paintings, looser and somewhat more delicate than Garcia-Fenech's,
are solid fields of translucent color overlaid with floating clusters
of tiny, multihued bricks.</TE>
<TE>   In Nina Bovasso's paintings, also abstract, color is a more
explosive, emotional force and tumbles across the canvas as though
propelled by its own internal combustion. Jeff Gauntt's works,
stylistic depictions of trees, are slick and tightly controlled
compositions marked by a careful interplay of textures and a spare
incorporation of sculptural elements.</TE>
<TE>   The best of Elizabeth McGrath's sculptures is a curious pyramid of
cardboard toilet paper tubes, green glass and sullied hand towels
that wavers(albeit rather unexceptionally) between the neat confines
of design and the loose quality inherent in found materials.</TE>
<TE>   The precise implication of the show's title is unclear, but it
does allude to the essence of this work: a frenetic but conservative
energy, governed by a strict, self-conscious sense of formalism. For
this Angeleno, it calls to mind the confined spaces of New York City:
the narrow streets, crowded subways, small studios, and entrenched
institutions. Unfortunately, with the exception of Bovasso's work,
which is promisingly reckless (even more so, happily, than in her
solo show at Richard Heller Gallery last fall), this conservatism
leads to attractive but largely unsatisfying art.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for this shortcoming may lie in a statement by the
show's organizers, which is a tangle of typical art-world
ambiguities. Being "emphatically ... open-ended," the work "resists
easy interpretation"; it blends "accident" with "carefully executed
detail," "representation" with "abstraction"; it is "personal" yet
avoids "narrative and autobiography."</TE>
<TE>   One comes away from the work wondering if all the verbal dodging
isn't just a sanctified method of avoiding responsibility for
actually making a statement. If these artists were to throw their
stylish ambiguity to the wind and dive straight into being either
representational or abstract, personal or objective--or else chuck
the whole dialectic fixation altogether and take the risk of simply
being sincere--there would be a lot more to gain from the work's
aesthetic charm.</TE>
<TE>   Hayworth Gallery, 148 N. Hayworth Ave., L.A., (323) 933-5565,
through April 9. Closed Sunday through Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Boundaries Are Shifting in 'Artificial Splendor'</TE>
<TE>   "Artificial Splendor" is a small but energetic exhibition of work
that aims to straddle that ever-shifting boundary between the natural
and the artificial in art. Using hip, contemporary substances like
resin, Duralar, polyurethane, velvet and aluminum, the six artists in
the show play up the material qualities of their organic subjects,
exploiting (in the words of its organizers) "the potential
artificiality of nature."</TE>
<TE>   The results vary. In Betsy Kenyon's photographs of dead flower
buds, pictured singly or lined up like rows of bodies for an autopsy,
much of the delicacy of the natural forms is sacrificed to the dry,
impersonal effect of the materials (Piezo pigment printed on
aluminum). Sierra Slentz-Anderson's jazzy paintings--frenetic tangles
of colorful shapes derived from shadows cast by plants and
flowers--are perfectly enjoyable but significantly limited by the
narrow terms of the exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Littlejohn's playful wall sculptures--tacky clusters of cast
polyurethane sea creatures--are happily over the top, pulling nature
in the direction of souvenir shop kitsch. Similarly audacious are
Mary Warner's large, acrylic-on-velvet paintings of chrysanthemums,
one of which curves assertively outward toward the viewer, the other
seductively inward as though attempting, like an O'Keeffe flower gone
rabid, to swallow the viewer whole.</TE>
<TE>   The most refined works in the show are Kimberly Squaglia's
liquid-smooth oil and resin paintings of wooded horizon lines twisted
into kaleidoscopic patterns and Cherie Benner Davis' elegant
vein-patterned designs, some cleanly carved into planks of wood,
others painted in an oily, blood-like red onto translucent Duralar.</TE>
<TE>   The concept behind "Artificial Splendor" is not especially novel.
All art involves the process of artificialization to some degree. But
in the work here--particularly that of Squaglia and Davis, which is
so attentive to the resonant quality of its materials--one comes to
see more clearly how the nature of our relationship with
contemporary, man-made resources defines the nature of our
relationship with the natural world.</TE>

<TE>   A Few of Joan Brown's Very Favorite Things</TE>
<TE>   On the occasion of its 20th anniversary, Koplin Gallery has
assembled a pleasantly intimate exhibition of paintings by Joan
Brown, the late Bay Area artist whose work inaugurated the space in
1982. Titled "A Few of Her Favorite Things: Models, Cats and Dogs,"
the exhibition is an affectionate cross-section of the artist's
preferred themes. It demonstrates the intelligence of her vision and
makes the case for the continuing validity of her work, 12 years
after her death.</TE>
<TE>   The images, most of which date to the mid-1970s, seem simple at a
glance. She builds them as one might build a patchwork quilt: with
thick, black lines and flat planes of bold color. Aside from a few
deliriously cluttered ink and fake-fur collages she produced right
out of art school, most of the compositions are straightforward and
unadorned--even cartoonish at times.</TE>
<TE>   There is a solidity to the work, however, that belies its
simplicity. Her picture planes are unshakable, her forms inviolable.
This is especially appealing in her paintings of models (all female).
The most distinctive feature of these women's bodies, it seems, is
that they occupy space--boldly, completely, unapologetically.</TE>
<TE>   They can be playful, thoughtful or pensive but are always, above
all, incalculably present. One might say the same of Brown's own
creative spirit throughout this show.</TE>

<HD>No Doubt and the Faint Conjure Up the '80s</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aieeee! Like some persistent teenage pustule, the '80s oozed all over
No Doubt's sold-out show Wednesday at Universal Amphitheatre. Not
just because the Orange County band took the new-wave flavor of its
latest album, "Rock Steady," to the stage with gleeful abandon, but
also thanks to opening act the Faint and its icy, gothic synth-rock.</LD>
<LD>   No Doubt's cribbing from Reagan-era rock was less campy, but then
new wave has always been in the quartet's mix, along with dancehall
reggae and punk-pop. The stage dressing incorporated the
graffiti-style white, red and black lettering from the "Rock Steady"
album cover and a bold color scheme that included neon-bright lights
in the drum kit. Singer Gwen Stefani, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist
Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young sported gaudy, '80s-boho fashion,
as did two keyboardists-vocalists who also played horns.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the 90-minute performance was not always well served by
this backward inspiration. Essentially a dance band, No Doubt is
elastic enough to adapt to trends (or whims), as is Stefani herself,
having sung on recent hits by artists as disparate as Eve and Moby.
The "Rock Steady" track "Hella Good" got the show off to a thumping
good start, but such synth-fueled new numbers as "In My Head" were
even less compelling than on the album.</LD>
<TE>   Even the band's cleverer, more modern-sounding hit "Hey Baby," for
which Dumont busted out a vintage keyboard guitar, fell relatively
flat.</TE>
<TE>   The band rarely slowed to less than mid-tempo. But Stefani,
evoking Madonna with her high, platinum ponytail and cat-eye makeup,
offered tender moments with the wistfully conventional "Simple Kind
of Life" and the reggae-fied valentine "Underneath It All." These
reminded us that her appeal lies not only in her
girl-just-wants-to-have-fun freakiness, but also in her
girl-next-door normality.</TE>
<TE>   The breakneck pace left plenty of room to plumb the catalog, and
the mixed crowd of teens to thirtysomethings happily accepted such
favorites as "Just a Girl," "Sunday Morning" and "Ex-Girlfriend."
They also cheered the half-dozen dancing girls who came out in
bustiers and fishnet. Which would've seemed quite "Moulin Rouge" if
it hadn't been so Cyndi Lauper.</TE>
<TE>   The Faint's 40-minute opening set was a hilarious, unholy blend of
Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, and Spinal Tap, except the black-clad Omaha
quintet appeared to be serious, despite the keyboardist's absurdly
warped geek-dancing and the players' exaggerated high-energy antics.</TE>
<TE>   The Faint started out as a regular indie-rock group, but forays
into dancier territory on 1999's "Blank-Wave Arcade" and last year's
"Danse Macabre" have garnered attention and major-label courtship.</TE>
<TE>   At times vaguely glam rock, the selections often dealt with dire
subjects, but that didn't keep the group from winning over at least
part of the crowd. Luring disco dollies to a life of vice, indeed.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Semitism and Holocaust-Era Money Are 'Dormant'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller; F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least three different plays have been shoehorned uncomfortably
together into Jorge Albertella's "Dormant," presented by L.A. Jewish
Theatre. First, there is a drama about a rich, young Italian Jew
attempting to escape Mussolini's roundups; second is a drama about
Holocaust survivors and their families attempting to retrieve money
locked in Swiss bank accounts; and third, a dark comedy about fortune
hunters trying to get their hands on that money.</LD>
<LD>   The connecting thread is Albertella's play on the word "dormant,"
which refers most obviously to those Swiss bank accounts, but also
describes the anti-Semitism that lingers in our culture, blazing
grotesquely to life just when we think the embers have died out.</LD>
<LD>   That's a compelling message, but it's nearly lost amid shifts in
tone that even some of the most dependable talents in L.A.'s
small-theater scene--director Jon Lawrence Rivera, set designer
Victoria Profitt and lighting designer Kathi O'Donohue--can't smooth
out.</LD>
<TE>   The action unfolds in the present and the past, in a small
apartment in New York's Jackson Heights neighborhood and in the mind
of its inhabitant, Rosina Castelli (Dana Peterson).</TE>
<TE>   Profitt's set is a haunted dreamscape in which the Nazi death
camps have begun to overrun the apartment. Barbed wire is strung
above the kitchen door, and shoes--left behind by the murdered
prisoners--are piling up under the furniture and are buried beneath
the floorboards.</TE>
<TE>   As the story begins, Rosina is reliving her terrifying flight from
Rome, made in the protective company of Fabrizio (Jason Peirce), a
Gentile family employee and the object of her affection. She is
yanked back to the present by the unannounced arrival of a young man
and woman who claim to be her grandchildren: another Fabrizio (Montre
D. Burton) and his half-sister Caterina (Melody Butiu).</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, a lawyer (Jeff LeBeau) who fights for frozen-account
payouts, also shows up. In his presence, the grandchildren suddenly
turn into characters in some teen comedy (think: "Scary Movie"), and
the tone grows ever more jumbled.</TE>
<TE>   What doesn't change is the indelible horror in Peterson's face,
which grippingly conveys what the script doesn't.</TE>

<TE>   'Girl's' Quest for Passion Diverted by Symbolism</TE>
<TE>   Yearning is palpable in the Aimee Bender short story collection
"The Girl in the Flammable Skirt." The characters seek connection
and, most of all, passion, yet rarely find it.</TE>
<TE>   The writing is evocative, the words chosen with care as Bender
casually transforms the everyday into the surreal. A woman in an
evening gown rides the subway, auditioning men to be her next lover.
A girl's worries take physical form in a backpack made of stone,
which she must carry around.</TE>
<TE>   Such fairy-tale symbolism proves more powerful in the imagination,
however, than when given physical form. At City Garage in Santa
Monica, adapter-director Frederique Michel has done little more than
turn four of the pieces into monologues, which are delivered at
monotonously unvaried pitches and tempos, while every gesture
indicated in the text is slavishly playacted.</TE>
<TE>   Things begin vividly, as a middle-aged woman (Maureen Byrnes),
observing her husband mindlessly eat the meal she has prepared, says
she wants to "rescue" the food from his mouth--a deft bit of wordplay
that conveys her feeling of imprisonment in the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The next two pieces involve restless younger women: the
aforementioned subway hunter (Victoria Coulson) and a woman (Maia
Brewton) who goes home with a guy because she likes his callused
hands. (In both instances, Paul M. Rubenstein plays the man.)
Problem: Both scenarios involve characters slipping out of their
clothes, and pretty soon, nakedness is all the story is about.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth piece, about the girl (Ilana Gustafson) with the stone
backpack, takes a far too literal approach to its fantastical events.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, Charles A. Duncombe Jr. provides appropriately
magical backdrops for each story by projecting artful video clips and
slides onto a series of white panels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if one hasn't already read Bender's collection, it's hard
to understand what all the hoopla was about when the book hit stores
in 1998. What was written with such passion becomes cold and clinical
here.</TE>

<TE>   'Serious Inquires Only' and Going Home Again</TE>
<TE>   Families tend to be fractious institutions, towers of Babel in
miniature, echoing with the overlapping chatter of people who don't
necessarily understand one another's language.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright D. Paul Thomas captures the vibrant cacophony of family
life in "Serious Inquiries Only," an endearing if ephemeral comedy at
the Sidewalk Studio Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew (Jeff Allin), a Dartmouth-educated journalist, has
recently returned to his hometown in rural Indiana to run the local
newspaper--a publication owned by his family for generations. To save
money, Matthew and his family have moved in with Matthew's widowed
mother Margaret (Kathryn Joosten), a feisty conservative with strong
opinions and a guilty secret.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew's wife Melissa (Ann Gillespie) and teenage daughters
Miranda (Andrea Procter) and Mandy (Nicholle Tom) have made the
transition fluidly. However, the move from big pond to tributary has
taken its toll on Matthew, who has just suffered a humiliating defeat
in a state assembly race.</TE>
<TE>   It seems the locals--including his own mother--don't cotton to
Matthew's fiery urban liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   Fed up with the heartland, Matthews swaps the family farmhouse for
summer digs in Italy. But a predictable crisis causes the family to
jettison their vacation plans, not to mention their fondest
preconceptions about "family values."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, who also directs, demonstrates a real flair for dialogue
and an evenhanded approach to his subject. Although his story is a
bit on the light side--nouvelle cuisine that may leave you hungry
after an hour or so--Thomas' staging, on an impeccably appointed set
by Jeff Crye, is deft. The actors, including Corey Nelson in a lesser
role, are impressively naturalistic. Allin's comical angst,
Gillespie's common-sense warmth and Procter's hormonal ardor are all
part of this vividly realized clan.</TE>
<TE>   Tom is poignant as Mandy, Matthew and Melissa's mentally
challenged daughter. The most memorable performance, however, is
Joosten's. Feisty, flawed and very funny, her Margaret is a
lugubrious sprite, a woman of a certain age with a hangdog expression
and a laser wit that can cut glass.</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Shenanigans in Zippy 'Clockstoppers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a more eco-minded Hollywood fantasy world, every suburban house
would have a special centralized recycling kitchen where families
would reprocess all the congealed oatmeal and cold eggs that don't
get eaten because Junior has to dash out to save the world.</LD>
<LD>   One's heart goes out to Julia Sweeney, a captivating comic playing
a reasonably hip mother who is stymied in her efforts to get her kids
to eat their breakfast. Needless to say, she is not the star of
"Clockstoppers," a movie in which parents merely set the stage (and
the table) for the heroism of their more global-minded children.</LD>
<LD>   To be fair, her resourceful teenage son Zak (a cocky and confident
Jesse Bradford) has little more on the brain besides girls and cars
at the outset of this jaunty sci-fi adventure. His science professor
dad (Robin Thomas) is always pushing his son to get more serious with
his studies, but Zak would rather be putting the moves on Francesca
(Paula Garces), the gorgeous daughter of a Venezuelan diplomat who
has just moved to town.</LD>
<TE>   Unbeknownst to Zak, Dad and a partner have been researching a
high-tech watch that speeds up the molecules of the wearer to such a
degree that others appear to be standing still.</TE>
<TE>   Zak accidentally obtains this "hypertime" watch, and finds himself
the target of an evil technocrat who wants to use it to conquer the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the freeze-frame special effects in "Clockstoppers"
revolve around people playing statue and sprays of water (or other
less seemly liquids) being halted in midair. One wishes that the
screenwriters had devised more inventive ways for Zak and Francesca
to toy with their magical gadget than helping a friend win a scratch
contest at a hip-hop club or vengefully repositioning a dog stopped
in the act of relieving himself.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Clockstoppers" is exceptionally user-friendly for the
technologically challenged among us and rides over its less inspired
patches on a wave of cheeky humor. Directed with verve and an eye for
off-center casting by Jonathan Frakes, the film boasts one of the
more determinedly vivacious sci-fi families in a spell. You have to
wonder what Sweeney is slipping into her kids' cornflakes. If they
ever finish them, there's no telling what they'll be able to
accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for action violence and mild language. Times
guidelines: The pace of this family entertainment may confuse the
youngest tots.</TE>

<HD>Hartley's Fable in Defense of Monsters</HD>
<DH>The director's 'No Such Thing' is a darkly funny,
outrageous story about the useful roles the creatures play in human
life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Hal Hartley's tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable "No
Such Thing," the director imagines that what supermarket tabloids say
is true: A monster does indeed still roam the Earth. In this case,
the Monster (Robert John Burke) lives in a ship wrecked off a tiny
island but a stone's throw from a coastal village on the northernmost
tip of Iceland. It's so remote and rugged an area that even on
horseback it's possible to travel only so far; the rest of the
journey must be made on foot.</LD>
<LD>   The Monster has a human male's tall, rangy build, and for all his
knurly, prognathous jaw, battered horns and leathery, reptilian skin,
he is a handsome creature. An alcoholic insomniac, brilliant and
foulmouthed, he has the stature of a dark protagonist of a Greek or
Shakespearean tragedy. In his seedy-elegant attire he is a romantic
figure, as tormented by loneliness and isolation as Nosferatu the
Vampire, and similarly cursed by immortality.</LD>
<LD>   Having witnessed humanity evolve from pond scum, he has developed
over the millennia an angry contempt for its inhumanity and longs
only for the death that seems an impossibility.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Manhattan, a callous, hard-driving producer (Helen
Mirren) of a TV news show that is as sensational as she can make it
has dispatched one of her journalists and his crew to check out the
authenticity of the Monster, only to have them disappear. Beatrice
(Sarah Polley), the timid, lowliest of aides to Mirren, dares to
suggest that she be assigned to go searching for the missing men, for
she is engaged to the reporter in the group. Against all odds the
demure but resolute Beatrice prevails. Unexpected developments turn
Beatrice into a major story herself before she even gets to Iceland.</TE>
<TE>   In his highly original way Hartley gets a lot going on, and all of
it looms with larger implications. Not surprisingly, the film
develops a Beauty and the Beast motif, while the Boss represents a
media concerned not only with gathering bad news but the absolute
worst that can be dug up or manufactured.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley suggests that we need monsters, that they are projections
of the dark side of humanity, and he leads us to suspect that in a
world without monsters humans will devour one another--especially at
a time when, in unsemantic fashion, people are increasingly more
inclined to accept reports about the world as the world itself. For
all its underlying seriousness, "No Such Thing" effectively plays
moments of exquisite tenderness, outrageous humor and scabrous satire
against one another.</TE>
<TE>   The film is at times too pokey and talky for its own good, but it
is strongly sustained by the force of Hartley's idiosyncratic vision
and a clutch of scintillating portrayals. Mirren is so steadfastly
amusing in delineating the Boss in all her extremes with a perfectly
straight face that she accomplishes the substantial task of making
yet another skewering of media excesses seem fresh and provocative.
Very much a monster herself, Mirren's Boss is balanced by Julie
Christie's Dr. Anna, a Reykjavik physician, a woman of exceptional
compassion and courage. They and Baltasar Kormakur, as a wildly
eccentric scientific genius, lend extraordinary support to Polley and
Burke, who gracefully embrace a wide range of emotions and levels of
perception.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, for sure, is going to be able or willing to go the
distance in this ambitious but exceedingly offbeat epic, which is
great-looking and has a sweeping romantic score by Hartley himself.</TE>
<TE>   Those who can, however, may discover that the dark undertow in
society and human nature Hartley uncovers here, along with
humankind's finer impulses, has a lot in common with the filmmaker's
initial explorations of the zanier side of life in blue-collar Long
Island. "No Such Thing" attains the pathos and gossamer enchantment
of the classic fairy tale it is at heart.</TE>

<HD>Satirical Overkill in 'Death to Smoochy'</HD>
<DH>Taking on the cutthroat world of kids' TV, the film puts
its strong ensemble cast in increasingly unbelievable situations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Death to Smoochy" starts out as such a deliciously savage satire of
TV kiddie shows that it's a shame it swerves out of control and over
the top, sliding into tedium before pulling together for a clever, if
protracted, finish.</LD>
<LD>   If this sharp-looking, sharp-talking presentation is decidedly
uneven, it nevertheless offers Edward Norton--in one of his typically
highly focused portrayals that is a constant delight--as well as
Robin Williams, Catherine Keener and Danny DeVito, who also directed
Adam Resnick's knowing script.</LD>
<LD>   The film opens with a pow and then some. Out comes Williams'
Rainbow Randolph in a white outfit and bowler and rainbow-striped
sequined jacket. He's on a garish set crowded with ecstatic
youngsters hearing him sing a reminder that "Friends Come in All
Sizes," which segues into a pitch for Randolph merchandise, with the
none-too-subtle hint that when it comes to sizes, the bigger (more
costly) the item, the better.</LD>
<TE>   Randolph's fortunes abruptly reverse in a scandalously
high-profile manner, and the Manhattan-based Kidnet is suddenly
desperate to find a replacement with an ultra-clean image.</TE>
<TE>   The network president (Jon Stewart) dispatches his tough, canny VP
of development, Nora Wells (Keener), to sign up Sheldon Mopes
(Norton), whom she finds dressed in his pink plush Smoochy the Rhino
costume entertaining the dozing denizens of a Coney Island methadone
clinic. Unenthusiastic doesn't begin to describe Nora's view of
Smoochy, but she's under orders to sign Sheldon up.</TE>
<TE>   As corny as Smoochy is, the kids do respond. Sheldon wants to tuck
in a message to the children in all his material and insists that the
merchandise bearing Smoochy's name must actually be good for them.
Nora tells him to get lost--actually, her sentiments are more
colorful and unprintable.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sheldon is completely without irony, he is no wimp and is
in fact likable in an aw-shucks way. He signs with notorious kiddie
show talent agent Burke Bennett (DeVito), who thinks and acts like a
mobster.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rainbow Randolph skulks around stoking a ferocious
craving for revenge. Hulking in the wings is yet another dethroned
kiddie star, Buggy Ding Dong (Vincent Schiavelli).</TE>
<TE>   So far so good, but DeVito and Resnick, a TV veteran, blow their
terrific setup by piling on the excesses and bringing in an awkward
and unpersuasive subplot involving a punch-drunk prizefighter
(Michael Rispoli), with whom Smoochy forms a mutual admiration
society, and who is associated with a fierce but good-hearted Irish
restaurateur (Pam Ferris) and her tough guys.</TE>
<TE>   (Among the crowded population of craven characters is Harvey
Fierstein as the thuggish head of a crooked charity that has always
been endorsed by Rainbow Randolph.)</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that at some point the filmmakers became convinced
they could get away with anything, with the result that "Death to
Smoochy" is overly complicated and overlong.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, as "Death to Smoochy" slides from the credibly
outrageous to increasingly incredible knockabout crime farce, it
allows viewer attention to wander before the movie regains focus and
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the picture pounds away at how just about
everybody is rotten to the core, with the possible exception of
Sheldon, but it proves to be a predictable case of shameless schmaltz
surfacing as the other side of the coin of its initial gleeful
cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   "Death to Smoochy" has appealing manic energy, especially in its
performances, but it's too cumbersome for its send-'em-home-happy
ending to seem well-deserved.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that "Death to Smoochy" smacks of something of the
sellouts it is ostensibly skewering.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and sexual references. Times
guidelines: The film is too cynical for small fry and the language
far too strong.</TE>

<HD>A Late-Night Snack With 'Zach'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been nearly a month since VH1, on a renewed mission to become
something more than an anonymous video jukebox, handed the keys to a
half-hour time slot to one Zach Galifianakis.</LD>
<LD>   "Late Night With Zach" (weeknights at 11), an irreverent
talk-variety show aimed at older teens and young adults, was seen by
the cable channel as a means of developing an identity with viewers,
part of the "New Face of VH1" promotion. For Galifianakis, a comedian
and sometime actor ("Boston Common," "Bubble Boy"), it was his game
to lose.</LD>
<LD>   VH1 wasn't sticking its neck out too far, of course. The spartan
set is little more than warehouse space, and after all the Acura,
Audi and Intel commercials are subtracted, it seems as if Zach and
his guests have all of 10 minutes to show their stuff. Fortunately,
on most nights, they are up to the task.</LD>
<TE>   The program puts a updated spin on the anarchic,
anything-might-happen vibe of the old "Late Night With David
Letterman" show, before that host left NBC's clubby confines and
began shouting his way to also-ran status at CBS in the cavernous Ed
Sullivan Theater. Although not as glib as Letterman, Galifianakis
generates some of the same intimate, late-night appeal. Even the
usually amusing filmed bits have a Letterman-esque lunacy.</TE>
<TE>   With his tousled hair, two-day stubble and a wardrobe out of the
studied slovenliness school, Zach delivers a nightly monologue
skewering Hollywood or current events, parries with an actor or two
and a hip-squared musical guest, and then sends the studio audience
into the night with some Zached-out observations.</TE>
<TE>   It's a watchable, deceptively neat package that only figures to
get better.</TE>

<HD>'Panic,' but Little Urgency</HD>
<DH>Director David Fincher, who usually relishes making
audiences squirm, pulls his punches in this Jodie Foster film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It's called a panic room," the snarky real estate person says to
prospective house buyer Meg Altman (Jodie Foster). It's the modern
version of the castle keep, a specially equipped spot with a door of
steel designed to be a refuge when burglars invade your space.
Because they can't get in, you feel safe.</LD>
<LD>   If only it were that simple.</LD>
<LD>   The house on New York's Upper West Side, all four stories and
4,000-plus square feet of it, including an elevator and six working
fireplaces, was most recently the home of a reclusive billionaire.
Funny thing, the real estate woman says, they can't seem to find big
chunks of his money.</LD>
<TE>   None of that matters much to Ms. Altman. Recently divorced from
the wealthy Mr. Altman, she wants someplace her snarly daughter,
Sarah (Kristen Stewart), can be happy. (As if.) Never mind that the
house is so grim and gloomy it makes the Addams Family place look
like Sunnybrook Farm. I'll take it, she says, and I'll worry about
completely hooking up that complicated security system in the
morning, after a good night's sleep in my requisite low-cut top.</TE>
<TE>   Big mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Other people have their eye on that house. Bad people. Very bad
people. They break into the place on the family's very first night,
and fleeing to the panic room is not the help it might be. Because,
wouldn't you know it, what the bad people want just happens to be in
that very room.</TE>
<TE>   Let the games begin.</TE>
<TE>   In outline, "Panic Room's" cat-and-mouse maneuvers between good
and evil in the same enclosed space is unapologetically derivative,
familiar from films as serious as the Audrey Hepburn-starring "Wait
Until Dark" and as silly as "Home Alone."</TE>
<TE>   What's surprising about this traditional thriller, moderately
successful but not completely satisfying, is exactly how genteel and
unsurprising the execution turns out to be.</TE>
<TE>   For "Panic Room's" director is David Fincher, the proficient
albeit icy technician behind films like "Seven" and "Fight Club," a
painstaking craftsman who cares only about making audiences squirm.</TE>
<TE>   Working with cinematographers Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji
from David Koepp's intricately worked out script, Fincher again
demonstrates undeniable visual flair. There are swooping, insinuating
camera moves, disconcerting rolls and tumbles, and all manner of
bravura displays.</TE>
<TE>   But if Koepp's script is good on structure, it is, as is often the
case (as co-writer on "Jurassic Park," "Snake Eyes" and "Death
Becomes Her"), on less secure ground with dialogue and
characterization, which hampers Foster's attempts to make Meg Altman
a completely realized individual.</TE>
<TE>   Always an actress with presence, Foster initially downplays her
intelligence and her spunkiness, giving us Meg as a mousy type who
might fear her own shadow, the complete opposite of "The Silence of
the Lambs'" determined Clarice Starling. With pro forma lines like
"This is not happening" and "Try and stay calm," Foster never manages
to create the kind of connection with her character that Nicole
Kidman, for instance, manages in a different kind of traditional
thriller, "The Others."</TE>
<TE>   The film's bad guys have even less dimension. The invaders'
nominal commander is Junior (Jared Leto), although he has such
limited leadership abilities, he didn't even know the house was
occupied. The smartest and most decent of the group is Burnham
(Forest Whitaker), who proceeds with the crime very much against his
better judgment. Then there is Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), the
ski-mask-wearing, card-carrying psycho no film like this can do
without.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fincher's gift is for wringing people out, he chooses not
to pump up the volume this time. One result is that when one of its
undeniably efficient set pieces isn't unfolding, "Panic Room"
unwittingly provides enough downtime to consider the implausible
things characters do and say, and that makes the film less
convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, "Panic Room" is perhaps best described as the work of a
torturer who's taken the day off. On the one hand, you're deeply
grateful for the respite, but on the other, the perverse thought
arises that when the man isn't dishing out torment, what's he got to
replace it with? A devilish dilemma indeed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

particularly nasty beatings.</TE>

<HD>Nas Seems Determined to Settle Old Scores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cycles of pop music history are as hard to fathom as the
mysteries of the cosmos, or at least the logic behind choosing Grammy
winners. How is it that Kid Rock can sell gazillions of albums one
minute, then become a mere Pamela Anderson appendage the next? If
Nas' performance on Wednesday at the House of Blues is any
indication, the vexing issue of stars abruptly losing their wattage
is probably something that keeps the rapper up at night.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it was only seven years ago that Nas was one of the
most luminous rising talents in hip-hop. His 1994 album "Illmatic"
mined the same grimy subject matter as his gangsta rap
contemporaries, but with a more reflective, world-weary attitude and
a refreshing nuance to both the supple arrangements and Nas' complex
internal-rhyme schemes.</LD>
<LD>   But in the accelerated culture of current hip-hop, seven years is
considered old school, and despite recording some fine music,
including 1996's underrated "It Was Written," Nas fell precipitously
from the apex of the hip-hop hierarchy, to be replaced by a new crop
of eager comers anxious to crowd out their elders.</LD>
<TE>   Nas now finds himself in an odd position: too large to be
underground, and too marginal to be a regular on MTV's "Total Request
Live." His new album, "Stillmatic," is the most strident of his
career, an attempt at reclamation by settling old scores. That venom
has resulted in healthy record sales: "Stillmatic" reached No. 5 on
the sales chart and has sold more than a million copies. Nas leaned
heavily on its material Wednesday, the first of his two sold-out
nights at the Sunset Strip club.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in black, the New Yorker was as serious as a heart attack.
Riveted to the same spot at center stage for the duration of his
50-minute performance, Nas barked and declaimed like a Rottweiler as
he ranged widely across the usual hot-button issues that get rappers
worked up--player haters, weed, dangerous women--while two rapping
foils chimed in with vocal assent.</TE>
<TE>   But the stench of sour grapes permeated the proceedings.
"Stillmatic's" laundry list of disses against rap acts such as Mobb
Deep and Jay-Z got prominent play. It felt unseemly for a rapper of
Nas' talent to stoop so low--like a politician running TV smear ads
against his opponents. It was a callow low point in an otherwise
relentlessly invigorating set.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Accepts Reform Plan Put Forth by Volcker</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Announcement follows meeting of partners to
determine best chance of salvaging firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen said Thursday that it would adopt a reform
package proposed by former Federal Reserve chief Paul A. Volcker, a
move that analysts described as a last-ditch effort to hold the
beleaguered firm together.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen said it was "aggressively proceeding" with Volcker's
recommendations to overhaul top management and sell the lucrative but
conflict-ridden consulting operations. The announcement came after
Andersen's 1,700 U.S. partners emerged from a five-hour
teleconference in which they hashed out various options for revamping
the firm and salvaging their careers.</LD>
<LD>   Volcker proposed March 22 that he take control of Andersen and
implement the far-reaching reforms as perhaps the only way to ensure
the firm's survival.</LD>
<TE>   Various factions within Andersen have opposed the plan because it
would leave a smaller and much less profitable business. But the
firm's acquiescence shows most partners now believe it is their most
viable course of action, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It means the partners realize they must take extreme action if
they're going to have any hope of survival," said Arthur Bowman,
editor of Bowman's Accounting Report newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker refused to comment Thursday but has scheduled a news
conference in New York today.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing the Volcker plan has two primary goals, analysts said.
Andersen hopes to prompt an accord with the Justice Department, which
is prosecuting Andersen on a criminal obstruction-of-justice charge
stemming from document-shredding related to its work for Enron Corp.
It also is trying to staunch the steady outflow of clients that has
occurred as a result of the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the day was marked by an intensifying war of words
between Andersen and federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest volley of an aggressive public relations campaign,
Andersen ran newspaper ads in which UCLA basketball coaching legend
John Wooden labeled the indictment a "miscarriage of justice." The
Justice Department shot back in a legal filing claiming Andersen "has
embarked on a massive campaign to flood the public record with
slanted and outright false" statements about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has come under growing criticism for responding too
slowly to Volcker's proposal. Larry Gorrell, the head of Andersen's
U.S. business, said Thursday that the firm will quickly address what
to do with the non-audit consulting units. But the company offered no
details about how or when that would be achieved despite the
widespread perception that Andersen is up against a ticking clock.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has declined to comment on the Volcker
plan, but the lack of concrete reform plans makes it much less likely
that prosecutors would agree to suspend or dismiss their indictment,
some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "My issue with the news release is: Where's the news?" said Allan
Koltin, a Chicago-based accounting-industry consultant. "That's the
result of the whole day? My gosh."</TE>
<TE>   In their teleconference, partners spent a lot of time discussing
various ways to dispose of the tax and business-consulting practices,
including selling individual units to other firms and spinning off
the units into separate companies, said a person with knowledge of
the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The partners also left in place non-compete clauses that bar
partners from taking clients with them if they leave for other firms,
a source said. But those clauses could be lifted for partners in
units that are sold.</TE>
<TE>   The firm gave no details about layoffs that are expected to occur
next week. The U.S. partners plan another lengthy teleconference
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts offered opposing thoughts on the prospects for
Andersen to sway the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "An indictment is a very big deal at the Department of Justice,
particularly an indictment with this much publicity," said Paul
Coggins, a U.S. attorney in Dallas from 1993 to 2001. "Certainly,
Arthur Andersen has got some good arguments to make. They are
arguments Andersen did make to the government [in earlier
negotiations]. Now they're coming back and making the argument with a
different voice. To get the government to come back to the table now,
I think, is going to be a tough sell."</TE>
<TE>   But others suggested Andersen's embrace of the Volcker
plan--coupled with Andersen's aggressive legal defense--could give
prosecutors pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen's done a fairly good job of positioning themselves for
maximum leverage," said Stephen Meagher, a former federal prosecutor
now in private practice in San Francisco. "I think the combination of
these things presented the Justice Department at least a reasonable
cover for backing off this."</TE>

<HD>Year-End GDP Hints at Strong Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Consumer, military spending push growth rate in
the fourth quarter to 1.7%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The economy expanded at a 1.7% annual rate from October through
December, the Commerce Department said Thursday, marking the fastest
pace in a year and a prelude to first-quarter growth that may be the
strongest since mid-2000.</LD>
<LD>   Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, was driven in the final quarter of 2001 by consumer and
military spending that surged after the terrorist attacks Sept. 11.
Growth was stronger than the estimated 1.4% reported by the Commerce
Department last month.</LD>
<LD>   "The recession is over," said William Sullivan, senior economist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. in Jersey City, N.J. "This is
paving the way for the economic rebound that's taking place this
quarter."</LD>
<TE>   The economy, which slipped into recession a year ago, is likely to
grow at a 4.2% rate from January through March, according to a survey
by Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses replenished stockpiles that had been drawn down at a
record pace, consumers kept spending and manufacturers boosted
production. A report Thursday showed Chicago-area manufacturing
expanded in March for a second straight month, adding to evidence
that the recession was the mildest since the end of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty optimistic and confident that we have turned around
and the economy is going to be expanding," Robert Parry, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said. The recession
probably ended in December, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Interest-free financing and advertising that appealed to
patriotism spurred auto sales in the fourth quarter, emptying dealer
lots. That's one reason BorgWarner Inc., the largest maker of parts
for automatic transmissions, this week raised its first-quarter and
2002 profit estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Confident consumers, whose purchases account for two-thirds of the
economy, may still lead the economy. The University of Michigan's
consumer sentiment index rose to a 15-month high of 95.7 in March
from 90.7 in February.</TE>
<TE>   The recovery has not led to widespread job growth, a separate
report showed. The number of U.S. workers filing first-time jobless
claims rose by 18,000 last week to 394,000, the highest since
mid-January, the Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending grew at a 6.1% annual pace in the fourth
quarter, the fastest since the second quarter of 1998, the GDP report
showed.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department will probably report today that spending
accelerated in February, growing 0.5% after rising 0.4% in January,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The increases have benefited retailers such as Target Corp. and
Best Buy Co. Target, the second-biggest U.S. discounter, reported
that fourth-quarter profit rose 19% amid less price cutting. Best
Buy, the largest U.S. retailer of electronics, said profit rose 80%,
led by spending on digital televisions and DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   Government spending rose at a 10.2% annual pace in the fourth
quarter, the strongest since an 11.1% rate in the second quarter of
1978, as the U.S. increased outlays for its military campaign in
Afghanistan and domestic security. Military spending increased at a
9% rate, the fastest in a year. Non-defense federal spending rose at
16%, the fastest in 11/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   For the current quarter, the economy probably will expand at the
fastest rate since the second quarter of 2000, according to the
median of 50 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey conducted March 18-27.
By the second quarter, growth is expected to slow to a 3% pace and
probably will stay close to that rate through the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain why businesses are in no hurry to hire more
workers and why Federal Reserve policymakers may not be quick to
raise their benchmark overnight bank lending rate from a 40-year low
of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the GDP price deflator, a gauge of inflation tied to the
report, fell at a 0.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be deliberative as we approach this issue of when policy
has to change and how aggressive it has to be," the Fed's Parry said.
"I don't think inflation shows, or indicates, that there is any
imminent problem."</TE>
<TE>   Last quarter's growth pace was the fastest since a 1.9% rate in
the final three months of 2000. It followed a 1.3% pace of decline in
the third quarter and a 0.3% rise in the second. The economy grew
1.2% in all of 2001, after increases of 4.1% in 2000 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   An index of manufacturing in the Chicago area rose to 55.7 in
March after rising to 53.1 in February, to the National Assn. of
Purchasing Management-Chicago said. It was the first consecutive
increase since June and July 2000.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Immigrants Facing Barriers to Homeownership, Study
Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immigrants will create a significant need for housing over the next
two decades, but their ability to become homeowners could be
undermined by high costs and other barriers in California, according
to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   Immigrants could create demand for 4 million or more new homes
over the next two decades, according to a study released Thursday by
the research arm of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America.</LD>
<LD>   They could account for 200,000 non-rental units annually, or
roughly the equivalent of 15% of the housing starts recorded in the
U.S. last year if the home-building industry kept pace.</LD>
<TE>   In Southern California, a chronic dearth of new construction has
pushed home prices, always among the nation's highest, to record
levels while demand has increased.</TE>
<TE>   High prices also have helped hold ownership rates in Los Angeles
County to 50%, and the state ranks among the lowest in the nation in
homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between immigrant and native-born households is growing.</TE>
<TE>   Many newcomers to the U.S. over the last decade had fewer skills,
less income and education, compared with Americans, and no equity
from a previously owned home, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   And they are settling in gateway regions with high housing costs,
such as Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge for policymakers, for home builders and mortgage
lenders in trying to bring immigrants into the mainstream," said Jim
Freund, one of the analysts who put the study together for the
Washington-based research group.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County had the widest gap of ownership between immigrant
and non-immigrant households among 10 major metropolitan areas in the
U.S., at 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles had the third-highest difference at 19%, the study
found.</TE>
<TE>   The report was based on current immigrants becoming homeowners
over 20 years, a period used to analyze the progress of a previous
generation.</TE>
<TE>   From 1980 to 2000, for instance, the older group raised its
ownership rate to 57% from 19.5%, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   For newer immigrants, "there will be demand for housing, but the
question is whether there will be a supply for that demand," said
Roberto Suro of the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington research group.</TE>
<TE>   Suro said he disagreed with the study's conclusion that coming
from a less-developed country is a key negative in homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he said, the overriding factors are housing costs and
wages for low-skilled workers that include large numbers of
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, he said, immigrants are moving from high-priced
markets in California and elsewhere to smaller cities and suburbs
with less expensive housing, Suro said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're acting like assimilated Americans," he said, "and going
where the housing is cheaper and jobs are better."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a recent study by Loyola Marymount University found that
immigrants are optimistic about their children becoming homeowners
someday.</TE>
<TE>   In the survey of 1,200 people, 54% of Southern Californians
overall said the next generation would be unable to purchase a home
in the area when they become adults. But among residents born outside
the U.S., only 43% said they believed today's children will be unable
to buy here.</TE>
<TE>   John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems Inc.,
said despite rising home prices, lenders are more willing to extend
credit, including mortgages that require little or no down payments.</TE>
<TE>   With historically low interest rates in the 7% range, the odds of
immigrants becoming homeowners should improve.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mixed picture for them," Karevoll said, "but the prospects
are brighter now for them than it has been in the past."</TE>

<HD>Hewlett Sues HP, Alleging Improper Vote</HD>
<DH>Technology: The director says the firm directed business to
Deutsche Bank to win its support. The company says the claims are
baseless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett on Thursday
sued to stop the company's acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.,
accusing HP management of improperly steering business to a major
shareholder to win the investor's votes in the closely fought proxy
battle.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett's lawsuit escalates what already had been one of the most
intense and expensive shareholder fights in years. It asks a Delaware
business court to throw out the votes of Deutsche Asset Management,
which could be enough to kill the $20-billion deal.</LD>
<LD>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said last week that the company
narrowly won the proxy fight. Hewlett has refused to concede, saying
the results are too close to call.</LD>
<TE>   "They have uncovered a very sexy, interesting issue. You can't use
the shareholders' money in order to buy swing votes," said Columbia
University corporate law expert John Coffee.</TE>
<TE>   But proving that act will be difficult, legal scholars said, and
HP issued a statement calling the suit "completely without merit."</TE>
<TE>   "We find it regrettable that Mr. Hewlett has chosen to resort to
baseless claims without regard to the impact of his false accusations
on HP's business reputation and employees," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which has
resolved many of the country's biggest takeover fights. Most of the
largest U.S. companies, including HP and Compaq, are incorporated in
Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   The most serious allegation concerns HP's contacts with Deutsche
Bank. The asset management group's proxy committee had recommended a
vote against the merger, and the unit cast at least 25 million shares
to block it, according to Hewlett's suit.</TE>
<TE>   On March 15, four days before the voting deadline, HP announced a
$4-billion line of credit that would be managed by two other Wall
Street firms but co-arranged by Deutsche Bank and a fourth company.
The upfront fee for that role could be less than $1 million, one
lending expert said.</TE>
<TE>   HP then requested a telephone conference with Deutsche Bank the
morning of the March 19 special shareholders' meeting that concluded
the voting.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says that after that call, Deutsche Bank switched 17
million votes to favor the merger. If Hewlett's side is correct that
HP won the still-uncertified vote by less than 1%, that switch made
the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "On information and belief, in addition to the inducement provided
by the HP credit facility, Deutsche Bank was led to understand that
if it did not switch its votes to favor the proposed merger, its
future business dealings with HP would be jeopardized," the suit
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   A bank spokeswoman didn't return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   HP declined to respond in detail. The computer and printer company
has said the managers who picked the leaders of the credit facility
were insulated from those in the proxy fight.</TE>
<TE>   HP used Deutsche Bank as one of two lead managers in selling $652
million worth of debt last year. And the brokerage was a co-arranger
in 1997, records show.</TE>
<TE>   "Deutsche Bank consistently participates in HP deals at a
co-arranger level," said Meredith Coffey, an analyst at debt data
specialist Loan Pricing Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for Hewlett will be to produce evidence showing
something other than business as usual between HP and the brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can prove an actual exchange of remuneration for votes, I
think he has a very strong case. But I think that's pretty unlikely,"
said Harvard Law School professor and corporate law specialist
Reinier Kraakman.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett also accused HP managers of misleading shareholders and an
influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services,
about how well its merger plans were going.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says HP's planning team had been told before the
shareholder vote that the combined company might need to lay off
24,000 workers, not the 15,000 disclosed publicly, and that profit
would fall $1 billion short of estimates. HP declined to address
those accusations Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee, the Columbia expert, said those claims were less likely to
sway a judge.</TE>
<TE>   The Chancery Court tends to move quickly, and it probably will
permit Hewlett to seek documents and other information that could
back up his claims before the shareholder vote is certified in the
next few weeks and HP can close the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hewlett has asked the court to quickly declare the merger
defeated, other outcomes are more probable, Coffee said. "I don't
think many courts want to determine the winner."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the court might decide to delay the merger while it hears
evidence or even orders a new election, raising the prospect of an
additional $100 million or more in proxy fight costs and additional
lost business for HP during the distraction.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Marches to Revival in the Face of Serious
Challenges</HD>
<DH>Indexes: Performance for first three months shows cautious
rise in investor confidence, particularly in 'old-economy' stocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financial markets in the first quarter signaled loud and clear that
an economic revival is underway.</LD>
<LD>   That message was heard even above the din of the Enron-Andersen
scandal, one of the worst ever to rock investors' trust in corporate
America.</LD>
<LD>   But Wall Street's performance in the quarter also demonstrated
investors' concerns about how the fruits of the economy's recovery
will be distributed.</LD>
<TE>   The quarter's big winners included such stock sectors as trucking,
hotels and auto parts, all of which posted double-digit gains.
Meanwhile, many technology and telecommunications stock groups
plunged anew, deepening 2001 losses.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, Treasury securities fell out of favor as
market interest rates began to rise, reflecting a growing belief that
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will be tightening credit by
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   But higher-yielding corporate bonds, including "junk" issues,
found eager buyers.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities markets, gold was a surprise, rallying above $300
an ounce thanks to a surge of buying by Japanese investors worried
about their nation's banking system, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Measured solely by popular indexes, the stock market didn't have
much to show for itself. The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
inched up 2.81 points, or 0.3%, to 1,147.39 on Thursday but for the
quarter was off by a sliver (less than 0.1%, not including dividend
income).</TE>
<TE>   Markets are closed today for Good Friday, so Thursday was the last
trading day of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials had a better run, gaining 3.8% in the
quarter despite slipping 22.97 points to 10,403.94 Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite added 18.60 points, or 1%, to
1,845.35 Thursday, but slumped 5.4% in the quarter after losing 21%
last year and 39% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from technology, however, there were many strong stock
groups in the quarter as investors looked for ways to bet on a
healthier economy, building on the fourth-quarter recovery that
lifted the market from the three-year lows reached in the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Many "old-economy" stocks that were all but forgotten during the
technology mania of the late 1990s have new appeal on Wall Street.
Case in point: Nickel miner Inco Ltd. rose 15.5% in the quarter,
closing Thursday at $19.57. A global recovery is expected to drive up
the price of nickel and other basic materials.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the S&amp;P 500 index's slight loss in the first quarter, 78
stock industry sectors in the index gained ground while 25 declined.
And smaller stocks registered better gains than blue chips: The S&amp;P
small-stock index jumped 6.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The market's advance lifted even some tech sectors. Semiconductor
stocks, for example, rose 14% in the quarter, as measured by the SOX
index. Computer chip firms are expected to be among the first tech
sectors to benefit from an increase in tech spending.</TE>
<TE>   But many other tech and telecom sectors fell in the quarter,
reflecting widespread concern that a meaningful turnaround in tech
capital spending won't occur before year-end at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq telecom stock index plummeted 27% in the quarter after
diving 49% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no broad upturn yet in business capital equipment
orders," Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. economists noted in a report Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about business spending dogged the market overall for much
of the quarter, analysts said. Greenspan and others have warned
repeatedly that the economic recovery probably will be weak by
historical standards because of lackluster business spending.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, threatens to limit the expected turnaround in
corporate earnings, which last year suffered their worst decline in a
generation. With prices of many stocks already at relatively rich
levels based on estimated 2002 earnings, a key issue is how much more
investors will be willing to pay for shares.</TE>
<TE>   But some market pros warn against underestimating the potential
rebound in corporate earnings, especially given the deep cost-cutting
many companies have undertaken over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, reductions [in corporate earnings growth
assumptions] may be too aggressive, thus leaving substantial room for
upside surprises," said Ned Riley, investment strategist at State
Street Global Advisors in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks face other major challenges, however. One is rising
long-term interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note, at 5.39% on Thursday, is up from 5.05% at year-end.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Fed isn't expected to begin raising short-term interest
rates until later this year--to give the economy a chance to get
going--bond investors aren't waiting: They have pushed yields higher
as economic data have pointed to surprising strength so far this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Riley and many other analysts note that the stock market usually
has continued to rally at the outset of an economic turnaround, even
if interest rates are rising. Nonetheless, higher bond yields can be
a drag on stocks, Riley concedes.</TE>
<TE>   Rising energy prices also are a threat to a new bull market:
Near-term crude oil futures in New York rose 44 cents to $26.31 a
barrel Thursday, the highest since September. Prices are up 33% this
year as demand has risen while major exporters have limited their
output and as traders fear that the situation in the Middle East
could threaten oil supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many analysts say the stock market's resilience,
particularly in the face of the crisis of confidence generated by the
Enron Corp. and Andersen scandal, is the best indication that the
rally can be sustained.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran into a number of pretty serious hurdles [in the quarter],
yet the market didn't collapse," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&amp;P's
Outlook investment newsletter.</TE>

<HD>Spending Cuts Offset Calpine Credit Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., a power-plant developer, won't need an
investment-grade credit rating in the next two years after reducing
capital spending, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said.</LD>
<LD>   Calpine this month delayed or canceled $3 billion of power-turbine
purchases. In January, it postponed $2 billion of projects. S&amp;P's
corporate credit rating for Calpine is BB, two notches below
investment grade, and probably will stay at that level for about two
years, S&amp;P officials said during a conference call with analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "I think there is much less incentive to obtain an
investment-grade rating now than there was before" because Calpine
won't need as much access to the capital markets after trimming
spending, S&amp;P's Jeffrey Wolinsky said.</LD>
<TE>   Energy companies such as Calpine are delaying projects or selling
assets to raise cash and bolster their balance sheets after Enron
Corp.'s collapse eroded investor confidence in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Jose-based Calpine fell 22 cents to $12.70 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P on Tuesday lowered Calpine's unsecured bond rating three
levels to B-plus, four notches below investment grade, from BB-plus,
the highest junk rating after the company pledged some of its assets
to get about $2 billion in bank credit. Calpine's outlook is stable,
the rating agency said.</TE>

<HD>Bail Denied in Worker Threat Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in New Hampshire denied bail Thursday for a man
accused of using a Web site to threaten executives at Global Crossing
Ltd., where he was twice fired.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge threw out charges that Steven Sutcliffe had violated
federal privacy laws by posting the Social Security numbers of
thousands of Global Crossing employees on the site because he didn't
intend to use them for illegal purposes.</LD>
<LD>   The case moves to a federal court in California, where Global
Crossing maintains its executive offices.</LD>
<TE>   Sutcliffe worked in the technical support department for the
fiber-optic network company in Beverly Hills. Last year he was fired,
rehired, and then fired again in September.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization in January, had successfully sought an injunction to
shut down Sutcliffe's Web site last fall. But prosecutors said
Sutcliffe relocated the site using several Web hosting services
around the country and offshore.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested by the FBI on Tuesday at his home in Manchester,
N.H., where he moved in the winter. His brother lives in nearby
Auburn, and Sutcliffe's lawyer said New Hampshire is Sutcliffe's home
state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty happy he's been apprehended," Cynthia Artin, a
spokeswoman for Global Crossing in Madison, N.J., said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the site includes threats against the company's
lawyer and other employees. They said Sutcliffe issued this message
to one employee: "If you call my house again and threaten me, or my
family, or ever appear near me, or my family, I will personally send
you back to the hell from where you came."</TE>
<TE>   But Sutcliffe's lawyer in New Hampshire, federal public defender
Jonathan Saxe, urged Magistrate Judge John Muirhead to view the
entire site to see the remarks in context.</TE>
<TE>   Muirhead obliged, setting up three computers in the courtroom so
that he, Sutcliffe, lawyers and spectators could see and hear the
site.</TE>
<TE>   Saxe demonstrated the site's attempts at humor and Sutcliffe's
detailed arguments about his troubles with his former employer. He
also pointed out a disclaimer that said "this site does not advocate,
encourage or condone any conduct that is illegal at any time by any
person."</TE>
<TE>   Saxe said if Sutcliffe had meant to carry out the threats, he
wouldn't have moved to New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a cyber-imagination case," Saxe said. "When we get into
the real world, there is no indication he's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Arnold Huftalen pointed out a photo of a Global
Crossing employee with her young daughter. The site also included the
woman's address and a link to a map to her house.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Muirhead complimented Sutcliffe on his handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   "That Web site is brilliantly conceived," he said. "But it's
scary."</TE>
<TE>   Sutcliffe could face up to five years in prison if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Cash-Low Nexell May Seek Buyer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nexell Therapeutics Inc., an Irvine biotechnology company involved in
cancer research, said it's considering finding a buyer for the
company, or other alternatives, and that it will run out of cash by
July.</LD>
<LD>   Its shares Thursday fell 55 cents to close at 53 cents on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Auditors found there was "substantial doubt" about Nexell's
ability to continue its operations, the company said in a statement.
Company officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment.</LD>
<TE>   Nexell had cash and equivalents of $5.1 million at the end of
2001, compared with $12.1 million at the previous year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell ended an effort to raise money through private placement of
equity securities in the first quarter so it could focus on
"potential business combinations," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Any such transaction may reduce the value of Nexell shares, the
company said. The stock has fallen 60% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell may convert its two series of preferred stock to common
stock to complete a transaction with another company. Conversion of
Series B preferred stock would result in Baxter International Inc.
owning more than a majority of Nexell shares.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell gave Baxter, one of the largest sellers of medical
supplies, the rights last year to distribute its line of lab
products, such as reagents. As a result of that agreement, Nexell's
revenue fell to $150,000 in 2001 from $4.3 million in 2000.</TE>

bidder's stock rises above $113.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Northrop Grumman Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. defense
contractor, rose to more than $113 on Thursday, boosting the value of
its $11.4-billion bid for smaller rival TRW Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Northrop is offering to exchange stock worth $47
for each TRW share, according to a sliding exchange-rate scale based
on the market price of Northrop stock before the offer expires.</LD>
<LD>   In a document filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Northrop said the exchange ratio would be at least 0.4159
regardless of how high its stock may go, and no more than 0.4563
regardless of how low its stock may fall.</LD>
<TE>   The minimum exchange ratio means that a Northrop stock price of
$113 or more automatically boosts the bid's value above $47.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop gained $1.55 to $113.05 on the New York Stock Exchange,
the highest price since Feb. 21, which was just before the firm
launched its offer.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict that Northrop's stock may go as high as $160
in the next 12 months as the Pentagon boosts defense spending. The
price is up 12% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop is trying to convince TRW shareholders that the
acquisition is good for them. Cleveland-based TRW has rejected the
offer as too low.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has refused to raise its offer unless TRW opens its
books, which TRW has refused to do.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many 'what ifs' involved," said Robert Norfleet, an
analyst with Davenport &amp; Co., referring to whether TRW will embrace
Northrop's bid.</TE>
<TE>   TRW shares eased 14 cents to $51.47 on the NYSE Thursday. The
stock is trading at a premium to Northrop's bid because many
investors believe the offer will be increased or a rival bid will
surface.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s credit rating may be lowered by
Standard &amp; Poor's because of acquisitions and capital spending that
increased debt of the largest owner of radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel, which owns 1,225 radio stations, has made several
purchases in recent years, buying AMFM Inc. in 2000 for $23.8
billion. The company, like other radio and television broadcasters,
has been hurt because the economic slowdown caused an advertising
slump.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel may have difficulty meeting the debt level required
for a June 30, 2003, bank covenant if there isn't a second-half
recovery in the ad market, according to an S&amp;P report.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allied Waste Industries Inc., the second-biggest U.S. trash hauler,
said it may face a $360-million tax bill because the Internal Revenue
Service questioned investment losses reported by a subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS is focusing on an investment loss reported by subsidiary
Browning-Ferris Industries on the tax return filed July 30, 1999,
Allied Waste Chief Financial Officer Tom Ryan said. Ryan wouldn't
disclose the amount of the loss, which he said arose from a
Browning-Ferris stake in a private company, which he declined to
identify.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan said that the company plans to dispute any disallowance of
the investment losses and that it hasn't been presented with any
findings or claims by the IRS.</LD>

substitution program Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Ford, the world's second-largest auto maker, has replaced 10.6

blamed the other for defects linked to an estimated 271 U.S. highway
deaths involving Firestone tires, most on Explorer sport utility

Wilderness AT tires at no expense to vehicle owners. The program cost
Ford $2.1 billion last year, contributing to its first annual loss

<LD>Aventis' rheumatoid arthritis drug Arava should be withdrawn from the

<LD>   Arava has been sold in the U.S. since September 1998. Food and

with Arava. Sales of the drug were about $225 million last year.</LD>

<HD>Judge Orders Enron to Turn Over Documents in Power Crisis
Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: State officials say firm has failed to comply with
subpoena issued last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Thursday ordered Enron Corp. to hand thousands of
documents over to California regulators probing the state's power
crisis of last year.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco County Superior Court Judge A. James Robertson II
said the company must respond to the state's subpoena by June 26 or
face contempt charges.</LD>
<LD>   California officials said Enron had dragged its feet in complying
with the subpoena the state issued almost a year ago, and on Thursday
urged the judge to sanction the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office is investigating whether Enron's
business practices contributed to last year's rolling blackouts and
whether the company artificially inflated wholesale energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   Enron attorney Gary Fergus said the company had not complied with
past orders from Robertson for reasons "beyond Enron's control."</TE>
<TE>   He cited turmoil at the company, which has filed for bankruptcy
protection and is the subject of congressional and federal criminal
probes.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's former auditor, Andersen, faces a May 6 trial date on an
obstruction of justice charge for shredding documents related to its
Enron work.</TE>
<TE>   With Andersen losing clients and bracing for layoffs, Citigroup
Inc. may lose as much as $70 million it loaned in October to
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's Citibank unit extended the money as part of a
$700-million loan it arranged in October with a group of banks.</TE>
<TE>   The other lenders included Barclays Bank and Bank of America
Corp., according to Bloomberg data.</TE>
<TE>   The arranger of a loan typically holds about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "This loan has a small chance of being paid back and a large
chance of being a loss," said Roman Weil, an accounting professor at
the University of Chicago. "The likelihood of Arthur Andersen
continuing as a going concern has taken a big dip down this week."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup closed on the loan Oct. 31, the same day Enron disclosed
that the Securities and Exchange Commission was formally
investigating its accounting.</TE>
<TE>   About a week earlier, Andersen employees began destroying records
of the firm's Enron audit, the action that led to the firm's
indictment on federal obstruction of justice charges.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy in December.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup, the world's largest
financial services company, declined to comment, as did Bank of
America spokesman Jeff Hershberger and Linda Wynns of Barclays.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton didn't return calls.</TE>

<HD>Spending on Prescription Drugs Jumps for 4th Year in a Row</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spending on prescription drugs surged for the fourth consecutive year
in 2001, climbing 17.1% as sales of a relatively small number of
expensive drugs boosted sales.</LD>
<LD>   Outpatient prescription drug spending totaled $154.5 billion last
year, up from $131.9 billion in 2000, according to a study conducted
by the Washington-based National Institute for Health Care Management
Research and Educational Foundation, a nonprofit group that conducts
research on health-care issues.</LD>
<LD>   The study found that just 50 drugs out of 9,482 on the retail
market were responsible for 62.3% of the $22.5-billion increase in
spending last year.Leading the list of drugs contributing to the
increase were cholesterol treatments Lipitor and Zocor, arthritis
drugs Vioxx and Celebrex, pain reliever OxyContin and antidepressant
Celexa.</LD>
<TE>   "Once again, we see that the rise in pharmaceutical expenditures
is led by the increased use of a relatively small number of expensive
drugs," said Nancy Chockley, president of the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   She said many of the drugs that led to increased sales were most
advertised by their manufacturers to consumers and doctors. Chockley
said information about the top-selling drugs is concentrated in the
hands of the industry.Also contributing to the rise in spending was
the increase in cost of a prescription, which jumped 10.1% to $49.84.
And prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies rose 6.8% to $3.1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressants remained the top-selling drug in 2001, with sales
up 20.2% to $12.5 billion. Anti-ulcer drugs were the second-biggest
selling category with sales up 14.4% to $10.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said the study reflected that more people were
being treated for diseases, and noted how medicines can help avoid
more expensive treatments such as surgery. Industry executives also
noted that the majority of the top 50 drugs discussed in the study
were for diseases and conditions that have large numbers of
under-diagnosed patients.</TE>

<HD>Federated May Fire 3,300 From Fingerhut</HD>
<DH>Retail: The store owner will let go of workers at its
catalog and Net unit if a buyer can't be found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federated Department Stores Inc., the owner of Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, will fire 3,300 workers at its unprofitable Fingerhut
catalog and Internet unit by the end of next week if a buyer for the
business isn't found.</LD>
<LD>   Efforts to sell the unit to turnaround firm Business Development
Group Acquisitions Inc. are continuing, and Federated is considering
selling individual Fingerhut assets, Federated spokeswoman Carol
Sanger said.</LD>
<LD>   Federated is selling Fingerhut, an Internet and catalog retailer
that serves mostly lower- and middle-income customers, to focus on
its department stores, which attract higher-income shoppers,
investors have said. Business Development Group is seeking financing,
Sanger said. Fingerhut's remaining 2,700 workers will be let go if
other buyers aren't found.</LD>
<TE>   "While we still hope to be able to conclude this transaction, we
understand Federated's need to explore alternative sale scenarios for
the Fingerhut assets," said Peter Lytle, head of Business Development
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Lytle's company said it has several letters of intent for funding
that require more due diligence and he hopes to reach a definitive
agreement with Federated.</TE>
<TE>   The shares of Cincinnati-based Federated fell 14 cents to $40.85
on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement was made after the
close of regular U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   Federated said it will provide severance packages to the workers
based on years of service and other factors. About 3,000 of the
affected employees are in Minnesota, while 250 to 300 are in
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer has been approached by other potential buyers of
Fingerhut units, including its Arizona Mail Order, Figi's and Popular
Club catalogs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Business Development Group, based in Wayzata, Minn., said it
would rehire many of the fired workers if it completes a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Federated bought Fingerhut in 1999 for $1.7 billion to expand its
Internet business.</TE>

<HD>Ford Says Large Sedan to Redefine Family Car</HD>
<DH>Autos: Decision to build a big brother to the mass-market
Taurus is part of a move toward roomier vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Moving away from the fiercely competitive mainstream sedan market,
Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it would produce a larger,
near-luxury sedan that it said would redefine the family car.</LD>
<LD>   The move indicates that the No. 2 auto maker is refocusing its
attention from the mid-size Taurus, once the best-selling passenger
car in the country, toward roomier cars including "crossover" type
vehicles that combine the attributes of passenger cars and sport
utility vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The new car, called the Ford Five Hundred, will share its platform
with a crossover called the CrossTrainer. That fact underscores the
importance the auto maker is placing in the market for crossovers,
which are emerging as key family vehicles of the future.</LD>
<TE>   "The Five Hundred will change the face--and space--of the family
sedan," said James O'Connor, president of the company's Ford
division, in making the announcement at the New York International
Auto Show. No model or prototype was at the show, but O'Connor showed
a brief video animation of the car, set to go on sale in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   It will be powered by a four-cylinder engine or a new 3.0-liter
V-6, but O'Connor would not give other details about the powertrain.</TE>
<TE>   The car, which gets its name from the Ford Galaxie 500 sedan of
the 1960s, will be built alongside the CrossTrainer at Ford's factory
in Chicago, which is ending its production of the Taurus.</TE>
<TE>   The Five Hundred will offer seating that is two to four inches
taller than that of the Taurus and an upscale treatment that will pit
it against higher-end sedans such as Toyota Motor Corp.'s Avalon and
Nissan Motor Co.'s Maxima.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts wondered whether the Five Hundred might compete against
the Taurus as well as Ford's Crown Victoria full-size sedan, but
O'Connor said the vehicles would appeal to different consumers. The
Crown Victoria is a larger, rear-wheel-drive car widely sold to
police and taxi fleets, whereas the Five Hundred is a
front-wheel-drive car aimed at retail customers.</TE>
<TE>   Ford insists that it is not abandoning the Taurus or its twin, the
Mercury Sable. Production of the two models--which compete against
Toyota's Camry, Nissan's Altima and Honda Motor Co.'s Accord--is
being consolidated at Ford's Atlanta plant.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of other details left some analysts scratching their
heads.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what the message is they're sending with this
vehicle," said Rebecca Lindland, an auto analyst with forecaster
DRI-WEFA. "Will both the Sable and the Taurus be continued? My
suspicion is they will be keeping the Sable because they don't want
anything to suggest they may be phasing out Mercury."</TE>
<TE>   The Mercury line has suffered from a lack of clear positioning in
the market. As part of Ford's sweeping restructuring announced in
January, two Mercury vehicles--the Cougar sports coupe and the
Villager minivan--are being discontinued, though Ford insists the
brand will stay.</TE>
<TE>   In retooling the Chicago plant for models that should have higher
profit margins than the mass- market Taurus, Ford aims to become more
competitive in car-based vehicles, said Joseph Phillippi, a longtime
Wall Street analyst who is a principal at AutoTrends.</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Three have had substantial passenger car market share
losses and clearly will lose share in trucks" as imports make greater
inroads, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But they have to make at least an attempt to put a finger in the
dike and get stabilized to the point where maybe they make money on
passenger cars," Phillippi said. "Ford's making a major effort to
turn around profitability by concentrating production in Chicago."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Farmers to Plant More Biotech Crops This Year</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Despite international resistance, more than 79
million acres of genetically engineered corn and soybeans are
expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American farmers will plant more genetically engineered crops this
year, including one-third of the corn on U.S. soil, shrugging off
international resistance to biotech food.</LD>
<LD>   The farmers are expected to grow more than 79 million acres of
genetically engineered corn and soybeans, the nation's two most
widely planted commodities, a 13% increase from last year, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The gene-altered crops require fewer chemicals, making them easier
and cheaper to grow. The crops are engineered to be toxic to insects
or to be resistant to a popular weedkiller.</LD>
<TE>   "Farming has become so competitive, so small margin, that if we
can find something that works economically and environmentally, we'll
jump on it," said Minnesota farmer Gerald Tumbleson, who grows
biotech corn and soybeans.</TE>
<TE>   About 74% of this year's soy crop, or 54 million acres, will be
genetically engineered, compared with 68% last year and 54% in 2000,
the Agriculture Department said. Soy is a crucial ingredient for a
variety of foods and, like corn, also is used for animal feed.</TE>
<TE>   About 32% of the corn crop, or 25.3 million acres, will be biotech
varieties, compared with 26% in 2001 and 25% the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Strong consumer resistance to agricultural biotechnology has
arisen in Europe and Japan, but most U.S.-grown corn and soybeans are
used domestically.</TE>
<TE>   "The farmer looks at it strictly from profitability," said
commodities analyst Don Roose. "They're not shying away from it."</TE>
<TE>   About 10.5 million acres of cotton, or 71% of this year's crop,
will be bioengineered. Last year, 69% of the cotton was gene-altered.</TE>
<TE>   Genetically engineered corn and cotton are considered better for
the environment because they reduce the use of insecticides.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech soybeans contain a bacterium gene that makes the crop
immune to Roundup herbicide. To control weeds in conventional
soybeans, farmers must either cultivate more often or spray more
frequently with less powerful weedkillers; critics are concerned that
Roundup is being used so much that weeds will develop resistance to
it.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's report "shows the continued high confidence that U.S.
farmers have placed in seeds improved through biotechnology," said
Michael Phillips of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks More Andersen Testimony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors asked a judge Thursday to let them continue
questioning Andersen employees in front of a grand jury even after
the accounting firm's indictment on an obstruction-of- justice
charge.</LD>
<LD>   The move is a response to an Andersen claim that prosecutors are
improperly using the grand jury to probe for evidence supporting a
charge that already has been filed. Andersen, the former auditor of
fallen energy giant Enron Corp., had asked U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon to quash subpoenas sent to four of its executives.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the request "is another in a series of efforts to
manipulate the pace and timing of the government's investigation into
obstruction of justice and other crimes relating to Enron, Andersen
and certain of their personnel."</LD>
<TE>   Courts have ruled that the law prohibits prosecutors from calling
a grand jury to hear evidence adding to an existing indictment. But
prosecutors said the law allows a grand jury to continue hearing
testimony to determine whether unindicted individuals were involved
in the same criminal activity or whether the indicted defendant
committed other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said Andersen is trying to shut down the
grand jury's probe of "the conduct of Andersen employees who include
persons the firm originally blamed in its public statements for the
widespread obstructive acts alleged in the indictment."</TE>
<TE>   In January, Andersen fired David B. Duncan, the lead partner
overseeing audits of Enron, and suspended three others, saying that
"it should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate
unethical behavior." More recently, the firm has toned down its
description of the executives' conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has sought to persuade prosecutors to withdraw the
indictment, saying it unfairly punishes the firm's 28,000 U.S.
employees for the actions of a few.</TE>
<TE>   In their motion, prosecutors said the company's public relations
campaign attacking the government's case "serves to signal Andersen's
desired factual position to current and former employees, some of
whom may be targets, subjects or witnesses in the pending
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, an attorney for Andersen, told Reuters that he was
"really saddened to see representatives of the government suggest
that these employees ... should not have the right to freely express
their disagreement without being accused of witness coaching."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate filing, prosecutors also offered a behind-the-scenes
glimpse of the events leading to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie R. Caldwell, the prosecutor overseeing a task force probing
Enron's collapse, said in the filing that Andersen--after disclosing
in January that employees had shredded Enron-related records--asked
the government to conduct an "expedited investigation" into the
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department initially informed Andersen on March 1 that
it intended to ask the grand jury to indict the firm for destruction
of records, Caldwell said. On March 3, at Andersen's request,
prosecutors held a meeting with Andersen Chief Executive Joseph F.
Berardino and other executives, in which the firm made a presentation
and asked the department not to indict it, Caldwell's declaration
said. Prosecutors decided not to reverse their earlier decision.</TE>
<TE>   Not until March 6, Caldwell said, did Andersen say it wished to
present testimony to the grand jury.</TE>

<HD>PepsiCo Lands NFL Soft Drink Contract</HD>
<DH>Beverages: The company ousts Coca-Cola as sponsor in a deal
worth an estimated $160 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PepsiCo Inc. fired the latest volley in the cola wars Thursday,
announcing a multiyear deal to replace archrival Coca-Cola Co. as the
official soft drink sponsor of the National Football League.</LD>
<LD>   In what sources close to the negotiations called a five-year deal
worth about $160 million, Pepsi-Cola will become the official soft
drink sponsor of the NFL beginning in the 2002 season. PepsiCo's
Tropicana brand also will be the official juice of the sports league.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the NFL nor Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo disclosed
financial terms or the length of the agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Football is the most popular sport on television in the United
States, drawing an average 120million viewers on weekends in the
fall. The U.S. also is the largest and most important soft drink
market for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola, the world's No. 1 soft drink company, moved quickly
Thursday to put the NFL sponsorship behind it.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta-based soft drink maker, which has been affiliated with
the NFL for more than a decade, said it was turning its attention to
increasing its marketing with 20 of the 32 individual NFL teams, as
well as a large number of college and local football programs.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola is the official soft drink sponsor of the National
Hockey League, the National Basketball Assn. and NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Coca-Cola, which have gained about 20% since early
February, fell 3 cents to $52.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.
PepsiCo rose 45 cents to $51.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Viacom Inc. won approval to further delay complying with a government
order to sell television stations while the Federal Communications

court.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC gave Viacom, one of the two biggest U.S. TV station
owners, a year from the approval date of a new rule to meet the cap.
It now prohibits one company from owning stations that reach more
than 35% of TV homes.</LD>

<LD>Cardiac Science Inc. said it filed a lawsuit accusing rival Zoll
Medical Corp. of stealing its patented ideas for heart
defibrillators.</LD>
<LD>   Zoll said Tuesday it received Food and Drug Administration
approval for an automated external defibrillator that can be used by
people such as lifeguards, flight attendants and security guards.
Cardiac Science claims Zoll's new defibrillator uses technology
covered by two Cardiac Science patents.</LD>
<LD>   Cardiac Science wants damages and a court to block further sale of
any products that infringe the patents. Shares of Burlington,
Mass.-based Zoll fell $1.30 to $38.40, and shares of Irvine-based
Cardiac Science rose 2 cents to $3, both on Nasdaq.</LD>

<HD>Internet, Software Firms May Sue IPO Underwriters Over
Pricing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet start-ups and software companies sued by investors over
their initial stock offerings are considering filing their own
lawsuits accusing the underwriters that took them public of
underpricing their stock, according to court records.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Jack Auspitz, who represents 300 companies including
Razorfish Inc., Red Hat Inc. and DoubleClick Inc. in the investor
suits, said some of his clients may sue the underwriters.</LD>
<LD>   Creditors of now-defunct Mortgage.com were the first to make the
underpricing claim against an investment bank.</LD>
<TE>   In a suit filed in May, they accused Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp. of charging too little for IPO shares of the Internet home and
commercial finance company in a bid to curry favor with institutional
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Auspitz declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage.com creditors said in their suit that the company and
other Internet start-ups were "deprived of millions of dollars in IPO
proceeds to which they were lawfully entitled." The suit seeks
class-action status on behalf of other firms that were taken public
by CSFB.</TE>
<TE>   The bank has denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Sunrise, Fla.-based Mortgage.com sold 7 million shares when it
went public in August 1999, raising $56.5 million. The stock debuted
at $8 a share, nearly tripled to a high of $22.75 within a month and
then fell to less than $1 within a year.</TE>
<TE>   The company was liquidated in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder suits already are pending against about 40
underwriters, including CSFB, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Lehman
Bros. Holdings Inc., and more than 300 technology firms. Plaintiffs
in the suits say the banks secretly allocated IPO shares to investors
who agreed to buy more stock at higher prices after the IPO, when
shares were made available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   That practice created an artificial demand, the suits say.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet-related and software firms are accused of making
misleading statements in their prospectuses.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyers say damages against the banks and the
companies they took public might top $1 billion.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taubman Centers Inc. said Thursday that it has sold two of Santa
Barbara's largest shopping malls, La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo, in
separate deals.</LD>
<LD>   The real estate investment trust said it will use a portion of the
$77million from the sale of the two properties it has owned since
1996 to buy a 50% stake in Sunvalley, a 1.3-million-square-foot
shopping center in Concord, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Taubman sold La Cumbre Plaza, a 474,000-square-foot, open-air
center anchored by Robinsons-May and Sears, to Madison Marquette, a
Washington-based property management and development company. J.P.
Morgan Fleming Asset Management has agreed to purchase Paseo Nuevo, a
438,000- square-foot center anchored by Macy's and Nordstrom, on
behalf of a fund advised by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The sale of La Cumbre Plaza has been completed and the Paseo Nuevo
deal is expected to be final in the next several weeks. Both
properties will be managed by Madison Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   "These transactions are consistent with our goals of recycling our
capital and improving the overall consistency of our properties,"
said Robert S. Taubman, chairman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based
Taubman Centers.</TE>

<HD>Dutch Court Backs Software Maker KaZaA</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Dutch appeals court ruled that the maker of computer software that
lets people download music, movies and other copyright-protected
material isn't liable for copyright infringement.</LD>
<LD>   The court overturned a judgment against KaZaA, which was convicted
in November of violating copyright law. Because the shared files
contain copyright-protected material, KaZaA was ordered to block
users from downloading songs.</LD>
<LD>   But the Amsterdam appellate court quashed the ruling, saying that
the users of KaZaA's Media Desktop software were responsible for the
copyright infringement, and not the maker or distributor of the
computer program.</LD>
<TE>   It also said that the KaZaA program wasn't exclusively designed to
download copyright protected works.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials were not immediately available to comment on the
report.</TE>
<TE>   KaZaA called the ruling "an important victory" over music
copyright organizations that lodged the case in the Netherlands.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cash-poor start-ups with ambitious goals to revolutionize the
delivery of home entertainment have decided to merge.</LD>
<LD>   Moxi Digital, based in Palo Alto, and Digeo, based in Kirkland,
Wash., are developing platforms for multimedia set-top boxes.</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms weren't disclosed. The new company will be named
Digeo, with headquarters in Kirkland and Palo Alto.</LD>
<TE>   The companies saw that their missions were nearly identical: to
give television viewers easy access to a new world of entertainment,
information, communications and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Their products--a set-top box platform that would act as a gateway
for TV programming, video, music and the Internet and be distributed
to multiple televisions in a house--even had some of the same
components.</TE>
<TE>   No layoffs of the 217 employees at Digeo and the 111 at Moxi are
planned.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Said to Be Near Sharing VSIP Tool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. was close to sharing a key programming tool after
learning that Palm Inc. was participating in the antitrust case
against the software giant, an executive from the hand-held computer
maker said in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   Palm executive Michael Mace told U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly the software giant had refused Palm access to the
software development tool called Visual Studio Integration Program,
or VSIP, and had set one-sided conditions for allowing Palm
hand-helds to work with Microsoft's .Net Internet software.</LD>
<LD>   Mace was the ninth witness called by nine states seeking stiffer
sanctions against Microsoft for findings it illegally maintained its
Windows monopoly in personal computer operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased that Palm may now be offered access to VSIP, but
the process by which we go there was very disturbing," Mace said in
written testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Mace, chief competitive officer of Palm's software subsidiary,
said Microsoft had refused to allow Palm into the VSIP, even though
it was supposed to be open to the whole computer industry.</TE>

<HD>Verizon Says Argentine Unit Defaulted on Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. said its Argentine wireless unit
defaulted on $1 billion of debt after the country's devaluation
slashed revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon also cut its stake in the unit, called CTI Holdings, to
48% from 65% by giving 5.5 million shares to employees in a move to
reduce exposure to Argentina. The reduction allows Verizon to exclude
CTI from its financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   The default underscores the financial difficulties facing
companies in Argentina and how their foreign owners, such as Verizon,
are unwilling to support their Argentine units after the nation's
$95-billion default and devaluation.</LD>
<TE>   CTI hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin to
negotiate with creditors. The debt includes $263 million of senior
notes due 2008, plus loans and vendor financing, analysts said.
Verizon is liable for about 10% of CTI's $1-billion debt. The local
currency has lost about 65% since January.</TE>

<HD>Watson Incontinence Patch Rejected</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: FDA asks for more clinical data on the
product. Corona company's shares fall 12%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. said U.S. regulators rejected a skin
patch for urinary incontinence that analysts called the generic-drug
maker's most important new product. Watson shares fell 12%.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration asked for more clinical data on
the patch, called Oxytrol. The company has research not yet seen by
the FDA, comparing Oxytrol to Pharmacia Corp.'s Detrol, that may
resolve the agency's concerns, Watson Chief Executive Allen Chao said
during a conference call.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts estimated Oxytrol's potential sales at as much as $500
million a year and said its approval was crucial to ensure Watson's
growth.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA's rejection, the second in 24 hours involving a Watson
product, is a blow to the company's strategy of shifting to
higher-profit brand-name products.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Corona-based Watson tumbled $3.65 to $27.09 on the New
York Stock Exchange, their biggest one-day decline in more than four
months.</TE>
<TE>   If the FDA accepts Watson's research comparing Oxytrol and Detrol,
the company expects to file an amendment to its application with the
agency by the end of the second quarter, said Charles Ebert, senior
vice president of research and development.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said the delay in getting Oxytrol approved will lower 2002
revenue, which it expects to be $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, down
from a previous forecast of as much as $1.28 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Watson said earnings this year will be higher than
previously forecast because the company won't have to spend as much
as it had planned to introduce Oxytrol.</TE>
<TE>   Watson expects to report first-quarter earnings of 33 cents or 34
cents a share, in line with analyst expectations; and 2002 earnings
of $1.60 to $1.70 a share, higher than an earlier estimate of $1.55
to $1.60.</TE>

<HD>Low Interest Rates Spur Bond Issuance</HD>
<DH>Debt: Corporations, governments struggling to bridge budget
gaps rush to raise money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporations and municipalities took advantage of low interest rates
in the first quarter to issue nearly $310 billion in new debt,
Thomson Financial Securities Data said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Issuance of new U.S. municipal bonds rose to the third-highest
quarterly volume on record, as struggling states and local
governments borrowed to make up for depleted tax revenue, the market
data provider said.</LD>
<LD>   Long-term municipal bond issuance jumped to $64.7 billion in the
first quarter, an 11% increase from the year-earlier period.</LD>
<TE>   "We have more budgetary problems, and you saw more issuance to
bridge budget gaps," said Cadmus Hicks, a municipal market strategist
with Nuveen Investments in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting for tax law changes and inflation, state tax collections
shrank by 4% between October and December, according to the latest
data from the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the
State University of New York in Albany.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, interest rates in the municipal market hit
near-record lows late last year, leading more municipalities to put
bond deals in the works so they could take advantage of low yields.</TE>
<TE>   Companies, meanwhile, confounded forecasters by selling more debt
than expected in the first quarter: $245 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bond traders originally had predicted that companies would delay
many bond deals as they waited for another rate cut by the Federal
Reserve. "You had the expectation going into the year that the Fed
may have one more easing in it," said Jim Merli, global head of the
fixed-income syndicate at Lehman Bros. Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As economic data pointed to surprising strength, and market
interest rates began to rise in the first quarter, many companies
decided to borrow rather than wait and face potentially higher rates
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Investor nervousness about unsecured short-term corporate debt in
the aftermath of the bankruptcies of Enron Corp., Global Crossing
Ltd. and other firms also pushed more firms to borrow via secured
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The overall pace of corporate bond issuance is slightly above the
pace set in 2001, when $818 billion of corporate debt was sold, and
just above the $242.2billion sold in the first quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, Credit Suisse Group
Inc.'s Credit Suisse First Boston unit and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.--respectively, the top investment-grade, "junk" and convertible
securities underwriters in 2001--held on to their leads in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kane, managing director at Banc of America Securities, said
that if interest rates remain stable in the next several weeks, "we
may see issuance front-end-loaded in the second quarter, but it's
still too early to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Exchanges Set Timetable for Options Linkage</TE>
<TE>   The five U.S. exchanges that trade options securities have agreed
on a timetable for permanently linking their markets to ensure that
investors get the best prices, regulators said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Under the timetable, testing of the electronic linkages would
start in early December. The plan sets Feb. 1 as the date by which a
first phase of the intermarket linkage would be implemented and April
30 for a second and final phase.</TE>
<TE>   "The options intermarket linkage is an important step in improving
options customers' ability to receive the best prices available," the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.</TE>
<TE>   An option is a right to buy or sell a specific type of
assets--such as stocks, bonds and currencies--at a set price within a
preset time period. An option holder is not obligated to exercise the
option to buy or sell before it expires.</TE>
<TE>   The heads of the exchanges proposed the timetable to the SEC this
year only after much prodding by regulators. The exchanges already
have had a one-year reprieve from implementing the electronic linkage
ordered in October 1999 by the market-regulating SEC under
then-Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The market regulator said that unless an exchange participates in
a linkage, customers must be told when options orders are executed at
prices inferior to the best published prices.</TE>
<TE>   The five exchanges are the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
American Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Pacific
Exchange and International Securities Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Those who like to play the pick six at Gulfstream Park on Fridays,
when there is always a guaranteed $25,000 pool, have themselves a
single today.</LD>
<LD>   Orchard Park, a 3-year-old son of Hennessy, should win his fourth
in a row in the $75,000-added Graveslines Stakes, the ninth of 10
races on the card.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Bill Mott for owner Peter Vegso, Orchard Park had a
fourth, a third and two seconds in his first four races, but has not
lost since being re-introduced to the turf on Nov. 16.</LD>
<TE>   After beating maidens on the Aqueduct grass, the chestnut shipped
south and won an allowance race at Gulfstream Park by daylight on
Jan. 11, then won the Palm Beach, a Grade III, by nearly two lengths
as the 13-10 favorite six weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   In a race restricted to Florida-breds, Orchard Park gets a
positive post change. After leaving from the outside in a field of 12
in the Palm Beach, he will start from post four and will again be
ridden by Jerry Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Trainer Julio Canani has two contenders, The
Price Spirit and Zanapour, in today's seventh at Santa Anita. The
race is at one mile on the grass and other notables in the field are
Apache Wings, Leave Us Leap and Black Silk.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Carla Gaines. When stretching out horses from a sprint
to a route, the trainer has won with five of her last 12. Super High
will try to improve on the percentage when she goes from six furlongs

<LD>Cabaway is not the best horse running at Los Alamitos tonight, but
the veteran gelding is certainly the most experienced.</LD>
<LD>   Now 11, Cabaway is scheduled to make his 103rd career start in the
sixth at his usual distance of 870 yards. Owned by Cinda Neth and
trained by Paul Price, the Texas-bred is the 9-5 morning line
favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Boag will ride Cabaway, who will be seeking his 16th win and
trying to rebound from consecutive losses as the favorite. He
finished fourth at 6-5 on March 8, and a couple of weeks before that
he was second at 9-10. Thus far in 2002, he is 0 for 4.</LD>
<TE>   Another old-timer on the card is Ganster. Trained by Paul Jones,
the 9-year-old gelding is the 5-2 second choice in the seventh at 350
yards. A winner of 17 of 72, he is 0 for 11 since the start of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lucks Flying High. 2. Virgule. 3. Tierra Firme. 4.
Vising. 5. Seperate Lanes. 6. KG Jim Dandy. 7. Ryans Ridge. 8. Texas
Classy. 9. A Big Shot Of Brandy.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Let's concentrate on the late pick four tonight, which
includes races 6-9. In the sixth, we'll single the returning
appaloosa KG Jim Dandy; use Ryans Ridge, Justa Live Weapon, Superoyal
Special and Traffic Boss in the seventh; use Texas Classy and Old
Easy Money in the eighth and A Big Shot Of Brandy and Tst Mr Linster
in the ninth. Total cost: $16.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Over A Mile (15-1) is a debuting Arabian from a
winning barn (Billy Lewis) in the fourth. Superoyal Special (15-1) in
the seventh could be coming up to a good one for trainer Adan Farias.</TE>
<TE>   Post Time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Glenn Thompkins, who led the Rialto Eisenhower football team to a
14-0 record, a Southern Section Division I championship and a No. 2
national ranking in 1993, has been named to replace Tom Hoak as the
Eagles' varsity coach.</LD>
<LD>   Thompkins, 26, is a middle school teacher who served as Hoak's
offensive coordinator the last two seasons. He was the Division I
player of the year in 1993, when the Eagles beat Mater Dei, 56-3, in
the championship game. Thompkins was a defensive back at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Hoak compiled a 181-88-4 record in 24 seasons as a coach, the last
19 at Eisenhower. His Eagle teams won one section title, made the
playoffs in 13 of his final 14 seasons and won six Citrus Belt League
titles.</LD>

<HD>Big Brothers Watching Pitts Excel</HD>

<LD>Julia Pitts faced a daunting task trying to tag along with her three
older brothers.</LD>
<LD>   "No, you're a girl, get away," they told her while she was growing
up.</LD>
<LD>   Whether playing touch football or jumping off a roof, the brothers
weren't convinced of their sister's toughness.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd follow them and they'd say, 'Stay back,'" Pitts said. "I was
always their little sister, and they didn't want me to get hurt doing
what they were doing."</TE>
<TE>   But there were games in the neighborhood that Pitts wanted to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "They were always throwing the football around," she said. "I'd
wait until the ball rolled into the street, then I'd run and go get
it just so I could touch the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Little did her brothers realize that they had a ringer in their
family, and it was Julia. They've since become her most loyal fans,
watching her blossom into one of the top female athletes in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   She was the Ocean League player of the year in volleyball at North
Torrance High. She's an All-Southern Section basketball player. She's
one of the top 400-meter runners in the state, finishing sixth last
season. This month, without any practice, she cleared a school-record
5 feet 9 in the high jump.</TE>
<TE>   She has signed with UCLA for basketball but also will compete in
track, and she might play volleyball after her freshman year.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe she's the next Jackie Joyner-Kersee," North
Torrance track Coach Candy Ham said. "She's that good."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts stands 6-2, looks like a model and competes as if she's an
indestructible machine.</TE>
<TE>   "She works hard every day, no matter what," girls' basketball
Coach Krissy Duperron said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts averaged 21.5 points in basketball and figures to improve
greatly in college because she has been playing the game only since
her freshman year.</TE>
<TE>   She was a cheerleader with little sports background until she
arrived at North Torrance. Pitts remembers coaches, who had spotted
her on campus, stopping her.</TE>
<TE>   "You're coming to play for me," they told her.</TE>
<TE>   First came volleyball, then basketball and track. With each sport,
she'd start from scratch, struggle early, then improve and become a
standout.</TE>
<TE>   "She's naturally talented," Ham said. "She trains real hard. But
more than that, she's a wonderful person."</TE>
<TE>   Her brothers showed the way in sports. Chester, 22, is an
offensive lineman at San Diego State who figures to be taken in the
upcoming NFL draft. Devin, 20, is a receiver at USC. Ryan, 19, runs
track at El Camino College.</TE>
<TE>   Julia has no hard feelings about her brothers not letting her join
them early on.</TE>
<TE>   "They push me to try harder," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She's fast enough to outrun 320-pound Chester, but she knows not
to pick a fight with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He pulls me up by one arm and throws me somewhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches were excited to recruit Pitts because she has made such
rapid progress without the benefit of a youth sports background and
possesses many of the qualities needed to excel at the college level.</TE>
<TE>   "She's raw," UCLA basketball Coach Kathy Olivier said. "The girl
can get up and down the floor. She runs like a deer. She has long
arms. She's explosive. She's going to see her game go to another
level."</TE>
<TE>   Twice at track and field invitationals this month, Pitts was
selected the female athlete of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Whether high jumping, running the hurdles or competing in relays,
she'll do whatever is necessary to help her team succeed.</TE>
<TE>   The best moments for Pitts are when she competes and her brothers
can be there to cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "I like having my brothers all there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And her brothers have learned not to underestimate their little
sister. They wouldn't mind recruiting her for a game of touch
football.</TE>
<TE>   "Line her up on the outside and let her run," Devin said.</TE>

<LD>Animal shelters across the state are increasingly overcrowded, which
leads to disease and to injury when dogs and cats crammed together in
small cages get into fights. That makes animals unadoptable and
hampers officers' ability to pick up more strays on city streets.</LD>
<LD>   The overcrowding is largely the unintended consequence of a 1999
bill by former state Sen. Tom Hayden that extended the time that
shelters had to hold strays before euthanizing them. By requiring
shelter directors to keep all stray dogs and cats four or six
business days, depending on certain conditions, instead of three,
Hayden's bill has backfired on the very animals he hoped to help. The
measure has forced shelters to kill adoptable animals the day they
hit the deadline to make room for even dangerous or severely ill
animals that are certain to be euthanized later.</LD>
<LD>   The problems could get worse July 1, when a second provision of
the Hayden bill will require shelters to hold animals relinquished by
owners for the same time as strays, rather than the current three
days. This could increase shelter populations by one-third.</LD>
<TE>   In February, Sen. Edward Vincent (D-Inglewood) introduced SB 1931,
a sensible measure to keep the holding period as it is. Vincent,
however, is enduring a furious outcry. One Hayden bill proponent,
UCLA Law School professor Taimie L. Bryant, fumed in a letter to
Vincent last month, ''Owner-relinquished pets ... are usually in much
better shape than strays.... Why should these animals die in our
shelters? Because shelter employees do not like cleaning up after
them?'' Other critics include the San Francisco "animal rescue"
activists who argued to save Hera, the dog that helped fatally maul a
33-year-old woman.</TE>
<TE>   The ridiculousness of "rehabilitating" a proven dangerous dog
aside, decisions about which animals have a chance of finding a home
should fall to shelter directors, not to clueless state legislators
or the loudest political constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to kill animals, but these hard choices are forced on
shelters by tiny budgets and multiple needs, including making streets
safer by rounding up strays. Forcing longer deadlines on shelters
without adding money and space would only increase the misery.</TE>

<LD>For the more than 10 years that Herman Walker has lived in federally
subsidized housing in Oakland he has been, to all accounts, a model
tenant. When a stroke left him partially paralyzed, the 78-year-old
hired Eleanor Randle, a health care aide, to help him with cooking
and bathing. Big mistake. Although he didn't know it at first, Randle
was a cocaine user, and she hid the drug in Walker's apartment and a
crack pipe in a bag of her hair rollers. She was caught during a
security check of the building, and because of her drug use Walker
may be evicted. Walker may deserve to stay where he is, but that does
not make the law allowing his eviction wrong.</LD>
<LD>   In a unanimous decision Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
law giving public housing administrators the unfettered right to get
rid of tenants if any family member or visitor is caught with illegal
drugs on or off the premises. It doesn't matter whether the tenant
knew of the drug use, or could know. In three of the four cases on
which the Supreme Court ruled, the tenants claimed that the drug
activity took place without their knowledge, either in the parking
lot of the apartment complex or blocks away. Nor will it necessarily
matter to housing officials that a tenant tried to prevent such
activity. The reasoning is that tenants unable to control drug
activity, even if they don't condone it, still harm their neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   This one-strike policy is at least as draconian as the zero
tolerance policies many school districts have adopted, requiring the
expulsion of any student who brings drugs onto campus. Federal
housing officials believed it had to be that way to quell the drug
trafficking and gang violence that can destroy public housing
complexes. Chicago's Cabrini-Green project and Robert Taylor Homes
are among the most notorious. Although conceived as decent housing
for tens of thousands of hard-working, low-income residents, the drug
trade helped make them miserable, treacherous places where even
police officers feared to tread.</TE>
<TE>   With its decision upholding the no-drug-use lease terms, the
Supreme Court has given housing administrators a potent club they can
wield to reclaim public housing projects. Officials should now take
care to use this power wisely.</TE>
<TE>   Under the court ruling allowing eviction, in many cases that harsh
action will be justified but it is not required. For tenants like
Herman Walker, eviction seems cruelly unjust. In some cases, housing
officials can and should set conditions short of eviction--for
example, barring certain visitors or family members from the
premises. Other cases may more easily justify eviction, as when the
leaseholder turns a blind eye to where the easy money or the new
big-screen television came from.</TE>
<TE>   Public housing was never intended to be luxurious, but it
shouldn't be a drug-filled purgatory. The Supreme Court's stern
ruling could help revive those housing projects where dealers and
gangbangers have put residents under siege.</TE>

<LD>The despicable attack of a Palestinian suicide bomber on Israeli
families about to share the traditional meal that begins Passover may
well kill a Mideast peace process that was showing faint signs of
life. But a display of restraint now by Israel could be a powerful
signal of strength.</LD>
<LD>   The bombing was the work of Hamas, a group that seeks the
destruction of Israel and does not recognize the leadership of Yasser
Arafat or the Palestinian Authority. The bombing, at a hotel dining
room, was calculated to cause the deepest possible anger, grief and
religious affront. The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
launched an attack on Arafat's Ramallah headquarters compound today
and announced a call-up of reserves. Branding Arafat an enemy and
vowing to ''isolate'' him is a bad portent, and some government
ministers used ominous rhetoric after a Cabinet meeting. But Israel
must still try to leave the truce door open.</LD>
<TE>   The bombing in Netanya, on the Israeli coast, gives Arafat, the
president of the Palestinian Authority, another chance to lead.
Arafat condemned the murder of 20 people and the wounding of more
than 100 in the bombing, but he has issued such statements after
previous bloodbaths. His Thursday statement that he is ready to work
for a cease-fire was welcome but insufficient, accompanied as it was
by a Palestinian gunman's attack on a West Bank settlement. If he
wants to moderate an Israeli response he must at least arrest
terrorists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad and order members of factions
that support him, such as Fatah, to stop their own attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat did crack down on Palestinian attacks briefly last
December, but soon the bombs and gunfire erupted again. If he is seen
to act effectively against terrorists this time, it will be up to
Sharon to reciprocate. The Bush administration has kept its mediator,
Anthony C. Zinni, in Israel. That acknowledges the role the United
States must play if there is to be any chance of quelling the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon should not have stopped Arafat from attending the Arab
summit in Beirut, but the prime minister gained some cover for his
actions now. He can say to those pressuring him from the right that
he resisted Washington's urging to let Arafat go and return freely.
Arafat can tell his followers that he too has resisted pressure from
Washington to stop all attacks, including on Israeli military
outposts in the occupied territories, but is cracking down on Hamas
and other terrorist groups because the slaughter of civilians
threatens to destroy the Saudi peace initiative that Arab leaders
adopted unanimously in Beirut. Arafat welcomed the Saudi proposal,
and an Israeli official called it "a very interesting development,
something that should be pursued." Hamas despises the initiative
because it would have Arab nations establish "normal relations" with
Israel rather than seek its destruction.</TE>
<TE>   A large-scale Israeli retaliation that lasts for weeks would
fulfill Hamas' objective of scuttling the peace proposal. It would
not make Israelis safer.</TE>
<TE>   The months of violence have increased support for extremists in
the West Bank and Gaza--and in Israel. Sharon, once at the extreme
right of Israeli politics, now has a big crowd to his own right. More
killings will produce more hard-liners, not more security.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Big Rig Drivers Chafe at Life in the Slow Lane," March 26: Being
a new resident of this state--only 10 years--I have never noticed
that big rigs were restricted as to speed or lane of traffic. I
commute 60 miles one way to work on the swing shift each day, on the
I-10 or Pomona freeways. The trucks drive, for the most part, in the
right-hand lanes at the prevailing speed of traffic. This speed can
range from a crawl to over 70 mph. There is nothing more intimidating
than traveling in the left lane and seeing, in the rearview mirror,
the grille of a semitruck that appears to be in your trunk.</LD>
<LD>   I have never seen a big rig pulled over by any law enforcement
officer for speeding or occupying the left lanes. I must admit that I
have not seen a semitruck in the carpool lane yet. If the big rig
drivers are chafing under the present "restrictions," I hesitate to
think how they will act if these restrictions are removed.</LD>
<LD>   Armand Lange</LD>
<TE>   Crestline</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This law is one of the worst because of the way it is enforced.
Whenever I return to California on Interstate 10, the first sign that
I see is "Buses, Trucks, Cars With Trailers, 55." Then I am passed by
buses, trucks and cars with trailers going 70 miles per hour.
Sometimes these are accompanied by California Highway Patrol cars
keeping pace with them. I imagine the worst thing for truck drivers
is never knowing when some cop may decide to enforce the law, and, if
they are going 71 miles per hour, then they are guilty of a
misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   If a law is on the books, it should be enforced uniformly or taken
off the books, but certainly not enforced at the caprice of a
particular officer. This situation certainly doesn't engender respect
for the law. Also, aren't the RVs pulling cars subject to this law?
They don't seem to believe the law applies to them, nor do the
police, as I have never seen one of them stopped.</TE>

<HD>3 Killings at Beach a Puzzle to Authorities</HD>
<DH>Probe: The deaths of a man and two women are believed to be
a 'double homicide-suicide.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>Investigators were puzzling Thursday over why two women and a man
from Colorado ended up dead from shotgun blasts on a cliff
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   A Sheriff's Department spokesman said investigators believe David
Bachman, 26, killed Melinda Leippe, 19, and Brenda White, 19, then
himself. The women were shot in the back of the head, said spokesman
Kim Allyn, who termed it a "double homicide-suicide."</LD>
<LD>   There was no suicide note found on the bluff overlooking Bonny
Doon Beach, about seven miles north of Santa Cruz, where passersby
found the bodies in a circle just before sunset Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators were not sure how long the three had been in
California and had not concluded whether they shared a suicide pact.
There were no signs of struggle. Records show the three lived
together in a Littleton, Colo., apartment. Neither Leippe nor White
attended Columbine High, the Littleton school where in 1999 two
teenagers shot and killed 12 students and a teacher, school district
officials said. White also has lived in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Donielle Dutton lived in an apartment next to Bachman and Leippe
during the summer of 2000. Dutton called the two "nice and quiet" and
said Bachman "was into 'Dungeons and Dragons'" and other fantasy
games, the San Jose Mercury News reported.</TE>
<TE>   Coroners were to perform autopsies on the two women Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The public has free access to the horseshoe-shaped, privately
owned beach, which is known for nude sunbathing and rave parties.
Authorities are called there periodically on reports of drug use,
sexual assaults and violence.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past we've had homicides there, but not very many," Allyn
said. Most incidents are "parties and just some real dangerous
drifters."</TE>
<TE>   The site is owned by Coast Dairies and Land Co., a nonprofit
corporation.</TE>

<HD>Work Begins on PCH Overpass</HD>
<DH>Infrastructure: Bridge in Huntington will give beach access
to hotel guests. But mayor has doubts about the look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction has begun on a $2-million pedestrian bridge that will
connect the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway with the beach near
downtown Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The overpass, between Beach Boulevard and Huntington Street, will
provide a crossing for guests and visitors to the 519-room Hyatt
Regency Huntington Beach Resort &amp; Spa, which is scheduled to open in
January. The bridge is scheduled to be completed at the end of June,
said Steve Bone, managing partner of Hyatt Regency.</LD>
<LD>   The Hyatt is being built west of the Waterfront Hilton Beach
Resort and will include a 100,000-square-foot conference center.
There are plans for a third hotel between the Hyatt and the Hilton.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the new Huntington Beach in some regards," said Rich
Barnard, a city spokesman. "These projects are changing the nature of
the city. We went from an agriculture town to an oil town and now to
a visitor-serving and tourist town."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is happy with the new look. Huntington Beach Mayor
Debbie Cook thinks the bridge could be a blight.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect the wide-open nature of our beaches, and I'm opposed to
anything that would detract from that," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   The elevated walkway will lead to a 35-foot concrete structure
resembling a lighthouse. It will include an elevator for wheelchair
access to and from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the bridge, which is being financed by the Hyatt
Corp., forced the partial closure of Pacific Coast Highway early
Thursday. Another overnight closure is planned in May.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles needs more help from the federal government in detecting
and responding to bioterrorism and nuclear threats, City Councilman
Jack Weiss told a congressional subcommittee Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss, who founded the city's Threat Preparedness Task Force after
the Sept. 11 attacks, also said the federal government could help
increase the Los Angeles Fire Department's hazardous-materials
response capabilities.</LD>
<LD>   He and other local leaders, including county Sheriff Lee Baca,
pressed their claims for assistance at a hearing on preparation for
biological, chemical or nuclear attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting was held in City Hall by the Congressional
Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and
Intergovernmental Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rep. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), a member of the committee:</TE>
<TE>   ''Congress and the current administration must provide the
necessary resources for those on the front lines to prepare for the
unexpected.''</TE>

<HD>Jim Brown Not Eating While in Jail</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Authorities call the football legend's two-week
fast a personal issue, not a protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Football legend Jim Brown hasn't eaten since beginning a jail term
two weeks ago, but Ventura County officials said Thursday that he is
fasting for "spiritual cleansing" and is not on a hunger strike.</LD>
<LD>   "Usually on a hunger strike, the person is protesting
something--his treatment or the reason he's in jail," said sheriff's
spokesman Eric Nishimoto.</LD>
<LD>   "I know Mr. Brown has been very vocal about his incarceration, but
he gave us assurances that his fasting had nothing to do with any
kind of protest," Nishimoto said. "He communicated to us that he
knows his limits. He's not out to kill himself. He communicated that
it's a personal thing he does to cleanse himself and that it's
something he's done before, outside of custody."</LD>
<TE>   A retired Hall of Fame football player and action film star, Brown
later established a program to rehabilitate gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 66, has been charged five times with domestic violence
since the 1960s. His only conviction came in 1999, after he smashed
the windows of his wife's car. After lengthy appeals, a judge in Los
Angeles sentenced him to six months in jail beginning March 13.</TE>
<TE>   Brown could have avoided jail if he had paid a fine, contributed
to a battered women's shelter and undergone counseling. He refused to
accept that offer, saying he had hurt the car, not his wife. Although
Brown was sentenced in Los Angeles, his anti-gang efforts through the
local jails were thought to pose a conflict, so he was sent to
neighboring Ventura County to serve his time.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is consuming only water, jail officials said. He bought
energy bars and other snacks from the jail canteen early on and
stashed them in his cell in case he changes his mind, a jail
supervisor said.</TE>

<HD>2 Weeks Into His Jail Sentence, Jim Brown Is Still Not

<DH>Ventura County: Authorities say football legend is fasting

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Football legend Jim Brown hasn't eaten since beginning a jail term
two weeks ago, but Ventura County officials said Thursday that he is
fasting for "spiritual cleansing" and is not on a hunger strike.</LD>
<LD>   "Usually on a hunger strike, the person is protesting
something--his treatment or the reason he's in jail," said sheriff's
spokesman Eric Nishimoto.</LD>
<LD>   "I know Mr. Brown has been very vocal about his incarceration, but
he gave us assurances that his fasting had nothing to do with any
kind of protest," Nishimoto said. "He communicated to us that he
knows his limits. He's not out to kill himself. He communicated that
it's a personal thing he does to cleanse himself and that it's
something he's done before, outside of custody."</LD>
<TE>   Brown could not be reached for comment, but filmmaker Spike Lee,
whose documentary "Jim Brown: All-American" will have its Los Angeles
premiere next month, said Brown called him two days into his sentence
to tell him that he was fasting.</TE>
<TE>   "Gandhi fasted," Lee said in a telephone interview from New York.
"Dr. King fasted. Reverend Al Sharpton fasted. People do that. It
shows that it's mind over matter, it's about becoming stronger and in
tune spiritually.</TE>
<TE>   "In prison, they try to break you down and take your soul and
will," Lee said. "And they've been trying to break Jim Brown for a
long time--law enforcement, Hollywood, take your pick."</TE>
<TE>   A retired Hall of Fame football player and action film star, Brown
later established a program to rehabilitate gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 66, has been charged five times with domestic violence
since the 1960s. His only conviction came in 1999, after he smashed
the windows of his wife's car. After lengthy appeals, a judge in Los
Angeles sentenced him to six months in jail beginning March 13.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was an icon of black pride in the 1960s and '70s. By the
late '80s, he had turned his focus to rehabilitating gang members,
establishing his Amer-I-Can program, which continues today.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout his life, Brown had a history of trouble with
women, including accusations that he once threw a girlfriend off a
balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Brown could have avoided jail if he had paid a fine, contributed
to a battered women's shelter and undergone counseling. He refused to
accept that offer, saying he had hurt the car, not his wife. Monique
Brown did not testify against him and has stood by him through the
case. Last year, she gave birth to the couple's child.</TE>
<TE>   Although Brown was sentenced in Los Angeles, his anti-gang efforts
through the local jails were thought to pose a conflict, so he was
sent to Ventura County to serve his time.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said Brown shouldn't be behind bars at all, but that if he
must serve time, he should be in Los Angeles, to be closer to his
wife, and that he should be permitted to mix with other inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's crazy and inhumane they have him locked up in this
closet they call a cell for 23 hours a day," Lee said. "Why? For
vandalism of a car?"</TE>
<TE>   At the county jail building near the farm town of Santa Paula,
Brown spends all but one hour of each day in a cell alone. Nishimoto
said that is standard procedure with high-profile inmates and that
Brown has displayed model behavior that could earn him an early
release.</TE>
<TE>   While many local law enforcement officials said they idolized
Brown as boys, they also said they aren't extending him any special
privileges.</TE>
<TE>   He may receive visitors once a week. He's been issued standard
jail blues--a short-sleeved shirt and long pants--and may not wear
his trademark African cap, a kufi.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the jail kitchen was cooking up a popular spread:
chicken-fried steak, green beans, white rice, cole slaw, bread and
milk or juice.</TE>
<TE>   Nishimoto said Brown's decision to hold out said something about
his self-discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is consuming only water, jail officials said. He bought
energy bars and other snacks from the jail canteen early on and
stashed them in his cell in case he changes his mind, a jail
supervisor said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two crew members were killed and four others injured Thursday when a
Navy helicopter from the Naval Weapons Station at China Lake crashed
during a routine mission in rugged and snowy terrain near Lake
Isabella in Central California.</LD>
<LD>   The HH-1 Huey helicopter from the Dust Devils squadron took off
from China Lake at 9:30 a.m. and crashed on Split Mountain in Sequoia
National Forest about 1 p.m. The station is involved in testing a
variety of weapons and weapons systems, including some meant for
helicopters.</LD>
<LD>   The Huey has been a workhorse helicopter for the U.S. military
since before the Vietnam War, performing missions ranging from search
and rescue to anti-submarine warfare and medical evacuation. More
Western countries fly Huey helicopters than any other helicopter.</LD>
<TE>   The four Navy personnel injured were airlifted to Ridgecrest
Regional Hospital by Navy and civilian helicopters. None of the four
suffered life-threatening injuries, a Kern County Fire Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the dead were not released pending notification of
their families. A China Lake spokesman said that no cause has been
determined for the crash and that an investigation is underway. The
helicopter was on a search-and-rescue training mission when it
crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The crash site is about 120 miles north of Los Angeles. Although
the site is off the base, it is not unusual for helicopters to train
in the area, officials said.</TE>

<LD>A San Bernardino police officer was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
kidnapping and raping 11 women while on duty.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Department said Thursday night that it now will
interview every woman that Officer Ronald VanRossum has stopped while
on duty.</LD>
<LD>   VanRossum, 36, a 14-year veteran of the department, has been
charged with 11 counts of kidnap for the purposes of rape and eight
counts of rape.</LD>
<TE>   "We're embarrassed and outraged ... " said Sgt. Mitchal Kimball.
"We took appropriate steps to ensure that he's brought to justice."</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum, who is married, has been on administrative leave since
Nov. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Five days earlier, San Bernardino officers arrested a woman who
told them as she was being booked that she had been sexually
assaulted by an officer, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police eventually focused on VanRossum, and the department created
a task force to investigate. They identified 10 more women as
victims, police said. None came forward of their own accord; all were
located by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Police asked that anyone who may have been a victim or may have
information about the crimes to contact the department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still early in the investigation," said Susan Mickey,
spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum also is charged with five counts of oral copulation, two
counts of sexual battery and one count of sodomy, all under color of
authority. He is being held in the West Valley Detention Center on
$3-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   He will be arraigned today, Mickey said.</TE>

<LD>A robber shot an armored truck guard four times Thursday outside a
Costco in Alhambra, sending hundreds of panicked people running for
safety, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting caused even more tumult when the guard, confused and
bloodied from two shots to his head, staggered inside the store with
guns drawn in what he thought was a pursuit of the robber, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   The holdup occurred at 3:15 p.m. in the 2200 block of Commonwealth
Avenue as the guard walked out of the store with a bag or bags of
money, said Alhambra police Sgt. David Nater.</LD>
<TE>   As the guard approached the armored truck, which belongs to AT
Systems, the gunman shot him from behind.</TE>
<TE>   The guard fell, but the gunman kept firing at him, police said.
Two bullets struck the guard's head and two hit his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a rather brutal robbery," Nater said.</TE>
<TE>   "He shot the guard, the guard fell to the ground, and he shot him
some more. This guy wasn't playing around."</TE>
<TE>   The robber took an undisclosed amount of money and ran to a
waiting car in the parking lot at the nearby Fremont Inn.</TE>
<TE>   The guard, meanwhile, got up and went into the store, guns drawn,
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees, who would not give their names on orders from Costco,
said the guard walked around the store looking for the gunman. They
said he looked disoriented.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said people inside the store scattered, dropping
merchandise, while some huddled behind cash registers.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving Alhambra police had to "calm the guard down," Nater said.
"We told him to put the guns down."</TE>
<TE>   The guard, who was not identified, was rushed to a hospital, where
he was listed in serious condition.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the armored truck was in it at the time of the
shooting and wasn't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   AT Systems is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the gunman, who was described as about 5
feet 11, 190 pounds, balding, with dark hair and a mustache.</TE>
<TE>   Police had no description of the driver of the older-model blue
Honda Civic used in the getaway.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a Brinks guard was killed and $20,000 was stolen from
his armored truck in Anaheim. Last year, a Brinks guard was killed by
robbers in the San Fernando Valley. A shootout two years ago at a
Costco in Van Nuys between armored guards and gunmen left a shopper
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the Alhambra shooting is asked to call
police at (626) 570-5151.</TE>

<HD>Davis Hints at a Rough Election</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor vows to shun 'over-the-top' personal
attacks but offers a highly selective portrayal of GOP opponent
Simon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis vowed Thursday to run a civil campaign against
Republican Bill Simon, promising to shun "over-the-top" personal
attacks against the businessman and neophyte candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Davis foreshadowed a rough election season. Offering a
highly selective portrayal of his opponent, he criticized Simon's
lack of political experience, his spotty voting record and the
involvement of his family investment firm in a failed savings and
loan.</LD>
<LD>   "He is not ready for prime time," Davis said.</LD>
<TE>   The Democrat, who is struggling to surmount his weak standing in
opinion polls, explained his reelection strategy by suggesting he was
not looking to win a popularity contest in November--he just wants
people to favor him over Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not asking people to marry me," Davis said. "I'm asking them
to make a decision as to who they want to govern this state."</TE>
<TE>   Davis discussed his reelection campaign, extolled the
accomplishments of his first three years in office and briefly looked
ahead to a potential second term in a wide-ranging meeting with
reporters and editors from The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of 90 minutes, Davis:</TE>
<TE>   * Promised to debate Simon at least once before the Nov. 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   * Indicated he would reduce his aggressive fund-raising if he is
reelected in November.</TE>
<TE>   * Defended his negative ad blitz against Republican Richard
Riordan, which helped defeat the former Los Angeles mayor in the
Republican gubernatorial primary this month.</TE>
<TE>   * Accused his predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, of playing
"the race card" in promoting anti-affirmative action and anti-illegal
immigration ballot measures that Californians approved during the
1990s. A spokesman for Wilson angrily rejected that accusation.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, Davis said he supports a $25-billion plan
before the state Senate to build and modernize public schools,
colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, the outlines of which Davis proposed, would place on
the November ballot a $13-billion initiative, to be followed by a
$12.3-billion bond proposal in March 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Thursday's discussion, however, was given over to Davis'
reelection campaign, to questions about his fund-raising and to the
governor's assessment on why California voters appear so lukewarm to
job performance.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Cites Effects of Electricity Crisis</TE>
<TE>   Davis hailed his accomplishments on issues including education,
transportation and health care, using superlatives such as
"remarkable" and "groundbreaking" to tout his record.</TE>
<TE>   He said many of his achievements were overshadowed by last year's
electricity crisis and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in
Republican-financed attack ads that targeted Davis during the
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   The governor stressed, as he has repeatedly, that he inherited the
state's failed energy deregulatory policy when he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back at his predecessor, Davis also offered an unusually
harsh assessment of Wilson and his support for Proposition 187, the
anti-illegal immigration initiative, and Proposition 209, which
stripped away racial preferences from state programs.</TE>
<TE>   "He played the race card," Davis said of Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "He started dividing us up, talking about special interests. He
stirred the pot and generated resentment. I try to go the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the former governor, vehemently
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is false political rhetoric from a soulless governor with no
long-term record of support to minority communities," Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a continuation in a long line of race-baiting and class
warfare attacks ... from a politician with no political courage and
no compass."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to his criticism of Wilson, Davis defended his
repeated attacks on Simon for opposing legalized abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "Wedge-issue politics is pitting one Californian against another,"
Davis said, adding he supports a woman's right to have an abortion
"but I certainly don't demean people who have a different point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   Suggests Riordan Picked the Fight</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his scathing assault on Riordan, Davis suggested the
former mayor picked the fight when he attacked the governor and used
words such as "evil" and "immoral" to describe the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at a point where a candidate cannot just sit back and
allow someone else to misrepresent their record and expect that
voters will ... put up some wall against whatever's being told to
them," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Davis said he expects to continue to differentiate himself
from his opponent now that the campaign has moved to the general
election.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fair to compare and contrast," Davis said. "It's fair to
say, 'Here's what this fellow believes. Here's who's supporting him.
Here's what I believe. Here's who's supporting me.' I think that's
fair. I don't think you should go over the top in terms of personal
attacks."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do so in 1998"--when Davis defeated Republican Dan
Lungren--"and I don't intend to do so in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The governor cited Simon's failure to vote in certain elections
over the past 10 years--Simon has said the action was inexcusable.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also faulted Simon, a wealthy investment banker, for the
$92-million collapse of a failed savings and loan--which Simon never
ran and blames, at least in part, on overzealous regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want him to govern the state, the [world's] fifth-largest
economy?" Davis asked.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, in turn, praised himself for running "a
straightforward, relatively transparent, above-board administration."</TE>
<TE>   But he turned aside a request that he permit access to his
fund-raising events, saying he saw no reason "to change the practice
I've had my entire career."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has raised roughly $1 million a month since taking
office in 1999, keeps his fund-raising schedule private and bars
reporters from the events.</TE>
<TE>   If he is reelected, Davis said, he will most likely cut back his
rigorous fund-raising regimen, but will continue to solicit some
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we'll need money for a variety of things we do," Davis
said, citing the out-of-state and foreign travels he finances with
campaign funds.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "I don't want to get ahead of myself. I'm focused
on this election. I have to get this budget signed.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect my needs would diminish in a second term, the need
to raise money, because I don't foresee any other state offices I
would pursue."</TE>
<TE>   Though saying he had no plans to seek another office, Davis has
not ruled out a race for the White House or the U.S. Senate.</TE>

<HD>Making Rehabilitation Into a Serious Business</HD>
<DH>Programs: Psychologist has built a small empire by
empowering thousands of ex-cons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Mimi Silbert has spent her career cultivating a university of the
streets, one she calls a Harvard for losers, a concrete campus where
the students are former pimps and prostitutes, junkies and drug
dealers, armed robbers and homeless waifs.</LD>
<LD>   Since the 1970s, the smiling dynamo of a woman has operated
Delancey Street, an alternative rehabilitation program run solely by
its residents--one that proponents say has turned 14,000 multiple
offenders and other societal castoffs into law-abiding,
look-you-in-the-eye, self-respecting working people.</LD>
<LD>   Silbert's secret has been to throw away the book on conventional
"hold your hand" counseling and challenge her often functionally
illiterate and unskilled wards to support themselves by helping to
operate a dozen Delancey businesses, including a gourmet waterfront
restaurant, a bookstore-cafe, a moving company and a catering center.</LD>
<TE>   Starting from a single house, the 59-year-old criminal
psychologist built a $20-million-a-year empire with locations in New
York, New Mexico, North Carolina and Los Angeles--all, she says,
without accepting a dime of public funds.</TE>
<TE>   Along with revenue from the businesses, the organization receives
more than $10 million a year in donations.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, as Delancey Street celebrated its 30th
anniversary with a dinner honoring longtime supporter Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), Silbert unveiled a new public-private
partnership to take her rehabilitation formula nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein helped guide a $1-million grant to a national nonprofit
foundation that will operate the program once Silbert finds sites to
train a new generation of offenders to go into business for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to take our model national, but I have never
wanted to accept the government funding it takes to do it," Silbert
said. "But we've finally found the way: The money goes to the
foundation. All we do is be ourselves, do what Delancey Street does."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, a
Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that coordinates social
programs, said the U.S. Justice Department grant will be used to
gather support for what he says is often perceived as an unorthodox
program.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't just go into a city and tell officials, 'Here we are.
We can do this rehab thing better than you, so we're going to get to
work turning convicts into entrepreneurs.' It takes time to win
people over."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers have identified possible sites ranging from Alaska to
New England.</TE>
<TE>   The start-up drill will involve locating prison inmates who would
make suitable Delancey Street clients.</TE>
<TE>   Then they must persuade local judges to parole them into the
program. They must develop a center and study which local enterprises
can make the most money.</TE>
<TE>   Silbert says she has resisted grant money in the past, fearing
that participants might then stop feeling that their survival depends
on the success of their business ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking judges to buy into what they consider a risky
arrangement--to see whether people who have constantly failed can
finally put it all together," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Silbert is familiar with such odds.</TE>
<TE>   Since she founded Delancey Street in 1972 with prison parolee John
Maher, she has transformed a fledgling program in which ex-cons are
treated like family into a success story that has been praised by
three former presidents--one that Feinstein calls "the best drug
rehabilitation center that I know of."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Silbert and her wards turned a city-leased
400,000-square-foot space in what was then a decrepit warehouse
district along San Francisco's Embarcadero into a lavish residential
and retail center that houses about 500 residents, along with several
thriving inmate-run businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities, complete with a health club, feel more like a
hotel than an urban correctional center. The swimming pool is styled
after one found at a Florida Four Seasons hotel, and the 150-seat
cinema looks like a screening room at the Sundance Film Festival
because the blueprint was donated by Robert Redford.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, the center bustled as Delancey Street prepared
for Thursday night's award dinner. Innocuous-looking men and women
moved about--nearly all of them with drug or criminal histories. The
chef is a former junkie, the waitresses armed robbers and the
painters prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   With her dog Amnesty at her side, Silbert seemed to be everywhere
at once, attending to details with a breezy yet forceful personality
that among her wards carries an almost cult-like attraction.</TE>
<TE>   At Delancey Street, when Mimi Silbert talks, everyone listens.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing stylish clothes donated by businesses such as Brooks
Brothers and the Gap, many of Silbert's most-trusted helpers resemble
Fortune 500 employees rather than prison parolees and former
junkies--even though, Silbert jokes, "the average number of felonies
of people I work with is 18."</TE>
<TE>   In a show of solidarity, Silbert also wears donated clothes and
lives in a one-bedroom apartment at the center, which she and
co-founder Maher named after New York's Delancey Street, where many
Jewish immigrants, including Silbert's parents, once settled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surrounded by ex-prison gangsters, Mexican Mafia men and
Aryan Brotherhood types who used to hunt Jews. And now we all live
together. We get along," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Though most participants are prison parolees, some have walked in
off the street. The center won't accept sex offenders or psychiatric
patients and strongly enforces three rules: No violence. No threats.
And no drug or alcohol abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Many study in general education classes taught by program
veterans.</TE>
<TE>   They learn job skills and tips on dealing with the public, and are
encouraged to attend the opera and symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Most are placed in outside jobs when they graduate, after an
average of four years--moving on to become truck drivers, lawyers,
even a deputy sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you don't know much, there's always someone who knows
less," said resident Gerald Miller. "If you can read at an
eighth-grade level, you can teach someone how to read at a
fifth-grade level."</TE>
<TE>   Miller is one of Silbert's prize students. Lanky and well-spoken,
his head shaved, he's Michael Jordan-smooth in his dark suit. The
only sign of a troubled past is a scar running along his neck--a
legacy of the 102 stitches he received following a knife fight while
doing time in Folsom State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old New York City native says he had never worked a
job in his life before coming to Delancey Street. He's served three
prison stints totaling 15 years, once sent back after only 30 days on
the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I only knew prison," he says, "that ugly upside-down place where
the nastier you are, the more you get along."</TE>
<TE>   At Delancey Street, where he has spent 10 years, he has received a
degree from a local college and wants to pursue a sales career.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has a car, a girlfriend and, now, a future.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for this place," he says, "I'd be dead today."</TE>

<HD>Wayward Dolphin Still Making Waves</HD>
<DH>Nature: Rescuers using a larger net will try again today to
retrieve the mammal from the Oxnard channel it wandered into.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after it eluded rescuers while swimming tight circles in an
Oxnard canal, a confused dolphin disappeared Thursday morning for
several hours before reemerging in the afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a long canal and he basically looks about the same as
yesterday," said Kathy Fischer, a volunteer coordinator for the
Ventura County chapter of the Organization for the Respect and Care
of Animals. "We just want to make sure he is OK. He's moving around
more than yesterday."</LD>
<LD>   Fischer, along with a handful of other volunteers from the
organization, spent much of Thursday walking along the marshy edges
of the canal attempting to spot the gray 200-pound dolphin.</LD>
<TE>   She said the dolphin swam almost the full length of the canal
toward the ocean before turning back.</TE>
<TE>   Its wayward journey has taken the marine mammal past breakwaters,
boat docks and even a side street called Porpoise Way.</TE>
<TE>   At low tide today--sometime after 3 p.m.--the volunteer team of
marine biologists, veterinarians and animal lovers will make another
attempt to catch the dolphin--this time with a larger net being
shipped in from Sea World in San Diego, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If caught, the dolphin will be trucked to a marine center in
Laguna Beach to determine whether it is healthy enough to eventually
return to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The 4-foot dolphin was first spotted about 7 a.m. Wednesday
swimming and jumping in the mossy 8-foot-deep canal water that is
used to cool generator pipes at the Reliant Energy-owned Mandalay Bay
Generating Station off Harbor Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the dolphin somehow swam past an underwater fence
at the mouth of the canal near Mandalay Bay that is designed to keep
fish and marine mammals out.</TE>
<TE>   For about two hours Wednesday, a dozen volunteers from the animal
organization tried trapping the dolphin in a 50-foot fishing net.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer and other rescue workers remained baffled why the dolphin
would travel the meandering canal, which begins at Mandalay Bay and
snakes through five miles of farmland and sand dunes before ending at
the electric generating station.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dolphin appeared to be breathing normally Thursday,
there are still concerns it has ingested coastal algae infected with
a lethal, naturally occurring sea toxin.</TE>
<TE>   In the past month, marine mammal rescuers have recovered more than
a dozen infected dolphins that have beached themselves. Most did not
survive.</TE>
<TE>   If the dolphin is healthy enough to eat, there are plenty of fish
in the canal, said Sam Dover, a Santa Barbara veterinarian
specializing in marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Dover observed the animal Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is he is finding fish there, because anything in the
ocean can find its way into that channel," said Dover, who once
worked as a veterinarian at Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like he was behaving normally, but you are not seeing a
whole lot in the water."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the dolphin is rescued and eventually returned to the sea,
its chances for long-term survival won't be known until a thorough
examination is conducted, said Joe Cordero, a wildlife biologist with
the National Marine Fisheries Service in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a 50-50 chance either way," Cordero said. "Given enough
time they can usually find their way out as a general rule."</TE>

<HD>Synagogue Bookkeeper Sentenced</HD>
<DH>Crime: Plea agreement for forgery includes a year in jail,
counseling. Redondo Beach temple won't seek restitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former bookkeeper of a South Bay synagogue pleaded no contest
Thursday to a single count of forgery, drawing a sentence that
includes one year in county jail.</LD>
<LD>   Doina Stanescu accepted a plea agreement reached the day she was
scheduled for a preliminary hearing on six felony charges stemming
from the embezzlement of nearly $100,000 from Temple Menorah in
Redondo Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the jail time, Stanescu, 51, of Long Beach, must serve
three years' probation and attend at least three meetings a week in a
program to help her combat her acknowledged gambling problem.
Stanescu will receive 99 days' credit toward the jail sentence--66
days she served since her arrest and the rest for good conduct.</LD>
<TE>   Other terms of the plea agreement include her paying a $200 fine
to a victims restitution fund, but she will not be required to repay
Temple Menorah. An attorney for the temple said it would not seek
restitution from Stanescu, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Martha
Carrillo.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing in a wheelchair because of an injured left foot and
wearing a dark blue jacket over her county jail jumpsuit, Stanescu
appeared to agonize over her choices before entering her plea.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had offered her the alternative of 16 months at the
California Institute for Women in Frontera, where she could have
received anti-gambling treatment, but that would have meant a longer
stay, and in a state, not county, facility.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jacques Cain, said outside
the courtroom that Stanescu thought a prison term would have made it
even more difficult to turn her life around.</TE>
<TE>   Had she been found guilty on all charges, Stanescu could have
faced up to three years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu seemed calm during the proceedings but responded to
questions so softly that Judge Laura C. Ellison had to ask her to
speak up. She made no statement of regret or apology Thursday but, a
few days before she turned herself in on Jan. 22, Stanescu had
written a letter to the temple, admitting the embezzlement and
expressing remorse and guilt, according to the Redondo Beach police
detective who worked on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after she was hired as bookkeeper by the temple about 18
months ago, Stanescu used its computer to print checks made out in
her name and forged supervisors' signatures at least four times,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Although temple officials did not know it when they hired her,
Stanescu had a troubled financial past. She had emigrated from
Romania with her husband, Marin, more than 30 years ago and had
become a U.S. citizen. The couple divorced in 1989, and Stanescu
received no alimony, apparently because she did not respond to court
requests for information about her financial situation.</TE>
<TE>   She would later tell co-workers she began making gambling trips to
Las Vegas to try to cover expenses, plus medical costs for her father
in Romania. By 1991, she had filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The embezzlement came to light in January when a former temple
board member began pressing Stanescu to see the books.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this will give us some closure, and I am very happy
that she is going to get a lot of treatment," Temple President Margy
Feldman said of the plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We were caused a lot of pain by this, but I am very proud of our
board and our congregation. We have received some very generous gifts
[to help replace the stolen funds], and we have stood tall and pulled
together to weather this," Feldman said, adding that the temple has
put "all kinds of checks and balances" into its accounting system
since discovering the embezzlement. "We have learned from our
mistakes."</TE>

<HD>Report Details Overcrowding in State's Emergency Rooms</HD>
<DH>Health care: Study finds 12% decrease in facilities
statewide in the 1990s. The number of patient visits increased 27%
during the same period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a worrisome number of emergency rooms and entire hospitals closed
in California over the last decade, the remaining emergency care
facilities had to handle a significant rise in the number of
patients, according to a study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The overcrowding in many emergency units is not being caused by
people arriving there with minor ailments, despite some impressions
to the contrary. The report found that the number of patients
visiting emergency departments with serious health problems rose by
59% from 1990 to 1999. Non-urgent visits to emergency rooms actually
dropped by 8%.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in the April issue of the Annals of Emergency
Medicine, noted a 12% decrease statewide in the number of emergency
departments, from 407 to 357. The number of patient visits to
emergency departments increased 27% during the same period.</LD>
<TE>   Other hospitals added capacity to their emergency facilities, and
the overall ratio of emergency department beds increased slightly in
the 1990s, from 14.5 to 15.3 per 100,000 Californians. But Dr. Susan
Lambe, author of the study and an assistant professor at UC San
Francisco, said there was little reason to celebrate that ratio.
"From a practical standpoint, it certainly doesn't do much," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the most significant and most surprising finding," Lambe
said, was the increase in seriously sick people using emergency
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "That goes against the suggestion that non-urgent patients are
causing trouble," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Marshall Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at UCLA Medical
Center, said most emergency physicians he's spoken to "feel that the
emergency care system is in a state of crisis. We're kind of holding
on by our fingernails."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who is familiar with the report's findings, said his unit
has not increased its formal number of beds in recent years but found
ways to increase its capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken the conference room and modified it in a way that we
can see patients," he said. "We use it as a conference room during
the day, then around 3 o'clock we move in the gurneys, pull the
curtains out and use it to see patients. And they still wait too
long."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Brent Asplin, a researcher at Regions Hospital in St. Paul,
Minn., who wrote an editorial to accompany the study, said the
decrease in emergency departments causes an array of problems at
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients who are triaged with less urgent conditions wait longer
for care," Asplin said. "The patients who are in the hospital are
still getting care, but because of the concentration of patients ...
our ability to take new patients is sometimes compromised."</TE>
<TE>   The study analyzed data from California's Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development, which details all hospital and
health service facilities in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Our emergency departments are overburdened, and if you walk into
any emergency department on any given day, you'll find that's true,"
said Brian Johnston, medical director of the emergency department at
White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Flanagan, 78; Wrote 3 Esteemed Irish Historical
Novels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Flanagan, an eminent literary critic, essayist and former UC
Berkeley English literature professor who became one of the foremost
historical novelists of our time, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Flanagan died March 21 of a heart attack at his home in Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   A Connecticut-born Irish American, Flanagan's three critically
acclaimed Irish historical novels provide what many consider to be
the definitive fictional representation of Ireland's struggle for
independence.</LD>
<TE>   His first novel, "The Year of the French," which portrays
Ireland's ill-fated rebellion against British rule in 1798, was
published in 1979, when Flanagan was 55. The novel won the National
Book Critics Circle award as the outstanding work of American
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Flanagan may not belong with Yeats and Joyce, but he loiters
agreeably in their vicinity," wrote critic John Leonard in the New
York Times.</TE>
<TE>   More critical acclaim greeted Flanagan's next two novels, "The
Tenants of Time" (1988) and "The End of the Hunt" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   "What is extraordinary about Tom is that in the framework of
apparently conventional historical novels, he wrote books of
absolutely dazzling technical virtuosity," writer John Gregory Dunne
told the Los Angeles Times this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The End of the Hunt" is about the Troubles--Ireland's battle for
independence and the internecine conflicts it caused. It has the
historical personages of Winston Churchill, Lloyd George and others,
but, more important, five distinct, individual fictional voices that
he created, and he has them speak in the third and the first person.
Each one is indelible.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a book that makes you glad you are a writer."</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan said working in a historical setting helped his process
as a writer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I discovered myself as a writer by getting away from my
own time and my own place," Flanagan told the San Francisco Chronicle
in 1994. "The present, I have a hard time dealing with. Writing about
Ireland in the past allowed me to find voices I could hide behind."</TE>
<TE>   The son of an oral surgeon, Flanagan was born in Greenwich, Conn.,
where he first learned about Ireland from his Irish grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   He was a freshman at Amherst College in 1941 when Pearl Harbor was
attacked. The next day he enlisted in the Navy and served in the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he returned to Amherst, where he earned a
bachelor's degree in English. He received his master's and PhD at
Columbia University, where he taught and wrote his doctoral
dissertation on 19th-century Anglo Irish novelists under the
direction of Lionel Trilling.</TE>
<TE>   The dissertation became Flanagan's first book, "The Irish
Novelists: 1800-1890," a critical work published by Columbia
University Press in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan had written an unpublished historical novel about China
when he was 21, and from the late '40s to the late '50s he had
mystery stories published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and
other magazines. He won Ellery Queen's best story of the year award
in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   But after arriving at UC Berkeley to teach in 1960, he devoted his
time to scholarly writing.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Flanagan and his wife, Jean--and their two young
daughters--began spending summers and sabbaticals in Dublin, where
Flanagan astonished the locals with his knowledge of Irish writers
and topography.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know it at the time, but it was all research for the
books," he told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, the research began to pay off.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, who never learned to drive, depended on his wife to
drive him to and from the Berkeley campus.</TE>
<TE>   "One day," he recalled, "she phoned to say she would be a couple
of hours late. On impulse, I picked up a pad of blue interoffice
paper and began writing. It was a description of a man walking along
a strand on the west coast of Ireland. He was wearing a frock coat, a
very torn frock coat, so I knew it was in the past. But I didn't know
why I was writing it."</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan continued writing after he got home, his pages turning
into what became the "virtually unchanged" first chapter of "The Year
of the French."</TE>
<TE>   "I began writing novels that irrationally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The amazing thing is that he got started," said Dick Bridgman, a
retired UC Berkeley English professor and longtime friend. "It's
almost unparalleled for someone to start a creative or fictional
career when you're in your 50s, but he was just absolutely saturated
in Irish history."</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Tom that was the most amazing was his memory,"
said Frederick Crews, another retired UC Berkeley English professor.
"He never forgot anything. Off the top of his head, he could go back
into history and re-create incidents with incredible vividness.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in the past that had ever come to his notice remained
vivid to him, and this was true not only of historical events but
also of personal anecdotes. So he was a great raconteur, and a man of
dry wit that was quite delicious."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Flanagan wrote numerous book reviews and essays
for various publications, including the Los Angeles Times. For the
last 15 years, he wrote regularly for the New York Review of Books,
primarily on Irish books, writers and other creative artists.</TE>
<TE>   "His prose was absolutely elegant," said Barbara Epstein,
Flanagan's editor at the New York Review of Books. "There's a
wonderful piece he did recently on [director] John Ford that was just
absolutely brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   New York Review Books, a subsidiary of the New York Review of
Books, will publish a collection of Flanagan's essays--mostly on
Irish writers--within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan left Berkeley to teach at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook in 1978. After retiring in 1996, Flanagan and his
wife moved back to Berkeley, where they lived in the hills about a
mile north of the UC Berkeley campus.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Flanagan died in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan is survived by daughters Caitlin Flanagan of Los Angeles
and Ellen Klavan of Montecito, and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Conejo Schools Get New Leader</HD>
<DH>Personnel: The district board votes to hire Hueneme
educator as superintendent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conejo Valley school officials Thursday chose Robert Fraisse,
currently superintendent of the Hueneme Elementary School District,
to take the helm of Ventura County's second-largest district.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, school board members visited the Hueneme
district where Fraisse has worked for five years. Later they voted
unanimously to hire him.</LD>
<LD>   "It was hands-down that this man was right for our district, and
we couldn't see the point in waiting any longer," said school board
President Mary Jo Del Campo. "We are all just so excited to have him
on board. I am beyond excited."</LD>
<TE>   Fraisse, 51, said he looks forward to the new opportunity. He has
lived in Thousand Oaks for 25 years. "My kids grew up here and went
through the school system here," he said. "This is a chance to work
in a community I've been a part of for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Fraisse will be paid about $170,000 a year to lead the
21,000-student Conejo Valley Unified School District, Del Campo said.
His contract will be finalized at a board meeting April 9, and a
reception is planned for April 29.</TE>
<TE>   In the Conejo district, Fraisse will face tough teacher salary
negotiations, which are at an impasse. He will also have to deal with
construction of a new elementary school and a continuation high
school that will share space with a satellite campus of Moorpark
College.</TE>
<TE>   Del Campo said she is confident Fraisse will rise to the
challenges and will apply a style of leadership that has been
described as "hard on problems; soft on people."</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't find one person to say one negative thing about this
man," she said. "He appears to be the perfect fit for our district."</TE>
<TE>   Fraisse took over the 8,000-student Hueneme district in 1997 after
working for 20 years in the Las Virgenes Unified School District.
Hueneme school officials said they will begin searching for a
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be our baseline," said board member Darlene Bruno.
"Someone is going to have to have his qualities, because we've grown
to really like them in the district."</TE>

<HD>Court Rules on 710 Freeway Extension Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Thursday issued a ruling that will help the
state and federal governments as they battle South Pasadena's suit
against extension of the Long Beach Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that South
Pasadena can sue the federal government in federal court, but it
can't sue the state in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   The panel said states can be sued in federal court only when they
consent to be part of that action.</LD>
<TE>   The city is suing both the federal and state governments to block
construction of the proposed freeway extension.</TE>
<TE>   But South Pasadena's attorney, Antonio Rossmann, said the decision
means the city and its allies will refile the state claims in a
separate lawsuit in a state court.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Freeway extension would fill a 6.2-mile gap between
the Foothill and San Bernardino freeways.</TE>

<LD>An Orange County-based group sued the federal government Thursday to
halt impending bans on personal watercraft in 21 national recreation
and seashore areas.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to requiring officials to do environmental assessments
of the effects of Jet Skis, WaveRunners and other small watercraft on
the lakes, islands and coastal stretches, the American Watercraft
Assn.'s lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop bans from taking effect
in April and September.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not trying to gain access to every national park in the
nation. We don't necessarily believe that personal watercraft belong
in every national park," said Stephan Andranian, government affairs
manager for the association, which is based in Foothill Ranch.
"However, it's impossible to find out where they do belong unless you
do some assessments."</LD>
<TE>   National Park Service and Interior Department officials could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the issue is already clear. According to the
Sierra Club, studies show that a personal watercraft engine operating
seven hours produces the same amount of cancer-causing and
smog-forming pollutants as an automobile being driven more than
100,000 miles.</TE>

<DH>Recreation: Foothill Ranch-based association leads effort

<LD>An Orange County-based group sued the federal government Thursday to
halt impending bans on personal watercraft in 21 national recreation
and seashore areas.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to requiring officials to do environmental assessments
of the effects of Jet Skis, WaveRunners and other small watercraft on
the lakes, islands and coastal stretches, the American Watercraft
Assn.'s lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop bans from taking effect
in April and September.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not trying to gain access to every national park in the
nation. We don't necessarily believe that personal watercraft belong
in every national park," said Stephan Andranian, government affairs
manager for the association, which is based in Foothill Ranch.
"However, it's impossible to find out where they do belong unless you
do some assessments."</LD>
<TE>   The association, along with two personal watercraft users and an
industry group, filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of
Interior and the National Park Service in federal court in Texas. The
association says it represents 20,000 of the nation's estimated 1.3
million personal watercraft users.</TE>
<TE>   Park Service and Interior officials could not be reached for
comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The suit comes as the Bush administration is pushing to reopen
wilderness areas for recreational use. On Wednesday, U.S. Bureau of
Land Management officials said the agency wants to overturn key parts
of a Clinton-era decision that helped preserve desert dunes in
southeastern California, a move that would reopen thousands of acres
to off-road vehicles. The administration is also reconsidering
another Clinton-era plan to phase out all snowmobile use within
Yellowstone National Park, starting next winter.</TE>
<TE>   Andranian said the watercraft suit does not target pristine areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to argue that personal watercraft belong at
Yosemite," he said. "We're talking about places like Lake Mead and
Lake Powell that were built, in part, for motorized recreation."</TE>
<TE>   As part of a settlement with an environmental group in December
2000, the Park Service agreed to complete environmental assessments
so personal watercraft could operate in certain areas. However, none
of the assessments have been completed. If they are not finished this
year, bans go into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the issue is already clear. According to the
Sierra Club, studies show that a personal watercraft engine operating
seven hours produces the same amount of cancer-causing and
smog-forming pollutants as an automobile being driven more than
100,000 miles. Each year, small marine motors spill 15 times more oil
and fuel into waterways than the Exxon Valdez did, the environmental
group said.</TE>
<TE>   "The engines are peculiarly inefficient," said Paula Goodman
Maccabee, a Sierra Club air-toxins campaign project coordinator in
St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   The watercraft lawsuit seeks to block bans at Lake Mead in Arizona
and Nevada; Whiskeytown, Calif.; Glen Canyon, Ariz.; Assateague, Md.;
Curecanti National Recreation Area, Colo.; Lake Roosevelt, Wash.;
Gateway and Fire Island, N.Y.; Big Thicket, Amistad, Lake Meredith
and Padre Island, Texas; Gulf Islands, Florida; Cape Cod, Mass.;
Indiana Dunes, Ill.; Cape Lookout, N.C.; Cumberland Island, Ga.;

<HD>Klamath Plan Will Hurt Fish, State Official Says</HD>
<DH>Environment: An expert with California wildlife agency says
ill-advised federal irrigation strategy will divert water imperiled
species need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials of the California Department of Fish and Game say that
endangered fish will be deprived of water they need to survive if
federal officials go ahead with a plan to divert water from the
headwaters of the Klamath River to drought-plagued farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Under current plans, two Bush administration Cabinet officials,
Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman,
will open head gates and release the water at a ceremony today in
Klamath Falls.</LD>
<LD>   Two federal agencies rushed to issue last-minute opinions Thursday
that justified the release of the water, saying there was no evidence
that three species of endangered fish would be harmed by the
diversion of water. The opinions are required by the Endangered
Species Act.</LD>
<TE>   Biologists at the two agencies charged with enforcing the act, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries
Service, issued letters approving irrigation plans for the basin for
the months of April and May. The approvals came a day after the
announcement that Norton and Veneman would open the head gates,
providing water for hundreds of farmers who can now prepare to plant
their crops.</TE>
<TE>   The last-minute opinion that coho salmon would not be harmed was a
surprise to state officials who had been working to preserve the
imperiled fish.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies Hurried to Formulate Opinions</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a really frustrating turnaround," said Michael
Rode, Klamath River coordinator for the California Department of Fish
and Game. "Those flows are just far too low."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Klamath River runs through California, while farmers
who depend on irrigation water live in both California and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Rode said that the months of April and May are times when both
farmers and fish badly need water. Farmers need to plant their
fields, while tiny coho salmon downstream in the Klamath River and
its tributaries need flows high enough to allow them to seek shelter
in shallow, shaded areas along streams. If the river is high enough,
the newly hatched salmon--called fry--are protected by overhanging
willows and can feed on insects, Rode said. One-year-old fish also
need sufficient water flows in the spring to carry them toward the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The Klamath River needs at least 2,400 cubic feet of water per
second during spring months to provide adequate habitat for young
salmon, Rode said. He questioned how the federal officials could
conclude, as they have, that salmon would not be harmed by flows of
at least 1,742 cubic feet per second in early April, dropping to
1,043 cubic feet in late May--the levels laid out in federal
irrigation plans for the next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Rode said he will consult with other state officials about how to
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "You sort of get squeezed into a corner when they come out with
such low numbers and so little information," Rode said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCracken, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,
the agency in charge of the irrigation project, said Thursday that he
was not aware of the state's concerns and that the bureau is on firm
legal ground because of the opinions from the two federal wildlife
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Some Federal Officials Unhappy With Plan</TE>
<TE>   James H. Lecky, the National Marine Fisheries Service
administrator who signed off on the diversion plan, said his agency
did not have much time to review the irrigation plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a short period of time," he said. "There are people on staff
who aren't happy with it. I'll be honest about that."</TE>
<TE>   Lecky said his agency may reach a different conclusion in a
separate opinion expected June 1.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath Basin farmers, meanwhile, were jubilant at the prospect of
water flowing Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It really shows that the Bush administration does understand that
this was an unjust decision last year, and they're going to do
everything they can to make sure that this doesn't happen to these
rural communities again, with incomplete science," said Bob Gasser of
Merrill, Ore., spokesman for the Klamath Water Users' Assn, which
represents 21 irrigation districts in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   The fish affected are the coho salmon in the Klamath River and the
shortnose and Lost River suckers upstream of the head gates.</TE>
<TE>   The basin has been beset by drought, reducing water for farmers
and fish alike. Federal officials concluded last year that
endangered-species laws required them to divert water from farmers
for fish, causing a firestorm of controversy when some farmers filed
for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of the National Academy of Sciences issued a
much-quoted report this winter, criticizing some of the science used
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine
Fisheries Service in decisions leading to that diversion.</TE>
<TE>   Norton Vows to Find Solutions</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bush administration officials have worked hard to avoid
a repeat explosion, with Norton vowing to find a solution that
satisfies all vying interests in the basin. Norton's department
oversees both the Bureau of Reclamation, which regulates irrigation
in the area, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, which protects rare
freshwater fish and other terrestrial wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Service oversees salmon and other
rare ocean creatures and is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation issued a 10-year plan for the basin
in late February, but it was too late for the two wildlife agencies
to review it and issue opinions before the traditional April 1 start
of the irrigation system.</TE>
<TE>   So in an unusual move, the bureau last Friday asked biologists at
the two agencies to provide opinions by Thursday that their
irrigation plans for April and May would not harm the three
endangered fish. The agencies normally have up to 135 days to prepare
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Suckerfish May Fall in Harm's Way</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service issued its opinion Thursday
afternoon, saying that the irrigation plan would not jeopardize the
continued existence of the two suckerfish.</TE>
<TE>   It did note that up to 100,000 larvae and 5,000 other suckers
could be trapped in irrigation systems during the two-month period,
but that the bureau's installation of barriers and nets would
minimize fish deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The fisheries service took a different approach, saying it could
not produce a biological opinion in only six days. So, the bureau
issued a letter Wednesday asking the fisheries biologists to concur
that planned irrigation operations in April and May would not
adversely affect coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the fisheries service issued a letter late Thursday,
referring to the National Academy of Sciences committee report.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the conclusions expressed by the [committee]," the letter
states, the fisheries service "currently has no basis for
contradicting your determination, and accordingly, NMFS concurs" with
the bureau that opening the head gates is not likely to hurt the
salmon.</TE>

<HD>Dream Homes Become Nightmares</HD>
<DH>Tract: Buyers may have to bid again on the Altadena houses
as financial and legal woes engulf the builder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick and Joan Whitehouse thought they had purchased their dream home
in September 2000, when they entered into escrow on a four-bedroom,
4,100-square-foot house in La Vina Estates in Altadena.</LD>
<LD>   But now, after a series of financial and legal twists and turns,
they may very well have to bid once again on the property they
thought was theirs--and they may be forced to pay handsomely for the
passage of time.</LD>
<LD>   Their predicament--and that of 25 other families--is part of the
tangled tale of the La Vina development in Altadena at the edge of
the Angeles National Forest. The 272-unit project took almost a
decade just to commence.</LD>
<TE>   Legal wranglings over the efficacy of such a massive project so
close to the forest tied the development up in court. Even now, many
area residents resent the property that seems to be carved into the
Altadena hills.</TE>
<TE>   The 26 homes, called La Vina Estates, were to be the last part of
the overall La Vina project, and the most luxurious, selling for
$700,000 to $800,000 each in a town in which the average home price
is under $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   But since last May, 25 of the La Vina Estates homes have sat
unoccupied and incomplete. Twenty-five families have waited anxiously
for almost a year now, since the builder, Compass Homes, began
defaulting on loans and payments to suppliers. They have wondered
whether they would ever be able to drive into their three-car
garages, play in their music and media rooms, or entertain in
kitchens equipped with granite countertops and cherry cabinets. Four
of those families have given up and asked for their $10,000 deposits
back.</TE>
<TE>   The 26th family has been leasing their almost-complete house since
late last year. "We technically aren't even supposed to get water
service," said Steve Cooper, who lives in the house with wife, Kim,
and children, Taylor and Michael, "because we don't own the property.
The power company has come by twice to turn off the power, because
Compass didn't pay their $13,000 bill."</TE>
<TE>   A report by the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer Affairs,
requested earlier this month by the Board of Supervisors, says that
Compass Homes and its subsidiary, La Vina Estates LLC, secured two
loans against the 26 homes in La Vina Estates: one from Prism Builder
Financial Group/Prism Mortgage for $10 million and another for $4
million from Lehman Ali, an affiliate of Lehman Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Ali began initiating foreclosure proceedings last November
after Compass defaulted on its loan. But Lehman Ali lawyer Benzion J.
Westreich said that Lehman Ali has been negotiating an agreement with
Prism that would allow Lehman to complete the project under the
auspices of a new limited liability corporation, Lehman Ali La Vina
II.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, many of the families showed up at the Norwalk
Courthouse for a trustee sale of the property, in which other
investors could have bid to take over Lehman Ali's loan on the
property. Although one private investor did show interest, no one was
willing to match the required $2-million opening bid, and the
property reverted to Lehman Ali.</TE>
<TE>   For the homeowners, however, much remains unresolved. First, they
wonder what will happen to the five-figure sums, most paid directly
to the builder, for upgrades on their homes, such as marble flooring,
covered balconies and other amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Westreich said that although Lehman Ali is not obligated to refund
any of the upgrade money, it plans to either credit or refund the
money families have spent. Lehman Ali, he said, has made "an
extraordinary offer. I don't know of a lender that has offered up to
the homeowners that if it takes over the project, the amounts they
spent will be returned to them or credited."</TE>
<TE>   And although many families are willing to accept Lehman Ali's
assurances on their upgrade costs, they are wary of what will happen
to the purchase price. Home prices in Altadena have increased 20%
since January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that the market is now higher than what it was when any of
us purchased," said Patrick Hanrahan, an attorney who leads the La
Vina families. "Why should a stranger get our equity?"</TE>
<TE>   Dick Whitehouse agreed. The chance to live near his grandchildren
in a new house may indeed be only a dream. "I would like for them to
sell it to us at the price we agreed upon," he said. "If they add 30%
or 40% to the purchase price, that's not right."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Ali has been unwilling to discuss what the purchase prices
will be. The Department of Real Estate's Crisis Response Team and the
district attorney's real estate fraud unit are investigating whether
any action can be taken on behalf of the families.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Leah Dilbeck, a Pasadena real estate agent who is
expecting her first child in June, does not know where she will be
living when the baby is born. "It's like you're in the middle of a
mini-series," she said.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Panel to Close Two Fire Stations</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite pleas from a dozen residents, the Orange County Fire
Authority on Thursday approved a sweeping proposal to close two of
its 62 stations and redefine the role of reserve firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-member board passed the plan that was endorsed by the
firefighters union but stirred resentment among reservists.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighting responsibilities will be taken from most of the
agency's 322 reservists. They will play supporting roles at fire
scenes and respond to traffic accidents and medical emergencies. The
only exceptions will be those assigned to stations in Sunset Beach,
Emerald Bay, Villa Park, Silverado Canyon and Modjeska Canyon, which
still need volunteers to help do actual firefighting.</LD>
<TE>   Battalion Chief Scott Brown and other officials argued that the
restructuring is necessary because the reserve program, which at its
peak had 600 volunteers, has been losing 25% to 30% of its people
annually. Nowadays, they said, many reservists work far from home,
leaving them unable to respond quickly to all calls.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting responsibilities, the agency hopes to increase the
reliability of a system that depends mainly on a backbone of 750
full-time firefighters to serve 1.3 million residents in 22 cities
and in unincorporated areas.</TE>
<TE>   Station No. 12 in Cypress and Station No. 1 in Orange will be
closed.</TE>

<HD>Lakshmi Knight, 58; Classical Indian Dancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lakshmi Knight, who performed and taught classical Indian dance in
India and the U.S., has died. She was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Lakshmi died of cancer in Chennai, India, on Dec. 23, members of
the Indian dance community in Southern California confirmed this
week.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a centuries-old family legacy, she inherited a
distinctive style of Bharata Natyam (one of India's classical dance
forms) from her mother, the legendary dancer Balasaraswati.</LD>
<TE>   Sunil Kothari's exhaustive 1997 book on Bharata Natyam cites her
dancing for "an unusual combination of personal grace, technical
discipline and talent for expression of deep emotions--the hallmark
of Bala's [Balasaraswati's] tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Lakshmi--who used only her given name professionally--was born
Oct. 30, 1943, in Madras, India. "Generations of my whole family have
been musicians and dancers," she told the Albuquerque Journal in
1999. "I think I'm the eighth generation and my son, Anirhudda, is
the ninth." Other sources make her the ninth and her son the 10th,
but at one time she had no interest in the family's performing
heritage and planned another kind of life.</TE>
<TE>   She studied political science at college before asking her mother
for dance training--and it wasn't an easy decision, according to Judy
Mitoma, director of the UCLA Center for Intercultural Performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched her grow into a young adult resisting becoming a
performing artist," Mitoma told The Times, "and I was so moved when I
saw that there was a point in her life when she realized that she
couldn't turn her back on it--the legacy of her family."</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wonderful thing that I was able to witness: her
starting her training with her mother and developing into a great
artist."</TE>
<TE>   Lakshmi gave her first public concert of Bharata Natyam in Madras
in 1972 and then performed throughout India and North America, giving
performances in major venues and teaching extensively in this
country. She received choreography and performance grants from the
National Endowment for the Arts and served as the artistic director
of the Balasaraswati School of Indian Music and Dance, an institution
with branches in India and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   As late as the beginning of 2001, when she was undergoing
chemotherapy, Lakshmi danced with enough skill to cause a critic for
the Indian publication the Hindu to write that "the striving for joy
and defending of the joy of dance resounded powerfully in her
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Award-winning locally based Bharata Natyam dancer and
choreographer Ramaa Bharadvaj saw Lakshmi dance at UCLA in 1999. That
performance, she told The Times, "really brought back my belief that
solo dancing can be powerful and profound."</TE>
<TE>   "It reminded me of everything I'd heard about her mother,"
Bharadvaj continued, "especially the quality of musicality. Lakshmi
was a complete dancer, understanding perfectly how the movement and
the music and the poetry all come together."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her son, Lakshmi is survived by her husband,
musician Douglas Knight Jr., an exponent of Indian classicism.</TE>

<LD>Derrick Evans sits inside the new Starbucks in South Los Angeles
wondering what the big deal is.</LD>
<LD>   "It's Starbucks," he says with a shrug. Evans, 41, refuses to buy
into the idea that the 'hood has "arrived" just because it's been
corporatized by a national franchise--from Seattle, of all places.</LD>
<LD>   "Overpriced, yuppie-[tail] coffee. That's all it is," says Evans,
a senior account executive for a company that tracks down missing
persons.</LD>
<TE>   Needless to say, Evans was not among the hundreds of celebrants at
Tuesday's grand opening of the new shopping center at Western and
Slauson, which includes the Starbucks, Home Depot, Food4Less and
McDonald's. He likes the idea of big-shot investors finally dropping
a few dollars in a neighborhood they've shunned, but thinks local
folks ought to have more pride than to go running into these
franchises as if they've just been set free.</TE>
<TE>   "McDonald's is killing our children," he says. "We got kids all
big and fat from all that grease. Daddy goes through that
drive-through and throws a 'Happy Meal' back to them. That ain't
right."</TE>
<TE>   Evans goes to Woody's Bar-b-cue on Slauson for his beef. You don't
see a Woody's in every neighborhood of every city in America, wearing
itself out. You see it right here, that's all. "Home-grown," Evans
says with pride.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he gazes around a Starbucks that's like every other,
listening to that same jazz they play in all the stores, like they
discovered the music. And now he takes in the doe-eyed images of
part-owner Magic Johnson on the walls, and his resolve softens. It's
Magic. Magic can do no wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "All right, I dig it," Evans says. "It's Magic's, which adds a
little something to it. But the average Joe from the 'hood ain't
bringin' his [self] in here. Three dollars for a cup of coffee?"</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason Magic is always smiling. Actually, I tell Evans,
a regular cup of Joe is $1.40. "Yeah, but it's Starbucks," he says.
"You come in here, you gotta stand in line, and you ain't going to
stand in that long line for no regular coffee. You'll get yourself a
Frappuccino or one of those. Kids are going to come in here before
school and use all their money on a cup of coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Evans gets up to check out the price of pastries and whatnot.
Clearly, he is aghast. A sad, small slab of peach cobbler in a
plastic box is $3.45. One cookie is the price of a whole package of
cookies down at Pic 'n Save.</TE>
<TE>   What the 'hood is celebrating, Evans suggests, is the opportunity
to be ripped off by outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that bottle of water for $1.69," he says. "It's 79 cents
at the 7-Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   But price isn't the worst of it. What really bothers Evans, as a
working-class black man, is seeing his neighbors fall for the pitch,
racing in here as if coffee never existed before Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   The place where it really gets to him is at the Starbucks in
Ladera Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's filled with upper-class black folk who think they're better
than the rest of us," Evans says. "Most of them are one paycheck away
from losing the car or house, but that's how black folk with a little
something act. We only get along because we have to."</TE>
<TE>   Before I can consider the possibility of a conspiracy to divide
the black community over coffee, two cops walk in, one white, one
black. The white guy gets a regular coffee and the black guy says
he's drinking some decaf vanilla latte thing; he can't even remember
what's in it. I ask why they come to such an expensive place, and the
white cop says the coffee is better. "And," he adds, "they give us a
break."</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful. An LAPD discount. I can see heat rising in Evans' eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's my junior badge, so I can get a break too?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "You want everything else that comes with it?" sneers the black
cop. It's kind of hard to come off as a tough guy, though, when
you're stirring a decaf vanilla cream puff, or whatever the heck he
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Evans can barely wait for the cops to get out the door before he
says, "Man, the black dude had some tutti-frutti drink. You hear
that?"</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea of our meeting, I remind Evans, was for him to be
my official taster in a sampling of neighborhood brew. So I buy him a
$1.40 cup of Starbucks, which he deems passable, nothing special, and
then we walk across the street to 7-Star Donuts &amp; Chinese Food.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the same coffee; it has the same effect," promises Vicky
Rin. "Only 60 cents."</TE>
<TE>   While Vicky pours a cup, we learn that her family came over from
Cambodia and built this business up from nothing. It's a classic L.A.
story, neighborhoods made and remade by a string of independent
dreamers.</TE>
<TE>   "We know all of our customers," she says. "Not like some
franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Evans takes his first sip just as Vicky's mother, Linda, comes
out.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you like my coffee?" Linda asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think your coffee is great," Evans says, handing her his
half-full Starbucks cup. "Can you please dump this one for me?"</TE>

<HD>LAPD Already Has the Facts on Dismissed Priests, Mahony
Says</HD>
<DH>Abuse: The cardinal responds to a demand from Police Chief
Parks for the names of those involved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to a written demand from Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks for the names of priests recently dismissed for sexually
abusing minors, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony wrote back Thursday that
those men already are known to the Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "Recently dismissed priests who were in the jurisdiction of the
Los Angeles Police Department have been duly reported," Mahony wrote.
"They were prosecuted and served probation many years ago. These
cases are a matter of public record and known to your detectives."</LD>
<LD>   In his own letter Monday, Parks had cited a police investigation
that was prompted by reports in The Times about the recent
dismissals.</LD>
<TE>   Parks requested that the archdiocese comply with state law
requiring members of the clergy to report any allegations of abuse to
authorities. Parks also asked for the names of victims, as well as
the dates when the archdiocese reported the alleged abuse to the
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Under growing pressure to publicly disclose the names of priests
involved in past or current child abuse allegations, it remained
unclear Thursday what information Mahony may have passed on to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony told 300 Catholic priests gathered in Long Beach on Monday
that he would support the decision of victims of past sexual abuse to
speak publicly, including some who had signed confidentiality
agreements. But he said the archdiocese would not release the names
of their abusers.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said in his Thursday letter to Parks that although
individual clergy are required to report abuse allegations, the law
does not extend to the church.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident each individual has carried out their
responsibilities under the [California Child Abuse and Neglect
Reporting Act]," Mahony wrote. "The law also provides for a penalty
to any mandated reporter who fails to report. But institutions, as
such, do not report."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony wrote that priests who report abuse to authorities are not
required to notify the archdiocese or their superiors. "Thus there
are undoubtedly reports of which we have no knowledge," Mahony said
in his letter to Parks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Mahony wrote, the archdiocese stretches far beyond
Los Angeles itself, encompassing Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties. "Consequently, there are mandated reporting cases
which occur in county and local law enforcement jurisdictions outside
the city of Los Angeles and hence outside the jurisdiction of the Los
Angeles Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   Parks wrote that on March 8, LAPD Dets. Dale Barraclough and
Steven Hales met with Sister Judith Murphy, the archdiocese legal
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy told the investigators that all the abuse cases had "been
reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said Juvenile Division detectives met
again with archdiocese officials Wednesday, after they had received
the chief's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives, Brennan said, were given additional information but he
would not disclose specifics.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, he said, "the archdiocese promised to
cooperate and make known new information on allegations of abuse. As
a result of that meeting, we are confident that the archdiocese is
committed to cooperating and we feel they have been cooperating."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Daniel Mulrenin, head of Juvenile Division's sexually
exploited child unit, said his office has received several phone
calls in recent days from alleged abuse victims, and a number of LAPD
probes are now underway.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter earlier this month, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley also urged Mahony to report any instances of alleged
child abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he has not been able to confirm whether any such cases
in Los Angeles County have been reported to police or child welfare
officials.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's Mass, the cardinal apologized for "the sinful and
deplorable actions of a small percentage of priests" and said he had
adopted a zero-tolerance policy for child abusers.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said, however, that the release of abusers' names going
back years ago would further harm victims.</TE>
<TE>   When new cases of abuse arise, he said, the names of priests
removed for sexual misconduct will be announced to parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference after the Mass, Mahony said church officials
are cooperating with police.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a tip to an archdiocese hotline that led to the dismissal
last week of a priest who headed a Catholic high school in Encino and
another that led to a Los Angeles County sheriff's investigation of
the sexual abuse of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has asked that anyone with information on child abuse
cases telephone (213) 485-2883.</TE>

<HD>Violence Leaves Merced County at a Loss, Again</HD>
<DH>Murders: The slaughter of four children by their mother's
ex-husband is only the latest in a series of grisly cases. Residents
grasp for answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERCED</DL>
<LD>Wednesday afternoon was the kind of glorious spring day made for
baseball practice. The Hoover Middle School seventh-grade team was on
the field. The thwack of ball on bat rose in a gentle breeze along
with the encouraging words of Coach Les Nordman. "Good drive," he
told a player called Boomer.</LD>
<LD>   It has been a week of nightmare and normalcy in Merced County. On
Tuesday, a former sheriff's deputy took terrible vengeance on his
ex-wife by shooting her four children to death and killing himself.</LD>
<LD>   Nordman said he watched four people cry as they read newspaper
accounts of the murders. He choked up when he got to the description
of how the man was holding the body of the youngest, 5-year-old
Michelle, when he turned the gun on himself.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm at a loss," said Nordman, a fifth-generation farmer in the
county. "I don't know if there is an answer. If you're religious or
not, educated or not, this happens."</TE>
<TE>   Merced County has in recent years experienced a series of multiple
murders that could have been lifted from a Stephen King novel. There
were the pitchfork murders, the Delhi decapitation, the Henson
killings, and now this.</TE>
<TE>   The string of grisly murders cannot be blamed on gangs or drugs or
wanton greed. The carnage has for the most part been wreaked by
family member on family member, perhaps once more proving that there
can be no greater hatred than that born of love.</TE>
<TE>   John P. Hogan, a private investigator and former Santa Clara
County sheriff's deputy, apparently wanted more than anything to hurt
his ex-wife, Christine McFadden, a well-known veterinarian who had
three teenage children from her first marriage, as well as Michelle
from her recent marriage to Hogan.</TE>
<TE>   While McFadden was out on her usual morning walk with a friend
before work Tuesday, authorities say, Hogan pulled up to her house in
a quiet, well-to-do neighborhood just outside of town. He entered
through the garage, and with his .40-caliber Glock pistol, went from
bedroom to bedroom, shooting Stanley, 15, and Stuart, 14, as they
slept.</TE>
<TE>   He then encountered Melanie, 17, in the hallway, apparently
struggling with her briefly before killing her. His last stop was the
master bedroom, where he left a letter and some biblical passages in
the bathroom, shot his own daughter and then, while clutching her
body, himself.</TE>
<TE>   "How else would you be able to forever hurt your ex-wife than by
taking away four of her most cherished items, her children?" said
Merced County Sheriff's Cmdr. Mark Pazin.</TE>
<TE>   He could barely stand to listen to the 911 tape of McFadden's
anguished phone call to police after she discovered her oldest
daughter's body. "My ex-husband has killed my children," McFadden
screamed to the dispatcher, gasping and sobbing.</TE>
<TE>   The letter Hogan left in the bathroom relates his unhappiness over
the divorce and his inability to reconcile with McFadden. Just before
the shootings, he called a friend--a deputy in the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department where he worked a decade ago--and said he was
spent and "emotionally bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan and McFadden, who married in 1995, had been divorced about a
year. Although McFadden complained of verbal abuse and obtained a
temporary restraining order against Hogan in 1998, Pazin said
investigators were not aware of any threats of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "He just snapped," said Pazin, describing Hogan as a loner who was
not well known in town.</TE>
<TE>   A local vet for nearly two decades, McFadden is the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it was my family," said Nordman, who has taken dogs
and cats to McFadden and likes her sensitive manner with animals.
"When she grabs something, the animal just seems to relax."</TE>
<TE>   Merced, he added, "is a very small community" where people seem to
know everybody's first name.</TE>
<TE>   Actually it isn't that small. Between Fresno and Modesto on
California 99, Merced is a growing Central Valley city of 64,000,
soon to be home to a new UC campus. But it still feels like a small
town, where murders do not go unnoticed, particularly the sort that
have been committed in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a couple of incidents already that shocked us," said
Craig Campos, a Pacific Bell technician, as he sipped coffee at a
cafe in Merced's waiting-to-be-revived downtown.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, an intruder broke into a rural Merced home and
attacked three children with a garden pitchfork, killing two and
injuring a third. Sheriff's deputies fatally shot him when he went
after them. Authorities never discerned a motive.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, a young man decapitated his mother in their family
home in Delhi, about 20 miles north of here. Police discovered him
naked, sitting in her blood. He was recently found competent to stand
trial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a teenage boy killed his father, sister, half-brother and
his father's girlfriend in a ranch house east of Merced. He pleaded
no contest and was sentenced to 176 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "These last 48 hours have been very difficult for the department,"
Pazin said, sitting in a Sheriff's Department office Thursday
morning. "In law enforcement we usually have a reason for despicable
acts--gang violence or carjacking. But these murders...."</TE>

<HD>Years Later, MTA Bus Dispute Back Where It Started</HD>
<DH>Transit: Out of appeals, agency resumes talks with riders
union over service--with the same mediator whose ruling sparked the
legal feud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's back to square one in the years-long dispute between the
county's giant transit agency and the disgruntled bus riders who
secured a federal agreement to compel the agency to boost bus
service.</LD>
<LD>   The release of a Metropolitan Transportation Agency report
Thursday signals the dispute's return to the hands of Donald T.
Bliss, the mediator whose 1998 ruling touched off a costly legal
battle that only ended last week, when the transit agency was
rebuffed by the nation's highest court.</LD>
<LD>   MTA officials at the agency's board meeting released a 52-page
report outlining what they've done to follow the agreement to improve
bus service--and how they intend to satisfy its remaining five years.</LD>
<TE>   The report was released on the same day the MTA board explored
providing schedules and route maps at more bus stops. The board also
heard advocates for the disabled community decry cutbacks in
paratransit services.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the MTA's report stated that it is closely
adhering to the federal agreement, signed in 1996 to avoid a trial
over claims by the Bus Riders Union that shoddy bus service was
violating the civil rights of impoverished minorities, the bulk of
the agency's customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bus Riders Union strongly disagrees with the MTA's stance, and
the dispute now must be mediated by Bliss, whose role as mediator was
created in the federal agreement.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the MTA has spent at least $1 million appealing the
agreement since 1999, when Bliss reviewed the agency's bus lines and
ordered hundreds of new buses to relieve overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   Partly because of the multimillion-dollar cost of the order, and
partly because many at the MTA believed Bliss should not have such
broad oversight powers, the agency immediately appealed.</TE>
<TE>   The transit agency was turned back by a federal judge and, in
recent months, by two panels of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court. The U.S.
Supreme Court declined last week to hear the agency's case.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, officials from the MTA and Bus Riders Union have met
twice to try to reach an agreement. Those meetings ended bitterly,
with the two sides unable to agree on how to measure or eliminate
overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   The Bus Riders Union believes that, to abide by the agreement, the
MTA should buy at least 135 buses. And that's just in the near
future. The group would prefer at least 500 more buses--and argues
that the agreement provides for them.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA, in its report, argues that portions of the agreement can
be treated as goals, not strict standards.</TE>
<TE>   Seen this way, the agency argues that it has done all it can to
alleviate overcrowding by replacing much of its aging fleet and
adding about 350 buses to reach a fleet of roughly 2,100.</TE>
<TE>   "Our report makes it very clear" that the MTA has adhered to the
agreement, said Alan Lipsky, the MTA official in charge of the
effort. Lipsky repeated the MTA's long-held argument that the
agreement is too strict and that it hampers the agency's broader
agenda, which includes freeway improvements and new rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   Lipsky said that despite Bliss' past rulings against the agency,
he was confident that Bliss would now see things the MTA's way.</TE>
<TE>   Bus Riders Union advocates remained staunchly defiant. "We
disagree with major portions of this assessment," said Manuel
Criollo, a bus riders organizer. He branded the report "doublespeak"
and "twisted logic."</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who has followed the case
closely, noted the irony that the dispute would once again return to
Bliss. The difference now, he said, is that Bliss--the special master
in the case--has more power.</TE>
<TE>   "The MTA was trying to argue against the authority of the special
master," he said. But by going through their appeals and being turned
back, he added, "the MTA must return to him, but knowing he really
does have authority to make decisions.... That's a key difference."</TE>
<TE>   Agency Criticized for Not Posting Schedules</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, county Supervisor Gloria Molina assailed the MTA
for "lagging behind most other transit agencies in providing bus
route [and] schedule information at the bus stops."</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, The Times reported that fewer than 3% of the MTA's
18,500 bus stops displayed routes and schedules, while more than 85%
of New York City's 14,000 bus stops did. According to transit
experts, displaying helpful information at bus stops promotes
ridership, and its absence discourages it.</TE>
<TE>   In a motion passed Thursday, Molina asked the agency to find ways
to make such information more readily available.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why the MTA hasn't done this in the past," she said.
She speculated that "they don't want to post the [bus arrival] times
because people might hold them accountable to that."</TE>
<TE>   Kymberleigh Richards, a spokeswoman for Southern California
Transit Advocates, wondered whether posting schedules might be too
expensive. According to the MTA, each information display costs $118,
and to equip every stop would cost more than $2 million, not
including labor.</TE>
<TE>   On a separate issue, a group of disabled riders and advocates
urged the MTA board to allocate more money to prevent a cut in
paratransit services. The county's largest paratransit provider,
Access Services Inc., receives more than 90% of its $63.8-million
budget through the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   To the alarm of riders, the board of Access Services voted last
month to reduce the level of service. Under the new plan, riders must
schedule service at least a day in advance. If riders want same-day
service, they must pay higher fares or take a subsidized taxi ride.
Kathleen Perrin, chairwoman of Paratransit Riders Coalition, said the
plan is creating a crisis in her community.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Fire Panel Votes for Major Revamp</HD>
<DH>Safety: Two stations will be closed and volunteers will be
given less of a firefighting role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite pleas from a dozen residents, the Orange County Fire
Authority on Thursday approved a sweeping proposal to close two of
its 62 stations and redefine the role of reserve firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-member board passed the restructuring plan, which was
endorsed by the firefighters union but stirred resentment among
reservists.</LD>
<LD>   Fire Authority Chairwoman Susan Ritschel said after the 20-3 vote,
"I think this is the beginning of a reserve program that we will be
able to sustain. I'm looking forward to getting on with it."</LD>
<TE>   Many of those who objected to the plan were from Seal Beach, where
the issue is emotional, City Councilman Paul Yost told the fire
board. "I am extremely concerned," he said. "I would have liked for
us in Seal Beach to keep our volunteer fire department. I'm concerned
that costs will go up and service will go down."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, drafted after a two-year study, aims to improve a
volunteer program that has been losing 25% to 30% of its people
annually.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not making these requests because of dollars and cents,"
Battalion Chief Scott Brown said before the vote. "This is being
driven by one thing and one thing only: We have a volunteer program
that doesn't work and needs to be fixed."</TE>
<TE>   The authority will close station No. 12 in Cypress, which is small
and surrounded by stations with full-time staff. Officials considered
it redundant.</TE>
<TE>   Also slated for closure is station No. 1 in Orange, which handles
administrative functions and does not respond to calls.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighting responsibilities will be taken from most of the
agency's 322 reservists.</TE>
<TE>   The reservists will play supporting roles at fire scenes and
respond to traffic accidents and medical emergencies. The only
exceptions will be those assigned to stations in Sunset Beach,
Emerald Bay, Villa Park, Silverado Canyon and Modjeska Canyon, which
still need volunteers to help do actual firefighting.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and other officials argued that the restructuring is
necessary because the reserve program, which at its peak had 600
volunteers, has fallen short on several counts in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, they said, many reservists work far from home, leaving
them unable to respond quickly or unable to respond to all calls.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting responsibilities, the agency hopes to increase the
reliability of a system that depends mainly on a backbone of 750
full-time firefighters to serve 1.3 million residents in 22 cities
and in unincorporated areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Over half the time, our reserves are not able to respond as
needed," Brown said. "By redefining the role of what our volunteers
should be doing, focusing the training on the type of call they
predominantly deal with, we will ensure the viability of a volunteer
program well into the future, but more importantly, building a
program that's safe and reliable."</TE>

<HD>Priest Admitting Sex Abuse Agrees to Leave Clergy</HD>
<DH>Religion: John Lenihan, accused in a recent suit, had been
pastor of a Dana Point church.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Lenihan, an Orange County priest who has admitted to molesting a
minor and having multiple affairs, has agreed to ask Pope John Paul
II to remove him from the priesthood, church officials announced
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Tod D. Brown, bishop of the Diocese of Orange, also said a special
investigation launched last month into his priests' backgrounds had
concluded this week with one pastor found to have a history of sexual
abuse.</LD>
<LD>   That priest, Michael Pecharich, was removed earlier this month
from his Rancho Santa Margarita parish.</LD>
<TE>   Pecharich and Lenihan are among three Orange County priests to
make headlines in recent months during the Roman Catholic Church's
unfolding sex scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange paid $5.2million in August 2001 to a single
victim to settle molestation accusations against Msgr. Michael
Harris.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, the dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange
were required to fire any priests with a history of child
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan had no comment, his attorney said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan, 56, will be laicized, a canonical process often used by
clergy who wish to leave the priesthood to marry.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure will not be completed officially until the pope has
given final approval, a formality in this case because of the request
by Lenihan and the bishop.</TE>
<TE>   In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, it's unknown whether Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony has sought laicization for any of the six to 12
priests that sources say have been fired or asked to resign recently
because of past sexual abuse of minors. A spokesman for Mahony didn't
return phone calls Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' rights leaders applauded the announcement of Lenihan's
removal.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowledge is power and people need to know why this man" was
removed, said David Clohessy, national director of the St.
Louis-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Diocese of Orange asked Vatican officials to remove
Harris from the priesthood as part of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan was removed as pastor of St. Edward Church in Dana Point
in September after he, under the pseudonym "Father X," revealed to a
Los Angeles Times columnist that he had had several sexual
relationships, including "four serious ones."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Lenihan admitted to church officials that he sexually
abused a teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid $25,000 to Mary
Grant to settle her lawsuit. The popular priest was allowed to
continue to work in the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Lenihan was accused in a civil lawsuit of molesting a
second teenage girl for several years starting in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's way overdue," Grant said of Lenihan's removal from the
clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad that Roman collar isn't going to be his path to
molesting other children."</TE>
<TE>   Grant was unable to seek criminal charges because of statute of
limitation problems.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart goes out to his victims, both minors and adults, and his
parishioners," Brown said. "I also feel sorry for Father Lenihan."</TE>

<HD>Priest Who Admitted to Sex Abuse of Teen Agrees to Leave

<DH>Religion: John Lenihan had been pastor of a Dana Point

<LD>John Lenihan, an Orange County priest who has admitted to molesting a

Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Tod D. Brown, bishop of the Diocese of Orange, also said a special

<TE>   Lenihan had no comment, his attorney said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan, 56, will be laicized, a canonical process often used by
clergy who wish to leave the priesthood to marry. The procedure will
not be completed officially until the pope has given final approval,
a formality in this case because of the request by Lenihan and the
bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1980s, laicization has been used with increasing
frequency to remove molesters from the priesthood. Previously, such
priests often were stripped of their authority to perform religious
ceremonies but remained in the clergy for life.</TE>
<TE>   In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, it's unknown whether Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony has sought laicization for any of the six to 12
priests who sources say have been fired or asked to resign recently
because of past sexual abuse of minors. A spokesman for Mahony didn't
return phone calls Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' rights leaders applauded the announcement of Lenihan's
removal from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowledge is power and people need to know why this man" was
removed, said David Clohessy, national director of the St.
Louis-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, known as
SNAP.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Diocese of Orange asked Vatican officials to remove
Msgr. Michael Harris from the priesthood as part of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan was removed as pastor of St. Edward Church in Dana Point
in September after he, under the pseudonym "Father X," revealed to a
Los Angeles Times columnist that he had had several sexual
relationships, including "four serious ones."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Lenihan admitted to church officials that he sexually
abused a teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid $25,000 to Mary

<TE>   "It's way overdue," Grant said of Lenihan's removal from the
clergy. "I'm glad that Roman collar isn't going to be his path to
molesting other children."</TE>
<TE>   Grant was unable to seek criminal charges against Lenihan because
of statute of limitation problems.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he asked Lenihan to consider quitting the priesthood
last fall before the latest lawsuit. The priest was sent to a
counseling center in Canada but didn't complete the program, Brown
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan agreed to the laicization last week in a decision that
Brown said "was very painful for him."</TE>
<TE>   "My heart goes out to his victims, both minors and adults, and his
parishioners," Brown said. "I also feel sorry for Father Lenihan."</TE>
<TE>   If a priest doesn't agree with his removal, he can be defrocked.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan, who was ordained in 1969, will be paid by the Diocese of
Orange until his removal gets final Vatican approval. He will receive
a standard pension, church officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he was pleased that the special investigation into his
priests' backgrounds is complete.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quite confident now that there is no one active in ministry
who [based on past incidents] poses a threat to minors," he said.</TE>

<LD>Virginia Strain of Sunset Beach, who has a revocable living trust in
her name, noticed with some amusement that it had been abbreviated
this way on one tax form: "Revocable Living Virgin." Her accountant's
secretary said, "Well, at least it's revocable, Virginia."</LD>
<LD>   Which reminds me: Dr. Howard B. Weithorn and Associates received
confirmation of a renewed postal box, but the notice shortened the
firm's name, leaving the last seven letters off "Associates."</LD>
<LD>   No fan of photographers? Linda Garcia of Riverside came upon a cat
notice snapped by Nita Hiltner in that city's Press-Enterprise and
wonders if the creature was just having a bad day (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   If you're under 800, expect to show your ID: In an attempt to
expand my reader base, I'm aiming this item at everyone from tots to
Methuselah-types. Don Lisle of Altadena found a Sunday school looking
for novice instructors, while Merrill Safstrom of L.A. was surprised
to read on a receipt that he was born in the Middle Ages (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Not dressed up, somewhere to go: A driver made an emergency call
on his cell phone to report a freeway sighting of a pickup truck
carrying two naked bodies in the back. A CHP officer found the truck
and pulled it over. When the driver identified himself as LAPD Sgt.
Bruce Bogstad, the Chippie nevertheless had to ask: "You got bodies
in the back of your truck?" Bogstad explained that plastic bags had
blown off two mannequins he was carrying.</TE>
<TE>   The manager of the L.A. Police Pipe Band, Bogstad was on his way
to a bagpipe recital by the group and had brought along the
mannequins to model various outfits.</TE>
<TE>   I'm pleased to report, by the way, that Bogstad was not
transporting the mannequins while driving in the car-pool lane--like
that hearse driver with a real stiff did a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Payback time: Mention was made in this space of the Leland
Stanford Jr. University Marching Band, known for crazy outfits and
wild halftime shows that often mock Stanford's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Knox recalled a subtle retaliatory move when Stanford was
playing UCLA down here. The public address announcer introduced the
visiting band this way: "And, now, the Leland Stanford [pause] Junior
University Marching Band."</TE>
<TE>   "It's all in the way you say it," Knox pointed out.</TE>

<HD>Parks Wants Panel Interview Public</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Chief says open session on his bid for a second term
would ensure 'fair proceeding.' The commission is considering his
request.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Chief Bernard C. Parks on Thursday asked the Los Angeles
Police Commission to interview him in an open session rather than
behind closed doors as they weigh whether to appoint him to a second
five-year term.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to commissioners, Parks wrote that to ensure a "fair
proceeding," he would "waive any right to confidentiality of privacy
I may have."</LD>
<LD>   The commission is scheduled to interview Parks on Monday, and he
is expected to defend his merits as chief.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan, spokesman for Parks, said Thursday that
Parks had asked for an open session because "he has received a number
... of inquiries from people in the community asking, why not? What
is so secret or confidential about this process ... that the public
shouldn't listen to?"</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said Parks plans to talk about his accomplishments as
chief and his vision for a second term during the interview, "all
information that the public is interested in and should have an
opportunity to hear," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said that he doesn't
object to Parks' making his presentation in open session, but that no
decision will be made until the request is cleared by the city
attorney, and the other four commissioners have a chance to weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the commission's deliberations on the chief afterward
should remain closed, Caruso said. The commission "has a right to
have some level of conversation in private," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Thursday afternoon, Caruso was still awaiting an
opinion on the request from the city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   But city attorney spokeswoman Ana Garcia said that, in general,
the Brown Act allows such sessions to be open if both the employee
concerned and the commission agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Openness in government is a good thing, and the public has a
right to see democracy in action. That has always been the policy of
this office," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, 58, is nearing the end of his five-year term. Earlier this
year, Mayor James K. Hahn announced that he opposes a second term for
Parks. The decision angered many of the mayor's most vocal African
American supporters, who have rallied behind the black chief.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League, the union representing LAPD
officers, opposes another term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   But under the city charter, the decision falls to the Police
Commission, subject to a City Council veto. The commission's members
are appointed by the mayor. The Police Commission has been weighing
its decision for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the commission has listened to public comments about
Parks in open session, further proceedings have unfolded in closed
sessions, as with other personnel matters before the panel.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent of these sessions, the chief met for more than
an hour with commissioners Monday to ask for clarification on the
interview process and the criteria being used to evaluate him. The
meeting followed a request from Parks for more time to prepare his
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Police commissioners announced in February that they would judge
the chief's performance on eight criteria, including leadership and
crime control, and give the chief an opportunity to respond to each.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter Thursday, Parks also asked the commissioners to
provide him with research material compiled by their staff to aid in
deliberations. That includes budgetary information and various
statistics, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso agreed to this request, and "got a large notebook" of
information from the commission Thursday afternoon, Brennan said.</TE>

<LD>Costa Mesa. Costa Mesa. What a great place-a.</LD>
<LD>   I've lived next door to--let me sing it again--Costa Mesa for 16
years but never gave much thought to its name. It never crossed my
mind to think, "I wish they'd rename it." If somebody wants to rename
a town, how about Placentia?</LD>
<LD>   Nope, Placentia is perfectly happy with itself. It's Costa Mesa
with the inferiority complex, the town where some suffer from an
identity crisis.</LD>
<TE>   I spent 18 months in a town named Weeping Water. If you think that
suggests we had a beautiful waterfall on the edge of town, you'd be
wrong. All we had on the edge of town was a limestone quarry that
created a constant cloud of dust.</TE>
<TE>   To my knowledge, the town council never once considered calling us
Weeping Water By-the-Quarry.</TE>
<TE>   But that was Nebraska, and this is Southern California. To my
country ears, "Costa Mesa" sounds downright continental.</TE>
<TE>   Not so to a group of Costa Mesa residents who may be spending too
much time at the Ritz-Carlton. Their stated mission is to improve the
city, and their latest brainstorm is to change its name to Costa Mesa
By-the-Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The group's chairwoman told the Daily Pilot this week that "Costa
Mesa" doesn't properly identify the city as a beachy place to live.
Sounds to me like she's got a serious case of Newport Beach envy,
which is weird because way before the town was Costa Mesa the area
was known as Goat Hill. You'd think "Costa Mesa" would represent
enough of an upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's this technicality: Costa Mesa doesn't border the sea.</TE>
<TE>   I don't live in the city, so I probably shouldn't sound off.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, I decided to talk to the future leaders of
Costa Mesa. After all, these are the people who'd have to live with
the name change.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, I found these future leaders outside a Starbucks on
Harbor Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "Change the name?" says Hayato Ochiai.</TE>
<TE>   He agrees that "Costa Mesa" doesn't have much lilt to it but
thinks the suggestion to change it is silly. He says it sounds like
something some folks at a country club thought up after a round of
golf and a few drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Ochiai, 33, is on his third tour of residency in Costa Mesa. He's
not enamored of the city but says fate keeps bringing him back and
hopes the third time is the charm. But of his various complaints, the
city's name isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   A few tables down sit Tiger Dowdy and Lori George. Dowdy is a
local, but George comes from another town with a mouthful of a
name--Rancho Santa Margarita. She wonders why Costa Mesa would want
to add words.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems unnecessary," she says. "The name would be too long."</TE>
<TE>   Dowdy, 28, is willing to consider it.</TE>
<TE>   I repeat the name to him: "Costa Mesa By-the-Sea."</TE>
<TE>   He shakes his head. "Doesn't grab me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   What's wrong with it? I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been Costa Mesa for so long, I'm just used to it," Dowdy
says. "They are doing lots of changes in town, remodeling things, but
this sounds like they're trying to make the name sound like Newport
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   In so many words, the name-change advocates don't deny that.
They've made it clear that "Costa Mesa" sounds way too inland to be
enticing.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, Dowdy says, but there is such a thing as truth in
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really by the sea," Dowdy says. "It's more like close to
the sea."</TE>
<TE>   Then he brightens, as if having hit on something brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it," Dowdy says. "Costa Mesa Close-to-the-Sea."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Hadley, 80, a developer of major projects in the Pacific
Northwest and Hawaii who also tried to renovate the luxury liner
United States, died Tuesday of undisclosed causes in Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Hadley's projects included the Prince Kuhio in Honolulu and other
large hotels and office towers in Seattle and Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   In 1978, he bought the United States for $5 million from the U.S.
government. The largest, fastest and most luxurious ocean liner built
in America when it made its maiden voyage from New York to Le Havre,
France, in 1952, it had been sold to the federal government in 1972
as a hospital ship for troops.</LD>
<TE>   Hadley wanted to spend millions on its renovation and use it on
San Francisco-to-Hawaii cruises. The job proved too daunting
financially, and Hadley's company, United States Cruises Inc., went
into bankruptcy in 1992. The vessel remains idle in a Philadelphia
shipyard.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley was a Seattle native who earned a civil and mechanical
engineering degree from the University of Washington before flying
with the Army Air Corps in Europe during World War II. He later
earned a master's degree in structural engineering and a doctorate in
business.</TE>

Commerce.</LD>

17-year-old Alabaman who moves to New Mexico with his mother when his
father joins the Navy during World War II.</TE>

<HD>Lee Paul, 94; Helped Found Law Firm With Global Reach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee Paul, the last surviving name partner of the law firm of Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky and Walker, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Paul, who co-founded the firm with Robert Hastings and Leonard
Janofsky in 1951 and saw it grow into an operation that has 790
lawyers in offices in many major U.S. cities as well as London and
Tokyo, died of natural causes Saturday at his home in Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "Leonard Janofsky was the country's leading employment lawyer, Bob
Hastings was a corporate generalist and Lee Paul was a litigator--and
a really tough, charismatic jury trial litigator," said Paul
Grossman, former chairman of the firm's employment law department.</LD>
<TE>   "Lee had a tremendous presence and a marvelous sense of humor, and
all the attributes that make a great jury trial lawyer, and he was
the founder and leader for many years of our very extensive
litigation practice," he added.</TE>
<TE>   As a civil litigator, Paul represented Toyota Motors, Union Oil,
McCulloch Oil, Singer Sewing Machine, the Los Angeles Times, the
Pasadena school board, the southern division of the Pacific Maritime
Assn. and many others.</TE>
<TE>   "When he battled in court, he was awesome to watch," said Jenifer
Monroe Bode, Paul's daughter. "His background was in literature, and
he drew on that kind of thing in court. He loved the English language
and wrote beautifully as well.</TE>
<TE>   "He was formidable if he was your foe, but for the people that
knew him he had this wonderful sense of humor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul retired in 1978 but maintained an office at the firm until
about five years ago, when he and his wife, Gordon, moved from
Pasadena to their summer home in Laguna's Emerald Bay neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Anthony Lee Gilmour Paul in 1907 in Denver. He
attended the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, graduated from
Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1929, and graduated from
Harvard Law School in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, after establishing private practices first in San
Francisco and then Los Angeles, Paul was commissioned as the resident
industry member of the Shipbuilding Commission of the National War
Labor Board in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he returned to Los Angeles and co-founded the firm
that was joined by partner Charles Walker in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, usually referred to as Paul Hastings, has offices in Los
Angeles; Costa Mesa; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Connecticut;
Atlanta; London and Tokyo. It is one of only two law firms founded
after World War II ranked in the top 50 of the American Lawyer's
"AmLaw 100" list of major law firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Our firm is very fortunate in having had four founding partners,
all of whom lived long, active lives, all of whom remained interested
in the law firm throughout their lives, and all of whom were
unselfish in the sense of their desire to create an institution that
would live beyond their legal careers," said Don Daucher, former
managing partner of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Paul had a longtime concern for civic affairs. Over the years, he
served as a member of the Child Guidance Clinic board, president of
the Los Angeles Boys &amp; Girls Club, director of the Pasadena Public
Library and the Pasadena Humane Society, chairman of the Pasadena
Council on Alcoholism and founder of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, he established the Lee and Gordon Paul Scholarship Fund
at Bowdoin, which provides financial assistance to graduates of the
college who are attending Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Paul's wife died in 1998. In addition to Bode, he is survived by
daughters, Mollie Paul Collins of Belvedere, Calif., and Deborah Paul
Barkley of Pasadena; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Wednesday at All Saints
Episcopal Church in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Donations may be made to Bowdoin, the Pasadena Humane Society or
Doe Library in Berkeley in Paul's name.</TE>

<HD>For California Poet Laureate, Names Both Large and Small</HD>
<DH>Culture: The field shrinks to three, each a strong
contender. The final choice should emerge in July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The writing staff of TV's "Will &amp; Grace" didn't make the cut.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-one more California wordsmiths ended up on the scrapheap
too, despite resumes gilded with prestigious awards, fellowships and
publications.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, a Beat Generation standout, a bilingual chronicler of
Chicano life and a multimedia Renaissance man emerged Wednesday as
the finalists to become California's first formally chosen poet
laureate.</LD>
<TE>   Now it falls to Gov. Gray Davis to nominate Diane di Prima,
Francisco Alarcon or Quincy Troupe to a post that has existed since
1915 but was largely political until last year, when the Legislature
approved a detailed set of qualifications and duties for it.</TE>
<TE>   The multitiered process to pick a poet laureate initially produced
a rather muted response from California's literary community.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the state's best-known poets declined to be nominated,
including Pulitzer Prize winners Gary Snyder and Philip Levine,
former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass and Bay Area legend Lawrence
Ferlinghetti. A few days before the Feb. 19 deadline, the council had
received just 10 submissions.</TE>
<TE>   But a last-minute blast of publicity brought a cascade of 45 more
applications, some from unexpected quarters. The 11-member "Will &amp;
Grace" writing staff, for example, submitted itself for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the poets of the Southern California landscape," said Jeff
Greenstein, one of the show's executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   Their entry didn't survive the first judging round, which culled
the applicant pile from 55 to 21.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if the writers of 'Six Feet Under' had been nominated,"
quipped panelist Jack Hicks, a professor at UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Well that's just mean," Greenstein shot back. "No one ever takes
comedy seriously."</TE>
<TE>   A five-member panel convened Wednesday in Sacramento to pick three
finalists, looking for poets with national stature and the ability to
act as ambassadors for their craft.</TE>
<TE>   In Troupe, Alarcon and Di Prima, they chose starkly different
stylists, all with proven ability to communicate across regional,
generational and ethnic lines.</TE>
<TE>   Troupe, 59, may be as well-known for his radio show, "The Miles
Davis Project," and for the autobiography he penned with Davis, as
for his poetry. His electric performance style helped the La Jolla
resident, who also teaches at UC San Diego, win the heavyweight title
twice at the annual Taos Poetry Circus.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, 48, who oversees the Spanish for Native Speakers program
at UC Davis, is one of the nation's most prominent Chicano poets. He
has written 10 volumes of poetry, including "Snake Poems," which won
the 1993 American Book Award, and an acclaimed children's book.</TE>
<TE>   Di Prima, 67, born in Brooklyn but a longtime San Francisco
fixture, captured the Beatnik era, both in poems and autobiographical
writing, and by editing several poetry anthologies. She co-founded
"The Floating Bear," a periodical that featured works by William S.
Burroughs and Jack Kerouac, and has written numerous plays.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great honor to be considered," Di Prima said. "California
is my country, in a way. How we see the world is unique."</TE>
<TE>   The governor is expected to pick from among the finalists by July,
sending one name for confirmation by the state Senate. The winner
will serve no more than two two-year terms, during which he or she
must give public readings and take on a project.</TE>
<TE>   Di Prima said she would use the position to reach out to working
people, urging them to write based on their experiences. Greenstein
said the "Will &amp; Grace" staff would have brought an episode of the
New York-based show to California.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's California's loss," he said.</TE>

<LD>More than 300 immigrants and their advocates descended on Los Angeles
International Airport on Thursday in a spirited but orderly rally to
denounce federal sweeps that snared scores of illegal immigrants at
the airport last week.</LD>
<LD>   "We are here today to demand that current and future INS raids and
sweeps cease immediately," said Angelica Salas, a rally organizer who
addressed supporters and the media from a patch of grass in front of
the futurist Encounters restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Participants--toting placards proclaiming "Raids Disrupt Families"
and "Immigrant Does Not Equal Terrorist," among other
messages--marched amid tight police security to the terminal curb, as
jumbo jets roared overhead and the aroma of jet fuel permeated the
air. Traffic snarled briefly as demonstrators crossed the street, but
officials reported no major disruption to operations at the nation's
third-busiest airport.</LD>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service sweeps, widely
publicized in the Spanish-language media, have stunned Southern
California's undocumented masses, who have grown accustomed to living
relatively normal lives despite their lack of legal residency status.
Community representatives have even reported some parents keeping
their children out of school--the kind of paranoia last evident
during the polarized battle over Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative
that targeted illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just very nervous now," said Miguel Ortega, a
42-year-old airport janitor who was among the dozens expressing their
outrage. Unions, churches, immigrant organizations and allied groups
brought in most of the marchers, who chanted slogans in Spanish as
Korean drummers pounded out a protest beat.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates fear a change of the unwritten rules of engagement that
have left Los Angeles and other areas in the U.S. interior as virtual
safe zones where INS interference is minimal. The Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks have provided an ominous backdrop: Airport security has been
tightened, and many see diminished public support for
immigrants--even the vast majority in no way linked to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "First they came for the Muslims, for the Arabs," warned James
Lafferty of the National Lawyers Guild, referring to the roundup of
more than 1,000 Middle Eastern and South Asian men after Sept. 11.
"Now they are coming for the Latinos and every other immigrant of
color."</TE>
<TE>   The INS said it is not changing the rules, but officials said the
protests will not alter their approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome their opinion, but we will continue with our
operations wherever they're needed," said Francisco Arcaute, INS
spokesman in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The INS, the focus of intense criticism in Washington after a
series of security gaffes, is being pulled in two directions:
Immigrant advocates call for an end to raids and a sweeping amnesty
for illegal immigrants, while some lawmakers and others say more
raids and mass deportations are exactly what is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have been doing operations like this a long time
ago," said Yeh Ling-Ling, executive director of the Diversity
Alliance for a Sustainable America, a Berkeley-based group that
favors cuts in immigration. "Illegal immigrants know that once you're
in the U.S., you're home free."</TE>
<TE>   Last week's raids at LAX resulted in arrests of 183 Mexicans and
one Guatemalan, according to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   A separate set of INS sweeps targeting airport workers has
resulted in more than 200 arrests of undocumented employees at
airports in California and elsewhere in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The 184 arrested at LAX last week had been recently smuggled
across the U.S.-Mexico border and were seeking to board domestic
flights to Chicago, New York and other destinations, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights advocates said the arrests were the result of racial
profiling. The INS denied such tactics, contending that the smuggling
rings targeted happened to be moving Mexicans, who account for the
great majority of illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is home to more than one quarter of the
nation's more than 7 million illegal immigrants, according to
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The raids underscored LAX's role as a major trans-shipment point
for illegal immigrants en route to jobs and families in other U.S.
cities and towns.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows with certainly, but one estimate had as many as 6,000
recently smuggled illegal immigrants using the airport daily during
peak seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledged that alert smugglers quickly adjust and
move their clients to other airports, so the long-term impact of the
sweeps is negligible.</TE>
<TE>   Though small scale so far, the raids demonstrate the potential
vulnerability of a Southland economy built in part on the labor of
millions of illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is: Are these people being picked up really threats
to the economy, or are they one of us?" asked Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the L.A. County Economic Development Corp. "Are they
just here to do a job and send money home?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Westerfield, a self-employed engineer, pleaded not guilty
Thursday to charges of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle
van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   He was charged two weeks ago after a preliminary hearing in which
prosecutors presented DNA evidence allegedly linking him to the
crime.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd set May 17 as a trial date,
although Westerfield's defense attorneys can request a delay.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   An appeals court this week tentatively granted a defense request
to seal search warrants used by police to gather evidence in
Westerfield's home.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's body was found Feb.27, 25 days after she disappeared
from the family home in an upscale suburb. Westerfield, 50, lives two
houses from the family.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A county jail inmate hanged himself in his cell Wednesday, which will
lead Sacramento County officials to redesign bunk beds after the
year's fourth apparent suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the four inmates used small holes in the top of the bunk
beds to hold the nooses, sheriff's deputies said.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. James Lewis said the holes measure about a quarter-inch in
diameter and were put in the top bunks for drainage during cleaning.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's apparent suicide occurred shortly after midnight. His
cellmate, who was asleep on the top bunk, told deputies he did not
hear the man die.</TE>
<TE>   The man complained just hours before his death that heroin
withdrawal was making him suicidal, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The man was given medication to ease withdrawal symptoms and was
examined by the jail's psychiatric staff.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who spanked her daughter with a belt more than a dozen times
because she believed the girl had stolen money from a wallet at
school was found guilty of a misdemeanor child abuse charge.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Alexis Fasteau told jurors that Ora Lombard
"lacked the proper regard for the life of her daughter." Deputy
Public Defender Greg Sloan, however, told jurors that his client had
simply made an unintentional mistake.</LD>
<LD>   Lombard used the belt in January 2001, leaving red welts on the
9-year-old girl's arm and face.</LD>
<TE>   Lombard's daughter testified that her mother had struck her on the
arm and face with the belt accidentally while she was twisting and
turning to avoid being spanked on the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   The girl also testified that she cried before and during the
spanking, which Fasteau told jurors "reflected the girl's mental
suffering."</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Reaches Settlement in False-Arrest Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has reached a $125,000
settlement with a Westlake Village businessman who filed a
false-arrest suit after he was jailed on suspicion of attempting to
kill his ex-wife.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Mannheimer, 59, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after his
arrest in September 1999 in connection with the near-fatal beating of
his former spouse, Linda Morrisset. Mannheimer was jailed for four
days but released after prosecutors declined to file criminal
charges.</LD>
<LD>   In his lawsuit, Mannheimer alleged deputies had violated his civil
rights by arresting him even though he had an alibi on the night
Morrisset, 50, was bludgeoned in her home near Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood and later identified her
ex-husband as the attacker. Although the investigation remains open,
no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer's lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial this spring in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. But lawyers reached a tentative
settlement after negotiations with a federal magistrate overseeing
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the
agreement, which is expected to receive final court approval next
month.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a case that had very explosive aspects for both sides,
and I think it represents a real compromise," said Pasadena attorney
John Burton, who represented Mannheimer.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the agreement, $40,000 of the settlement money must
be used to purchase annuities for Maxx Mannheimer, the 11-year-old
son of Lee Mannheimer and Linda Morrisset.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the false arrest claims, Mannheimer alleged
detectives had maliciously launched a child-welfare investigation
that resulted in his son being removed from his custody for more than
three months, causing emotional trauma for both.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said Maxx will not receive the settlement money--expected
to be used as a college fund--until after he turns 18.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard attorney Alan Wisotsky, who defended the Sheriff's
Department in the case, also called the settlement a fair compromise.
He said the lawsuit involved several issues, and said Mannheimer had
a strong claim on at least one.</TE>
<TE>   While in custody Mannheimer was rearrested after two days behind
bars. Suspects are supposed to be released after 48 hours if no
charges are filed. The department has since stopped its practice of
in-custody rearrests.</TE>
<TE>   "We have since come to learn that while a number of agencies
across the state had practiced the same approach, there were problems
with it," Wisotsky said. "He was likely entitled to compensation for
that."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other litigation stemming from the assault continues.
Five months after Mannheimer sued the Sheriff's Department in federal
court, he brought a defamation suit against Morrisset in Ventura
County Superior Court for accusing him of the assault, even though
charges had not been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset counter-sued Mannheimer, alleging assault, battery,
trespassing and other claims. She is seeking unspecified damages to
pay for medical bills, nursing care and emotional distress. The two
cases have been consolidated and are set for a jury trial on May 20.</TE>

<HD>Wild Chase Ends in Shots, Death</HD>
<DH>Pursuit: Steps from an elementary school, Santa Ana police
kill a man suspected of car theft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a harrowing start to a school day, Santa Ana police shot and
killed a suspected car thief Thursday just doors away from
1,000-student Jefferson Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting ended a 10-minute, high-speed car chase over city
streets during which frightened parents and other motorists veered
from the path of the fleeing suspect and pursuing police.</LD>
<LD>   School officials locked down Jefferson Elementary on Adams Street
after the shooting, rushing children who were eating breakfast from
the cafeteria into the library. Students being dropped off were put
onto buses, Principal Pamela Mayle said.</LD>
<TE>   Only the suspect was injured in the incident, which ended just
before 8 a.m. with police gunfire that raked the stolen black Chevy
Suburban. One bullet also struck a nearby house but caused no injury.
The suspect, Ubaldo Figueroa Jr., 20, of Compton, died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   No weapon was found, but police said Figueroa rammed police cars
during and at the end of the pursuit, and they feared that his escape
posed a significant threat.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that he rammed into our officers indicated that the
suspect didn't want to be arrested or end peacefully," Santa Ana
Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Arellano was walking her son to school when the Suburban,
tires screeching, pulled onto Spruce Street. She ran into a
relative's home nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so scared," Arellano said. "I thought he was going to hit
me."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the chase began about 7:45 a.m. when an unidentified
man left a Santa Ana house and saw someone driving off in his
late-model black Suburban, which he had left running in the driveway.
The man hopped into a second car and chased the stolen vehicle,
calling police on a cell phone as he drove.</TE>
<TE>   Officers joined in, and Figueroa led them over three miles of
Santa Ana streets before he entered the neighborhood surrounding Carl
Thornton Park on West Segerstrom Avenue, near Bristol Avenue. He
stopped several times during the chase and reversed, ramming his
pursuers' cars, including one driven by the man who owned the
Suburban, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa eventually turned onto Hemlock, a short street of older
single-story stucco homes, and drove onto Rita Street, a cul-de-sac.
He quickly turned around and raced back out to Hemlock, then turned
onto Spruce, another dead-end, police said.</TE>
<TE>   He got part way down the short street before stopping, then
backing into a pursuing police car. Turning around, he hit at least
one more police vehicle and a civilian car before officers fired at
least 17 rounds, shooting through the Suburban's windshield, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Myrna Garcia, 33, was caught up in the chase. As she drove her
daughter to school, the Suburban roared up behind her, police cars in
close pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so close to me, I thought he was going to hit me," Garcia
said. "I decided to make a turn to get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Moses, who lives near the shooting scene, said he heard sirens
outside his house and went to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "He was trapped in a dead-end street," Moses said. "When he tried
to leave, there were three police cars capping off the end of the
street.... They did not fire until he started to position his car to
go over a curb to get away from them."</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Luna lives next to Jefferson Elementary with his sister,
her husband, and their three children. The children were preparing
for school when he heard a helicopter overhead, and gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Luna said he was in his bedroom and the children were in the
dining room. Family members ducked to the floor until the shooting
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God, no one in my family got hurt," Luna said. "Everyone is
safe."</TE>
<TE>   Concepcion Araiza was walking her daughter, Raquel, 8, to school,

<HD>Culver City Sued Over Law That Bans Signs</HD>
<DH>Court: Resident says she has constitutional right to put
political posters on public property, but municipal officials say
they cause visual clutter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Culver City woman is suing her city government for the right to
post signs on public property advertising the upcoming municipal
election.</LD>
<LD>   Lynne Davidson, 48, spent $3,500 of her own money on 220 signs
urging her neighbors to "Vote for a Change." She said
"embarrassingly" low voter turnouts of 20% for the city's April
elections, particularly during years with a March primary, prompted
her to try to increase awareness.</LD>
<LD>   "If you're not a high-propensity voter, you're not going to get
the [campaign] letter from the candidate. You're not going to see the
local newspaper with information about the election," she said.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought if I did a little work," things would change, Davidson
said. The signs only urge people to vote and do not endorse a
candidate or party.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials objected to the posters, which Davidson paid an
advertising company to mount on light posts along major streets. A
Culver City ordinance prohibits signs from being posted in the public
right of way, regardless of their content. Stephen Rohde, Davidson's
lawyer, called city enforcement of the law "highly subjective and
discriminatory."</TE>
<TE>   Rohde sent a letter to the city attorney on March 13 listing 20
different political, commercial and public service signs that were
posted in the public right of way for long periods of time. After
city workers and police removed her signs on two occasions, Davidson
chose to sue in federal court to defend what she says is her
constitutional right to post a political sign on public property.</TE>
<TE>   Rohde filed suit Wednesday in hopes of securing a temporary
restraining order against any further sign removal. Rohde and
Davidson are seeking a preliminary injunction that would let the
signs stay up at least until the election on April 9.</TE>
<TE>   The city counters that a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision, City of
Los Angeles vs. Vincent, upholds a city's right to avoid visual
clutter by banning signs.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Carol Schwab said public works employees usually remove
signs after a complaint is made.</TE>
<TE>   These ordinances do more than just protect the aesthetic feel of
the community, officials say. Sign posters sometimes damage city
property by affixing the signs with metal grommets and duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City is investigating ways to assess a per-sign removal fee
when signs are posted illegally, Schwab said. But it's often
impossible to track down the people responsible for posting the most
common signs--those that advertise ways to lose weight or work at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, such as Carlsbad, allow political signs for a 40-day
campaign season, said Ed Davidson, Carlsbad code inspector. Signs can
be staked only in landscape areas along sidewalks--not attached to
light posts or staked in medians, where they could interfere with
drivers' field of vision. Candidates are also required to leave a
deposit to ensure that the posters will be removed in a timely
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City does not prohibit signs posted on residential
property.</TE>
<TE>   But Davidson had fewer than 10 signs placed on lawns, she said,
because the majority of the city's residents live in apartments or
condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   The concern about illegally posted signs in Culver City has been
dramatically illustrated at several City Council meetings in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman David Hauptman has made the issue a personal crusade,
bringing in fistfuls of fliers he has removed from area poles.</TE>
<TE>   He leaves what he has named the "Hauptman Hook" in his pickup, so
he can pull over and remove any offending signs he encounters while
driving.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a blight," he said, likening illegal signs in a city to
slapping a sticker on the "Mona Lisa."</TE>
<TE>   But Davidson has a different opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think political signs are gorgeous," she said. "They're a real
sign of an active democracy."</TE>

<HD>A Lesson on Thinking Things Through</HD>
<DH>Weary of nonsensical arguments and petty biases, a Los
Angeles judge writes a book about critical thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers who don't read one new how-to book before entering the
courtroom of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr.
could end up asking themselves why they didn't think to.</LD>
<LD>   That's because McCoy is the author of a new primer on critical
thinking, called "Why Didn't I Think of That?"</LD>
<LD>   His book is meant to teach the importance of thinking ahead and
thinking things through--in other words, how to think perceptively
and deliberately while systematically controlling the quality of
thought.</LD>
<TE>   If you think that sounds difficult, think again.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing a little imagination with personal intuition and enough
empathy to understand what others are feeling can help anyone learn
to anticipate the unexpected, McCoy says.</TE>
<TE>   Careful thought is usually required in his courtroom at the
Central Civil West courthouse on Commonwealth Avenue in the McArthur
Park area. McCoy is one of seven judges assigned to its two-year-old
"complex litigation program"--where the Los Angeles court system's
thorniest and most convoluted civil cases end up.</TE>
<TE>   Last year McCoy presided over the nation's largest tobacco lawsuit
trial, in which a jury ordered cigarette maker Philip Morris to pay a
cancer victim $3 billion in damages. McCoy later reduced he award to
$100 million, still a record. But plaintiff Richard Boeken of Topanga
Canyon died earlier this year at age 57 before he saw any cash.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy's other cases have included lawsuits involving the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's subway construction and last
year's state energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old McCoy was appointed to the bench in 1992 by
then-Gov. Pete Wilson. He had spent 18 years before that as a lawyer
specializing in securities and antitrust litigation.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy, a 6-foot-2-inch ex-Marine, says his book was prompted by
his experiences as a rookie judge. "Sometimes I made my decisions too
quickly and sometimes, I'm embarrassed to say, I allowed my own
personal biases to shape my view of the particular case before I knew
everything about the case," McCoy acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   In those early days he would listen to arguments and think he had
the right decision in mind. "But then very late in the case I'd
discover some fact that, had I kept my mind open long enough, would
have kept me from ever jumping in the wrong direction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That prompted me to think about my thinking ... thinking is like
making a product. You need to think about thinking while you're
thinking in order to maintain the quality of that process."</TE>
<TE>   Office Filled With Important Reminders</TE>
<TE>   McCoy's chambers are filled with subtle reminders to avoid making
snap decisions, to stay focused, to think systematically.</TE>
<TE>   A strip of red masking tape stuck above the doorway leading into
his courtroom calls out to him to "stop and think before you walk out
there," he said. "It says, 'If you're not ready to be fair, stop
where you are.'"</TE>
<TE>   A hunk of charred wood that McCoy plucked from a still-smoldering
Koreatown storefront during the 1992 Los Angeles riots sits on his
windowsill. "I keep it to remind myself the only thing that stands
between us and chaos is the ability to be a just society," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A framed portrait of Winston Churchill hangs over his desk.
Britain's prime minister during World War II is McCoy's personal
hero--and a recurring subject in his book.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill's ability to think through the consequences of his
options as he dealt with the threat of Adolf Hitler in 1940 is cited
as an example of factoring the past, present and future into
decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Vignettes involving such historical figures as Mt. Everest
conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary, physicist Albert Einstein and
automotive pioneer Henry Ford are also sprinkled throughout the book.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the cases that echo the circumstances of those in
McCoy's own courtroom that bring the book to life. However, he
acknowledges that he has shielded the true identity of litigants in
those cases by fictionalizing them. "They are constructs," he
explained.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise missing are references to celebrities who frequently pop
up in front of McCoy. Litigants have included the bands Guns N' Roses
and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, actress Jenny McCarthy, boxer Mike
Tyson and rapper Ice Cube.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't tempted to drop any celebrity names. I wanted to talk
about things that ordinary people can experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of us, individually and collectively as a society,
need to do a better job of thinking. Turn on the television and watch
the talking heads. People are impressed with rhetoric. They tend to
evaluate people on how good an argument they make rather than, 'Well,
is that a true argument? Is this the truth? Does this make sense?'</TE>
<TE>   "As the world we live in gets more complicated and the
communication system gets better and we're more aware of what's going
on everywhere, we all must become better thinkers."</TE>
<TE>   Each chapter in the book, published by Prentice Hall Press, is
illustrated with exercises that challenge readers to find hidden
blind spots and loopholes in their logic. It's a format that
McCoy--who teaches law part time at Pepperdine University and
Southwestern Law School--feels will appeal to a wide range of
readers.</TE>
<TE>   Although he wishes some lawyers who appear before him would read
it and take its lessons to heart ("Sometimes nobody wants to get to
the key issue--they want to fight for years on peripheral issues," he
shrugs). McCoy doesn't talk about his book in court.</TE>
<TE>   And most attorneys involved in his cases are apparently unaware
what their judge has thought up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get that much free reading time, but I'd probably read
that one," said Kory Booth, a Woodland Hills lawyer frequently
involved in "complex litigation" cases.</TE>
<TE>   "As an attorney it always helps to know how your judge is
thinking--or that he's hopefully doing some thinking."</TE>

<HD>Tribe Impoverished by Salton Sea Gets Windfall</HD>
<DH>Reparations: The Torres-Martinez Indians get $14 million
for flooding in 1905.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It could be argued that the tattered band of Torres-Martinez Indians
living on a dusty pocket in the Coachella Valley has been the
unluckiest of the state's 100 Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   Of their 22,000 acres of reservation land, half lies beneath the
Salton Sea, created by a Colorado River flooding accident in 1905.</LD>
<LD>   And unlike neighboring tribes, which have made the most of their
tribal lands with flourishing casinos, the Torres-Martinez Indians
have been unable to come up with a gambling center because of a lack
of funds and their location, tucked deep into the desert community of
Thermal.</LD>
<TE>   Poverty has plagued the tribe, considered one of the poorest in
the state. But the tribe's luck is poised for a dramatic upswing.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is the end of many years of struggle," said Tribal
Chairwoman Mary Belardo, moments after accepting more than $3 million
of a $14-million settlement check from the federal government and the
water districts. "The fruits of all our suffering is about to come to
bear."</TE>
<TE>   In a celebration Thursday that included a visit from Rep. Mary
Bono (R-Palm Springs) and Interior Secretary Gail Norton, tribal
elders said they hoped that years of devastating economic hardships
will finally come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the key that will lift us out of poverty," said the
tribe's 67-year-old spiritual leader, Ernie Morreo. "All my life
people have been talking about this, but I never thought the day
would actually ever come."</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years of litigation against the U.S. government and area
water districts, the tribe finally won the right to buy more than
11,000 acres of desert land and 640 acres near Interstate 10, prime
location for a new casino. That's in addition to the cash, $10
million of which will come from the federal government and $4 million
from area water districts.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is an attempt to right the 96-year-old wrong
created when the swollen Colorado River overtook feeble dikes near
Yuma, Ariz. The river swept into the Salton Basin, flooding numerous
Torres-Martinez communities. In the wake of the flooding, exacerbated
by runoff from nearby farms, California had a new lake, the Salton
Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe has been seeking reparations for their lost land for
more than a decade. The late Rep. Sonny Bono (R-Palm Springs) first
took up the fight in 1996. But his bill didn't make it past the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Mary Bono, then took on the cause and introduced the
Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement Act in June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   She said it was Belardo's passion that moved her to get involved.
That, and the tribal leader's vivid descriptions of the incredible
poverty her tribe endured. During visits with Bono, Belardo even
flashed pictures of the makeshift homes of many of the 250 tribal
members--portable HUD trailers that did little to shield them from
the desert's 120-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   Many lived without running water or electricity. And the school
was so underfunded that the children rarely were given homework, with
teachers afraid to allow the school's few textbooks to leave the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I am hopeful that in the next few years, all of that will be
behind [the tribe]," Bono said. "This opens the door for so many new
opportunities and I'm just happy to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   The underpinning of the tribe's plan for economic development
includes a casino, built on newly acquired land near Interstate 10.
But Gov. Gray Davis has to sign off on the idea. Bono is hopeful that
Davis will not stand in the tribe's way, although the new casino
would be the only one in the country not technically on reservation
land.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other tribe here has a right to build a casino," Bono said.
"If it is the cornerstone of economic development for these tribes,
let it be."</TE>
<TE>   Tribal members, however, are not pinning their hopes only on the
casino. There are plans to build a truck stop along California 86.
They also hope to build a massive electric power plant that could
generate up to $1 million annually to the band.</TE>
<TE>   Tribe members hope to build new houses, complete with
air-conditioning. They want to invest money in the school system. And
they want to start investments that will mimic the success of the
neighboring Cabazon Indians, who run the successful Fantasy Springs
Casino just off Interstate 10 in Indio.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we celebrate victory," Norton said at Thursday's ceremony.
"We've all heard the phrase, 'The check is in the mail.' Well today,
we've seen the check delivered--today we end nearly 100 years of
inequity."</TE>

<TE>   "I certainly think it's fine art," Sloan said. "This may be
garbage, but I'm doing something creditably within the world of fine
arts."</TE>
<TE>   Staff members and the school's 1,300 students contribute the
artist's supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell who's dieting around here and who's not," said Sloan,
47. "Fortunately for me, my contributors aren't too hung up on
dieting."</TE>
<TE>   Sloan stumbled onto his art form three years ago after salvaging
some classroom windows from Deihl Hall, the college's modern
languages building. The 75-year-old wooden sashes were being replaced
with aluminum window frames.</TE>
<TE>   He decided to use the old windows as art frames. But what would
they enclose?</TE>
<TE>   One day Sloan noticed the repetitive pattern of the colorful
packaging on a stack of supermarket cereal boxes. The look reminded
him of work done by Tony Cragg, a British artist whom Sloan admires.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan rummaged through the trash at his Brea home and began
experimenting with empty food packages. "I'm a big consumer of
packaged goods," he acknowledged. "I do little food preparation from
scratch."</TE>
<TE>   He tried soaking the discarded cardboard and then mushing it into
pulp that could squeezed into a mold. That didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Then he tried folding the wet cardboard into long strips. To his
delight, he discovered they held their shape when allowed to dry
while being compressed. When the strips were arranged in rows and
layers, they created intriguing shapes and colors.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan devised an inch-wide, three-foot-deep plywood form that
allowed him to quickly squeeze wet food boxes into accordion-like
strips. Soon, he was mass-producing them.</TE>
<TE>   The strips are weighted down with concrete blocks when they are
removed from the form and placed on a table to dry. Then each row of
strips is glued to plywood backing before being placed in a window
frame. A coating of roofing tar applied to the surface of the window
frame completes the artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of empty food boxes are required for each of Sloan's
pieces, which he assembles in a workspace beneath the wooden
bleachers in the college's former gymnasium--a 1925 structure that
now houses the school's art department. That means he has to make
frequent campus appeals for more empty food packages.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder a large crowd of curious students and staff members
turned out when Sloan's artwork made its debut last month at the
Brewery, an artists colony and collection of galleries in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like looking through a window into someone's life," said
Paul Kjellberg, a Whittier College philosophy professor who lives in
Hacienda Heights and viewed Sloan's work at the show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was meticulously done. All of us could see some of our own
garbage reflected in the art. I was responsible for a lot of the
six-packs in there," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan, when pressed, offers a scholarly appraisal of the
empty-package art. "Materials, organization and metaphor converge in
my work.... I deliberately avoid self-conscious adherence to guiding
principles and influences, except, perhaps, a precious few notions,
specifically the recognition that pattern can be powerful and that
waste is to be avoided."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, trash is turned into treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan has not put any of his food-box works on sale. When he does,
he laughs, "I won't settle for anything less than the minimum wage:
$5.75 an hour. And these things are really time-intensive. They take
about 150 hours per piece."</TE>
<TE>   Cakmakli, a junior international relations student, hinted that
she might someday be in the market for Sloan's art as she picked out
packaging that once held Lean Cuisine, Diet Coke, Quaker Oats Toasty
Oatmeal Squares and other popular food brands.</TE>
<TE>   It would go nicely, she said, "maybe in my dining room."</TE>

<LD>City officials said they will seek an injunction in federal court to
block the sale of Verizon's Americast cable system to cable giant
Adelphia.</LD>
<LD>   They have argued that the sale would unfairly end local
competition and hurt cable subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   The city was to argue for the injunction in Ventura County
Superior Court on Thursday, but Adelphia blocked that effort, filing
a motion to force the argument to be heard in a federal court.</LD>

<HD>Pool Ballot Measure Loss Unchanged by Recount</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A ballot measure that would have generated money to maintain a
proposed public swimming pool in Fillmore failed by 46 votes,
according to a recount completed Thursday by Ventura County elections
officials.</LD>
<LD>   About 65.7% of those who voted March 5 were in favor of Measure Q,
which would have taxed property owners up to $15 a year. Tax measures
in California require a two-thirds approval. Because the margin was
so thin, city officials asked for the recount, which cost $500, said
Mayor Don Gunderson. No votes were gained or lost in the new count,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The tax was key to a deal between the city and Fillmore Unified
School District to replace the current pool at the high school, which
was shut more than a year ago for health and safety reasons.</LD>

<HD>Backyard Gardeners Going Native</HD>
<DH>Horticulture: Sun Valley's Theodore Payne Foundation
encourages the planting of indigenous species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time of year, when many Southern Californians come to realize
their near-perfect climate is actually challenging for backyard
gardeners, they often turn to the Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun
Valley, which is dedicated to the propagation of native species.</LD>
<LD>   At the foundation Wednesday, Sharon Emanuelli lifted pots of young
plants from a red wagon and into the back of her car.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm doing some planting on my Nichols Canyon hillside, and I
wanted natives and native-friendly things," said Emanuelli, who lives
on five-eighths of an acre in the Hollywood Hills.</LD>
<TE>   She found a wagon full of colorful species, including dark pink
monkey flower, blue and violet lupine and a bigberry manzanita, a
treelike shrub that bears little white or pink flowers. Later, she
plans to spray wildflower seed mixed with water onto her hillside.
"It's much better than ivy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to find the native plants she wanted at commercial
nurseries, Emanuelli bumped up the dirt road from Tuxford Street to
the Payne Foundation. "I like what they do here. I like it a lot,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Using native plants will slash her water bills, she said. "And
it's nice to have butterflies and birds" attracted by the indigenous
flora.</TE>
<TE>   The organization receives about 100 visitors a week, said Louise
Gonzalez, one of two nursery managers. People visit the 21-acre site
to buy water-sparing plants or seed and to find the best plants to
feed their desert tortoises. Some want the experts to identify
mystery plants that have taken up residence in their yards.</TE>
<TE>   And some just want to see the bright California poppies now
blooming in Sun Valley, as drought has made them scarce in Antelope
Valley and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Time, Great Outdoors Motivate Customers</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to be good to the Earth is only one motive for seeking out
low-maintenance plants, Gonzalez said. "People are very busy and
don't have time to take care of a garden," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nursery manager James Brumder said visitors often arrive at the
foundation after an inspiring backpacking trip or other wilderness
experience: "They go on a hike and come here and say, 'I saw this
plant. It was so beautiful. What was it?'"</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1960, the foundation furthers the work of Theodore
Payne, a horticulturalist born in England in 1872 who was bewitched
by California flora when he settled in the state as a young man.</TE>
<TE>   Payne, who lived in Los Angeles most of his life, believed native
plants needed to be saved from encroaching civilization and that they
belonged in local gardens. He preached his grow-native gospel
throughout the state, created model gardens and made more than 400
native species accessible to home gardeners before his death in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he was like Johnny Appleseed," said Frances Liau of
Pasadena, a member of the Payne Foundation board.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation received an endowment of $100,000 last year, and
the board hopes to increase its endowment to $1 million next year,
Liau said. "The long-term hope is to upgrade the facility," Liau said
of the foundation's visitor center.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation maintains a wildflower hotline that people can call
to find out where wildflowers are blooming in Southern California.
Its annual Poppy Day, scheduled for April 13, will include a workshop
on gardening in small spaces and a tour of the solar house and garden
of board member Ellen Mackey. Until the endowment grows, plant sales
keep the foundation afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the plants are propagated and tended in open-air
structures that climb the hill behind the office. Visitors can buy
such rarities as a California lilac, previously found only on a small
stretch of coast beneath Hearst Castle in San Simeon.</TE>
<TE>   Re-Creating Natural Conditions Tricky</TE>
<TE>   Payne Foundation staff and volunteers are masters of the green
arts--attuned to the subtle needs of their native charges.</TE>
<TE>   Laima Harmon, the foundation's seed-room supervisor, said that
coaxing native plant seeds into germinating may require much
different treatment than that of commercially cultivated species.
"Basically, you're trying to copy the things that happen in nature,"
Harmon said.</TE>
<TE>   Take the yellow bush poppy. Because it sprouts in nature after
wildfires that eliminate competing plants, the seed must be burned.
"It's not clear whether the seed is responding to heat, to smoke or
to chemicals in the ash," Harmon said. "It may be a combination."</TE>
<TE>   Some seeds--such as those of California lilacs, which are not
really lilacs at all--need several months of wet and cold.
"Basically, you're mimicking our winter," Harmon said.</TE>
<TE>   And some seeds require desperate measures. "Lupines are notorious
for having seed that stays dormant for decades," she said. Sometimes
the only way to get the seed to sprout is to cut it with a knife, a
process called scarification.</TE>

<LD>Losing to the Golden State Warriors, a bottom feeder in the NBA, can
prompt a violent reaction.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press expressed his disgust
after the Timberwolves, at home, had lost to the Warriors Tuesday
night, 115-109.</LD>
<LD>   "Just a few blocks from Target Center is a garbage incinerator,"
Sansevere wrote. "That's not what stinks in the neighborhood, though.
It's the Timberwolves. They reek.</LD>
<TE>   "The Wolves' next promotion shouldn't be another bobblehead
giveaway. They should provide fans with something they really need,
like nose clips."</TE>
<TE>   Bob, baby, it's only one game out of 82.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the men's Final Four single-game
record for shooting percentage?</TE>
<TE>   Incentive? Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "One of
the proud advertisers on the center-field scoreboard at Pacific Bell
Park, along with the Chronicle, of course, is that well-known energy
firm, Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait till Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent hear about the club's new
promotion: Hit the Enron sign, lose your 401(k)."</TE>
<TE>   Anything else? Tom Sorensen of the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, on
New Orleans' "desperation" to get the Hornets there: "If [NBA
Commissioner] David Stern announced that New Orleans had to hose down
Bourbon Street once a day instead of once a month, practice voodoo
only on weekends and make the Mississippi River flow the other way,
the mayor-elect would appoint a blue ribbon committee to look into
it."</TE>
<TE>   Positive spin: Dennis Eckersley, former Oakland Athletic pitcher,
estimates he has seen the tape of the dramatic Kirk Gibson home run
hit off him in the 1988 World Series "about a thousand times."</TE>
<TE>   He says, "Just for the heck of it, I watched the whole game the
other night on ESPN Classic."</TE>
<TE>   What struck him the most about it?</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get over how young I looked."</TE>
<TE>   Challenged: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Cincinnati
basketball Coach Bob Huggins decides to stay put, saying, 'We still
have much to do here.' Yeah, Bob, like graduate somebody."</TE>
<TE>   More Greene: "About the Tyson-Lewis fight, you can sit ringside
for a cost ranging from $2,500 to $10,000--but being seen in those
cheesy $2,500 seats will be an embarrassment."</TE>
<TE>   Extroverted: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Now
Charles Barkley says his race-card zings at the Masters were just a
trick to make people pay attention to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Exposed by himself as a half-cocked loose cannon, Barkley will
never again be taken seriously. Tragically, the only career options
left open to him are TV and politics."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Villanova, 22 of 28 field goals, 78.6%, against
Georgetown in the championship game in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A new stamp honoring the Norwegian Soccer
Federation's 100th anniversary has forced the Norwegian postal
service to launch an international manhunt.</TE>
<TE>   The 1.3 million stamps have a picture of a soccer referee in
action, but it's the wrong one, and the postal service has no idea
whose likeness it is.</TE>

<HD>NFL to Get Early Start With Thursday Game</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new-look NFL will start its season with a Thursday night game for
the first time and end its opening weekend with a Monday night
appearance by the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.</LD>
<LD>   The 256-game schedule released Thursday includes a Sept. 5 game
with the San Francisco 49ers playing at the New York Giants. The
Thursday night opener will be shown on ESPN.</LD>
<LD>   With the addition of an expansion team in Houston, the league has
realigned into eight divisions of four teams each. After the
49er-Giant opener, the expansion Houston Texans open their season on
Sunday night in their new stadium against the Dallas Cowboys, one of
14 games that day.</LD>
<TE>   The first weekend ends with the Patriots opening their new stadium
against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night. That will be the
first of four prime-time appearances for the Patriots. They play in
Oakland on Sunday night, Nov. 17, at Tennessee on Monday night, Dec.
16 and at home against the New York Jets on Sunday night, Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   There had been some sentiment for leaving ABC's Monday night late
season schedule flexible so that more attractive games could be
moved, but that plan was dismissed when CBS and Fox networks
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Complete NFL schedule on D15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Renaldo Wynn, who can play tackle or end, signed a six-year, $21
million contract with a signing bonus of more than $3.5 million with
the Washington Redskins, agent Peter Schaffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn, 27, played five years for Jacksonville and started all 16
games at end before his contract was voided last month as the Jaguars
sought to get under the salary cap before the March 1 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars saved about $6 million in the move.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Bryan Cox signed a one-year contract with the New
Orleans Saints after spending last season with the Patriots....
Former USC standout quarterback Rodney Peete signed with the Carolina
Panthers for one year and $800,000 and probably will play as a backup
and tutor to starter Chris Weinke. Peete was a backup the last two
seasons in Oakland. The Panthers also signed signed free-agent
defensive tackle Shane Burton, who had a career-high 65 tackles for
the New York Jets last season, to a reported three-year, $2.1 million
contract. Defensive end Lance Johnston re-signed with the Minnesota
Vikings, agreeing to a one-year contract for the league-minimum of
$525,000.... Cincinnati Bengal defensive end Reinard Wilson agreed to
a three-year contract.... Chris Sanders, the wide receiver who missed
Tennessee's last 12 games last season because of a back injury,
agreed to a one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns.... The
Philadelphia Eagles re-signed restricted free-agent guard Doug
Brzezinski and center Hank Fraley to one-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Former NFL star Dexter Manley was sentenced to two years in jail
for evidence tampering after he was convicted of swallowing cocaine
during a drug bust and failed to show for a court-ordered meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Manley could have received as little as probation. His possible
state jail term ranged from six months to two years. He received the
maximum.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad received probation
after pleading guilty to weapon and drug charges from a traffic stop
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Richard Brown gave Muhammad a 30-day suspended sentence as
well 12 months of unsupervised probation.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Justin Fargas, competing for the USC tailback spot in spring
practice, was scheduled to be reexamined after suffering what
appeared to be a minor knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas went down after being hit by two tacklers and remained on
the field, surrounded by trainers, for several minutes. He watched
from the sideline the rest of the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a little scared but it feels like it should be fine," he
said.</TE>

<AU>FAWAZ A. GERGES</AU>
<BD>Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of Middle East studies and
international affairs at Sarah Lawrence College, is author of the
forthcoming "The Islamists and the West" (Cambridge University
Press).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The suicide bombing that killed at least 20 Israelis celebrating
Passover reflects the dramatic changes that have occurred in
Palestinian society since the outbreak of the intifada 18 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Even though Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Thursday that he
was ready to implement an unconditional cease-fire, his ability and
willingness to enforce one is almost nonexistent.</LD>
<LD>   The armed intifada has brought about an internal political
realignment undermining Arafat and strengthening those who favor
continuing attacks against Israel. Never before has Palestinian
society been as militarized and radicalized, thanks to a deepening
sense of powerlessness and loss.</LD>
<TE>   A new and strong consensus has emerged among Palestinians that the
attacks are making the occupation too costly for Israel to endure
indefinitely. They believe that they have created a balance of terror
with their powerful enemy, using suicide bombings to counter Israel's
military strength. In the eyes of the Palestinians, this balance is
the key to forcing Israel to agree to the creation of a viable
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Old rivals, such as Hamas and Arafat's own Fatah faction, Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigades, which mistrusted one another and vied for
influence, now agree that Washington's cease-fire efforts only
undermine Palestinian national aspirations and consolidate Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's hard-line position.</TE>
<TE>   They insist that armed struggle and terrorism are the most
effective means to force Israel to withdraw from the occupied
Palestinian territories and remove the settlements.</TE>
<TE>   This new realignment of political forces, ushering in tactical
coordination between the Islamists and secularists, has put Arafat
and his security lieutenants on the defensive and has made it
virtually impossible to enforce any cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials reportedly are angry and disappointed with
U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni's emphasis on security issues and
his neglect of politics. As one official involved with the
negotiations said, all Zinni's proposal does "is to stop the
violence. It doesn't do anything about our interest in addressing the
root causes."</TE>
<TE>   Given the lack of a clear political horizon, Arafat is unlikely to
take concrete steps to implement the plan drawn up by CIA Director
George J. Tenet to enforce a cease-fire. It is not in his interest to
do so. In the face of overwhelming military and diplomatic pressure,
Arafat may promise, with little prospect of success, to crack down on
violence.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Arafat recognizes the inherent dangers in trying to
disarm young, hardened fighters with no tangible political
concessions. He is averse to risking popular rage and even civil war
at home and being further sidelined by Sharon. The latter's
actions--branding Arafat irrelevant, confining him to Ramallah and
invading Palestinian territories--have backfired and have compounded
Israel's security dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being beaten into political acquiescence, the
Palestinians have improved their combat techniques and become more
experienced and daring. No degree of American and Israeli diplomatic
pressure will persuade Palestinian activists to stop their attacks. A
cease-fire unaccompanied by substantive peace negotiations either
will not hold or will be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is how to address Israeli security concerns while
bringing political questions into the negotiations giving the
Palestinians a stake in the future. In this context, Washington's
narrowing of the Zinni mandate to deal solely with security issues
does not augur well for an immediate cessation of hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League's unanimous adoption this week of the Saudi peace
initiative might provide a way out, but only if the U.S. gets more
actively engaged in pushing the protagonists toward a real
settlement. The critical question is: How can the U.S. translate this
sweeping initiative into hard currency?</TE>
<TE>   One would hope that the administration sustains its involvement in
the Palestinian-Israeli track by focusing not just on security but
also on political questions regarding the broad contours of a
settlement. This broader focus holds the key to reassuring the
desperate Palestinians and providing security for the Israelis, thus
putting an end to the bloodshed.</TE>

<HD>Mighty Military Machines Offer Little Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AVIGDOR HASELKORN</AU>
<BD>Avigdor Haselkorn is the author of "The Continuing
Storm: Iraq, Poisonous Weapons and Deterrence" (Yale University
Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What has taken place Sept. 11 and since then in the United States and
in Afghanistan and what is unfolding in Israel these days are all
parts of one picture. Its many details signify nothing less than a
shift in the fundamentals of national security.</LD>
<LD>   Events in the U.S. and Israel point to a disconnect between
military power and national security. The traditional view that a
strong military machine would provide security and deter attack on
the homeland is a shambles. The hallowed notion that large defense
outlays and the fielding of the most modern armies would ensure a
nation's survival has been shown to be a fallacy.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli Defense Forces, or IDF, are generally viewed as
without equal in the Middle East. The country's military power is
immense by any standard. Despite this overwhelming military
superiority, the nation faces its gravest challenge since the 1948
War of Independence. All this is a result of a confrontation with an
opponent whose force size is a fraction of the IDF's and whose troops
are lightly armed and poorly trained.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the fact that the IDF's strength has barely been
degraded by the recent fighting has not altered the fact that few in
Israel feel secure. Israelis must be asking themselves what good
these military formations and advanced weaponry are if no city is
safe from daily enemy raids.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the attacks on the United States were not the product of
some high-tech terrorism as Hollywood scriptwriters often prophesied.
To the contrary, the evil ingenuity of Sept. 11 was the simplicity,
even primitiveness, of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   The only weapons the hijackers brought into the U.S. were
themselves. The only infrastructure used was cash. And yet the
results were absolutely devastating. The degree of damage from the
attacks was unprecedented in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, the attacks on the United States and the unfolding
terror war in Israel highlight a fundamental shift in the annals of
military history. Terrorism's main aim is no longer political
theater. Rather, it has become a strategic weapon through which
sub-national outfits aim to destroy regional and even global
superpowers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the United States was targeted precisely because it
symbolizes the apex of Western economic, technological and military
superiority. Israel is another test case.</TE>
<TE>   The mighty have naturally responded by seeking protection behind
their well-oiled military machines. But as in Afghanistan, they could
discover that there is no army to fight, and the number of casualties
inflicted on the enemy cannot even be gauged accurately.</TE>
<TE>   Even a high toll does not necessarily dampen the enemy's quest for
martyrdom. The sense of insecurity at home is only marginally
alleviated by successes on the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   How will this revolution end?</TE>
<TE>   There are two possibilities. One is that, after suffering repeated
atrocities and failures, our value system will change so that modern
armies will be given the go-ahead to use any means to crush the
enemy. Inflicting "collateral damage" would no longer be a taboo.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, like our enemies, to ensure victory we would adopt
a doctrine of total war.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, the gap between military power and national
security would have to be filled by hardening the civilian
population. Defending civilians, which during the Cold War was
tantamount to endangering the stability provided by mutual assured
destruction, is already very much on the agenda, but not only as the
domain of government agencies and security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Israeli government has authorized putting more
licensed handguns on the streets in the hope of citizens being in the
right place at the right time to prevent terror attacks. Accordingly,
the Israeli army will issue handgun permits to 40,000 reserve duty
officers of the rank of captain and above.</TE>
<TE>   How ironic that the American cowboy image could become the best
deterrent against terrorism yet.</TE>

<HD>A Cloud of Sexism Over the Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT S. McELVAINE</AU>
<BD>Robert S. McElvaine is a professor of history at
Millsaps College and the author, most recently, of "Eve's Seed:
Biology, the Sexes and the Course of History" (McGraw-Hill, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J'Accuse. That was the title of a famous protest letter by novelist
Emile Zola, published in 1898.</LD>
<LD>   In it, Zola accused the French military and government and the
Catholic Church of a conspiracy to convict an innocent man, Alfred
Dreyfus, of treason.</LD>
<LD>   It is time, a century later, for a similar public charge to be
made to Pope John Paul II and the Catholic hierarchy about another
conspiracy, one that has gone on longer and with far more widespread
consequences.</LD>
<TE>   As a Catholic, the accusations I make are not directly against the
current pope but against the men who institutionalized Christianity
and so turned it away from some of the most important teachings of
Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul II's mistake has been following their lead.</TE>
<TE>   One of my students states the problem perfectly: "I have
discovered that religion is the worst thing that happened to
Christianity."</TE>
<TE>   This Easter season is an appropriate time to face what some
aspects of organized religion have done to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   The cloud that hangs over our church is the dark shadow of sexism.</TE>
<TE>   The sad and ironic history of the relationship between
Christianity and women has a great deal to do with the current
scandal in what remains an all-male institution.</TE>
<TE>   The sort of revolution that is needed--and the sort I hope is now
brewing--is for the church to go back to its source on matters of the
sexes.</TE>
<TE>   The pope has called for "a wholehearted reawakening of the ideals"
of the priesthood. What is actually needed is a reawakening of the
ideals of Jesus, which were subverted by the early church fathers.</TE>
<TE>   The irony in the continuing attempts to restrict the role of women
in the church is that the whole thrust of the teachings of Jesus was
to adopt more "feminine" values and behaviors: turning the other
cheek, being meek, merciful, peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Chaucer's Wife of Bath may have been onto something when she said,
"Christ was a maid, and yet shaped like a man."</TE>
<TE>   By reinforcing the idea that women are inferior, the
institutionalized church has led men to fear, deny and repress the
very tendencies and qualities that Jesus sought to cultivate.</TE>
<TE>   Women were centrally involved in the birth of Christianity. They
were disciples, prophets, the first to recognize Jesus as the Messiah
and the essential witnesses to the events most basic to Christian
belief: the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   But the men who took control of the Christian Church in the first
few centuries after Jesus did their best to obscure the role of
women.</TE>
<TE>   Although three of the Gospels plainly state that the risen Jesus
first appeared to Mary Magdalene, and women are prominently mentioned
throughout Gospel accounts of the crucifixion and resurrection, St.
Paul's account of the first Easter and its aftermath sounds as if it
took place in a men's club: "He appeared to Peter, then to the 12.
Then he appeared to more than 500 brethren at one time.... Last of
all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me."</TE>
<TE>   Paul simply ignored the women.</TE>
<TE>   The current pope's immediate predecessor attempted to start
correcting nearly 2,000 years of error.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 10, 1978, Pope John Paul I declared that God is a mother
as well as a father. Eighteen days later, he was dead. But John Paul
II should not let that fact deter him from issuing a similar
statement.</TE>
<TE>   This Easter, the pope and his bishops should tell the story of the
first Easter as it was.</TE>
<TE>   They should accept Mary Magdalene as one equal to the apostles and
so remove the contrived reason for barring women from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   And while they're at it, they ought to recognize that birth
control is not a sin; the sin is telling poor people on an
overpopulated planet that birth control is a sin.</TE>
<TE>   This Easter, let's save Christianity from the worst thing that
happened to it.</TE>
<TE>   Let us truly be able to say: "He/She is risen!"</TE>

<HD>Senate Blocks Changes to a Court Gone Amok</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENT SCHEIDEGGER</AU>
<BD>Kent Scheidegger is the legal director of the Criminal
Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has long been an embarrassment.
Now it is becoming dangerous. And the only remedy--new judges--is
being blocked by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, has a history
of strange decisions. More of its decisions are overturned by the
U.S. Supreme Court than any other court, 86% in the past four years.
Recent cases involving violent criminals are more than just legal
error; they are a public menace.</LD>
<LD>   In one case, an FBI agent approached a suspected murderer, but
before he could read the man his rights, the suspect blurted out, "I
have nothing to say; I'm going to get the death penalty anyway." The
9th Circuit ruled that that statement should not have been admitted
at trial because it violated the 5th Amendment, which says no one may
be compelled to be a witness against himself.</LD>
<TE>   This is absurd; decisions such as this stretch the 5th Amendment
far beyond its language and purpose. Although the court affirmed this
conviction based on other, overwhelming evidence of guilt, the
precedent established could put a killer back on the street in a
future case.</TE>
<TE>   It gets worse. In the Andrade decision last November, the 9th
Circuit held that California's three-strikes law was unconstitutional
as applied to a thief with nonviolent prior convictions. That
decision was controversial but within the bounds of reasonable
debate. Then, in February, the same court issued an extension of that
holding. The cases of Earnest Bray Jr. and Richard Napoleon Brown
involved thieves with violent convictions, including armed robbery
and assault with a deadly weapon. The California appellate courts
already had decided that their sentences were not disproportionate in
light of the criminals' violent records. Yet the 9th Circuit declared
that only the most recent offense, not the priors, could be
considered in the proportionality analysis. This holding is clearly
contrary to Supreme Court precedent, which requires consideration of
the whole record in habitual-criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court corrects only a fraction of the court's errors.
So what can we do about it?</TE>
<TE>   With California's state appellate courts, we have retention
elections, a check on a runaway judiciary that we have needed to
invoke only once in seven decades. Regrettably, the framers of the
federal Constitution did not include this check on the federal
courts; removal by impeachment is only for crimes, not for bad
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the appointment process. President Bush could, in
time, bring rationality to the 9th Circuit with a series of carefully
chosen appointments. There is no chance of this court becoming
conservative or even middle of the road in the foreseeable future,
but it could be changed to display common sense.</TE>
<TE>   This necessary correction, however, has met a roadblock in the
Senate Judiciary Committee. Bush's nominations drop into a black
hole. Two nominations to the 9th Circuit have been pending for nearly
a year with no action and no explanation. L.A. County Superior Court
Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl and Honolulu attorney Richard B. Clifton appear
to be well qualified. The committee has had enough time to study
these nominations. It should proceed with hearings and a vote.</TE>
<TE>   The people of the West deserve a better quality of justice.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While I respect Frida Ghitis' intent to protect women's rights
universally, her efforts are erroneously geared toward the Muslim
world ("A Tragic Fire Unveils Saudi Arabia's Misogyny," Commentary,
March 25). Muslim women are proud of their religion and their
countries. Yet for some reason, some women of the West cannot get
over the fact that these women cover their bodies instead of proudly
flaunting their cleavage for the public.</LD>
<LD>   Let us be reminded that the tragedy is the deaths of these young
girls and not who impeded their rescue. Numerous Saudi newspapers
have reported that the initial report about the "tragic" actions of
the religious police was baseless. Yet these ill-intended attempts to
shed negative light upon them has been a frequently used tactic by
opponents of Islamic law.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia's system is just as vulnerable to cases
of poor judgment and abuse of power by authorities as is America's
legal system. The LAPD has often been accused of race-based
mistreatment, but does that lead to reports blaming the Christian
world for human rights abuses?</LD>
<TE>   Just because many American women may not want to live under the
conditions of Saudi Arabia, that does not equate to Saudi Arabian
women being deprived of their human rights.</TE>

<LD>Re "Empty American Promises Embitter an Afghan Village," March 26:
What has happened to the honor of our country? How can a Special
Forces soldier be allowed to make promises of food and goods to
villagers in Afghanistan in return for risking their lives to fight
for us, then proceed to flatten their villages with bombs--and now we
turn our backs. How can this behavior, according to our military
experts, be not only condoned but encouraged? For shame!</LD>

<HD>U.S. Constitution Does Not Take Sides</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A March 20 letter states that "the U.S. Constitution focuses its
power on protecting the rights and beliefs of the minority."
Unfortunately, this couldn't be more wrong. That so many believe the
Constitution is a document which grants rights and privileges to
special groups or minorities is a point of view that continues to
gain support regardless of its divisiveness.</LD>
<LD>   The Constitution is a document that tells the government, in no
uncertain terms, how to behave. The founders understood that any
government, regardless of how benign, craves more and more power over
the governed. Consequently, the concept of inalienable rights. Rights
that may not be infringed upon for whatever reason by any group.
Assigning the document as a protector of the few prostitutes the
ideal of liberty and inalienable rights by setting one group against
the other.</LD>

<HD>Passover Massacre and Peace Summit</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Attack in Israel Kills 19, Hurts 100," March 28: The Israeli
response to the Passover massacre (which really should have been
Israel's response to the many previous massacres of innocent
civilians) should be the exact same response the United States had
when our innocent civilians were murdered on Sept. 11--bomb the
terrorists from the air and keep bombing. If bombing terrorists is
right for America, it is right for Israel. The Palestinian people can
thank Yasser Arafat and his Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and all the
other terrorist organizations for the awful (but self-made) situation
they are now in!</LD>
<LD>   There was no peace in 1967 when Israel had the borders the Arabs
are demanding today; why would there be peace now?</LD>

<TE>   In the wake of the Passover massacre in Netanya by a Palestinian
terrorist and the failed Arab League summit in Beirut, two things
have become clear during the last 24 hours. First, the terrorist den
known as the Palestinian Authority is no authority at all, but simply
a failed experiment that Israel should end immediately and
unilaterally on behalf of the civilized world. Second, the group of
tin-horn dictators who rule the Arab world can't even maintain
"normal relations" with one another.</TE>
<TE>   How can Israel or anyone else in the Western world take the Saudi
peace plan seriously?</TE>
<TE>   Lorin Fife</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If it's madness to do the same thing over and over and expect
different results, then Israel is in the grip of madness. After the
Passover massacre, Israel will say that red lines have been crossed,
exclaim it knows how to defend itself and will do so--empty buildings
will be bombed, Shimon Peres will continue his delusional
appeasements and everyone will go back to the business of hoping that
the Palestinian Authority will stop encouraging, facilitating and
applauding vicious terror attacks against babies, teens, shoppers,
templegoers, pedestrians and sleeping soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   So it has finally, amazingly, come to be true: Israel is fully
responsible for the latest terror attack, and not for the usual
ludicrous reasons trotted out by Palestinian spokesmen. In the
horrible calculus of the Middle East, savage Palestinian terrorism is
a constant, the only thing for which Arafat and his bloody henchmen
can be relied upon. Israel has done the same thing over and over and
has expected different results. It needs to do what any other country
would have done long ago: liquidate or exile the corrupt, terrorist
PA and its satellites, kill and capture its soldiers and destroy
their weapons. Then see about negotiations. Until it does, Israel
must expect more massacres.</TE>

<TE>   Your Thursday editorial says, "The West was far too slow to step
in and end the violence" in Yugoslavia. Can't the same be said about
the Palestinian-Israeli dispute? Let us join with the United Nations,
Russia, Saudi Arabia, NATO and others and step in to stop the
violence. A fair arbitration could be used to settle the disputed
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians and the Israelis have proven themselves to be
incapable of doing that.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't Arafat arrested as a war criminal and tried by an
international tribunal? Is it because his arrest might cause a
reaction by the Mideast oil producers and a reduction in our oil
supply? Even in this case, is money the only reason for our inaction?</TE>

<HD>Mahony Stands 'Apart From Common Sense'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mahony Won't Name Abusers," March 26: Historically, the Roman
Catholic Church has stood apart from, or perhaps more aptly, beyond
civil law.</LD>
<LD>   What seems to be occurring before our eyes is the church's
insistence on standing apart from common sense (I really want to say,
decency) and the ethics that bind a civilized society. Church
administrators decline to reveal the names of priests who have
committed unspeakable crimes against children--crimes that, occurring
in any other sector of our society, would instantly galvanize law
enforcement agencies into prosecutorial ecstasy. Everyone--even
hardened criminals--detests child molesters.</LD>
<LD>   But Cardinal Roger Mahony will not release the names of accused
priests because he wants to protect the victims from further pain.
Imagine that argument on the lips of a school principal whose
students have been molested by a teacher, on the lips of a physician
who has taken advantage of a patient, and so on.</LD>
<TE>   Roger, clean out the house. There are wolves among the flock.</TE>
<TE>   David Lorenzana</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony is only perpetuating the secrecy that continues to
shroud the abuse of our children by priests when he refuses to
release the names of the abusers under the guise that he is
"protecting" the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't he realize that part of the continuing trauma to these
victims is the fact that the perpetrators have been so protected by
the church? If someone commits rape, we keep the name of the victim
secret, not the perpetrator. Apparently, Cardinal Mahony still thinks
the priests are the "victims."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Healy</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe Cardinal Mahony's position is backward. Releasing the
names of priests who perpetrated sexual abuse of children would
provide a measure of justice and help with the healing process of the
victims. It would also protect children in the communities where
these men now live and deter other priests so inclined.</TE>
<TE>   For the victims to publicly identify themselves and violate
confidentiality agreements is what would be traumatic. Is it possible
they are being used again?</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The pressure from insurance companies and of large financial
judgments against the Catholic Church seem to, as much as anything
else, be behind the new-found willingness of the church to openly
deal with the issues raised by the current sex abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   We would all be well advised to remember this the next time that a
reduction in plaintiffs' rights, or a limit on damages, is being
debated.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Spevack</TE>
<TE>   Oakland</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One does not know whether to laugh or cry at James Pinkerton's
solution to the crisis in the Catholic Church (Commentary, March 26).
Married priests? Not a chance. Women priests? God forbid! But let's
get on with the castrations--then we can have a bunch of eunuch
pedophiles leading the flock. Ah, but let's be tolerant of Pinkerton;
after all, he is a conservative Republican.</TE>

raised in affluence in beautiful Marin County only to go and join the
Taliban, a regime that terrorized civilians, treated women as
subhuman, destroyed artistic treasures and generally stood in
opposition to every American value. Whether or not he was fighting
with Al Qaeda, to me he is a traitor, and at the very least a
misogynist moron, no matter how many PR firms his parents care to

<HD>Jenks' Future Looks Bright</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels broke camp Thursday, heading to Southern California to
begin this season but leaving behind a pitcher who could develop into
a dominant part of future seasons.</LD>
<LD>   He's Bobby Jenks, 21, armed with a 100-mph fastball but still
refining his control and off-speed pitches. The right-hander is
expected to start the season at double-A Arkansas, but the major
league coaching staff got its first look at him this spring, and jaws
dropped.</LD>
<LD>   "The guy has got the most upside of any young pitcher I've seen,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's got a tremendous power arm. If he
can fulfill 75% of his promise, he'll be some kind of pitcher."</LD>
<TE>   Said minor league pitching coach Howie Gershberg, who worked
extensively with Jenks last season: "He reminds me of Curt Schilling
and Roger Clemens. He's built like them, big and strong, with a good
delivery.... He has the ability to be a solid No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball America ranks Jenks as the Angels' top pitching prospect,
although more polished minor leaguers such as Chris Bootcheck and
John Lackey could arrive in Anaheim sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Jenks has started only 35 minor league games, two above the
Class-A level. The Angels nonetheless sent him to the Arizona Fall
League, where he displayed his potential and his flaws against top
double-A and triple-A prospects. His earned-run average was 6.97, but
he led the league in strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "When he had command of his breaking ball, he made hitters look
silly," catcher Jason Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the potential to be dominant," General Manager Bill
Stoneman said. "The scouts in the fall league left the park
mumbling."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels pounded the Milwaukee Brewers in an exhibition
Thursday, 17-5, starting the game with nine consecutive hits. The
Angels got 23 hits in all, including three apiece from outfielder
Orlando Palmeiro and utility candidate Clay Bellinger. In his final
spring start, Kevin Appier gave up one run over five innings.
Reliever Lou Pote gave up four runs in one inning and left Arizona
with a 15.00 ERA, but he is expected to make the team based on his
strong showing last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, in search of a right-handed hitter, have had internal
discussions about the possibility of signing Todd Greene, released
this week by the New York Yankees. Greene, 30, a former Angel, hit
.440 for the Yankees this spring. He could replace Shawn Wooten as a
right-handed power hitter and third catcher.... Scioscia indicated
Larry Barnes or Benji Gil will be the first baseman on opening night.
If the Angels believe that Gil, recovering from shin splints, can
play for eight consecutive games--the maximum combined suspensions
for Troy Glaus and Scott Spiezio--then Barnes would not make the
team.... The Angels nearly traded outfielder Darin Erstad to the
White Sox in December for four players, and the key player would have
been Jon Garland, projected as a potential No. 1 starter. Not yet:
Garland, 22, has a 9.28 ERA this spring and has given up 18 hits and
11 walks in 11 innings. He'll be the No. 4 starter for Chicago....
The Angels conclude their exhibition schedule with a two-game series
against the Colorado Rockies at Edison Field. Aaron Sele faces Jason
Jennings tonight at 7, with Scott Schoeneweis opposing John Thompson
Saturday at 1.... This year marks the 10th anniversary of "The
Simpsons" episode that featured a softball team made up of major
leaguers, including Scioscia, who said he still gets residuals.
"Every three months, I get a check for, like, $4," he said.</TE>

<LD>   Ankiel, 22, will remain at the Cardinals' complex in Jupiter,
Fla., for extended spring training.</LD>
<LD>   Ankiel made one start this month, giving up five runs in the
second inning against Montreal on March 3.</LD>
<TE>   Closer Tom Gordon and third baseman Bill Mueller were officially
put on the 15-day disabled list as the Chicago Cubs set their 25-man
roster. The Cubs also returned infielder Angel Echevarria and
reliever Joe Borowski to minor league camp.... The New York Yankees
informed veteran utility man Luis Sojo that he won't make the opening
day roster unless an injury opens a spot. In 2000, the popular Sojo
drove in the World Series-clinching run with a ninth-inning single in
Game 5 against the New York Mets.... To remember the tragic events of
Sept. 11, there will be a minute of silence at 9:11 p.m. at every
major league team's first night game this season. In addition, "God
Bless America" will continue to be sung during the seventh-inning
stretch of all games until further notice.... Whitey Wietelmann, who
played for the Braves and Pirates during more than five decades in
baseball, died at the age of 83. Wietelmann, who coached with the San
Diego Padres, was found dead in his home on Tuesday. He had lived in
San Diego since 1949.</TE>

<LD>Oregon State coach Ritchie McKay was hired late Thursday as the new
coach at New Mexico, receiving a five-year contract, spokesman Greg
Remington said.</LD>
<LD>   McKay, 22-37 in two seasons at Oregon State, will replace Fran
Fraschilla, who resigned March 17 as coach of the Lobos.</LD>
<LD>   New Mexico Athletics Director Rudy Davalos and Senior Associate
Athletics Director Bill McGillis met with McKay at least twice a day
for the last week.</LD>
<TE>   "On Monday, we started serious discussions with him," McGillis
said.</TE>

<TE>   For Sam Clancy, being invited to the Final Four has taken some of
the sting out of ending his college career by losing in the first
round of the NCAA tournament but not all of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be busy getting ready to play," said the USC senior,
who was flown to Atlanta by a sports magazine as a candidate for
power forward of the year. Kansas' Drew Gooden won the award. "But
I'm just happy they invited me down here for this."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who was wearing his USC warmups, was taking in the
slam-dunk and three-point shooting contests at Georgia State on
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough to get over that loss," Clancy said of the
Trojans' 93-89 overtime defeat at the hands of unheralded North
Carolina Wilmington on March 14. "It's been hard to get over it, but
now it's time for me to get ready for the next stage of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who tested the NBA draft waters last spring before
returning to USC, has signed with agent Arn Tellem and will bypass
pre-draft camps this time around. Clancy said he would instead work
out for individual teams as the draft gets nearer.</TE>

<TE>   Stockman, a sophomore, averaged 12.2 points. He and Edward Scott
were expected to form one of the top backcourts next season in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Dwon Clifton, a sophomore guard, also has chosen to transfer to a
school near his hometown of High Point, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "They are fine young men who have represented the program well,"
Clemson Coach Larry Shyatt said.</TE>
<TE>   Shyatt says the Tigers next season will count on Scott and four
inside returnees--forwards Ray Henderson, Chris Hobbs, Tomas Nagys

<LD>Clipper forward Corey Maggette, on the injured list because of two
dislocated bones in his right hand, is expected to play tonight for
the first time since Feb. 22.</LD>
<LD>   While he was sidelined because of the hand injury, he also
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his sore left knee.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette was mentally prepared to play earlier this week, but
Coach Alvin Gentry and the team's medical staff decided he should
practice with his teammates for a few days before playing.</LD>
<TE>   Maggette acknowledged his hand is not yet 100%, but said his knee
is better than it was at the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have missed Maggette's hard-nosed style of play,
particularly on defense.</TE>
<TE>   While filling in for the injured Lamar Odom at small forward,
Maggette was assigned to guard the opposition's top players.</TE>
<TE>   With Maggette and Odom sidelined, the Clippers turned to Tremaine
Fowlkes, who was playing in the minor league National Basketball
Development League until Maggette injured himself punching the
scorer's table during a loss Feb. 21 to the Orlando Magic.</TE>

<HD>Piazza Mad After Being Hit by Mota</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The New York Mets will be in L.A. for a three-game series against the
Dodgers on May 13-15. The mayor may want to alert the National Guard.</LD>
<LD>   The teams exchanged heated words during a March 4 game when Met
catcher Mike Piazza and Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan were hit by
pitches, and Piazza sparked a bench-clearing incident Thursday after
being drilled on the left hip by a Guillermo Mota 3-and-0 fastball in
the seventh inning.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza, who has been hit by four pitches this spring and had to
sit out two games after being hit in the left hip Saturday against
Montreal, came out of the game but remained on the Met bench, which
is on the first-base side of Holman Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Mota was replaced to start the eighth inning, and when he walked
past the Met dugout and toward the right-field line to return to the
Dodger clubhouse, Piazza left the bench and walked with Mota,
exchanging words with the pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Then Piazza grabbed Mota by the jersey and players from both
benches swarmed the pair. No punches were thrown, order was restored,
and Piazza and Mota proceeded to their respective clubhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Mota declined comment, and Piazza showed restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no comment right now," Piazza said. "You guys will have to
draw your own conclusions. I have to sit tight, and once everything
gets out, we'll go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Met Manager Bobby Valentine was upset that Mota glared at Piazza
after hitting him. "He hit Mike and was staring at him," Valentine
said. "What's that all about?"</TE>
<TE>   As for the scuffle, Valentine said, "That wasn't like a fight.
Mike could have taken his head off and thrown it [into the crowd] for
a souvenir if he wanted to."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn has been working with Mota, who came to
the Dodgers from Montreal in a Saturday trade, to adjust his
mechanics in an effort to get more movement on his blazing fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid is struggling with his control, it was a 3-0 count, and
he was looking for a double play," Colborn said. "The situation made
it impossible to assume it was intentional."</TE>
<TE>   Colborn, who spent nine big league seasons with the Cubs and
Brewers from 1970-78, said things were different when he pitched.</TE>
<TE>   "We would regularly hit guys on purpose and throw at them, but
there was a code for that," Colborn said. "It was understood what was
appropriate, and hitters weren't as touchy. I guess if I'd been hit a
few times in spring training I would be looking for a way to make it
stop. [Piazza] chose to try to intimidate the last pitcher to hit
him, but I don't know what good it will do. He's probably just
frustrated."</TE>

<HD>Brown Gives Team a Scare, but He's Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna; Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger right-hander Kevin Brown pitches a lot like Monica Seles hits
ground strokes, a loud grunt accompanying every delivery, but the
yelp he emitted on a 1-and-1 pitch to Roger Cedeno in the second
inning of an exhibition against the New York Mets on Thursday was
practically ear-splitting.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy and trainer Stan Johnston jumped off the bench
and headed toward Brown, worried that he had hurt his surgically
repaired elbow, but it was the Holman Stadium mound, not Brown, that
was in need of repair.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this spring, the mound was too soft. Thursday it was too
hard, causing Brown's plant foot to slide every time it hit the
ground. On the pitch to Cedeno, Brown slipped so badly he nearly fell
off the mound.</LD>
<TE>   "It's never good when you have problems landing, when you're
sliding," Brown said. "It's hard to be consistent, to be really
aggressive. So it was nice to survive today and move on."</TE>
<TE>   The ground crew watered and raked the mound before the third
inning, and that seemed to help Brown, who gave up two runs and five
hits, struck out four and walked two in 42/3 innings of a 5-1 loss to
the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Brown threw 91 pitches, 53 for strikes, in his final tune-up
before starting Tuesday's season opener against San Francisco at
Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   He retired the last six batters, the last, Mike Piazza, striking
out. Brown's fastball was consistently clocked at 90-92 mph. He hit
94 twice and 93 a few times, several notches below his usual 96-97
mph, but catcher Chad Kreuter said Brown's sinker was moving better
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "His movement is king," Kreuter said. "When he gets that much
movement, you don't care about velocity. I'd rather he throw softer
with more movement than throw faster with less control."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who earlier this month looked doubtful for opening day, is
confident his velocity will return as his strength and stamina
improve and as the adrenaline kicks in for regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw hard last year with my arm about to fall off, so why
wouldn't I expect [my velocity] to come back?" asked Brown, who
underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle last Sept. 27. "I haven't
held my breath, expecting to have problems. I'm really pretty pleased
with everything."</TE>
<TE>   Brown gave up consecutive doubles to John Valentin and Mo Vaughn
in the first inning and a solo homer to Jay Payton in the second.
Barring any setback, he will start Tuesday's opener, though he's not
expected to go much beyond 100 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "With him being the Superman he is, anything is realistic,"
pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "He might pitch a nine-inning
shutout for all I know."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers completed the Grapefruit League portion of their
exhibition schedule with a 9-16-4 record, but Tracy was pleased that
his team broke camp in much better shape than last season.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, Adrian Beltre was 30 pounds lighter [after two
surgeries] and Chris Donnels was our opening-day third baseman, Dave
Hansen had two broken fingers, Shawn Green had played only six or
seven exhibition games [because of a thumb injury], Brown had an
Achilles' problem, Eric Karros had back problems, and once the season
started it got worse," Tracy said. "So I feel a lot better from a
health standpoint."</TE>

<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans, in Las Vegas for the Dodgers'
7-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday night, said he
is not feeling pressure to make moves as the deadline for setting
major league rosters looms.</TE>
<TE>   All teams must have their rosters submitted by Saturday at 9 p.m.
PST.</TE>
<TE>   Evans did not specify which players might be involved, but with
Dave Roberts having won the center field job, Tom Goodwin could be
traded or released and McKay Christensen could be traded or sent to
the minor leagues if he clears waivers.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is between now and the end of the game [against the
Cleveland Indians] on Saturday, we'll make our moves," Evans said.
"We have a few guys left and we'll figure that out whether they're
contract assignments to the minor leagues, trades, whatever. I have
had conversations with probably 20 clubs today and I'll probably
speak to as many teams or more tomorrow and Saturday. That's just the
way everybody is working right now."</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Omar Daal, who demanded a trade on Tuesday after he was
not included in the rotation, said his feelings have not changed
about starting. But he is ready to do whatever the Dodgers ask.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the same," he said. "I understand the situation. They need
me here. I'm not happy to go [to the bullpen] but if I have to go
there I will and every time I cross the lines I'll go 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo gave up four hits in six shutout innings against the
Diamondbacks. He struck out five and walked three. Brian Jordan hit a
three-run-homer in the third inning.... Phil Hiatt, a candidate for a
bench job until he sprained his left ankle Sunday, was optioned to
triple-A Las Vegas and will probably open the season on the disabled
list.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Defeat Coyotes in OT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Steve Shields knew the odds were long that
anything good would happen when he was pulled late in regulation for
an extra skater.</LD>
<LD>   He was thrilled with the results.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Rucchin scored with 37 seconds left in regulation and German
Titov scored with 1:02 remaining in overtime for a 2-1 victory by the
Ducks over the Phoenix Coyotes on Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   "We've pulled the goalie a ton of times this year, and we finally
got one," Shields said. "It's not a very high-percentage play to do,
but it's your best chance."</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes took a 1-0 lead when Claude Lemieux scored with 5:00
remaining in the third period, but goalie Robert Esche, who had 26
saves at that point, gave up goals on the Ducks' last two shots--the
second one after Lemieux gave up the puck trying to get a pass to
Brian Savage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in overtime, we're cheating and trying to get the extra
point, so you try fancy stuff," Lemieux said. "You try passes you
usually don't try when it's not in overtime. You know, these guys are
playing loose, they've got nothing to lose, and it cost us the
point."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' fourth victory over Phoenix in five games this year
prevented the Coyotes from tying the franchise record of nine
consecutive wins at home, set by the 1992-93 Winnipeg Jets. But they
still earned their NHL-best 23rd point in 15 games (10-2-1-2) since
the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin came in for Shields on the last-ditch effort by Coach
Bryan Murray to get a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin wound up with the puck after Phoenix defenseman Todd
Simpson tried to clear it from behind his net. It banged off the
boards, hit Titov's skate, flew out to the slot and Rucchin blasted a
one-timer past Esche.</TE>
<TE>   Titov took an inside-out pass from Samuel Pahlsson, who wound up
with Lemieux's turnover, as he skated across the slot. He turned and
fired, netting the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a bit of good play off the backboard and the puck came
right to the slot," Murray said. "So it's not that they gave anything
up. It's just that we got the extra man out there, and it was the
extra man that I put on the ice that scored the goal, so it was
pretty tough to cover that."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux scored on a wraparound, beating Shields between the
skates.</TE>
<TE>   Although the teams met for the second time in 24 hours--Phoenix
won, 4-2. on Wednesday--the game was relatively calm through two
periods, with only three penalties called.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks picked up the pace after killing Phoenix's second power
play with 6:33 left in the second.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two minutes, the Ducks outshot Phoenix, 6-1, but Esche
preserved the scoreless tie with strong saves, including pad stops on
Matt Cullen from close range and on Jeff Friesen, who spun and fired
in the slot.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks killed two Phoenix power plays early in the third, and
the teams skated defensively until the late fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   "The script was going perfect, and someone changed the ending on
us," Coyote Coach Bob Francis said.</TE>

<DL>THE WOODLANDS, Texas</DL>
<LD>Jim Carter, with one PGA Tour victory since turning pro in 1985, shot
a seven-under-par 65 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the Shell
Houston Open.</LD>
<LD>   Esteban Toledo of Mexico, looking for his first tour victory,
charged home in the afternoon with a 66 on the TPC at the Woodlands.
Vijay Singh was two strokes back along with Chris Riley, J.P. Hayes,
Scott Verplank, Brian Bateman and Jay Haas.</LD>
<LD>   Carter's round stood up while other more recognizable players
faltered. John Daly was five under through 16 holes but bogeyed No.
17 and double-bogeyed No. 18 for a 70.</LD>
<TE>   Greg Norman, playing in the tournament for the first time since
1991, also had a 70. Craig Perks, an unknown until winning the
Players Championship last week, opened with a 74.</TE>
<TE>   Carter had seven birdies--five on the back nine--in his bogey-free
round.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had good first rounds before and this was nice," Carter
said. "It was just a good, solid round. I didn't seem to do anything
stupid. I didn't seem to do anything real spectacular. It's always
nice to get a good solid round under your belt."</TE>
<TE>   It was Carter's low round of the year. He tied for 49th last week
in the Players Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been playing really great golf, and I'm waiting to bust
out," Carter said. "I've made a few mistakes. I've just kind of
inserted those into my round. I didn't do that today and hopefully
I'm done doing that for the year."</TE>
<TE>   Singh was five under at the turn but couldn't better that on his
final nine holes.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament will end a 24-year association with the Woodlands,
the last 17 at the TPC. It will begin play in 2003 at Redstone Golf
Club.</TE>
<TE>   There were seven others three shots off the pace at 68, including
former champion Robert Allenby and Houston favorite Fred Couples and
Nick Price. Defending champion Hal Sutton shot a 72.</TE>

<LD>Mike Linn of Newhall Hart High had spectators cheering for a victory
again Wednesday afternoon. However, this competition wasn't in the
swimming pool, where Linn was runner-up in the 50 and 100 freestyle
events at the Southern Section Division II finals last season, but on
a picnic table in the middle of campus.</LD>
<LD>   Linn pinned Notre Dame-bound lineman Chris Frome in an
arm-wrestling contest during pre-spring break school activities,
unleashing a roar of excitement from his fellow students.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a showdown," said Steve Neale, Hart's swimming coach.</LD>
<TE>   It was also an example of Linn's versatility as an athlete.</TE>
<TE>   He earned All-American status in both freestyle sprint events at
the section finals last season, then turned his attention to
football, where he was an All-Foothill League defensive end for Hart,
which won its fourth consecutive Division II section title last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Linn, who is 6 feet 4 and nearly 200 pounds, has also excelled in
sports ranging from wrestling to lacrosse but will settle on swimming
once he graduates and moves on to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.</TE>
<TE>   So far this season, Linn has produced the second-fastest time in
the region in the 50 freestyle, 22.06 seconds on Saturday during a
triangular meet at L.A. Loyola High.</TE>
<TE>   That's a long way from his personal best of 20.93 achieved at the
section finals in May, but Linn expects to better that time, as well
as a few others, by the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Two marks he's aiming for are the winning times produced by James
Jenkins of Crescenta Valley in the 50 and 100 freestyles at the
Division II finals. Jenkins finished in 44.65 and 20.47 to win the
events for the second consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the division records of 20.27, set by Derya
Buyukuncu of Irvine Woodbridge in 1994, and 44.28, set two years ago
by Anthony Ervin, a former Hart teammate and 2000 Olympic gold
medalist.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Jenkins has graduated, Linn said it might take some extra
self-discipline to satisfy those goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see how it goes," said Linn, who trains with the Canyons
Aquatics swim club. "Who knows, there might be an up-and-coming star
who has my name on his wall, just like I had [Jenkins'] name on my
wall last season."</TE>
<TE>   Heard this before? Glendora Coach Janet Pollard wasn't happy with
the way the diving portion of an important Baseline League boys' meet
was scored Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Upland outscored Glendora, 13-3, in the diving competition and
went on to win the meet, 93.5-90.5.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, who scored the diving competition for Glendora, along
with a judge from Upland and a nonpartisan official, said the scores
from the Upland judge differed greatly from the other two.</TE>
<TE>   "Their kids were doing cannon balls and getting fours [on a scale
of 1 to 10]," Pollard said. "Our divers would do a good dive and get
a two."</TE>
<TE>   High school dives are scored based on the judges' total points,
which are then divided by a predetermined number based on the degree
of difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard said Upland Coach Terry Kimberling pulled her aside after
the meet and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some weird judging going on, I'll admit that," said
Kimberling. He said he offered to throw out the scores from Upland's
judge, but even that wouldn't have changed the results.</TE>
<TE>   "Their diving coach admitted that no matter how bad the judging
was, [Upland] would have placed 1-2-3," said Kimberling, adding he
had no plans to change judges at future competitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had five meets so far and that has not been a problem," he
said. "I'm going to have a talk with the [judge] though."</TE>
<TE>   Better than ever: Erin Volcan returned to the Anaheim Canyon swim
team Wednesday and helped set a school record in the 200 freestyle
relay in a Century League meet against visiting Villa Park.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan, who placed second in the 200-meter backstroke last week at
the U.S. Spring Nationals in Minneapolis, teamed with Sheva
Khalafbeigi and sisters Lauren and Courtney Mathewson to win the
event in 1:38.32, the fastest time in the region this season.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan, who will swim for Auburn next season, also won the 100
breaststroke in 1:07.73. The Comanches won the meet, 92-78.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Hedges on Playing Next Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was unusual, but Michael Jordan wasn't 99.9% sure of anything.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan said Thursday he plans to play next season. He also said he
probably won't play unless his injured knee improves.</LD>
<LD>   "You guys are asking me to make a decision about next season now,"
Jordan, 39, said after the Washington Wizards' practice. "Based on
how I feel, that's not really fair. My intention, my contract lasts
for next season. I have all intent of living out my contract.</LD>
<TE>   "But, if I physically can't, if I go through the same situation
I've been going through this year, it's not meaningful for me."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was taken aback by the tempest created by Wizard Coach Doug
Collins, who said on ESPN that he'd be surprised if Jordan plays next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan usually doesn't speak on non-game days, but he broke his
routine to admonish reporters for "running with something" that's
been obvious all along.</TE>
<TE>   But, when asked if Collins was right, Jordan said: "That would be
my observation , too."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had surgery on the knee Feb. 27 and missed 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also said he might have surgery on his left knee during the
off-season, a strong indication that he does plan to play, though he
reiterated that no decisions will be made until the off-season.</TE>

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Ian Laperriere was back on the ice for the Kings on Thursday night
after sitting out Tuesday's game to attend the birth of his son,
Tristan, but that wasn't Coach Andy Murray's only lineup change.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson Emerson, who had been scratched in five consecutive games
and seven of eight, was back playing on a line with fellow veteran
Kelly Buchberger, who returned Tuesday after sitting out seven games
because of a sprained ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Andreas Lilja, who had sat out 18 consecutive games, was back in
the lineup for the first time since Feb. 7, the Kings dressing seven
defensemen.</LD>
<TE>   Scratched were Jaroslav Bednar, Adam Mair and Ken Belanger, who
all played key roles in the Kings' recent six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going with a lot of our veterans here tonight," Murray said
before the game. "This is the time of year when that leadership and
that veteran experience should help out. It will help us as long as
we use it to help us."</TE>
<TE>   After the Kings were shut out in consecutive games at Phoenix and
Vancouver, Murray naturally turned his attention to ... defense?</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody talks about the fact that we haven't scored for two
games," Murray said. "My major concern is that we've given up eight
goals because we always play better offensively when we're better
defensively.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really got to tighten it up. We've taken 21 penalties in
the last three games and we can't afford to do that because we're
using Ziggy [Palffy] and Jason [Allison] and some of those guys on
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "They're spending too much time on the defensive side of the game
instead of having the chance to focus on offense, so we need to be
better there."</TE>
<TE>   Murray, on dressing seven defensemen: "We're not happy with a
couple of our defensemen, the way they've been playing, but it's a
bit of a risk to take one of them out and put Andreas in there
because he hasn't played for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how he's going to respond. If we get into the game
and he's struggling, where are we? This way we have other guys."</TE>

<HD>Kings' Tie Is Simply Special</HD>
<DH>Hockey: After two shutout losses, they tie Oilers, 2-2,
behind power-play goal and stellar penalty killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>After the first three games of a four-game trip, the Kings still
haven't found their way into the win column.</LD>
<LD>   But in ending a two-game losing streak Thursday night with a 2-2
tie against the Edmonton Oilers in front of 16,839 in the Skyreach
Centre, they found their special teams, scoring a power-play goal and
easily killing five penalties.</LD>
<LD>   And more important, perhaps, they may have found themselves.</LD>
<TE>   "The main thing is, we played the game we wanted to play tonight,"
defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "After two games where we really
felt we weren't ourselves, that was fairly important.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a rough road trip for us, but that's the way we were
playing before the trip, and it's good to see us get back to that
same type of hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy and Mikko Eloranta scored goals and the checking line
of Eloranta, Brad Chartrand and Ian Laperriere shut out the top Oiler
line of Mike Comrie, Ryan Smyth and Anson Carter, which had generated
29 points in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   On the negative side, the Kings twice gave up one-goal leads. But
after consecutive 4-0 losses at Phoenix and Vancouver, in which they
failed to score in 11 power-play opportunities and gave up four
power-play goals, they weren't about to quibble with a result that
put them one point closer to the playoffs and ended the Oilers'
season-best six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we got just a tie," Coach Andy Murray said, "we
wanted our players to take some satisfaction out of this game to know
that's how we have to play. Sometimes it's not the wins and losses
that are most important.</TE>
<TE>   "It's how you play, and I thought we played pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, in losing consecutive games for the first time since
November, had failed to match the intensity of their previous two
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play these games, you always worry about what you're
going to do, your game plan," King captain Mattias Norstrom said
before the game, "but you've also got to realize, looking at the
whole picture, we're not the only team that's fighting to get into
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "You have other teams with a lot of emotion in their dressing
rooms and a lot of guys that are going to put it on the line every
night.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have so many teams that are pretty much on the same
level, it comes down to which team will give that little extra. We're
going to be facing desperate teams pretty much every night, in pretty
much every building we go into."</TE>
<TE>   The most recent band of desperadoes in the Kings' path was the
Oilers, whose coach, Craig MacTavish, told Edmonton reporters
beforehand that this was the most desperate game his team had faced
all season.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing that, Murray grinned and said: "This is the most
desperate game they'll play until the next game. That's exactly the
way it is."</TE>
<TE>   With Smyth in the penalty box for obstruction hooking, Palffy gave
the Kings the lead midway through the first period with his 13th
power-play goal and 28th goal overall.</TE>
<TE>   When Oiler goaltender Tommy Salo failed to cover the rebound of a
shot from the left point by Schneider, Adam Deadmarsh pounced on the
puck in the slot and slipped a pass to Palffy, who netted a shot from
the right faceoff circle.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Kings' first goal since the second period of Saturday's
3-0 victory over the San Jose Sharks, ending a drought of 155 minutes
59 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Janne Niinimaa pulled the Oilers even with 1:43 to play
in the first period, slapping a rebound of his own shot over a pile
of players sprawled in the slot, the puck trickling between the legs
of King goaltender Felix Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   Only 42 seconds into the second period, Eloranta put the Kings
ahead again with his seventh goal, ripping a shot from the right
circle that caromed off the bottom of the crossbar and into the net
past a startled Salo.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-nine seconds into the third period, the Oilers tied the
score again after Mike Grier blocked a clearing attempt by Potvin as
he circled behind the King net, kept control of the puck and fed a
pass in front to Ethan Moreau.</TE>
<TE>   Moreau, all alone in the slot, banged home his 11th goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave up that goal in the first shift and you could have a
situation where you collapse after that," Murray said. "But I thought
we came right back and didn't give them anything.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way we've played. We've been pretty resilient."</TE>

<HD>Patterson Duel Isn't Personal for Bryant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The short history is that Ruben Patterson does not seem to like Kobe
Bryant, and Kobe Bryant is pretty sure he remembers who Ruben
Patterson is. Something like that.</LD>
<LD>   After Portland's six-point victory  over the Lakers last month,
Patterson made clear that when he and Bryant were both young and
Lakers, Patterson was needy too.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant's slights, perceived or otherwise, hurt him.</LD>
<TE>   "Ever since that first training camp, Kobe has been very
arrogant," Patterson said. "You know Kobe. He talks a lot of trash.
But he don't talk directly to me now. He knows not to talk to me
directly."</TE>
<TE>   To which Bryant raised an eyebrow.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a really good defender," Bryant said that day. "But five on
five is different. If we bang into each other in the gym and I play
him one on one, I will demolish him."</TE>
<TE>   That brings the two of them to Staples Center tonight, where they
undoubtedly will see plenty of each other, if in a five-on-five
element.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw, I don't want to get caught up in that, man," Bryant said
Thursday afternoon. "It's not personal for me."</TE>
<TE>   No one seemed offended, although Coach Phil Jackson wondered if
Patterson's boasts and Kobe-stopping reputation "might have gotten
him a contract with Portland, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Derek Fisher: "On the way up, the arrogance Kobe showed was
one of the things that made him so great. Now ... he's too arrogant?"</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the old,
oh-what-a-disaster-how-long-before-Mo-Cheeks-is-canned Trail Blazers
and the new, nobody-wants-to-play-them-anymore Trail Blazers?</TE>
<TE>   "Scottie Pippen," Jackson said. "It's spelled S-C-O-T-T-I-E.
Scottie's taken on the offense, as far as directing it."</TE>
<TE>   Pippen has averaged 14.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists in
his last three games.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Portland</TE>
<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 50-21, Trail Blazers 44-27.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Trail Blazers--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--After a horrid start, the Trail Blazers have won 18 of 21
games, including a 111-105 decision over the Lakers on Feb. 17 at
Portland, and have become a very dangerous first-round draw as,
probably, the fifth-seeded team. They have won nine of 11 road games,
and are a league-best 19-4 since the All-Star break. The Lakers have
lost three times in six games, all on the road, but have won nine in
a row at Staples Center. Rasheed Wallace, who missed Monday's game
against Memphis and sat out most of Wednesday's victory over San
Antonio, is not expected to play because of back pain.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal, Lakers Facing the Blahs on Defense</HD>
<DH>Basketball: L.A. looks to regain its form after a number of
sluggish outings, and the star center's arthritic toe could be the
key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On an unremarkable afternoon in El Segundo, where champions, uh,
train, Phil Jackson wore a cap bearing the commentary "BLAH BLAH
BLAH," and center Shaquille O'Neal wouldn't communicate at all, other
than to tap his head with his forefinger.</LD>
<LD>   So stand the Lakers, somewhere between bemused and thoughtful, and
to their credit not at all defensive, which explains all of the
points they've been giving up for these two weeks. They are quite the
curiosity this time of season, ever vulnerable, maybe weary, perhaps
wondering, like everyone else, about that three-peat thing, what it's
going to take this time and whether they have it.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal is in pain and everyone else is in transition, and just
last weekend their coach threw up his hands, mentioned something
about not being capable of affecting their psyches anymore, and then
they won a big game in a nasty place. It's anyone's guess now if the
real O'Neal will show in mid-April, though most expect he will. Or if
the defense will come around by then, and the Lakers say it will,
though that depends an awful lot on O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, they've got the Portland Trail Blazers tonight at
Staples Center and the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night, a stressful
weekend followed by four games on the East Coast. They'll try to put
some emotional distance--and defensive effort--between themselves and
the atrocious game they played Wednesday night in Phoenix, the
118-106 loss that made everyone forget Sunday's victory in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very confident about what we can do as a ballclub," said
Jackson, whose BLAH BLAH BLAH cap blended nicely with his "Don't
Hate" T-shirt. "We feel we can move our game up a notch whenever
called upon."</TE>
<TE>   After a hesitation, he added, "When that call comes, I'd like to
know."</TE>
<TE>   This could simply be a matter of the Lakers being the Lakers. Ten
of their 21 losses have been in the second of back-to-back games, of
which there will be few or none when the regular season goes away.
They also were no better off at this time last season, when their
record was worse and Kobe Bryant's ankles were dreadfully swollen,
except that O'Neal was fit and giving indications he was becoming
interested.</TE>
<TE>   It was three days into April before their playoff momentum began,
and later than that before anyone recognized it as such. A year
later, on a gray day, the Lakers watched film for an hour, then
belittled each other in a brisk game of half-court four on four.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal shot free throws--he was four for 15 against the Suns--and
walked easily through questions that bounded off him. He, of course,
is in one of those spiritual places where everyone who does not agree
with him is a fool and every question put to him is idiotic. Sort of
like being an NBA referee, the symmetry of which might amuse him.</TE>
<TE>   Asked, as he waded, if he believed he could be dominant on both
ends of the floor come playoff time, he nodded. Asked why he thought
so, he poked himself in the head a few times, and grinned. And then
he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like, with him being fresher game in and game out, he can
be more active, more so on the defensive end," guard Derek Fisher
said. "Defensively, we're going to need him to be more active. We're
supporting him now and we know he'll be there when the game's on the
line."</TE>
<TE>   His offensive output has fallen only slightly because of the
arthritic toe, but O'Neal has had difficulty defending the
pick-and-roll and quicker centers, and controlling rebounds. But,
again, he has a sore toe, and what excuse do the rest of them have?</TE>
<TE>   "He's showing up for the games, that's for darn sure," forward
Rick Fox said. "His health is going to change, night to night, and we
know that. Where he'll be energy-wise for the playoffs, I'm not real
concerned with. I don't worry about Shaquille. I worry about all of
us out in front of him getting beat.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been spoiled. We've grown accustomed to gambling and making
aggressive defensive plays. If we were beaten, he'd be back there to
intimidate and block shots. As of late, it hasn't been the case."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's point: The Lakers should become more conservative, make
teams beat them from the perimeter, and protect O'Neal from too many
guards going too eagerly to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   It's the least they could do, considering how close they are to
finding out how it all ends, and what it all means, and, oh, blah,
blah, blah.</TE>

<HD>Neumann Takes the Early Lead</HD>
<DH>Golf: She has a three-under 69 on a cold, blustery day and
is in first place after one round at Kraft Nabisco Championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>Membership, apparently, does have its privileges.</LD>
<LD>   Swede Liselotte Neumann made good use of her honorary membership
at Mission Hills Country Club in January, hitting the course almost
every weekend in anticipation of the LPGA's first major of the year.</LD>
<LD>   It got cold, and windy, of course, being it was January. One
practice round was shortened, mercifully, to nine holes because
conditions were so chilly.</LD>
<TE>   Still, who knew the turtleneck-and-sweater weather would be ideal
preparation come March?</TE>
<TE>   Neumann dealt with the elements better than anyone else in the
opening round of the $1.5-million Kraft Nabisco Championship here on
Thursday, shooting a three-under-par 69.</TE>
<TE>   One shot back was the trio of defending champion Annika Sorenstam,
Gloria Park and Amy Fruhwirth. Only eight players were under par on a
tough, blustery day. Fifteen-year-old Thai amateur Aree Song
Wongluekiet, was one under at 71.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, winner of eight titles last year, finished late in the
day, about 15 minutes before it started raining.</TE>
<TE>   She seemed more upset about spotting lightning on No. 18 than she
was by hitting a four-wood off the tee into water, finally bogeying
the last hole.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end, I mean we've been out there for five hours, and the
wind was howling and I saw some lightning," Sorenstam said. "So I'm
happy to be in and be under par."</TE>
<TE>   The press and interview tent were buffeted by the heavy winds as
she recounted the difficult day of weather and lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "We were standing waiting to hit our third shot, and I saw several
little streaks in the background," she said. "And we were hoping that
we would be able to finish. But it seems like they are still playing;
so it must be moving some other direction.</TE>
<TE>   "But it really felt close and I heard some thunder too."</TE>
<TE>   Neumann's caddie teased her about adapting to the challenging
conditions. Her best finish at this event was a tie for 10th in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually play pretty good in the wind," said Neumann, who was
bogey-free.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a really long swing. Just kind of keep it compact
and am able to hit a lot of really low shots. So actually my caddie
asked me today, 'Are you sure you don't have a little British blood
in you?'"</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier, and much sunnier, it was like another tournament,
though still windy.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the early leaders, Park and Fruhwirth, have vastly
different experiences with this course.</TE>
<TE>   For Park, who was born in Seoul but lives in Sydney, Australia,
this was only her third full round at Mission Hills, including
Tuesday's pro-am.</TE>
<TE>   Fruhwirth grew up in Orange County in Cypress and has played this
event seven times.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, she was low amateur, and her best finish, a tie for
third, was in 1997. More recently, she missed the cut three years
ago, tied for 57th in 2000 and tied for 42nd last year.</TE>
<TE>   She is distinctive for a couple of reasons, wearing a wide-brimmed
straw hat on the course to protect her skin from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "My skin is very sensitive, fair skin, and I've had basal cells
removed from my left eyebrow, so I'm very conscious of the sun and
trying to do everything I can to protect it." Fruhwirth said.</TE>
<TE>   Her gallery of relatives and friends numbered nine and is going to
expand in the next round. She expects about a dozen more supporters
to be on hand today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to grow. It's going to get loud," she said. "My
sisters are here, aunts, uncles, cousins. You'll be able to hear
them. We are a pretty loud family."</TE>
<TE>   The big family following makes sense because her father is one of
10 children, and Fruhwirth estimates she has about 60 cousins.</TE>
<TE>   So, does she know all their names?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm embarrassed to say," she said</TE>
<TE>   The Fruhwirth family could make it interesting if she were to win
on Sunday. What has become a traditional victory plunge into the lake
could turn into a tidal wave at Mission Hills. And she will remove
the hat too.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. I don't care," she said. "If I'm the winner, my whole
family and I are going to come out and jump in the lake. We are going
to empty that water out."</TE>

<HD>Still Hooked</HD>
<DH>Problems Remain, but at Least Marlins Will Be Fielding a
Team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIERA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A cloud has hovered above the Florida Marlins for as long as they can
remember, so dark days are nothing new to this seen-it-all bunch.
Players said they have no choice except to try to focus on baseball
rather than an uncertain future in the wake of their recent purchase
and management purge.</LD>
<LD>   Such is life in the eye of the storm.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, there's always something happening around here," said
right-hander Ryan Dempster, a 15-game winner last season. "But you
get used to it. You just block it out because you have to."</LD>
<TE>   In mid-February, art dealer Jeffrey Loria sold the Montreal Expos
to a Major League Baseball partnership for $120 million and acquired
the Marlins for $158.5 million--assisted by an unprecedented $38
million loan from the league. Only moments after getting the keys
from John Henry, who heads the group that purchased the Boston Red
Sox for $660 million, Loria fired 60 baseball-operations employees.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the cost-cutting moves, team President David Samson,
Loria's stepson, gutted the scouting and development departments. He
replaced most with former Expo employees--among the lowest paid in
baseball--who received $5,000 bonuses to follow Loria to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   While rumors of contraction or relocation continue to swirl around
the club, there was reason to accentuate the positive on a
picturesque day recently at their spring-training complex.</TE>
<TE>   Although long-running plans to build a new ballpark are on hold,
the Marlins extended their lease at Pro Player Stadium through next
season. Loria has pledged to keep the club's talented roster
intact--for now. And their impressive young rotation should be worth
watching.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins have been in a hole since former owner Wayne Huizenga,
unable to generate public support for a retractable-roof ballpark,
ordered a fire sale after the club's 1997 World Series championship.
When Dave Dombrowski, the architect of the title team and current
rebuilding project, left in November to become president of the
Detroit Tigers, many believed the curtain would soon drop on the
Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Henry also gave up after failing to persuade Florida's voters to
contribute to a new baseball-only stadium and negotiated to buy the
Angels from the Walt Disney Co. before joining the Red Sox group.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Loria.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that Loria bought the Marlins to move
them to Washington, D.C., and that the Expos and another team would
be eliminated before the 2003 season. But baseball sources said the
Expos are the likelier candidates to move to Washington because
owners could sell the club for a huge profit, and the commissioner's
office isn't ready to give up on the South Florida market.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Loria would have to pay back only $23 million of the $38
million he borrowed from Major League Baseball if he doesn't get a
new stadium within five years. Combined with the lease extension, it
could all be a sign Loria plans to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm determined to see [that] this team gets returned to
championship form," Loria said shortly after purchasing the club.</TE>
<TE>   Loria will maintain the team's current $44-million payroll and is
prepared to incur losses, projected at more than $20 million this
season, another indication, Samson said, "to let people know we mean
what we say."</TE>
<TE>   Loria is developing a plan to attack the stadium issue, but
there's no timetable. Attempts to spark community interest in the
team's impressive young rotation have so far been met with
apathy--something that the players said they find far more
distracting than management moves.</TE>
<TE>   "The things that throw me off are the fan support ... it just
doesn't feel like home," said outfielder Cliff Floyd, selected to his
first All-Star game last season. "When the [Atlanta] Braves come to
town, they root for the Braves. When you don't get that support, it
tends to wear on you a little bit. You feel good about your day, you
feel honored to be wearing this uniform, and then you get out there
and you see 1,000 people in the stands. It hurts. You look forward to
going on the road, and that shouldn't be."</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins acknowledge that the recent upheaval contributed to
their disappointing 76-86 record and fourth-place finish in the
National League East. New Manager Jeff Torborg believes the Marlins
should expect more of themselves this season--and they do too.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no confidence last year," Floyd said. "We were so caught
up on stadium proposals, who would be our manager and all this other
off-the-field stuff. With the team we had, there's no way we should
have won only 76 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The new coaching staff came in here with a good game plan. They
told us we have what we need to win, we just need to change the
attitude and forget about all that stuff that's not going to help us
on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Torborg, a former Dodger and Angel catcher, replaced Tony Perez,
who took over in May for the fired John Boles. The Dodgers hired
Boles as a senior advisor to General Manager Dan Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Loria hired Torborg, his longtime friend, in Montreal after he
ousted the popular Felipe Alou in May. Torborg, who also managed the
Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox and New York Mets, knew early in
the off-season he would be managing the Marlins and was eager to take
the reins.</TE>
<TE>   "All winter long, I had one eye on the Expos and the other eye on
this club," said Torborg, the 1990 American League manager of the
year while with the White Sox. "I was just hoping that nothing was
done [with the roster]; just leave 'em alone. If we were going to be
here, just let us get in and let us see what we have."</TE>
<TE>   Torborg and his coaches inherited lots of pitching. Dombrowski
stocked the roster and farm system with big right-handers who throw
in the 90s, providing a solid foundation for the Marlins' future,
wherever it occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Starters Dempster, A.J. Burnett, Brad Penny and heralded rookie
Josh Beckett, the No. 2 selection in the 1999 free-agent amateur
draft, are all 25 or younger and their fastballs have been clocked at
95 mph or faster.</TE>
<TE>   The starters are determined to be catalysts for a positive change.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot is going to ride on our shoulders," Dempster said.
"Hopefully, we can throw everybody on there and just say, 'Let's
go.'"</TE>

<HD>He's No Fan of the IRL</HD>

<LD>"If the Indy Racing League didn't have the Indianapolis 500, do you
think it would have lasted more than six months? No chance," says
Mario Andretti.</LD>
<LD>   Andretti has been honored as the greatest open-wheel race car
driver in U.S. history, and he still has a passion for his sport.</LD>
<LD>   Andretti's pet beef is the IRL and the way Tony George separated
it from CART in 1996 and created a schism in American open-wheel
racing that continues today.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes great conversation to discuss what's wrong with
open-wheel racing today," he said from his home in Nazareth, Pa. "The
IRL's what's wrong. Six years the IRL has been trying to promote
itself and it hasn't made a dent.</TE>
<TE>   "They've tried everything to make it exciting, bringing in Roger
Penske's team, getting Al Unser Jr., but it makes no difference. They
just don't have a product to sell. Look at the attendance this year.
They haven't had more than 20,000 anywhere and [last Sunday] at
Fontana they had no more than 12,000 paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it should have been embarrassing to Roger to be there. It
goes to show, either you have a product or you don't have a product.
And the IRL doesn't have one."</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, winner of 52 races and $17.7 million in his U.S. Auto
Club and CART Indy car career, acknowledges that CART has its
problems too.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, politics finally caught up with CART and no doubt it's
at the crossroads right now, but I think with Chris Pook in charge,
it will get straightened out. That is, if the owners give him the
authority to run it the way he sees fit. For years, it has been run
as a democracy with two foreign guys [Bill Stokkan of Finland and
Andrew Craig of Britain] running the show, and it didn't work. Too
many people had their own agenda and the two guys in charge didn't
have a clue.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that has saved CART is its product. The series,
with its combination of street races and road races along with ovals,
is still incredibly viable. It is a very attractive series and that
is why so many foreign drivers come from all over the world to race
with CART."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign drivers won 19 of 20 races last year, the exception being
Mario's son, Michael, who won his 41st race at Toronto and ranks
third on the all-time list behind his father and leader A.J. Foyt,
who won 67 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't listen to all that talk about not enough American drivers
in CART," Mario said. "We're just like golf. Foreign players is what
makes golf so popular now. The day of parochialism in sports is over.
The world is too small for what people like to call the good old
days. Fans want the best, wherever they come from."</TE>
<TE>   Even the IRL, which stated as one of its objectives the providing
of opportunities for young U.S. drivers, had 10 foreign-born drivers
among its 27 starters last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his feelings toward the IRL and the sad state of
open-wheel racing, Andretti is optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, to look at the future, it's more positive than it was
two or three years ago, but they're [CART and the IRL] going to have
to come together, one way or the other. Maybe with a single
championship or an all-star race, or all-star series. Somehow, we
have to get a common formula. It will be easier next year because the
engines will be similar, but CART will still have the upper hand
because of its diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there is NASCAR, no all-oval open-wheel series can be
successful. The only way would be to line up 50 cars on the track and
if you did that, you might as well have all the local funeral homes
on standby. It's just not feasible."</TE>
<TE>   Another pet peeve is what has happened to the Indy 500, a race
Andretti won in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pity how much the IRL has degraded Indy, the premier event
in racing. It's no longer what it used to be. I remember when
200,000, the real fans of Indy, would turn out for qualifying. I went
last year, the first time I'd been back since Tony forced CART out,
and there weren't 20,000 there. I couldn't believe it. It was like
being in Milwaukee. How can Tony George and the speedway people not
see that?</TE>
<TE>   "Things have improved at Indy, like letting CART and other drivers
in the last couple of years. I am still 100% supportive of that race
and am glad Michael finally got back there. He'll be there again this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Andretti will be back in Long Beach, where he became the only
American Formula One driver to win a U.S. Grand Prix, and where he
later won three CART races, in two weeks. Besides watching Michael's
performance in the April 14 race, he will do a book signing April 11
at 7 p.m. at Borders in the Los Altos Market Center in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The book, "Mario Andretti: A Driving Passion," written by Gordon
Kirby, details intimate moments in Andretti's life, from living in
World War II Italy, coming to America and racing with twin brother
Aldo, through his USAC and Formula One careers, to the bitter
relationship between him and his 1993 teammate, Nigel Mansell, and
how that influenced Mario's decision to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it means anything or not, but at my book signing
in London, my line was longer than Muhammad Ali's," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to getting back to California. I have some
solid roots there. I have offices in Redwood City and Michael and I
own the biggest gas station in San Francisco. And, of course, we have
the vineyards in Napa Valley. One of our wines got a gold medal in
the L.A. County Fair."</TE>
<TE>   Fontana Fans</TE>
<TE>   Now we know where all those people were who weren't at California
Speedway for last Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400. They were home checking
it out on Indy Racing Online. According to the Indy Racing League,
the race generated the third-highest amount of traffic on the
league's Web site, www.indyracing.com.</TE>
<TE>   The site registered 6.7 million hits and 17.2 million page views.
Only last year's Indianapolis 500 and the 2002 season opener at
Homestead, Fla., scored better.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Kart Club will open its season in new surroundings
Sunday when the first of nine races will be run on a track inside
Irwindale's half-mile oval. For the last 15 seasons, the LAKC ran at
Saugus Speedway, but Saugus authorities shut down the track this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Karts will find a welcoming face at Irwindale. Bob DeFazio, vice
president and chief operating officer at Irwindale Speedway, is the
father of Nick DeFazio, a former karting champion now driving super
late model stock cars.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale's Saturday night program will feature NASCAR late
models, Ultra Wheel super trucks, legend cars and modified 4s.</TE>
<TE>   Next weekend's program will be an unusual two-day event featuring
American Speed Assn. stock cars. Qualifying is set for Saturday
afternoon, followed by the regular weekly show. On Sunday, the ASA
will run a 300-lap main event, which will be televised nationally at
1 p.m. on TNN.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Garnett gave the Minnesota Timberwolves a big scare in the
third quarter when he banged his head on the floor and left for the
locker room with a bloody gash.</LD>
<LD>   Returning in the fourth quarter after receiving a dozen stitches,
Garnett gave his team a big lift.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett had 20 points--including seven of his team's last
nine--and 18 rebounds Thursday night to lead Minnesota to a 113-111
victory over the Dallas Mavericks at Minneapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew it wasn't major," Garnett said. "I still had my wits about
me. It wasn't like I couldn't remember my name or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak scored 26 points and Chauncey Billups had 23
points and a career-high 17 assists for the Timberwolves, who held a
players-only meeting the day before to address their monthlong slump.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which lost 10 of its first 13 in March, had dropped
seven of its previous eight at home.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nash nearly tied it at the buzzer, but his off-balance shot
with one foot on the three-point line went off the back of the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki scored 34 points and Nick Van Exel had 20 for
Dallas, which dropped into a tie with San Antonio for first place in
the Midwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 112, Cleveland 91--Filling in for the ailing Donyell
Marshall, Andrei Kirilenko and Scott Padgett each scored 17 points to
lead the Jazz at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz solidified its hold on the eighth playoff spot in the
Western Conference, moving four games ahead of the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 85, Atlanta 83--Jerome Williams' putback with 6.1 seconds
left at Atlanta gave the victory to the Raptors, who have won four in
a row since learning that Vince Carter will miss the rest of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 101, Houston 74--Chris Webber scored 19 points and Doug
Christie had 17 at Houston as the Kings defeated the Rockets for the
eighth consecutive time and held Houston to a franchise-record low
29.9% shooting from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 99, Chicago 79--With Allen Iverson out because of a
broken hand and Derrick Coleman sidelined by a sore knee, Eric Snow
scored 24 points and Speedy Claxton 17 to lead the 76ers at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 95, Denver 88--Sam Cassell scored 29 points despite a
painful toe injury and Glenn Robinson had 19 points and 15 rebounds
for the Bucks at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Bucks put guard Michael Redd on the injured list
because of a sprained left knee. Redd, a second-year guard who must
sit out at least five games, is averaging 11.3 points.... Veteran
point guard Robert Pack, a former USC standout, was signed by the
Minnesota Timberwolves for the rest of the season. Pack had signed a
10-day contract with Minnesota on March 18.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sue Bird, the cool, clever point guard who has helped bring
Connecticut within two games of a perfect season, was honored
Thursday as the Associated Press player of the year in women's
basketball</LD>
<LD>   Brenda Oldfield was picked as coach of the year after leading a
remarkable turnaround in her first year at Minnesota, which had its
first winning season since 1993-94.</LD>
<LD>   Bird, a senior, was an overwhelming choice by the 44-member
national media panel that votes in the AP poll. Oldfield edged
Connecticut's Geno Auriemma, a three-time winner, for the coaching
award.</LD>
<TE>   In the three full seasons Bird played, Connecticut reached the
Final Four every year. In her one season cut short by a torn knee
ligament, the Huskies were eliminated in the regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut has lost only nine games since Bird joined the team.
Five of those losses came when she was out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   This is the fourth time a Connecticut player has been the AP
player of the year, an award that started in 1995. Rebecca Lobo won
it that year and was followed by Connecticut's Jennifer Rizzotti in
1996 and Kara Wolters in 1997.</TE>

<LD>Eric Messier scored with 8:58 left as the Colorado Avalanche woke
from their offensive slump just in time to hang on to second place in
the Western Conference Thursday night with a 3-2 win over the San
Jose Sharks at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   The Avalanche ended a three-game losing streak by dominating the
third period against San Jose, which blew a chance to move past
Colorado in the conference standings.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Larsen scored his first NHL goal and Chris Drury also scored
for Colorado, which won in its fifth consecutive game in San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Ricci and Scott Thornton scored for San Jose, which lost for
the fourth time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks' Pacific Division lead over the Kings is one point,
while Colorado's lead over Edmonton in the Northwest Division grew to
seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Philadelphia 1--Sean Hill had a goal and two assists
and Arturs Irbe matched the franchise record with his 115th victory
in goal as the Hurricanes won at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Irbe tied the franchise mark of Mike Liut, who won his 115 games
for the former Hartford Whalers from 1985-90.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 4, Columbus 3--Andrew Cassels scored with 39.4 seconds
left in overtime at Vancouver, as the Canucks rallied from a two-goal
deficit to defeat the Blue Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, Calgary 2--Rob DiMaio and Pierre Turgeon scored goals 66
seconds apart in the third period as the Stars rallied to tie at
Calgary.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Earl Barron scored a career-high 25 points and tournament most
valuable player Dajuan Wagner had 16 as Memphis won the NIT with a
72-62 victory over South Carolina on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Wagner, Memphis' star freshman and a possible lottery pick in the
NBA draft, may have played his last college game.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Coach John Calipari thinks Wagner could be one of the first
13 players taken if he leaves this year and one of the first three
players taken if he leaves next year.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-and-white-clad contingent of Memphis fans stood and
chanted, "One more year! One more year!" when Wagner was taken out of
the game with 47.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   For Calipari, the championship accomplished something he wanted to
get out of the way at this time last season. The Tigers lost in the
NIT semifinals last year, and Calipari was hoping they would make the
NCAA tournament this year. But the Tigers lost five of their last
seven, including a first-round loss to Houston in the Conference USA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Calipari said earlier this week he felt snubbed by the NCAA
tournament. Before Tuesday's semifinals, he said advancing would be
"validation."</TE>
<TE>   First-year South Carolina Coach Dave Odom was bidding for his
second NIT title in three years. He won the tournament with Wake
Forest in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rolando Howell had 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Gamecocks,
who made only eight of 18 from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   The Gamecocks (22-15) stayed close in the first half, but didn't
score in the second until Aaron Lucas made a free throw with 15:50 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas scored South Carolina's first field goal of the half with
13:25 left. But by then, Memphis (27-9) was running away with it.</TE>

<HD>Arkansas Takes Chance on Heath</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stan Heath gave new meaning to the term "one and done" Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The former Michigan State assistant left Kent State after one
season to become coach at Arkansas, replacing the fired Nolan
Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   It's a reasonably good hire for Arkansas, which needed to recruit
a minority coach after the racial questions raised by Richardson's
stormy departure.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Heath is somewhat unproven.</TE>
<TE>   He did persuade Gary Waters' former players at Kent State to come
around to his style of play in plenty of time to make another NCAA
tournament run.</TE>
<TE>   After a second-round loss last year, Kent State went all the way
to the Elite Eight, where a lights-out shooting performance by
Indiana and lock-down defense on Trevor Huffman kept Kent State from
reaching the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   But besides his recruiting work for Tom Izzo at Michigan State and
his impressive 30-6 season at Kent State with another coach's
players, Heath remains an unknown quantity--personable, but with a
brief track record.</TE>
<TE>   The smartest things Heath did were to contact Richardson before
accepting the job, then pay him homage during his introductory news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to thank Coach Richardson," Heath said. "He's opened up
barriers. He's a leader."</TE>
<TE>   His charge will include leading Arkansas to higher graduation
rates. NCAA statistics show Arkansas had a 0% graduation rate among
African American players during one period in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State lost Waters to Rutgers after last season and now must
replace Heath, but Athletic Director Laing Kennedy didn't sound
bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "You do not want to have coaches nobody else wants," Kennedy said.
"In my opinion, Arkansas is one of the top five jobs in America."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder which school among Duke, UCLA, Kentucky, Indiana and North
Carolina he thinks doesn't rate.</TE>
<TE>   Knight Moves</TE>
<TE>   It's an interesting time for Bob Knight watchers, because Knight
is in a fix.</TE>
<TE>   This is his opportunity to show that loyalty--a quality he says is
of utmost importance--isn't a one-way street with him.</TE>
<TE>   You can argue about whether he should speak to Coach Mike Davis,
the former assistant who took the interim job without consulting
Knight after Knight was fired.</TE>
<TE>   The players are a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Leary, a player on the Indiana's last Final Four team in 1992
and now a color commentator on Hoosier radio broadcasts, said as much
to the Indianapolis Star.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bob Knight would just send a telegram to Indiana University
and congratulate all those kids for what they've accomplished, he
would be loved by 99% of the people in the state of Indiana," Leary
told the Star.</TE>
<TE>   "But we all know that will never happen. I don't know why I keep
thinking that Coach Knight will take the high road because he never
does. That's what is most disappointing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Allow that Knight should defer from contacting the players until
after the Final Four so he isn't accused of interfering.</TE>
<TE>   But if he doesn't congratulate his former players next week, any
future talk of loyalty should be met with skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   Leary also took exception to remarks made by Knight's son, Pat
Knight--best man at Leary's wedding--that Davis was disloyal by
taking the job.</TE>
<TE>   "What was Mike Davis supposed to do?" Leary told the Star. "They
think he was disloyal because he didn't pack his bags, take a year
off and head for Lubbock? I think that's crazy. I think if Pat had
been offered that job, even as mad as he was that they had fired his
dad, he would have had a difficult time turning it down."</TE>
<TE>   He also objected to Knight's soliciting financial support for
Texas Tech from former Indiana players.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing he used to say to us over and over was that we
didn't have names on the back of our jerseys because we were playing
for Indiana University," Leary said. "He'd say we weren't playing for
Damon Bailey University, we were playing for IU. He must have said
that two million times.</TE>
<TE>   "He said we should always be loyal to Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "So now I think he should be proud of us that most of us are
continuing to be loyal to IU."</TE>
<TE>   Loans (Not Pay) For Play</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA is moving toward a vote on whether to allow projected
high draft picks to borrow up to $20,000 while still in school.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA management council is to vote on the issue later this
month, after which it would go to the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's some positive legislation that would be there for
our student athletes and eliminate some of the hypocrisies that we
currently have and disenchantment with some of the rules we currently
have," said NCAA President Cedric Dempsey, who is retiring at the end
of the year. "I have encouraged our presidents and our membership to
support much of that legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Spit and Image</TE>
<TE>   Superstitious Coach Roy Williams of Kansas is remembered for
spitting in the Mississippi River for good luck before North Carolina
played in the Final Four in New Orleans when he was a Tar Heel
assistant in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody told me it was good luck to spit in the Mississippi,"
Williams said. "So I did it that year and we won the national
championship. So I did it again in 1993 when we were going through
St. Louis and then did it again this year when we were in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't go around spitting in every little puddle of water
that you can find."</TE>
<TE>   He has other superstitions, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I always know what the record of every coat and tie is. This
year, being 33-3, I can tell you which three outfits I will not be
wearing in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do get them cleaned in between."</TE>
<TE>   Ankle Angles</TE>
<TE>   All Indiana eyes are on the ankle of guard Tom Coverdale, who was
injured against Kent State. He arrived in Atlanta wearing a boot but
walking without the aid of crutches.</TE>
<TE>   In Bloomington, Ind., his ankle was front-page news, and a hotel
marquee pleaded, "Heal fast, 'Cov.'"</TE>
<TE>   His isn't the only injury to watch, however.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas guard Kirk Hinrich also has a sore ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not 100% by any means," Williams said. "I think his stamina
is still in question. He gave me more tired signals in the Oregon
game the other night than I have gotten from him the entire season,
so we are trying to get him some extra time on the [exercise] bike
and things like that because we don't want to pound on his ankle this
week."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's Strength</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson's father, John "Ned" Sampson, is in
Atlanta after flying from San Jose, where he underwent brain surgery
last week before the West Regional games.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson was hopeful but not yet certain his father will be able to
attend Saturday's semifinal game against Indiana.</TE>

<DH>Football School Oklahoma Is Deluged by Basketball Success</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Oklahoma isn't just OK anymore. The sprawling campus is dripping Ws
and dollar signs, an institution of higher football suddenly flush
with Final Fours and lavish sports facilities without hash marks.</LD>
<LD>   For one week, anyway, basketball talk has nudged aside the
relentless speculation on whether Jason White or Nate Hybl will play
quarterback and who will replace graduated linebacker Rocky Calmus.</LD>
<LD>   Fans lining the practice field to watch spring football aren't
forgetting the swift, brilliant resurrection conducted by Coach Bob
Stoops. And no one needs reminding that the program is one season
removed from its seventh national championship.</LD>
<TE>   Yet this could become the greatest Sooner sports year ever,
despite the blemish of an unspeakable gridiron loss to Oklahoma State
and a ho-hum Cotton Bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma is only the third school to put its men's and women's
basketball teams in the Final Four in the same season. Two
championships would rival the school's 1950-51 benchmark when
national titles were won in football, baseball and wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   "It really puts our program into an elite group of schools," said
associate athletic director Jeff Long. "It's a statement about our
program. We're pretty darn good in men's and women's basketball."</TE>
<TE>   What a concept! Sooner story lines involving athletes without
helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Dynamic shooting guard Hollis Price rose from the poverty-stricken
projects of New Orleans to lead the Sooners to a 31-4 record, while
still finding time to date an Italian runway model.</TE>
<TE>   The women's program went from the brink of extinction to a 31-3
record under indomitable former high school coach Sherri Coale, who
has seen average attendance increase from 65 (yes, sixty-five) to
nearly 6,000 in only a few years. Oklahoma's drug-and-gun scandals of
yesteryear are long buried, presumably under the Barry Switzer
Center, a Taj Ma-ball of weight rooms, offices and big screens that
opened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first project completed in the Great Expectations
campaign, a $100-million fund-raising drive that has already brought
in $80 million. At many schools, facilities construction and
renovation are forever on the back burner, something to address
later.</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma, they think "Sooner."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Switzer Center, swallowed in a swirl of dust, already
looks dated. Hard hats are everywhere, yet it's early morning,
several hours before spring football practice is scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   A $50-million renovation of Memorial Stadium is in full swing.
Luxury suites and 8,000 more seats are being added. Bleachers are
being replaced. There will be new administrative offices. New locker
rooms were done first.</TE>
<TE>   From the top of the stadium, blue skies and flat terrain boundless
on all sides, the activity is stunning. And the wealth is spreading.</TE>
<TE>   There's the gleaming softball stadium, only 4 years old, home of
Coach Patty Gasso's 2000 national champions.</TE>
<TE>   There's the renovated baseball stadium, home of Coach Larry
Cochell's perennial top-25 team and 1994 national champions. Luxury
suites and a press box were added in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   There are bleachers for the track, a soccer complex, a wrestling
facility, a tennis center. All new, new, new.</TE>
<TE>   And in place of the old tennis courts, ground has been broken on a
$3.5-million indoor football practice facility.</TE>
<TE>   Superior complex, absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Superiority complex, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say to be a student at the University of Oklahoma, or be
faculty or staff, what great pride you can have in athletics," Long
said. "Not only winning on the court, but in the quality of young
people here."</TE>
<TE>   If character indeed were measured by opulence, Oklahoma would be
beyond reproach. And basketball, for so long considered a diversion
during the months between football season and spring football
practice, is getting its share of the spoils.</TE>
<TE>   The Lloyd Noble Center has been renovated to the tune of $17
million. Coach Kelvin Sampson is only too happy to take a break from
preparing his team for its national semifinal game against Indiana to
lead a tour of the months-old, 63,000-square-foot add-on.</TE>
<TE>   Through a glass wall, players are seen getting treatment in the
spacious training room. Poke a head into the players' lounge next to
the locker room and there's Price, cue stick in hand, eyeing an
eight-ball across clean green felt, teammates watching from
overstuffed leather sofas.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches have new digs too, with a steam room and one shower
for the assistants, another for Sampson. In a meeting room, chairs
face a theater-sized projection screen.</TE>
<TE>   The whole place smells of fresh paint. Sure enough, on the way
down the hall to the new practice gym, Sampson passes a man on his
knees, carefully applying crimson enamel to the baseboards. The coach
pats him on the head: Keep up the good work.</TE>
<TE>   The words also apply to Athletic Director Joe Castiglione.</TE>
<TE>   "Administrators fall into two categories," Sampson says,
"inhibitors and facilitators. We've got a facilitator."</TE>
<TE>   Castiglione, 44, came from Missouri four years ago and adapted
instantly, tapping into alumni wealth, treating all sports with
respect and bringing new meaning to '70s pop psychology, pumping up
his coaches by saying, "I'm OK, you're OK. We're all OK."</TE>
<TE>   He also hired Stoops, who not only brought the football team back
to prominence but buys into the family concept.</TE>
<TE>   When the basketball team left for Dallas before the first round of
the NCAA tournament, Stoops slapped hands with players boarding the
bus. And he wore a Final Four T-shirt and cap Monday during a news
conference before the first spring football practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Championship runs rub off on players [from other sports]," Stoops
said. "You watch those [basketball] teams play defense? It's amazing,
isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Sampson marvels too. He is standing in his new practice gym. "This
is the thing I always dreamed of, you kidding me?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   The floor of the Noble Center is lifted after the season and the
venue is used for concerts, leaving the team nowhere to practice. Now
the problem is solved--for both teams. The women have a new practice
gym too.</TE>
<TE>   Only 12 years ago, the school dropped women's basketball. But the
Women's Basketball Coaches' convention happened to be underway,
leading to an organized protest that prompted Oklahoma to reinstate
the sport eight days later.</TE>
<TE>   Coale heard the news while riffling through her mail in the
teachers' lounge at Norman High, where she was coaching. Six years
later, Oklahoma hired her, leading to cries that the school again was
trying to torpedo the program, this time by bringing in a high school
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through her 5-22 first season, she came home after a
one-sided loss to Texas Tech, opened the kitchen door and collapsed
on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband Dane helped her up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I can do this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Consider it done. Oklahoma has been to the Sweet 16 three
consecutive years, and blitzed Colorado, 94-60, in an Elite Eight
game last week.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be part of it to really realize how far it's come,"
said senior Stacey Dales, the Big 12 player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson sprang from similar humble roots. His first coaching job
was at tiny Montana Tech, where he drove a dilapidated team bus over
mountains and through blizzards to games. Then there were seven years
at pitiable Washington State, where he escaped in 1994 with a .500
record.</TE>
<TE>   So going to a football school reluctant to allow basketball out of
the back seat fit nicely with his underdog mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always best with causes," he says. "Football will always be
the heartbeat and that's fine. But we have our own niche."</TE>
<TE>   He's carved it by making the NCAA tournament in each of his eight
seasons, joining Roy Williams of Kansas as the only coaches to do so.
The first four years, though, the Sooners lost in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma made it to the Sweet 16 seeded 13th in 1999, but was
upset in the second round the following year and lost in the first
round last season. This is the breakthrough, the school's best season
since making the final in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Driving to church Sunday, I saw stands all over Norman selling
Final Four T-shirts," Sampson said. "People get out of their cars at
stoplights, run to my window and give me high fives."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he was able to find a cause and cast this team as
unappreciated. The Sooners defeated Kansas for the Big 12 tournament
title, yet were seeded second in the West, behind Cincinnati. He
huddled with his team.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we're going to thrive on, not being a No. 1 seed,"
Price said.</TE>
<TE>   The theme continues because there is talk that the Kansas-Maryland
semifinal is the de facto championship game. Conveniently overlooked
is that Oklahoma has defeated both teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll use that as motivation too," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Next season, it will be difficult for Sampson to play the underdog
card. Four starters, Price among them, are due to return, and the
recruiting class is considered the best in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, Oklahoma's facilities will be the envy of every
visiting team. Basketball might never be on the level of football
here, but no-respect Montana Tech it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson laughs. "I'll adjust. It's not like I'm going to resign
because of it."</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Is Making Big Strides</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Once awkward 7-foot center is becoming a
force for the Clippers. Re-signing him is considered key to team's
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was once languid, but now he's driven. He was awkward; now he's
smooth. He was timid; now he's fearless. He was an afterthought; now
he's a go-to guy. He was booed; now he's cheered.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the day Clipper center Michael Olowokandi's game changed
coincided with the day his life changed.</LD>
<LD>   Arrested in the early-morning hours of Dec. 1 after a scuffle with
a former girlfriend, Olowokandi spent the rest of the night in the
Manhattan Beach jail. The Los Angeles County district attorney
declined some weeks later to file charges against him, but the
experience was difficult for him.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, it alters who you are to a certain extent," said
Olowokandi, 26, who stands 7 feet and weighs 270 pounds. "It was an
unfortunate situation. I'm still friendly, cordial with her. She
didn't use good judgment. She said things to the police to get at me.
Did it change my perception of people? I can't let things change who
I am. I guess I should be more careful with people. I am a trusting
person by nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hate to be in a position that when basketball is over I've
become a changed person, that I'm not a fun-loving person."</TE>
<TE>   It has been obvious to longtime observers of Olowokandi that he
has become more assertive on the basketball court since his arrest.
He appears to be more willing to stand up for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi got into an altercation with Shaquille O'Neal in the
closing moments of the Clippers' loss March 15 to the Lakers, then
suggested to reporters that O'Neal "needs to grow up." He became so
angry at a referee's decision in Tuesday's loss to the Sacramento
Kings that he kicked the ball the length of the court, drawing a
technical foul. He also has become more of a floor leader, taking his
teammates to task for all manner of transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's truly a remarkable turnaround," said Bill Walton, a TV
commentator and former NBA standout. "Here's a guy who didn't seem
all that interested in playing basketball, much less being a top
player. Industriousness and enthusiasm, two cornerstones of John
Wooden's 'Pyramid of Success,' were two traits that I didn't
associate with Michael Olowokandi."</TE>
<TE>   Consider that Olowokandi had only seven 20-point games during his
first 31/2 seasons in the NBA but has eight since Jan. 28, including
a career-best 30 points in a March 8 victory over the Chicago Bulls.
He is averaging 16.2 points and 10.8 rebounds in 13 games this month.
His overall averages this season are 10.2 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Question is, has Olowokandi's metamorphosis from "robotic stiff,"
in the words of Walton, to "showing his competitive fire" (Walton
again) ensured his swift departure from the Clippers? Will he be too
good to keep beyond this season or next?</TE>
<TE>   There has been much speculation about Olowokandi's future in
recent weeks and there's certain to be more. If he's not signed to an
extension, he'll be a restricted free agent July 1, with the Clippers
able to match any outside offer.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said last week that he has heard nothing from his
agent, Bill Duffy, or Clipper management about a new contract. But
he's not worried--at least not yet.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it wouldn't be the first time a professional athlete
was motivated to improve his play because he sought the security of a
bigger and better deal.</TE>
<TE>   But Olowokandi insisted he is focused on a game he is only now, in
his seventh season of organized play, beginning to master. He's
leaving the contractual matters to his agent.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the Clippers are locked in their first playoff chase
since 1996-97, and as remarkable as it sounds, Olowokandi is helping
to lead them. Anyone who has seen Olowokandi wheel and deal on the
low block in the last few weeks has been impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Olowokandi was incredible," San Antonio Coach Gregg
Popovich said after watching him score 26 points and take 17 rebounds
in the Spurs' victory over the Clippers on Monday. "He definitely was
all over the floor. He really kept us honest down there and really
made a game of it."</TE>
<TE>   Walton thought so much of Olowokandi's play that he sought him out
after the game to offer a few kind words. "I told him, 'Michael,
congratulations, you've become a real basketball player,'" Walton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper forward Corey Maggette put it another way: "I feel Michael
Olowokandi has improved 300% from where he started. He has become a
dominant big man. The sky is the limit for him. But they still need
to pay him that money."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Olowokandi is a test case for just how serious the
Clippers are about keeping perhaps the NBA's best young team together
until it fulfills its potential. Olowokandi's growing presence in the
middle has allowed All-Star Elton Brand to concentrate on his more
natural position, power forward. Brand already has said that his
future with the team is tied to Olowokandi's.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor wants to keep Olowokandi in
the fold.</TE>
<TE>   "He's vital to the future of this franchise," Baylor said. "He's
getting better and better all the time. I think he will be one of the
top five centers in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry made his wishes clear earlier this
week, when he said, "Obviously, I'd like for the whole team to stay
together. My recommendation would be to keep them all together.
You've got a big guy, a pretty good center who has a chance to become
a very good center. He's working toward that.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to keep guys like that around."</TE>
<TE>   In order to appreciate how far Olowokandi has come, it's important
to know how and where his basketball career began.</TE>
<TE>   He was 17 and living in London when he touched a basketball for
the first time. It was tucked away in the back of his high school's
athletic equipment room, behind the soccer and rugby balls and
cricket bats you would expect to find in his native England.</TE>
<TE>   "I played basketball because it was something different," he said.
"It was something I always wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Until that day, Olowokandi had been a soccer player and a long-
and triple-jumper. He was soon hooked on basketball, dominating
schoolmates during pick-up games in which double-dribbling was as
commonplace as a swished 15-foot jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   On his 20th birthday, Olowokandi opened a book of U.S. colleges
and picked the University of the Pacific at random. With no thoughts
of attending the school, but merely interested in learning about
transferring, he picked up the phone and spoke to Tiger assistant
Tony Marcopolos.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Thomason, Pacific head coach, had jokingly told his assistants
they should never leave the office unattended "because you never know
when a 7-footer would walk through the door." And here was one on the
telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi was sold on Pacific in minutes, offering to attend the
school without a basketball scholarship. In fact, he didn't get one
until right before his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   "I went from London, trendy and sophisticated, to Stockton, which
is pretty rural, and you can imagine what that was like," Olowokandi
said. "Maybe it was what I needed to focus on basketball."</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, Olowokandi played only at the end of one-sided
games. He didn't know the rules. He had natural ability, but the
skills honed by other collegiate players over the years were sadly
lacking. As a junior, he was injured for part of the season.</TE>
<TE>   As a senior, he finally began to show signs of being the player he
would become, averaging 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds and earning Big
West Conference player-of-the-year honors. The Clippers made him the
top pick in the 1998 draft, taking heat for a selection every other
team probably would have made if in the same position.</TE>
<TE>   After three seasons, it seemed to outsiders that the Clippers
could live without Olowokandi just fine if 2001-02 were like his
previous seasons. Lamar Odom was considered their best player and
they had acquired Brand from the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers felt differently and tried, but failed, to work out
an extension during training camp last October. In the end, both
sides were willing to wait to see if Olowokandi could improve on his
three-season averages of 9.1 points and 7.4 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were hopeful a breakout season was at hand, but they
also challenged him to excel at every opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor, perhaps Olowokandi's biggest supporter, had seen the
player improve during practices and offered this advice: "Do that in
the games."</TE>
<TE>   Igor Kokoskov, who became an assistant to Gentry before last
season, approached Olowokandi upon meeting him for the first time and
said, "I've seen you play and I'm not impressed, given your natural
ability."</TE>
<TE>   Said Olowokandi: "I didn't like hearing that."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry turned Kokoskov loose on Olowokandi, instructing him to
improve the big man's footwork while also diversifying his shot
selection. They spent hours in the gym, Olowokandi setting up for
jumpers and hook shots in and around the paint while Kokoskov
rebounded and fed pass after pass to him.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be patient with big guys," Kokoskov said. "I could
see he was capable of doing so many things, but I'm never satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Something finally clicked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I always thought I could do, but for some reason I
didn't," Olowokandi said. "This season I have more of an offensive
array. I'm more successful at it because I'm more confident doing it.
There are things I'm doing now in games that I never thought I would
do last season."</TE>

<HD>Fire Ravages Lower Owens River Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time I was on the lower Owens River I felt totally removed
from civilization. I was on a drift boat with guide Tom Loe and one
of his fly-fishing clients.</LD>
<LD>   We were surrounded throughout the trip by willows, cottonwoods and
wild rose, which lined the banks so thickly that we seemed in our own
little world.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing visible beyond this world, over the tops of the
trees, were the snow-covered peaks of the Eastern Sierra.</LD>
<TE>   Now I'm told, by Loe and others, that I would no longer recognize
this marvelous stretch of river.</TE>
<TE>   A fire swept down its banks last Friday, consuming most of the
cottonwoods, willows and wild rose from below the Highway 6 bridge
downstream to the East Line St. bridge, covering nearly 10 miles of
meandering waterway.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire remains under investigation but California
Dept. of Forestry Owens Valley Chief Kenneth Toy told the Inyo
Register in Bishop this week that "it doesn't appear to be natural
causes."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is speculation among some Bishop locals that the
blaze may have been set intentionally to enable access to a portion
of river long reserved for those able to handle drift boats--a
portion that had served as a sanctuary of sorts for brown and rainbow
trout because of its limited access.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence to support such speculation, but the fact
remains that now, with the terrain resembling a moonscape, anyone
with a car is able to drive nearly to water's edge, get out and cast
their wares wherever they please.</TE>
<TE>   This part of the Lower Owens is open year-round to fishing, and it
is stocked every other week through a program funded by the Bishop
Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau. But the fear is that it will
be overrun when the multitudes arrive for the April 27 opening of the
region's general trout season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brand new water; it's bound to be attractive," says Vance
Spitznagel, a clerk at Culver's Sporting Goods in Bishop. "I just
hope they bring some fresh air filters [for their cars] because
there'll still be lots of ash."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Schmauss, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce,
expressed concern that so much vehicle traffic will prevent the
natural rejuvenation of what had been such a beautiful stretch of
river.</TE>
<TE>   The Owens River runs through Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power property and the stretch in question is open to public day use.
There are no plans to restrict access, DWP spokesman Chris Plakos
said.</TE>
<TE>   The only two guide outfits that run drift trips on the Lower
Owens--Loe's Sierra Drifters and Gary Gunsolley's Brock's Flyfishing
Specialists--are advocates of catch-and-release fishing. There is a
deep animosity between them and the catch-and-keep crowd that
heretofore has had access through a handful of narrow footpaths.</TE>
<TE>   On my trip with Loe, as he rounded one of many bends in the river,
an old man on the river's edge made sure to show off a stringer of
fish, and particularly a lone wild brown. Loe held his tongue, but
muttered something about hoping the man choked on the bones.</TE>
<TE>   Now Loe, who has temporarily moved to a section of river below
East Line Street, is angry at the DWP for not doing a better job of
enforcing after-hours restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   He points to a smaller blaze last November downriver toward Big
Pine, believed to have been set by an illegal campfire.</TE>
<TE>   Plakos countered by saying that river patrols, using trucks and a
helicopter, have been conducted daily since last Sept. 11, and that
appropriate law enforcement agencies are asked to deal with those who
don't heed after-hours requests to vacate.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't use strong-arm tactics because that's not our job,"
Plakos says. "But the [Inyo County] Sheriff's Dept. has been
extremely cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   Laws and Order</TE>
<TE>   Bishop leaders breathed a huge sigh of relief when the fire failed
to reach, by only a few yards, its preeminent landmark: the Laws
Railroad Museum.</TE>
<TE>   More than 450 firefighters from various agencies battled the
blaze, which consumed 840 acres. No human lives were lost.</TE>
<TE>   His Dog Spot</TE>
<TE>   Spitznagel says anglers are already beginning to show on the banks
of the Lower Owens, but added that 16 inches of ash has been a pretty
good deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "I took my white springer spaniel over there to look around the
other day and she came out looking like a black lab," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spirit of '95</TE>
<TE>   If Saturday's salmon opener is anything like the 1995 opener,
"It'll go ballistic around here," predicts Andy Manoux, general
manager at Sea Landing in Santa Barbara. "Everybody wants to catch
salmon."</TE>
<TE>   Local salmon seasons typically materialize this far south every
few years, when king salmon find conditions cool and productive
enough to make so long a trip--they typically stay north of Monterey.
But seven years have passed since the tasty swimmers have come en
masse.</TE>
<TE>   Why all the optimism this year? For starters, anglers on coastal
rockfish trips from Oxnard to Santa Barbara have been catching salmon
incidentally--releasing them, of course--for more than two weeks.
They've run anywhere from 10 to 30 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, conditions are similar to what they were in '95, with water
temperatures in the low 50s and with bait fish holding close to
shore.</TE>
<TE>   The daily bag season is two, with a minimum size of 24 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Blues</TE>
<TE>   Every year at this time, complaints come this way from tourists
and residents of the East Cape region of southern Baja California.
During Lent, many residents give up meat in favor of fish, and
fisherman respond by stepping up their activities to satisfy the
increasing demand. East Cape waters are popular because they're
fairly productive and because enforcement of fisheries regulations is
notoriously nil.</TE>
<TE>   This year, one of the complaints arrived in an e-mail from an East
Cape dive master sickened by what he called the wanton slaughter of
mobula rays, commonly mistaken for manta rays.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fleet of several pangas parked on the beach just south
of Palmas de Cortez," the e-mail read. "They mostly bottom fish at
night. They make their own harpoons out of rebar. What I saw was two
guys in two pangas. The one driving idles the boat up on a school of
mantas on the surface. The other stands on the bow and waits for a
good shot. In the past they have just brought in the whole ray. These
guys were cutting off the wings and throwing the body back."</TE>
<TE>   Mobulas and especially giant Pacific mantas are considered
valuable tourist attractions by the diving community, but they are
not federally protected. Being easier to locate and handle, the
smaller mobulas are targeted seasonally throughout southern Baja.
Their flesh is stringy and brings less than 50 cents per pound, but a
single mobula can yield 25 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Bucking the Odds</TE>
<TE>   If Jim Betts of Yreka, Calif., were a betting man, not even he
would have wagered on this.</TE>
<TE>   When his wife, son and daughter applied for recent north-state
deer, elk and antelope tags, the chances of all of them getting drawn
were slim enough. Blacktail deer tags were readily available, but
Janine Betts' odds of bagging a deer about 3-1, according to the
Department of Fish and Game. Son Ryan's odds of getting drawn for the
Roosevelt elk hunt were 44-1, his chance of success 3-1; and daughter
Rechelle's odds of getting drawn for the pronghorn antelope hunt were
74-1, her chance of success 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did they each get drawn--they each bagged their critters.
Overall, the DFG said, their chances of collective success from start
to finish were 240,000-1.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Betts was not drawn for any of the hunts.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Yosemite National Park announced this week that the last half-mile
of the popular trail to Half Dome will be closed for repairs July 8
through Sept. 19, Mondays through Thursdays from 7 a.m.-4 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Phone Betting Isn't Hurting</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Industry leaders say on-track wagering has
not been adversely affected by legalization of service in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Told that newly legalized telephone betting in California had
accounted for more than $13 million in horse bets in two months, one
racing board member wondered if business was already tapering off,
while another industry official speculated that there might be a
windfall ahead.</LD>
<LD>   What all industry leaders seemed to agree upon during the
California Horse Racing Board's meeting Thursday in Monrovia is that
phone and Internet wagering has not adversely affected on-track
business--one of the industry's biggest fears.</LD>
<LD>   One of the three companies licensed in January and February to
take phone and Internet bets, XpressBet, reported to the racing board
that it had signed up 7,900 horseplayers. A spokesman for the
Television Games Network (TVG), another licensee, said that it had
approved about 3,000 accounts, with the customer base increasing by
50% in the last month.</LD>
<TE>   And TVG's business, hamstrung until April because it has no
contract with the two major winter tracks--Santa Anita and Gulfstream
Park in Florida--is expected to grow dramatically when Hollywood Park
opens on April 24. XpressBet, which is owned by Magna Entertainment,
the Frank Stronach-led company that owns Santa Anita and Gulfstream,
has no deal with Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The third phone-betting license-holder, Youbet.com, was
represented at Thursday's meeting by David Marshall, who founded the
company, left it and has recently returned as chief executive officer
following the departure of Ron Luniewski, who has signed on with
Magna and XpressBet. Marshall did not say how many customers Youbet
has. The Los Angeles-based company has shown a deficit of more than
$31 million in 2000-01. TVG, which also operates a 24-hour horse
racing network on cable systems in California and other states, has
lost even more money--an estimated $100 million in three years--but
its corporate parent, Gemstar-TV Guide, despite recent heavy losses
of its own, appears to be staying the course.</TE>
<TE>   John Harris, one of California's leading breeders and horse owners
and a board member, remains cautious about the expansion of phone
betting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's been that much growth in the last few
weeks, and that's a concern," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Hannah, a vice president for Magna, shared Harris'
apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   "XpressBet's business in California seems to have stabilized,"
Hannah said. "I would like to see the early upward trend continue."</TE>
<TE>   John Van de Kamp, president of the Thoroughbred Owners of
California, is more bullish about phone betting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're projecting that the handle will reach about $117 million by
the end of the year," Van de Kamp said in remarks made outside the
meeting. "Well down the line, there's the potential to grow this part
of the business to where the annual handle could hit $500 million, or
even $750 million. If the foreign audience can get involved, the
sky's the limit. As it is, I think we've just scratched the surface."</TE>
<TE>   Of the $13 million bet from Jan. 25 through March 17, XpressBet
accounted for $9.25 million, TVG handled $3.3 million and Youbet took
in about $500,000. The $13 million represents 3.4% of the total
handle at all California tracks during this period. Of the total
phone-bet handle, 85.6% was bet on thoroughbreds, 9.8% on
standardbreds and 4.6% on quarter horses. The three phone-bet
companies are also licensed to take bets on races at out-of-state
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Liebau, president of Magna's three California tracks--Santa
Anita, Golden Gate and Bay Meadows--said that on-track business at
Santa Anita and Golden Gate was not impacted by the introduction of
phone betting, and Rick Henson, speaking for Los Alamitos, echoed
that observation. Earlier this month, Santa Anita raised purse money
by 5% at its meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say that phone betting had something to do with our
purse hike," Liebau said. "But in truth I think it's got more to do
with the good weather we've had this winter and the great number of
[pick-six] carryovers that have brought the bettors out."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Landsburg, a horse owner and chairman of the racing board,
urged the phone-betting companies to emphasize the horses and the
jockeys in their marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we try to bring back the lapsed player and
also develop new fans," Landsburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Customer criticism resulting from long phone delays was addressed
by Hannah of XpressBet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now handling the average customer in 136 seconds," Hannah
said. "Our goal is 120 seconds, or two minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Harris thinks XpressBet should aim even higher.</TE>
<TE>   "Two minutes for a horseplayer is like an eternity," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that a phone-betting company be contracted with
the Thoroughbred Owners of California, and such an agreement is not
in place between TVG and the owners, with Hollywood Park's opener
less than a month away. Both Van de Kamp, speaking for the horse
owners, and John Hindman, vice president for communications for TVG,
expect to get together.</TE>
<TE>   The Kentucky Derby at Hollywood Park's parent track, Churchill
Downs, is traditionally a big betting draw in California, and this
year's race will be run on May 4. Racing board officials said
Thursday that they expect a big increase in new phone accounts as the
Derby approaches.</TE>

<HD>Rivalry Is More Than It Seems</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Does Geno like Pat? Does Pat like Geno? Geno has better players, Pat
has more players. Pat has made the women's game what it is, Geno is
making the women's game what it's going to be.</LD>
<LD>   There may be no more contentious rivalry in sports than
Connecticut versus Tennessee in women's college basketball. There may
be no more intriguing dynamic than that between Connecticut Coach
Geno Auriemma and Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt.</LD>
<LD>   When Auriemma is asked about his relationship with Summitt,
Connecticut guard Sue Bird starts choking on her soda while Auriemma
makes a face.</LD>
<TE>   Summitt is asked about her relationship with Auriemma and she says
that it used to be great and then it changed. "And I didn't change,"
Summitt says, the implication being clear. That Geno has gotten too
big for his britches.</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason Auriemma and Summitt barely exchange a word or
gesture other than a postgame handshake and lukewarm "hellos" in the
hall. They are the same person. They live for basketball. They work
their players harder than anyone else and they desperately want to
win.</TE>
<TE>   And the outcome of this weekend's games at the women's Final Four
in the Alamodome could well signal a change in the dynamic of this
annual get-together.</TE>
<TE>   First it was Immaculata and Delta State and Old Dominion. Then
Texas and USC and Louisiana Tech. Women's college basketball has been
marked by mini-dynasties. The sport's evolution can be mapped by a
series of dominating programs.</TE>
<TE>   And from the late 1980s until now, Tennessee and Summitt have been
the be-all and end-all of the sport. Little girls all over the
country wanted to be recruited by Summitt, wanted to be good enough
to be a Lady Vol because, if you were, you would surely go to a Final
Four and probably win a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   But change is happening again.</TE>
<TE>   If Connecticut, beats Tennessee tonight in the semifinals, then
beats either Oklahoma or Duke in Sunday's final, it will be official.
Connecticut and Auriemma will be the power.</TE>
<TE>   Summitt and the Lady Vols and their 24,000 orange-wearing, "Rocky
Top"-singing faithful will have to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   This is something like the 1975 men's NCAA final, when John
Wooden's last UCLA team played Kentucky. UCLA won, but Kentucky was
poised to start a new era.</TE>
<TE>   As Tennessee coach, Summitt has won six NCAA titles and 20
Southeastern Conference titles. Without Tennessee, there would be no
Connecticut. Auriemma has been chasing Summitt for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   This chase has been great for the game. When Connecticut and
Tennessee play, it is the one time basketball fans--not just women's
basketball fans, but basketball fans--pay attention. The stage can't
be big enough for Auriemma and Summitt. There is no exchanging of
hugs and compliments, no weekly phone calls, no golf games after the
season.</TE>
<TE>   There is respect. That's all, and that's plenty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, when the Lady Vols went 39-0 and won their third
consecutive NCAA title, and won it over Louisiana Tech by 18 points,
at the time the largest margin of victory in a title game, it seemed
Tennessee would never lose. A stretch of titles was expected for
Summitt, who was supposed to have on hand the greatest recruiting
class.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here we are, four years later, and Connecticut is 37-0, aiming
for its third national title and possessing what is considered to be
the best recruiting class in the nation on its way. Since 1998,
Tennessee has missed the Final Four twice (1999 and 2001) and was
beaten, 71-52, in the 2000 final by Connecticut, the worst-ever
defeat suffered in a national championship game. It would surprise
nobody if Connecticut wins by more than that tonight.</TE>
<TE>   It is good for the game that a university without a big-time
football program and all the financial and institutional advantages
that brings can grab the spotlight. It is great for the game that a
school in the media-heavy Northeast is having a record-breaking
season. It is great for the game that Tennessee's dynasty might be
toppled.</TE>
<TE>   "This rivalry," Auriemma says, "has taken on a bigger-than-life
significance, more so than it probably should. That's probably
because there's not enough games like this. But they always seem to
be where we want to go and we always seem to be where they want to
go."</TE>
<TE>   To which Summitt said, "We don't care who we beat. We just want
the title."</TE>
<TE>   This is the difference between Auriemma and Summitt, between
Connecticut and Tennessee. Auriemma's Huskies have had to acknowledge
Tennessee's dominance and lust after Tennessee's crown. Summitt's
Lady Vols have to act as if everyone is equal. Except them. Except
Tennessee.</TE>

<HD>ISU Refuses Request to Delay Judge's Hearing</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Le Gougne's lawyer says action will hinder
defense against charges of unethical conduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French figure skating
judge suspended by the International Skating Union during the Salt
Lake City Olympics, said Thursday the ISU's refusal to postpone a
hearing into her alleged misconduct will hamper his defense against
charges she acted unethically in judging the pairs event.</LD>
<LD>   "It does put a hardship on us. It does prejudice us," said Maxwell
Miller of Salt Lake City, who is representing Le Gougne. "I'm not
sure we're going to have time to take everyone's deposition and
prepare....</LD>
<LD>   "I think she is a target and a scapegoat, and if there is
misconduct, there is misconduct by a lot of people, and it's unfair
for the ISU to single her out."</LD>
<TE>   Miller said he received an electronic transcript last week of
testimony from about 10 witnesses--including fellow
judges--interviewed by the ISU regarding events surrounding the pairs
competition. Miller said the transcript showed some questions were
slanted against Le Gougne, some testimony was contradictory and some
obvious questions were not asked.</TE>
<TE>   To interview the ISU's witnesses and others of his choosing,
Miller asked that the hearing--scheduled for April 29-30 in Lausanne,
Switzerland--be delayed 30 to 60 days. His request was rejected
Thursday. ISU officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "In reading the list, our feeling was there were inconsistencies
and biases in the questioning, and they had made up their minds to
use Marie-Reine as a scapegoat," Miller said. "We were not invited to
participate in those depositions.... I'm not sure we're going to be
able to interview all of those people. We asked them to subpoena some
people, and there's a provision under federal law for them to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne, a veteran judge, voted for Russians Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier
in the free skate finale Feb. 11. A 5-4 majority gave the Russian duo
the gold medal. However, she later told ISU President Ottavio
Cinquanta she had "submitted to a certain pressure" from the French
federation to vote for the Russians, although she later denied having
been coerced and said she voted her conscience.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee, on the recommendation of the
ISU, awarded duplicate gold medals to Sale and Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also filed complaints with the ISU alleging pairs referee
Ron Pfenning and ISU technical committee chair Sally-Anne Stapleford
made false accusations and "exercised undue influence" over Le
Gougne. Both told Cinquanta they heard Le Gougne say she had been
pressured to vote for Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. Miller also filed
a complaint about Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie, who told reporters Le
Gougne told him in November she had been pressured to favor the
Russians at Salt Lake City. Le Gougne denied having said that, but
Miller said Lavoie should be sanctioned for not reporting the alleged
conversation to the ISU before the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic judging scandal led Cinquanta to outline sweeping
reforms in scoring and judging. But the reforms have not been added
to the agenda of the ISU's June council meeting in Kyoto, Japan.</TE>

<HD>Serena Bully of Her Block</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Williams scales a mental barrier against sister
Venus to reach Key Biscayne final with a dazzling 6-2, 6-2 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES BRICKER</AU>
<BD>FORT LAUDERDALE SUN SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>She was ruthless and relentless, as golden as her sneakers.</LD>
<LD>   But more than anything, and for the first time in a meaningful
match against her older sister, Serena Williams was as unflappable as
Buddha.</LD>
<LD>   In a heavily publicized semifinal Thursday that signaled the final
leap to maturity of the most physically imposing player in women's
tennis, Serena beat back the emotional demons that had cursed her
previous efforts, overcoming what she called a "mental block" to
defeat Venus, 6-2, 6-2, and soar into the final of the Nasdaq-100
Open.</LD>
<TE>   Her opponent in the final Saturday will be top-seeded Jennifer
Capriati, who overcame two match points to beat No. 5 Monica Seles,
4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4), closing out the victory at 12:17 a.m. EST.</TE>
<TE>   "This definitely is a very big milestone for me and all the
younger sisters and brothers out there," Serena said after 50 minutes
of powder-keg tennis in which she slashed winner after winner and was
so devastating with her returns that Venus won only one of 16
second-serve points.</TE>
<TE>   Serena's smile was on high beam and her laughter spontaneous as
she reveled in this watershed victory. Yet when the giddiness
subsided, there were also moments of sobriety.</TE>
<TE>   "I was serious at the beginning of the year when I said my goal
was to be No. 1," said Serena, bidding for her first title at Key
Biscayne and 13th of her career. "I'm serious now. That's where I
want to be, at the top spot."</TE>
<TE>   No one ever doubted her skill. It was her mental makeup that had
held her back in prime-time losses to Venus at the 1999 Key Biscayne
final and in the 2000 Wimbledon semis.</TE>
<TE>   But at 20 and with the stronger resolve that comes with age, there
were no nerves Thursday, only thunderbolts. Yet to say this victory
was achieved solely on raw power would be incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams put her complete game on display with three
memorable pieces of finesse.</TE>
<TE>   First, with Venus serving at 2-4 in the opening set, Serena lofted
a perfect offensive lob for a winner to bring the game to deuce.</TE>
<TE>   Three points later, she hit a sensational short-angled backhand
crosscourt pass--a shot that must be delicately stroked, not crushed.</TE>
<TE>   In the second set, serving at 0-1, Serena raced wide of the
forehand doubles alley to tomahawk back a shot with such perfection
that it induced Venus to stroke wide. It was the shot of the match.</TE>
<TE>   "Shocked" was the word Serena used after the women shook hands,
but did not embrace, at the net.</TE>
<TE>   Both women over the last three years have downplayed Serena's
emotional meltdowns. This time, however, Serena not only talked about
it, she reveled in her newfound strength after moving to 2-5 against
her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it definitely removed a mental block for me. But this is
just one match of many. Just one win. You can't just beat someone one
time. You have to beat them several times," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Venus spoke with reporters in a barely audible voice. "I never
really got into the match. Before I knew it, it was over," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time in five matches Venus had lost an opening
set. Serena needed to maintain her aggressiveness, and she did.</TE>
<TE>   With Venus serving in Game 1 of the second set, Serena smacked two
wild forehands to fall behind, 40-love. Said Serena, "I desperately
needed to calm down. Venus really likes to make a lot of comebacks. I
knew she wasn't going to give it to me. I was going to have to win
it."</TE>
<TE>   She held serve at love to even the set at 1-1, then broke with
another finesse shot--a floating backhand slice that broke Venus'
rhythm. She slapped her shot into the net and Serena led, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, serving for the match, Serena walked to the
service mark and bounced the ball 20 times, 11 off her racket and
nine more out of her hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just like, 'OK, Serena.' I was thinking I need to get a
first serve in. I don't know if I did or didn't," she admitted.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't. But she quickly took command of the final point off
her second serve and polished it off.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the biggest win in my career," she said. Bigger
than the U.S. Open title in 1999?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even remember that," Serena said playfully. "I need to go
ahead and win another Grand Slam. That was so long ago. This is
getting ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing ridiculous, however, about this victory. She's
no longer the little sister. She's the younger sister, which makes
all the emotional difference in the world.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Takes His Time in Victory Over Safin</HD>

<BD>FT. LAUDERDALE SUN SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt combined a little patience with a little
more patience to defeat sixth-seeded Marat Safin, 2-6, 6-2, 7-6 (4),
in a rousing men's quarterfinal at the Nasdaq-100 Open on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The match took 2 hours 44 minutes and was full of long baseline
rallies, rocket serves, spectacular shots and, in a surprise to those
who have watched the fiery Safin, championship-quality composure.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, the 21-year-old Australian, will play 12th-seeded Roger
Federer in one of today's semifinals. Ninth-seeded Andre Agassi plays
Marcelo Rios in the other.</LD>
<TE>   Federer, who hasn't had his serve broken in the tournament,
dispatched Andrei Pavel, 6-1, 6-1, on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But that match was nothing compared to the drama and intrigue of
the one involving Hewitt and Safin, who have won the last two U.S.
Open titles.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, the world's top-ranked player and the 2001 U.S. Open
winner, entered the quarterfinal with a 14-match win streak and
tournament titles at San Jose and Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Safin packs booming serves, a bit of a temper, and has the 2000
U.S. Open title on his resume.</TE>
<TE>   However, after winning the first set Thursday, Safin couldn't keep
his serve going and ran into problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The serve made the difference," Safin said of Hewitt, regarded as
one of the tour's best returners. "Without the serve you can't beat
this guy."</TE>
<TE>   After finding his game in the second set, Hewitt was tough to
derail en route to his 22nd consecutive victory on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, who hasn't lost since the first round of the Australian
Open (when he had chickenpox), had to be patient and not force
things.</TE>
<TE>   Safin made a beautiful backhand diving shot to extend the
match--which featured 10 breaks in 21 opportunities--and force the
tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't much I could do about it," said Hewitt, who won when
Safin hit a couple of errant backhands down the line.</TE>
<TE>   Federer used blistering serves and punishing ground strokes to
keep Pavel from mounting a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," Federer said. "Hit the ball very focused. I mean, I
really couldn't ask for more."</TE>
<TE>   Federer, 21, is hoping to use this tournament as a springboard
toward establishing himself as one of the world's top players.</TE>
<TE>   "I really would like to reach the top 10 as soon as possible,"
said Federer, who finished last year ranked 13th and upset Pete
Sampras at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something very special for any player.... I'd like to make
the next step."</TE>

<HD>Tagliabue's Bad Call Reversed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may not happen often, but it appears that NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue made a tactical mistake.</LD>
<LD>   He thought he could railroad through a provision that would give
ABC the option of cherry-picking games for "Monday Night Football"
during the final four weeks of the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   He talked about it with reporters at the recent NFL owners'
meeting in Orlando, Fla., before discussing it with Fox and CBS. That
was a mistake.</LD>
<TE>   Fox and CBS wouldn't go along with giving away top attractions to
a competitor. So when the NFL schedule was announced Thursday,
"Monday Night Football" got a traditional set schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was awkward for everyone," Fox Sports President Ed
Goren said Thursday. "In the current environment, where all the NFL
television partners are facing a tough marketplace, where every tenth
of a rating point is critical, to change the method of game selection
in the middle of a contract just wasn't realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We had open and frank discussions. We're willing to listen to
proposals down the road that might incorporate exchanging games."</TE>
<TE>   It appears, though, that ABC came out OK after all.</TE>
<TE>   Of the eight teams playing on "Monday Night Football" the last
four weeks of the season, all but the Tennessee Titans made the
playoffs last season. And the Titans went to the Super Bowl after the
1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, no one can predict in March how well a team will
be playing in December. That's why Tagliabue would like to see a
flexible schedule for "Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Raunch and profanity can get you attention. They can also get you
in trouble, as Dave Smith and Steve Carbone of KXTA (1150) realized
this week.</TE>
<TE>   They were fired because of a profanity-laced column Carbone wrote
for a Web site controlled by Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had been at KXTA from Day 1, surviving all the lineup
changes, management changes and name changes the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Joey Haim, Howard Stern wannabes who called themselves
"the Sports Gods," came over from KMAX-FM, where they had established
a reputation for being raunchy. But their act was a bad fit on the
Dodger flagship station, particularly when the Dodgers were owned by
Peter O'Malley.</TE>
<TE>   Haim was dismissed. Smith tried to shift gears and become a more
legitimate sports talk-show host. In some ways he succeeded. Those
familiar with Smith, even those who thought he needed a personality
transplant, could tell he was always well-prepared. And he would work
any shift and do any duty that was asked of him.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he was working a prime afternoon shift with Arnie
Spanier, was making $125,000 a year and was due a $10,000 raise April
1.</TE>
<TE>   Things were looking good.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith could never totally shake his earlier reputation. And it
didn't help that he ran a Web site, www.thesportsgod.com, that
featured gambling touts and profanity-laced columns.</TE>
<TE>   Such a column by Carbone that appeared Monday was brought to the
attention of Robin Bertolucci, who came from Denver six weeks ago as
program director at KXTA and Clear Channel sister stations KLAC (570)
and KFI (640).</TE>
<TE>   Bertolucci fired Smith and Carbone immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Ashlock, who has been the station manager of KXTA, KLAC and
KFI for about a year after moving over from the sales side, has
worked hard at improving the station's image.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to establish quality and credibility," Ashlock said.</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain the quick action against Smith and Carbone.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem was the unauthorized use of the station logo and
name, Ashlock said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Carbone say they believe the firings were too harsh, and
that they'd like their jobs back.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave my life to this station the last five years, I poured my
heart and soul into this job, and I loved working with Arnie," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   Carbone said, "I'd do anything to get my job back. That's all I'm
interested in."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, Smith and Carbone have learned a lesson--that class and
dignity work better than raunch and profanity.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Nasty</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of class and dignity, Joe McDonnell of KSPN (1110) showed
none this week when he gloated on the air about Smith's misfortune.
Has McDonnell already forgotten he too was fired by the same station?</TE>
<TE>   The Other Side</TE>
<TE>   Class and dignity have worked well for Irv Kaze, who celebrates
his 10th anniversary on the air Saturday. John Wooden was the first
"Irv Kaze on Sports" guest during Final Four weekend in 1992. Wooden
will be back as one of Kaze's guests on his KRLA (870) show Saturday
at 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Ratings</TE>
<TE>   No matter what approach sports talk radio has tried, it has never
been very successful in the Los Angeles market.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest Arbitron trends, covering December, January and
February, San Diego's XTRA is ranked 40th in L.A. and KXTA 44th. KSPN
and KMPC (1540) did not make the book.</TE>
<TE>   The highest rated shows are Jim Rome's live morning show on KXTA,
with a 1.4 share in men 18-plus, and Lee Hamilton's 4-8 p.m. show on
XTRA, with a 1.2 share.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Returns</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn said Thursday he's planning to attend tonight's Laker
game against Portland at Staples Center as a spectator. He said he
and wife Marge will sit in press row, right behind the broadcast seat
that Paul Sunderland has been keeping warm for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to get a feel for the place," Hearn said. "It's been
so long since I've been there."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, recuperating from hip surgery, plans to return to his
broadcasting duties alongside Stu Lantz on April 9, when the Lakers
play host to Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn will be honored at a City of Hope benefit roast at the
Sheraton Universal Hotel on April 16. The affair was originally
scheduled for March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   "Mohr Sports," the new half-hour variety show with comedian Jay
Mohr, makes its debut on ESPN Tuesday at 7 p.m. After that, it will
be seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m. The series is scheduled for a 25-week
run.</TE>
<TE>   The shows will be taped in Hollywood and shown later the same
night. Mohr, part of the cast on Fox Sports Net's "NFL This Morning,"
said he tried to work out a deal with Fox but "there were budgetary
differences." His deal with Disney is multifaceted and calls for
appearances on ABC, ESPN and ESPN radio.</TE>
<TE>   Bad timing: The producers of this week's edition of "Beyond the
Glory," to be shown on Fox Sports Net Sunday at 8 p.m., are
particularly high on their profile of Vince Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Carter recently had season-ending knee surgery.
Another bad break is that the show is going up against the FX movie,
"Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie."</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Bob Knight, a guest on Bob Costas' "On the Record" on HBO Thursday
night, talked about the ESPN movie, "A Season on the Brink," starring
Brian Dennehy as Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian Dennehy called me after the movie was shown," Knight said.
"I've always really liked Brian Dennehy as an actor and [still] do. I
told him this: 'I felt sorry for you. Because I looked--it was
unavoidable looking at clips that came out in the promotion of the
movie--and rarely did you say anything I would say.'"</TE>

<HD>Sooners, Duke Also Matter</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: With powers Connecticut and Tennessee
garnering most of the attention, the other semifinal might prove to
be more entertaining.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>This might surprise some of the estimated 30,000 people coming to the
Alamodome for today's NCAA women's Final Four, but there are two
games being played.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the fan interest will be on the second game between
Connecticut, the Mideast Region champion, and Tennessee, the Midwest
Region champion.</LD>
<LD>   But Duke and Oklahoma, champions of the East and West regions, are
here, too. They play in the first semifinal game, and do not consider
themselves an opening act.</LD>
<TE>   "People may want to make Tennessee and Connecticut the de facto
championship," Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale said. "But unless I am
wrong there is another game scheduled Sunday night. And that's when
they give the trophy. Either us or Duke will be competing for a
championship. Once you get there, anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways the Sooners and Blue Devils, both 31-3, may provide
the more entertaining game. Both teams like a fast tempo and score
lots of points; Duke averages 84.9 points, Oklahoma 78.2. Both use
the motion offense, where players have a bit more freedom to create
shots instead of grinding out a set play.</TE>
<TE>   And both depend on excellent guard play. Oklahoma has a height and
experience edge in seniors LaNeishea Caufield (17.6) and Stacey Dales
(16.9). Duke's backcourt of sophomore Alana Beard (20.2) and freshman
Monique Currie (14.5) may be quicker and a shade more athletic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how you stop Alana Beard," Coale said. "You try to
take away the things she loves to do and make her do things maybe she
likes to do. The thing that perplexes me the most about Alana is
she's such a great kid. It's hard to find a chink in her armor."</TE>
<TE>   Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors gushed about Caufield and Dales. "I
think Oklahoma's backcourt is, if not the best, one of the very best
in the country. LaNeishea and Stacey complement each other so well.
You can tell they've played together four years because they seem to
know exactly where the other one is at any point in time."</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut (37-0) and Tennessee (29-4) also have top guard
combinations. Husky senior Sue Bird (14.4) is the Naismith national
player of the year and sophomore Diana Taurasi (14.4) has averaged
22.6 points in three games against the Lady Vols. Tennessee's Kara
Lawson (15.2) and April McDivitt (5.1), both juniors, are respected
for their defense.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut and Tennessee are also strong up front.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies' three senior forwards--Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and
Tamika Williams--combine for 39 points and 22 rebounds a game. The
Lady Vols' frontcourt of junior Gwen Jackson and freshmen Brittany
Jackson and Shyra Ely doesn't have quite the same production (27
points, 14 rebounds), but Connecticut doesn't have anyone like
Tennessee's 6-5 senior Michelle Snow (12.5 points) coming off the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   The teams met in Knoxville in January, and Connecticut rolled over
Tennessee as it has rolled over everyone else this season. Tennessee
Coach Pat Summitt said the Huskies are even better now.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even watch their game tape against Old Dominion,"
Summitt said, referring to Connecticut's Mideast Region final win.
"They were so impressive. That was their best game offensively, as
far as I was concerned. Their defense and rebounding have been solid
all year. They may be the best passing team I've ever seen. I don't
see any phase of the game they're not committed to."</TE>
<TE>   Should Tennessee pull off an upset, it would give Summitt 789
career victories to pass Texas' Jody Conradt as the winningest coach
in women's basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma, whose Huskies are playing in
their third consecutive Final Four, said if they are to be validated
as a great team, they must go through Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "They always seem to rise to the challenge and so do we," Auriemma
said. "If we can win [today] and Sunday it will be meaningful,
because unless you beat them it doesn't feel like you've won the
whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Under Summitt, Tennessee has appeared in the Final Four 13 times
in 28 years. They expect to play for a national title.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever problems Connecticut presents, fear is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the history of the matchups, and we feel we've held
our own," said Summitt, who is 6-8 lifetime against the Huskies. "We
know we're playing the best team in the game. Are we in awe of
Connecticut? No way. Are we impressed and do we respect them?
Absolutely."</TE>

<HD>More Signs of Economic Recovery: Workers Wanted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three days after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress that an economic recovery was underway, Eric Saca was back at
work full time for the first time since October.</LD>
<LD>   For the 34-year-old Bellflower resident, who started working two weeks
ago as a computer network administrator for a telecommunications
engineering firm, the economic recovery is as tangible as the pay in his
pocket.</LD>
<LD>   Although the jobless rate could worsen in the months ahead as more job
hunters enter the market, the hiring picture is showing early signs of a
rebound. Temporary agencies and executive headhunters report that
business is picking up, particularly in services, biotechnology and
technology, and even among some manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   These hopeful signs were underscored Thursday by reports that the
economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2001 and
consumer confidence hit its highest level since December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what I tell Alan Greenspan: It is not yet a
bounce-back, but every week since Jan. 1, we've put more people back to
work, and the last six weeks particularly we've seen it get stronger each
week," said Debbie Ponds-Heide, president of the North American division
of Adecco, an international staffing firm. "It's still flat compared to
the prior year, but it is rapidly picking up."</TE>
<TE>   At Team-One Employment Specialists, a Los Angeles-based staffing
agency that serves the apparel and other industries, demand for permanent
workers is flat. But demand for temporary administrative, clerical and
light-industrial workers is up 13% this month over February and 11% over
March of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The door is cracked now," said Frank Moran, Team-One president. "The
question is, how wide will it open?"</TE>
<TE>   Economists and employment specialists said it is too soon to tell how
strong the jobs portion of the economic recovery will be. One forecast,
released this week by UCLA's Anderson School, projects a weak recovery
for both California and the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   But another report, published Thursday by investment firm Salomon
Smith Barney, said recent signs suggest a turnaround in the labor market
may be near and payroll growth probably will have quickened in March.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are beginning to use more temporary help, which is a very
good sign that the job market is beginning to improve," said Lynn Reaser,
chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management Inc. in St. Louis.
"We also have seen companies start to extend the number of hours that
employees who are on the job are working."</TE>
<TE>   High-volume hiring won't begin until employers feel more confident
about the economy, Reaser said. "Corporate CEOs are much more cautious
about the economic outlook than economists at this point. They believe
the worst is over, but they are not seeing a strong trend of orders and
sales coming in the door."</TE>
<TE>   Wages and salaries, deflated when the tech bubble burst, remain fairly
flat, employment specialists said. And companies that are hiring are
taking their time, putting candidates through background and reference
checks and even personality tests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely an employers' market," said Matt Coffin, chief
executive of Los Angeles-based LowerMyBills.com Inc., which plans to add
seven mid-to-high-level technology and marketing specialists to its
40-person staff. "We can be very picky about quality and make sure we're
getting the best of the best."</TE>
<TE>   That's the job market Saca landed in when a corporate merger cost him
his job Oct. 11. Saca had been laid off before, but his information
technology skills had ensured he was never jobless for more than two
months. This time, his job search wasn't quick or easy.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was bad," Saca said. "But I had gotten several jobs in the
early 1990s, during that recession, so I didn't think it was [going to
be] that bad."</TE>
<TE>   As two months stretched into five, Saca cut back his spending to
essentials, dipped into savings and took a series of temporary, part-time
clerical assignments for which he was overqualified. Although he took
comfort in the news that the economy appeared to be turning around, Saca
kept his expectations low.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that after the economy improves, it takes a while for
employment to pick back up," he said. "I was hoping it was getting
better, but I didn't know what to think."</TE>
<TE>   Saca said he was lucky to get one job-related call a week. Then, in
late February, the calls picked up and he was getting five or six job
interviews a week. A contract position as a network administrator sounded
interesting, but the pay was less than that of his old job. Saca held out
for more--and he got it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual these days to see rehired workers get something close
to their old salaries, said Catherine Farrell, vice president for the
Western region of Drake Beam Morin Inc., an international workplace
consulting firm that helped find jobs for 254,000 laid-off workers in the
last year. "We're not seeing a big decrease in salaries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Ellis went back to work March 5, a little more than a month
after she was laid off from her job as an office manager. The 31-year-old
single mother said she was a bit panicked by the prospect of
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a parent--how is the rent going to get paid?" Ellis said. "Almost
everyone I know was looking for a job."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis said she probably faxed out 200 resumes applying for jobs she
found on the Internet and in newspapers, but she kept getting the same
response: "Overqualified."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis eventually stopped looking for a permanent job and within a week
found a contract assignment with a financial institution in Irvine. It
pays more than her last job, and Ellis said she figured being a
contractor would enable her to see whether it was a good fit. Now she
hopes the job--compiling and proofreading training materials--becomes
permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The executive suites also are starting to turn over. At Los
Angeles-based Korn/Ferry International, the world's largest corporate
search firm, assignments were up 15% during the first three months of the
year compared with the last quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At Christian &amp; Timbers Inc., a Cleveland-based executive recruiting
firm, assignments are up 64% from the end of last year, CEO Jeffrey E.
Christian said.</TE>
<TE>   John Beuerle, recruitment director for Apex Direct Search Inc., a Los
Angeles-based firm that specializes in technology searches, said business
started to pick up about six weeks ago. "We're filling jobs in the
director and vice president level for consumer products and games," he
said. "Games has really exploded for us--PC and console games."</TE>
<TE>   Even on college campuses, where many feared that students would face
D-minus prospects, employers are making offers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw in the fall quarter was an upswing in the level of
participation in recruitment activity on the part of the students," said
Kathy L. Sims, director of the UCLA career center. "The job fairs were
jampacked. I think at first they were worried."</TE>
<TE>   Employers came to campus, but the mix of companies was different. The
investment banking firms, management consultants and large technology
corporations that have dominated college recruiting in recent years were
in retreat.</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors, intelligence agencies and nonprofit organizations
were quick to fill the void, and retailers made a surprisingly big
showing, Sims said. "Organizations that haven't been very competitive or
glamorous to students saw an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Students aren't being showered with multiple offers and enticed with
signing bonuses and stock options, she said. But they are getting offers.</TE>

<HD>Arab League Approves Saudi Peace Initiative at Beirut Summit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>Arab leaders endorsed a historic peace initiative Thursday that
offers Israel "normal relations" with its Arab neighbors in exchange for
land, a viable Palestinian state and a "just solution" for nearly 4
million Palestinian refugees.</LD>
<LD>   But the leadership at the fractious Arab League summit here also
loaded up an accompanying declaration with a tirade against the Jewish
state, rhetorical support for the Palestinian intifada and--contrary to
the peace plan itself--an endorsement of the "right of return" for all
refugees.</LD>
<LD>   Israel has consistently objected to such a provision on refugees,
saying an influx of that many Palestinians would undermine the viability
of the country. On Thursday, an Israeli spokesman said allowing their
return "would be committing suicide."</LD>
<TE>   Arab leaders had hoped that the summit would provide a unique
opportunity to unite behind a single position. Instead, the conference
was defined by bickering, conflicting agendas and, ultimately, final
documents that provided a little something for everyone--from tough talk
to peace talk.</TE>
<TE>   Still, coming just one day after the Palestinian delegation walked out
in a huff, and after more than half the Arab heads of state failed to
show up, adoption of the Saudi-initiated peace plan was hailed by
proponents as a sign that the Arab world is unified in its quest for
ending the Israeli-Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   Participants said it was extraordinary simply to see Saudi
Arabia--guardian of the holiest sites of Islam--acknowledging Israel's
right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   The summit was also buoyed by an apparent rapprochement between Iraq
and Kuwait, the fellow Arab League member Baghdad invaded more than a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders tried to use the Saudi plan to shift the onus onto Israel
for moving the peace process forward in a region that this week has seen
both proposals for peace and devastating violence.</TE>
<TE>   "If Israel wants security and seeks peace, this is the way to
security," the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, said after
the summit ended Thursday. "It cannot keep the land and demand peace."</TE>
<TE>   Israel was muted in its response to the plan's endorsement.
"Generally, we welcome the Saudi peace initiative," said Gideon Meir, an
official with the Israeli Foreign Ministry. "But we were very
disappointed that it was diluted, especially by extremist voices who will
never accept Israel."</TE>
<TE>   And he added: "The right of return is a nonstarter for Israel. It
would be committing suicide."</TE>
<TE>   But the Saudi initiative was welcomed by the White House, which has
seen its efforts at negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and the
Palestinians consistently undermined, most recently by the deadly suicide
bombing Wednesday, the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday.</TE>
<TE>Complete Breakdown at Summit Avoided</TE>
<TE>   The summit, only the second regularly scheduled summit since the group
was founded in 1945, had been in danger of a complete breakdown
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah II were
just two of the more than 10 heads of state--plus Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat--who didn't attend the two-day gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, for reasons that remain unclear,
blocked Arafat from addressing the meeting via satellite hookup. The
Palestinian delegation withdrew from the conference in protest. After
last-minute negotiations--and facing the prospect of losing hundreds of
millions of dollars in financial aid if the conference failed--the
Palestinian delegation returned to the table Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But while all of the attention was focused on the Lahoud-Palestinian
dispute, Iraq and Kuwait may have taken a substantial step toward
smoothing over their relationship. The differences go back to 1990, when
Iraq invaded the oil-rich Persian Gulf country.</TE>
<TE>   Although the details remain a bit unclear, the Beirut Declaration
suggested that Iraq has finally agreed to all of Kuwait's demands,
including an acknowledgment of the tiny emirate's sovereignty and a
promise never to invade again. If the deal sticks--a day earlier, Kuwait
had dismissed it as "sweet talk"--it could undermine whatever plans the
United States might have for trying to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Arab leaders welcome Iraq's confirmation to respect the independence,
sovereignty and security of the state of Kuwait and guarantee its safety
and unity of its land to avoid anything that might cause a repetition of
what happened in 1990," the declaration read.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq and another estranged neighbor, Saudi Arabia, made it
semiofficial, with a kiss. Izzat Ibrahim, a Hussein deputy, gave Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah a peck on the cheek in front of television cameras,
to the applause of the other delegates. Ibrahim also shook hands with
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Jabbar al Sabah.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said that the
one issue that has managed to unite all of the Arab leaders is opposition
to a military strike against any Arab country--including Iraq. The group
is unanimous in its concern that a military strike could destabilize the
region.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position that we could not support an attack on Iraq is a
unanimous Arab position," Maher said as he left the Phoenicia Hotel in
downtown Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Although the events of this summit were considered deeply disunited,
even by Arab standards, many of the participants felt that persuading the
league's 22 members, including the Palestinian Authority, to endorse the
Saudi peace initiative was a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "Sanity has to prevail," said Adel Jubeir, an advisor to Crown Prince
Abdullah. "The Arab world has now put an offer on the table that offers a
way out."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is not meant to be a settlement but a catalyst for peace.
As it stands, the plan requires that Israel meet a list of sweeping
conditions--and only then will it be rewarded with "normal relations."</TE>
<TE>   If all the terms are met, the league statement said, Arab countries
would "consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ended and enter into a peace
agreement with Israel and provide security for all states of the region."</TE>
<TE>   For Israel to comply, it would have to withdraw from all territory
occupied since the 1967 Middle East War, including the Golan Heights. It
would have to offer a "just solution" to the Palestinian refugees--taken
to mean compensation or resettlement--and accept an independent
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   But it was unclear whether all the league members are truly committed
to the initiative or instead felt compelled not to block it.</TE>
<TE>'Heroic Struggle' of Palestinians Praised</TE>
<TE>   The declaration threatened: "The leaders affirm in light of the
[collapse] of the peace process their commitment to stop having any
relations with Israel and reactivating the activities of the Arab boycott
office until Israel responds to the implementation of international
declarations and the Madrid peace conference and withdraws from all
occupied Arab territory to 1967 borders."</TE>
<TE>   And it chided: "[We are] giving the highest salute to the resilience
of the Palestinian people and its honorable resistance in the face of
Israeli occupation and its destructive military machine and its
oppression and the massacres it inflicts targeting children, women and
elderly without discrimination or humanity."</TE>
<TE>   The declaration said the leaders support the "legitimate, heroic
struggle in the face of occupation until its just demands represented in
the right of return and self-determination and establishment of an
independent state and Jerusalem as its capital are achieved."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of the refugees, which the declaration muddied, may well be
the most problematic to resolve, not only for Israel but for Arab states
as well. Lebanon, for example, strongly opposed the initial Saudi
proposal because it didn't expressly guarantee that refugees would be
repatriated. Lebanon is home to several hundred thousand Palestinians,
many of whose families have been here since Israel was founded in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Lebanon had a sentence added to the peace initiative
ensuring that host countries would never be forced to give citizenship to
the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   A separate final communique, the last of three documents issued at the
conclusion of the conference, also committed the Arab community to
donating $55 million a month for six months to the Palestinian Authority
and $150 million to pay for "supporting areas of development in
Palestine."</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Movie Maker Left 'Indelible Stamp'</HD>
<DH>Obituary: Director, writer and producer won six Oscars and peers'
envy. He was 95.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Wilder, the director, writer and producer of both antic farce
and serious drama who was nominated for 21 Academy Awards and won six,
has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Wilder, who had been in failing health for some time, died of
pneumonia Wednesday at 11 p.m. at his home in Beverly Hills, his wife,
Audrey, said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   As his health declined during the last few years, Wilder began lumping
his various physical problems--including diminished eyesight, a cancer
battle and frailties of old age--into what he called his "malady."</LD>
<TE>   Yet the ever-dapper Wilder continued to go to his Beverly Hills office
almost daily well into his 90s, reading and keeping tabs on film as well
as art, of which he was an extremely knowledgeable collector. And he
remained an icon to those around the world who make--and love--motion
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "There are few filmmakers who don't crave being compared to him. His
is a tough-minded romanticism and elegance; the lack of sentimentality
has left him forever relevant as an artist," wrote director Cameron Crowe
in his 1999 book, "Conversations With Billy Wilder."</TE>
<TE>   "Wilder was a great collaborator," Times critic Kenneth Turan said.
"Working first with Charles Brackett and then with I.A.L. Diamond, he
co-wrote and directed films that have become the standard by which others
are judged. He did this not once, but several times, in genres ranging
from sex farce ('Some Like It Hot') and romantic comedy ('Ninotchka') to
the darker areas of film noir ('Double Indemnity') and the social-problem
picture ('The Lost Weekend'). And in 'Sunset Boulevard,' he made the
ultimate Hollywood-on-Hollywood film as well."</TE>
<TE>   "His mind and personality were so strong, it was easy to be lulled
into thinking he would go on forever," Curtis Hanson, director and
co-writer of "L.A. Confidential," said Thursday in a statement. "As a man
he was witty and irreverent, of course, but he was also a humanist. And
he was a relentless enemy of pomposity, particularly refreshing in this
age of inflated self-importance. As a writer-director, he was an
inspiration and teacher to us all."</TE>
<TE>   "The great master is finished here," actress Shirley MacLaine, who
starred in Wilder's films "The Apartment" and "Irma la Douce," said in a
statement. "He will write and direct another masterpiece in heaven. I
learned more from him than anyone else. I will miss him till we meet
again."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder put his indelible stamp on some 50 films, beginning in 1929
with German scripts he wrote in Berlin through his final pictures: the
very American "The Front Page" in 1974, "Fedora" in 1978 and the poorly
received "Buddy Buddy" in 1981. He was content to let his body of work
stand, kept no prints or tapes, and rarely watched his movies in later
years. When friends tried to trick him into attending a Los Angeles
Conservancy showing of his "Double Indemnity" a few years ago, Wilder
refused, commenting: "I don't want to see all those dead people."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the idea of redoing," he told The Times in January 2000,
when he was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
before a retrospective of 27 of his films presented by the UCLA Film and
Television Archive and the American Cinematheque. "I did the best I could
at the time. I want to leave it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Although he respected certain contemporary directors, including Steven
Spielberg, Wilder didn't envy them and came to believe that modern
audiences flock to theaters because of stars rather than directors. "The
glamour of being a director is over," he said in 2000. "So is the fun."</TE>
<TE>   Although Wilder arrived in this country from Europe in 1934 with
minimal knowledge of English, his use of the language on and off screen
became legendary for its pithiness and sharp wit. And though he was
nominated eight times by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
as best director, a total bested only by William Wyler, all of his films
were well and truly written before they were anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder's words were not only stylish, they brought a wide variety of
material to life. Few creators of knockabout comedies as popular as "Some
Like It Hot" were equally comfortable with dark and even brooding
material.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilder the comic writer and director could also be a poet of
cynicism and despair. His direction of novelist James M. Cain's "Double
Indemnity" (which Wilder co-wrote with Raymond Chandler) in 1944 resulted
in a film noir classic, and he startled audiences in 1950 when his
"Sunset Boulevard," perhaps Hollywood's definitive look at itself, turned
out to be narrated by a corpse.</TE>
<TE>   In person, Wilder's verbal thrusts could be just as incisive as the
dialogue he scripted. He counseled one actor, "You have Van Gogh's ear
for music," advised Walter Matthau that "we're on the track of something
absolutely mediocre," and wooed his wife by telling her, "I'd worship the
ground you walk on if you lived in a better neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder disparaged lifetime tributes as "Quick, before they croak"
awards, but lived to collect several: the Life Achievement Award of the
Directors Guild in 1985; the Life Achievement Award of the American Film
Institute in 1986; and the Irving G. Thalberg Award of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1987 for the "consistently high
quality of motion picture production."</TE>
<TE>   His six Oscars spanned the years of his greatest success. He won two
for co-writing and directing "The Lost Weekend" in 1945, one for
co-writing "Sunset Boulevard" in 1950, and three for producing,
co-writing and directing "The Apartment" in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder also won the Palme d'Or, the top award, from the first Cannes
Film Festival in 1946, for "The Lost Weekend," starring Ray Milland in a
riveting tale of an alcoholic writer.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Wilder was born June 22, 1906, in the town of Sucha, in a
section of Poland that was then in the Austro-Hungarian empire. His
mother, Eugenia, who died in Auschwitz during World War II, had lived in
the United States in her youth and nicknamed her second son "Billy"
because of her fascination with the American frontier hero Buffalo Bill
Cody.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Vienna with his family in 1914, young Billy developed
an affinity for American jazz, westerns and the satirical films of gifted
German director Ernst Lubitsch, who preceded him to Hollywood. In 1924,
Wilder spent three months in the University of Vienna's pre-law program
but dropped out to become a reporter for the newspaper Die Stunde,
writing personality profiles and crime and sports stories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1926, Wilder got a job in Berlin handling publicity for touring
American bandleader Paul Whiteman.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder's colorful entry into screenwriting, as told by biographer
Maurice Zolotow, occurred one night in Berlin when he agreed to help his
landlady's daughter, Lulu, out of a jam. When her boyfriend suddenly
appeared at their apartment house, Wilder agreed to hide the
sometime-prostitute's client in his room. He immediately recognized his
naked guest as a man known only as Galitzenstein, the president of Maxim
Films, and, introducing himself as a screenwriter, offered him a script
to read.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing the raging boyfriend in the next room vow that he would slit
the throat of any man he caught with Lulu, Galitzenstein hefted the
script in his hand and said: "I'll buy it. It feels like a good story."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was soon writing screenplays for UFA, Germany's top movie
company. Although he ghostwrote several other films, Wilder considered
his film debut to be "Menschen am Sonntag" ("People on Sunday") in 1929.
He became popular overnight and remained much in demand until 1933, when
Adolf Hitler came to power and Wilder fled.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a new Graham-Page American car and a new apartment furnished in
Bauhaus, and I sold everything for a few hundred dollars," Wilder said
many years later. "A lot of my friends had a fear of going into a country
where they didn't speak the language, so they went to Vienna or Prague,
which was very shortsighted. . . . I sensed that it was best to go as far
as possible. I was on the train to Paris."</TE>
<TE>   During his 10-month stay in France, he wrote and co-directed the film
"Mauvaise Graine" ("Bad Seed"), about young auto thieves. Then he wrote
the script "Pam Pam" for Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in Hollywood in 1934, unable to speak English, and after a
six-month contract with Columbia expired, he was out of work for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of starved for a little bit," he said. "I shared a room with
Peter Lorre, and we lived on a can of soup a day."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder taught himself English by listening to baseball games on the
radio and going to movies, forcing himself to learn 20 new words a day.
For decades, he instructed his collaborators--first Charles Brackett and
later I.A.L. Diamond--to correct immediately any mistake he made in
writing the language.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the refugees had a secret hope: 'Hitler will be defeated and
I will go back home,' " said Wilder, who became a U.S. citizen in 1939.
"I never had such a thought. This was home. . . . I had a clean-cut
vision: 'This is where I am going to die."'</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, Paramount hired Wilder and teamed him with Brackett, a
novelist and former New Yorker drama critic. The temperamental, often
warring pair wrote 14 consecutive hits, including the innovative
"Ninotchka," "The Lost Weekend" and "Sunset Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by what other directors did with his scripts, Wilder made
his solo directing debut in 1942 with the romantic comedy "The Major and
the Minor," with Milland and Ginger Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a born director," he told Crowe. "I became a director because
so many of our scripts had been screwed up."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount, Wilder once recalled, expected him to fail in his initial
directing effort and thereafter stop interfering with its regular
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "But I was careful," he said. "I didn't go out to make a so-called
'artistic success.' I went out to make a commercial picture I wouldn't be
ashamed of."</TE>
<TE>   After that, Wilder directed all his pictures. Many critics consider
"Double Indemnity" in 1944 to be the first of his major works. In the
film noir classic, he cast Fred MacMurray as a corrupt insurance salesman
in love with a vicious Barbara Stanwyck, with the couple murdering
Stanwyck's husband only to learn they cannot collect his insurance money.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was nominated for Academy Awards for best screenplay (along
with Chandler) and director for the film, but Leo McCarey's "Going My
Way" swept the 1944 awards.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Wilder made "The Lost Weekend," which pioneered
movies about social problems. The film won Wilder his first two
Oscars--for writing and directing--but not without some anxious months.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount was under intense pressure to drop the completed project.
Lobbyists for the liquor industry reportedly offered as much as $5
million for the print of the movie. An audience at a sneak preview in
Santa Barbara laughed derisively, and some people even walked out.
Paramount shelved the film indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was so humiliated that he fled Hollywood for four months,
returning to Germany to aid in the reconstruction of the German film
industry, theaters and radio. It was at that time that he learned his
grandmother and stepfather had been killed along with his mother at
Auschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Wilder returned to the U.S., Paramount had decided to
release the film. It opened to critical acclaim in New York. Moviegoers
packed theaters there and in California, and the film's success was
sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder directed a number of other pictures over the next five years,
including the 1948 comedy "A Foreign Affair" and "The Emperor Waltz."</TE>
<TE>   But of all Wilder's films, perhaps the most revered by Hollywood
itself was the 1950 dark tale of Hollywood "Sunset Boulevard," featuring
Gloria Swanson as an aging silent-screen star whose fantasies of her
former fame and beauty are aroused by a cynical young writer (William
Holden).</TE>
<TE>   At a celebrity preview, Stanwyck tearfully fell to her knees in front
of Swanson and kissed the hem of her gown in tribute. Louis B. Mayer, on
the other hand, stormed out of the theater cursing Paramount and
shouting, "We should horsewhip this Wilder, we should throw him out of
this town! He has brought disgrace on the town that is feeding him!"</TE>
<TE>   The film won worldwide acclaim and brought Wilder his third Oscar, for
his screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when Crowe asked him to name his favorite of the pictures he
had made, Wilder mused:</TE>
<TE>   "The picture maybe that has the fewest faults, obvious faults, would
be 'The Apartment.' But I like the end result in 'Some Like It Hot.' It
was a very successful picture. Or maybe this and 'Sunset Boulevard.' It
['Sunset'] really caught them unaware. Nobody expected a picture like it.
And it's very difficult to make a picture in Hollywood about Hollywood.
Because they really scrutinize you."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder came to refer to his cynical 1951 drama "Ace in the Hole,"
starring Kirk Douglas as a ruthless reporter, as "the runt of my litter."
It marked his debut as a producer, and when it proved a box office
failure, Paramount warned Wilder that his next film had to pay the
expenses for both.</TE>
<TE>   He rebounded in 1953 with "Stalag 17," a comedy-drama starring Holden
that brought in more than $10 million in its first year and was the
biggest-grossing picture he ever made for Paramount. The film also won
Holden his only Oscar, for best actor.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was "Stalag 17," about a German prisoner-of-war camp,
that caused Wilder to depart Paramount. Preparing a dubbed version for
German release, the studio suggested he change the Nazi spy to a Polish
prisoner of war who had sold out to the Nazis. Wilder refused and said he
would leave if the studio failed to apologize. He left in 1954, but not
before making the romantic comedy "Sabrina" with Audrey Hepburn, Holden
and Humphrey Bogart.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Paramount didn't dent Wilder's winning streak. He did "The
Seven Year Itch," a romantic comedy with Marilyn Monroe; the May-December
romance "Love in the Afternoon," with Gary Cooper and Hepburn; the
courtroom drama "Witness for the Prosecution," with Marlene Dietrich,
Tyrone Power and Charles Laughton; and then, in 1959, what many consider
his masterpiece, "Some Like It Hot."</TE>
<TE>   Featuring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as out-of-work musicians trying
to escape Chicago gangsters by masquerading as women in an all-girl band,
which included Monroe as the singer, the film grossed $14 million, the
highest for a comedy up to that date.</TE>
<TE>   Next came "The Apartment," a dark New York comedy featuring Lemmon,
MacLaine and MacMurray in 1960, which won Wilder triple Oscars for best
film, best screenplay (with I.A.L. Diamond) and best director, and
represented the zenith of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "In Hollywood," critic Pauline Kael wrote, "it is now common to hear
Billy Wilder called the world's greatest movie director."</TE>
<TE>   Kael and others, however, frequently criticized Wilder as cynical and
money-hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a dedicated man, not after the fast buck," he responded. "I
wanted to say [in 'The Apartment'] how corrupt we are, how money-mad we
are. . . . I guess that's the theme of all my pictures. Maybe my
philosophy is cynical, but I have to be true to what I feel."</TE>
<TE>   Yet to come was his biggest box-office success, 1963's "Irma la
Douce," a comedy about a Parisian prostitute, again starring Lemmon and
MacLaine, which grossed $25 million. But despite being nominated for
several Oscars, including MacLaine for best actress, the film won no
major awards. Wilder was nominated in 1966 for his and Diamond's
screenplay for the biting comedy "The Fortune Cookie," for which Matthau
won a best supporting actor Oscar as a crooked lawyer. This film marked
the first on-screen pairing of Lemmon and Matthau.</TE>
<TE>   A man who loved being the center of attention, Wilder boasted that he
was his own public relations agent and would jump fully clothed into a
swimming pool for a dare or a laugh. A hypochondriac, he paced when he
worked, waving one of his collection of walking sticks that he carried
because of a chronic bad back. Only in his final years did he kick a
four-pack-a-day smoking habit.</TE>
<TE>   He enjoyed professional sports, chess, bridge and gin rummy, classical
music and gourmet cooking, but hated and feared flying.</TE>
<TE>   His best-known avocation unquestionably was collecting modern and
contemporary art, which he pursued passionately from the beginning of his
long career. In 1989, he sold 94 works by Picasso, Miro, Kirchner and
others for $32.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever I made, $200 or $300 a week, I always put half or a third
into a drawer for art purchases," he said during sale previews.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no villa in St. Tropez. I cut down on my ballooning in
Bavaria, and I stayed away from junk bonds," he continued. "I just buy
nice things and sometimes swap them for better ones. I've been rather
lucky in that. I bought most of the stuff a couple of weeks ahead of the
big prices."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Los Angeles had few art dealers in the 1940s or 1950s,
Wilder said he went on 14-hour buying sprees when on location in New
York, Paris or London. In 1945, he said, as an example of the bargains he
found, he bought a George Grosz painting for a carton of cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder said he auctioned some of those paintings to make space on the
walls of his apartment for other pieces in his vast collection and for
pieces he wanted to buy.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, you know the cliche about being possessed by possessions,"
he said. "We worried that the people in the apartment above ours would
let the bathtub overflow. And insurance--I don't have to tell you. I felt
I needed a liberation from responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   But Wilder was an inveterate collector and continued to buy art after
the New York auction. He sold a second collection in 1993 through the
Beverly Hills gallery of his longtime friend Louis Stern.</TE>
<TE>   For years after his final film, "Buddy Buddy," starring Lemmon and
Matthau, bombed in 1981, Wilder continued to write and contemplate making
more movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are always cooking in the back of my mind or in the back of a
drawer," he said in 1988. "There is never a day I don't write something.
It's not tough to make a picture. It's tough to make a deal."</TE>
<TE>   He explained the realities of the new Hollywood in the January 2000
Times interview: "It's much harder to direct now. Everything's in the
hands of the money people; they dictate what has to be done. When I was
making pictures, we went to the front office, told them what we wanted to
do, and then we did it."</TE>
<TE>   Even when Wilder was no longer wanted for new films, he and Hollywood
continued their love affair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here for more than half a century," he said in 1986 when he
received the American Film Institute award, "and I've watched Hollywood
vacillate between despair and fear. But even if they have 5 million
screens . . . there's one little detail: Who will write it, who will
direct it, who will act in it?</TE>
<TE>   "Relax, fellow picture-makers. We are not expendable. The bigger they
get, the more powerful we get. Theirs is the kingdom; ours is the power
and the glory."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was married twice--in 1936 to Judith Coppicus Iribe, with whom
he had a daughter, Victoria, and whom he divorced in 1947, and in 1949 to
singer-actress Audrey Young.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by one
grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services are pending.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Seek Death for Sept. 11 Suspect</HD>
<DH>Law: Zacarias Moussaoui is accused of 'depraved' actions in support
of attacks. The legal move is seen as unique by experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors told a federal court Thursday that they will seek the
death penalty against suspected Al Qaeda terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui in
connection with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
even though he was in jail Sept. 11 and apparently had no direct links to
any of the 19 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   The 33-year-old French citizen deserves to die, prosecutors alleged in
a much-awaited court filing, because his actions in support of the
terrorist attacks were "heinous, cruel and depraved" and contributed to
the deaths of more than 3,000 people and the destruction of billions of
dollars in property.</LD>
<LD>   The novel decision, which experts said stretches the limits of legal
theory in capital cases, sparked immediate protests from death penalty
opponents and deepened a diplomatic rift between the United States and
Moussaoui's native country. France, which banned capital punishment in
1981, had appealed to Washington two weeks ago, asking it not to seek
Moussaoui's execution.</LD>
<TE>   French Justice Minister Marylise Lebranchu said Thursday in Paris that
she regretted Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's decision to reject the French
plea. She said that while France will continue to cooperate in the U.S.
probe into the Sept. 11 attacks, "under no circumstances" would it turn
over any evidence that could be used to press a death sentence against
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, a strong supporter of the death penalty, said he would not
be swayed by foreign sentiment on an issue so crucial to American
security.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask our counterparts in the international community to respect our
sovereignty, and we respect theirs," he told reporters in Florida in
announcing his decision on the Moussaoui death penalty issue.</TE>
<TE>   "And to the extent that they can cooperate and help us, we welcome
that cooperation, and we respect their views," he said. "But . . . it's
clear that America is so concerned about the safety and security of its
citizens that certain crimes against the people of this country have been
designated as death-eligible by the Congress of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui is the only person charged in the United States with aiding
in the Sept. 11 attacks, and his trial in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., scheduled to begin in October, promises to be the
government's fullest airing of how the plot was carried out.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI suspects that Moussaoui was supposed to be "the 20th hijacker"
had he not been arrested in Minnesota in August after his odd behavior at
a flight training school drew the suspicion of his instructors.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators acknowledge that there is little strong evidence
tying him directly to the plot. Although authorities allege that he was
trained in Al Qaeda terrorist camps, received a $14,000 wire transfer in
Oklahoma from a former roommate of hijacker Mohamed Atta, and was "an
active participant" in the Sept. 11 plot, they have been unable to show
that he had any direct contact with the 19 hijackers or suspected
terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's mother, Aicha Moussaoui, said in France on Thursday that
U.S. authorities are using her son as a "scapegoat" because they "can't
find the people who are truly responsible for this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's defense attorneys withheld comment on the Justice
Department's decision to seek the death penalty, saying they would
respond in court. But they attacked Ashcroft for airing his decision
publicly at a news conference just as court papers were being filed.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney general is breaking the spirit if not the letter of
[court] rules every time he holds a press conference to announce a
filing. It couldn't be for any other purpose than to influence the
potential jury pool," said defense attorney Frank W. Dunham Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The bench in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Moussaoui will be
tried, is known as the "rocket docket" because of the speed with which it
dispatches cases, and is known for its high rate of death penalty
verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   Legal analysts said the district's conservative reputation appears to
have played a key role in Ashcroft's decision to bring a death case
there. The capital charges may also increase pressure on Moussaoui to
tell what he knows about Al Qaeda's workings and begin cooperating with
investigators to avoid a death sentence, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly improper to seek the death penalty to pressure someone
to give information," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the
Death Penalty Information Center in Washington. "I would hope that
wouldn't be the goal here, but that's a worry."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials refused to comment on Ashcroft's public
airing or the reasoning behind it. "The filing speaks for itself," said
spokesman Bryan Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   In their defense of Moussaoui, his three veteran lawyers will point
out that he had been in federal custody for nearly a month when the
attacks occurred, a source familiar with their strategy said. They will
also cite Bin Laden's own statements--made on a videotape released by the
White House--that many of the hijackers didn't know until the morning of
Sept. 11 they were embarking on a suicide mission.</TE>
<TE>   It is by no means unprecedented for prosecutors to seek the death
penalty in a conspiracy case in which the defendant did not actually
carry out the killing. There have been at least half a dozen drug
kingpins sentenced to death in federal court for the actions of their
underlings, and many states have secured death sentences in
murder-for-hire schemes and fatal robberies.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oklahoma City bombing, Terry L. Nichols, an accomplice to
Timothy J. McVeigh who was not at the scene of the explosion, faced a
death sentence on murder and conspiracy charges in federal court, but was
sentenced to life instead. A separate state case that could bring the
death penalty is pending.</TE>
<TE>   What is highly unusual in the Moussaoui case, analysts said, is that
authorities have not alleged that he had any direct or overt role in the
Sept. 11 tragedy or events leading up to it, but rather that he engaged
in similar activities to the hijackers on a "parallel" track leading up
to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems like quite a stretch to me," said Stephen Bright, a law
professor and prominent death penalty opponent in Atlanta. "This really
tries to twist the law to apply . . . to this fellow. The Justice
Department's attitude seems to be that there's a war on terrorism on, and
we can bend the rules and do things we wouldn't ordinarily do."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking the death penalty in such a case "is unique. It's hard to
identify any real precedents for it," said Dieter of the death penalty
center. "His connections to the whole case are somewhat tenuous."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the Supreme Court, in a 1982 case throwing out a death
sentence against a Florida man who waited in a getaway car during a fatal
robbery, prohibited capital punishment against an accomplice who "did not
kill or intend to kill."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1987 case, however, the Supreme Court offered an expanded
interpretation, saying that a participant in a crime who shows "reckless
indifference to human life" can be executed. In that case, two Arizona
men were sentenced to death after they helped their father escape from
prison, and the father later killed a family of four in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Scheidegger, an attorney with the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation in Sacramento, which favors the death penalty, compared
Moussaoui's case to that of a drug kingpin who orders the killing of
several rivals from a prison cell. Even though the perpetrator is behind
bars when the killing takes place, he can be sentenced to death for the
crime, Scheidegger said.</TE>
<TE>   And Eric H. Holder Jr., the second-ranking Justice official under
former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, cited the assassination of Abraham Lincoln,
in which several co-conspirators of John Wilkes Booth were convicted of
conspiracy charges and hanged, even though none participated in the
assassination itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic conspiracy law is that if you did something that directly
led to the death of people, you can be held liable," Holder said. "Will
the government be able to prove that Moussaoui did things that without a
doubt led to the deaths? His actions mirror the actions of the other 19
hijackers, so that is good circumstantial evidence. And you have him
getting money from the same source as the others."</TE>
<TE>   But Holder acknowledged that securing the penalty "is not an easy
case. . . . Instinctively people will say, 'Wait a minute, he was in
custody.' The government will have to overcome that and prove he was
still engaged in the conspiracy on that day."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the legal ramifications of employing a fairly untested court
theory, analysts said Ashcroft's decision to seek the death penalty
against Moussaoui could prove counterproductive in sustaining
international support for the U.S. war on terrorism--especially after
criticism over the Bush administration's pursuit of military tribunals
for terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is incredibly shortsighted," said Juliette Kayyem, a
terrorism expert at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
"If we are serious about a war on terrorism being a coalition, and we
want support from our Western European allies, no matter how good this
[decision] makes us feel on some visceral level, we have to think of the
long-term consequences of this."</TE>
<TE>   France contributed elements to the case against Moussaoui,
particularly about his alleged rise in the Islamic extremist underground
of Europe and his alleged stints at Al Qaeda training camps. Moussaoui
has been a target of French investigators for years because of his
alleged terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Remi Marechaux, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington, said
France hopes to find a way to continue cooperating with the U.S. probe
without furnishing evidence that could be used to put Moussaoui to death.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident the Americans will provide for a fair trial," he
said. "But we oppose the death penalty--as do all the other countries of
the European Union--whether it's against Mr. Moussaoui or anyone else.
That's just a general principle."</TE>

<HD>Israel Attacks Arafat Compound</HD>
<HD>Army Calls Up Reserves, Has Orders to 'Strike Everywhere'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader, trapped in Ramallah, appeals for help
as Sharon ignores his eleventh-hour offer of a cease-fire.</DH>

<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces today smashed their way into the Ramallah
headquarters of Yasser Arafat and fought fierce gun battles with his
bodyguards. Israel formally declared the Palestinian leader an enemy and
said he would be "completely isolated."</LD>
<LD>   Arafat desperately appealed to world leaders to save him as Israel
launched its most punishing large-scale offensive yet against the
Palestinians in the wake of a Passover suicide bombing that killed 21
Jews.</LD>
<LD>   About 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers roared into the West
Bank city of Ramallah before dawn and surrounded Arafat's compound. They
punched gaping holes in the front gates as his guards manned the walls
and roofs and exchanged fire with tanks shooting heavy machine guns.
Several Palestinians and Israeli soldiers were reported wounded.</LD>
<TE>   The tanks then fired rockets into the blocklong compound, witnesses
said, setting several buildings ablaze. Tanks approached within yards of
Arafat's private office, which was filling with smoke, said Mohammed
Dahlan, a Palestinian security chief.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is very grave," Arafat advisor Nabil abu Rudaineh said
from inside the besieged buildings, where the Palestinian Authority
president and his inner circle were holed up. "We've been trying to reach
world leaders, but it's early and they're still asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Firefights erupted elsewhere in the city as troops and tanks took up
positions and rounded up Palestinian men. One woman was reported killed
in her car.</TE>
<TE>   Branding Arafat's eleventh-hour offer of a cease-fire a ploy, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon presided over an extraordinary all-night
meeting of his government to plan the offensive. Many members wanted to
expel Arafat, but the majority decided to cut him off from the outside
world but allow him to remain in Ramallah. Expulsion remained a future
option, however.</TE>
<TE>   The army was ordered to "strike everywhere" and to destroy as much
"terrorist infrastructure" as possible. "Restraint is dead," one official
said. "We will fight terror until it is vanquished."</TE>
<TE>   Israel also called up combat unit reserves to expand its manpower,
another reflection of the deepening war footing that Israel and the
Palestinians are now on.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the killing of 21 people at a Passover Seder on
Wednesday, a Palestinian gunman on Thursday burst into a Jewish
settlement in the West Bank and killed four Israelis from the same
family, and early today a Palestinian infiltrated a settlement in the
Gaza Strip and stabbed two Israelis to death.</TE>
<TE>   Medical examiners worked to identify mangled bodies from Wednesday's
suicide bombing in the coastal city of Netanya. The attack was one of the
deadliest in 18 months of relentless bloodshed, and its psychological
impact for Israelis was all the more devastating because it came on a
date of utmost religious significance for Jews, the opening night of
Passover. Israelis called it a watershed event, a point of no return.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials earlier said the army had been instructed to abide
by a commitment not to physically harm Arafat. However, Sharon said this
week that he was sorry he ever made that promise to President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on Thursday, in a clear bid to temper the fury of the expected
Israeli onslaught, Arafat summoned reporters to his headquarters and said
he was ready to work toward a truce. But he didn't declare a cease-fire
outright, and his statements fell short of the unilateral cease-fire he
declared Dec. 16 under intense U.S. pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I assert our readiness to implement an immediate cease-fire, and we
have informed Gen. Zinni," Arafat told the news conference, referring to
U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni, whose truce-seeking mission here has
all but collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the sober, angry Cabinet meeting, where the Passover killings
dominated the agenda, Sharon said Arafat and only Arafat was to blame.
The prime minister said Israel now faces "a new and different situation."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Sharon emerged from the seven-hour meeting and said his
government was launching an "extended operation against Palestinian
terrorism." It was "not a reoccupation" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
he said, "but a long, complicated war" that "knows no borders."</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat, who has formed a coalition of terror against Israel, is an
enemy and at this stage shall be isolated," Sharon said at a hastily
arranged news conference in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say what would be done to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians accused Israel of ignoring efforts by Arab states and
U.S. mediators to ease tensions. The Bush administration had earlier
pressed Sharon to show restraint but also called on Arafat to make an
Arabic-language appeal to his people for calm. Neither Middle Eastern
leader appeared to be paying heed.</TE>
<TE>   In Elon Moreh, a Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus,
a Palestinian gunman burst into a house where a settler family was
celebrating Passover with guests. He killed or mortally wounded four
members of the family and then barricaded himself on an upper story when
armed settlers and troops rushed to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Two sons in the family managed to hide, and for a time it was thought
that the gunman had taken hostages. But the two were able to leap from a
window and escape.</TE>
<TE>   In a gun battle, soldiers shot dead the Palestinian. The radical
Islamic organization Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, as it
had for Wednesday's bombing. Settlements throughout the West Bank and
Gaza Strip were placed on high alert.</TE>
<TE>   Elon Moreh is one of the more radical settlements among the more than
170 that fragment the West Bank and Gaza Strip and are considered illegal
under international law. Yet in the current climate of hardened hatreds,
the radicals have become more mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be only one terrorist in Elon Moreh tonight, but there are
tens of thousands of terrorists throughout the land of Israel," the
settlement's rabbi, Elyakim Levanon, said. "They must all be cleaned out.
Otherwise, there will be no peace, not only in Elon Moreh but in all of
the land of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   About the same time that Elon Moreh was under attack, Arafat was
cautioning that a massive Israeli military operation now would endanger a
new peace proposal endorsed at an Arab League summit just concluded in
Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said their security forces had begun rounding up
a number of militants from Hamas and its sister organization Islamic
Jihad. The arrests could not be confirmed independently; past roundups
have been only token in nature.</TE>
<TE>   Israel scoffed at Arafat's gestures.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need are actions, not empty statements after which more
Israelis die," Sharon advisor Dore Gold said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials had little use for the Arab League proposal, saying
it is difficult to speak of peace when terrorism is rampant.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified Palestinian civilians, meanwhile, braced for what they
expected to be a harsh Israeli military onslaught. This time, they fear,
Israeli forces will invade and stay.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, Palestinians emptied store shelves in panic buying. They
stocked up on food, water and other supplies in expectation of indefinite
confinement to their homes. By the afternoon, Ramallah looked a ghost
town. People went home early from work or collected their children from
school, everyone trying to stay out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Suad Attalah, a mother of three from Ramallah's Al Birah neighborhood,
filled her grocery cart with milk, bread and cans of food.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect another invasion, and this time it may take longer," she
said. In the first two weeks of this month, scores of Palestinians were
killed and hundreds arrested in a huge military operation.</TE>
<TE>   Some Ramallah residents also hoped to flee, at least temporarily. Huge
crowds massed at the main military checkpoint that Israel has set up to
control Palestinian comings and goings. But no one seemed to be able to
leave.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks could be seen massing around Ramallah and Nablus. In
Gaza, tanks sliced the narrow strip that is home to 1.2 million
Palestinians into three segments, blocking transit from north to south.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's next offensive may be more far-reaching than the incursions
into Palestinian towns and refugee camps earlier this month. That sweep
was Israel's biggest military operation in the West Bank and Gaza since
capturing those territories in the 1967 Middle East War, and it triggered
a barrage of international condemnation.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on Israel TV, military affairs analyst Ron Ben-Ishai said
senior army officers and Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had come
up with a plan to send troops into Palestinian territories to capture
suspected militants and deter attacks. The operation, which needs Cabinet
approval, would exceed the scope of previous ones but would stop short of
a full reoccupation, he said.</TE>

<HD>Baby Is Bundle of Proof</HD>
<DH>Guo Yanfeng's parents are determined to use the only evidence they
have to prove who raped their 14-year-old daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LIHEZHUANG, China
</DL>
<LD>The day Guo Shunyou became a grandfather should have been one of
the happiest of his life. But when his daughter gave birth in November to
a healthy boy--normally a prize in a rural village like this--Guo saw it
as an emblem of shame, a stain on his family's honor.</LD>
<LD>   His daughter, Yanfeng, is only 14. She did not bear her son out of
love, or desire, or even her own free will. She had the child on her
parents' orders, for another reason entirely: evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The baby, the family says angrily, is the product of rape--and their
best hope of seeing justice done in a case where the odds appear stacked
against them.</LD>
<TE>   The Guos say the man who fathered the child--one of two men who, they
say, repeatedly assaulted Yanfeng--is a villager with ties to the local
government.</TE>
<TE>   So when police offered to perform a DNA test on Yanfeng's unborn
fetus, which would identify the father yet allow the girl to have an
abortion, her parents demurred. What if the suspect used his connections
to sabotage the investigation? Perhaps some obliging official would
conveniently lose the blood sample or mix up the lab results.</TE>
<TE>   Guo and his wife, uneducated peasant farmers, took the only path they
thought offered any chance of success: They told Yanfeng to have her
attacker's baby, who would be living proof of her rape--and a source of
blood for further DNA tests if anything suspicious happened to the first.</TE>
<TE>   It was a gamble fraught with risk to the girl's physical and emotional
welfare. "My daughter is a child herself," said Guo, 51. But he saw no
alternative. "We just don't trust the police. We need to keep the
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Yanfeng, and her parents' quest for justice, is a
tragic tale that illuminates some of the darker corners of China's
rapidly changing society, problems ranging from the nation's spiraling
crime rate to the economic and social stagnation gripping the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   But at root it is the story of one family's loss of faith in a legal
system so rife with corruption that ordinary people sometimes feel
compelled to go to extraordinary lengths to get a fair shake.</TE>
<TE>   Corruption is the scourge of the Communist Chinese government, which
is riddled with low-level officials willing to turn blind eyes and bend
the rules in exchange for money. Last year, 40,195 officials were
investigated for graft and bribery, with half of them found guilty and
punished, the country's top prosecutor reported this month.</TE>
<TE>   The public routinely ranks official sleaze as the No. 1 problem in the
country--above disruptions stemming from entry to the World Trade
Organization, above China's rivalry with Taiwan, above even the upswing
in violent crime. Trust in government institutions is low. As central
authority loosens and the race for riches grows more heated, cash and
connections have become the ultimate arbiters in society.</TE>
<TE>   This has made justice especially hard to come by for people like the
Guos, who are poor--which is to say powerless.</TE>
<TE>   The family feels completely outmatched by the prime suspect in the
rape of Yanfeng, a villager named Ma Wenzhong who, they say, has both
cash and clout.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing," Guo Shunqing, Yanfeng's uncle and the family's
designated spokesman, complained bitterly. "We can't find any honest and
upright officials here. . . . No one speaks for us."</TE>
<TE>   Even by Chinese standards, the Guos are impoverished. Home is a
tumbledown structure with earthen walls, a cracked tile roof, few
furnishings and a dirt floor that no amount of sweeping can keep clean.
There are two small bedrooms, one off either side of a living room so
narrow that a grown man can stretch out his arms and almost touch both
walls.</TE>
<TE>   In the yard, some chickens, a pig, a goat and a dog paw the dust,
while a recalcitrant goose stands tethered to a tree, a leash looped
around its webbed foot.</TE>
<TE>   If their harvest of rice and green beans is good, the family earns
about $120 a year. But rain has been scarce lately in this pocket of
central China, and so has the Guo household's income.</TE>
<TE>   Yanfeng, an only child with rosy cheeks and a ponytail, has not set
foot in school since kindergarten. Her family cannot afford it. To a
visitor, she appears to be mildly retarded, but getting a diagnosis of
her condition lies beyond her parents' means.</TE>
<TE>   So while her peers diligently memorize Chinese characters and learn
complex math, Yanfeng tends the family's sheep in the hills around her
home, which is where her ordeal began.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the winter of 2000, her family says, Yanfeng was violated
by two men on separate occasions while she was watching the flock. Taking
advantage of her apparent mental impairment and her naivete, Yanfeng's
attackers warned her that they would kill her family if she breathed a
word about what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified, she stayed silent--and continued to be raped--for months.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last summer, Yanfeng's appearance started to change. Her
parents, at first, did not recognize her condition for what it was. "We
just thought she was getting fat," her father said.</TE>
<TE>   Only after a skeptical cousin brought the girl to a clinic did the
family discover she was pregnant. And only after repeated questioning did
she reveal who was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "She refused to say, so we kept at her," her uncle recalled. "Her dad
threatened to beat her to death if she didn't tell. Then she spoke."</TE>
<TE>   Caught between the threats of her attackers and the threats of her
father, Yanfeng identified her assailants as Ma and another village
resident, Li Rongjie.</TE>
<TE>   The family hustled to the police June 30. Both men were brought in for
questioning. Li confessed to raping Yanfeng but insisted that the child
could not be his because he is infertile. He remains in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Ma denied any involvement. Irate, he demanded to be allowed to
confront Yanfeng face to face. He accused her family of slander and
threatened to have Yanfeng's uncle locked up. Citing lack of evidence,
the police let him go.</TE>
<TE>   The Guo family is convinced that Ma, 65, pulled strings in the
township government, where his nephew works, and bought off police and
officials with gifts of food and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   So when investigators told Yanfeng's family that she could go ahead
with an abortion and that a blood sample could be taken from the fetus,
her parents hesitated. "We knew a DNA test could be done without
delivering the baby, but we don't trust the police," the girl's father
said.</TE>
<TE>   The police tried to talk the Guos out of having their daughter carry
the child to term. Local family-planning officials also applied pressure,
warning that the parents could be fined if they allowed their daughter to
give birth without official permission.</TE>
<TE>   But on Nov. 21, Yanfeng checked into the township clinic, underwent
four hours of labor and delivered her baby--then checked out two hours
later. "Of course I was worried about her health," her father said
glumly, pulling at one cigarette after another during an interview. But
"we couldn't afford to let her stay at the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   The birth cost $35.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, the Guos brought Yanfeng's baby, helpless and nameless,
to the county authorities to have blood drawn, as they were told to do.</TE>
<TE>   But to collect samples from the two suspects, police went to the jail,
where Li was being held, and then to Ma's home, where blood was taken
behind closed doors and without outside witnesses present.</TE>
<TE>   The Guos were suspicious. "How come we, the victims, had to travel to
the county to have the blood taken, but Ma Wenzhong, the suspect, just
stayed at home and had the medical examiner draw his blood with the door
closed?" Yanfeng's uncle said.</TE>
<TE>   The township authorities deny any wrongdoing. An official in the local
prosecutor's office, who gave only his surname, Liang, insists that the
police followed proper procedure. He added that the case had been handled
with the utmost care because it involves an underage girl.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Daode, a legal expert at China University of Politics and Law in
Beijing, said resolving such a dispute should be simple.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is a lack of transparency; get an independent third party
involved to, say, monitor the blood-taking to be sure that the blood
comes from the right person," he said. "There should be nothing secret
about such a procedure."</TE>
<TE>   But in China, local police bureaus are notorious for flouting the
rules. Human rights groups allege that torture of suspects is widespread,
especially during national anti-crime drives such as the current "Strike
Hard" campaign, during which hundreds of criminals have been executed
over the past several months.</TE>
<TE>   Even the state-run media here, emboldened by calls from the top for
police accountability, have run sensational stories highlighting the
problem of police abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes obscured, though, is the fact that police suffer from a lack
of resources so serious that proper, scientific crime detection is next
to impossible. Officers are ill-trained and ill-paid, making them more
susceptible to bribes. Many police stations do not have cars or even
cameras, let alone advanced equipment such as lie detectors, fingerprint
sensors or computers. The blood samples in the Guos' case had to be sent
to a city more than an hour's drive away for processing.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, when it came just before last month's Chinese New Year,
proved their worst fears: Neither of the two suspects was the baby's
father, the authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The family rejects that outcome, saying it is tainted by bribery and
impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't even allowed to see the test report. We were simply told
the result," said Guo Shunqing, the girl's uncle.</TE>
<TE>   The family insists that Yanfeng could not have had sex with anyone
else. They have demanded another, independently administered DNA test,
which the authorities have not yet approved and which may depend on
whether the Guos can scrape up the money for it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   So for now they are holding on to the baby. Not for sentimental
reasons, since the family feels no attachment to him. The infant still
has no name. Yanfeng betrays hardly a flicker of emotion as she holds her
sleeping son, a tiny, breathing bundle swathed in dirty strips of cloth.
But then the whole experience, her family says--the trauma of being raped
and of having to bear her attacker's child--has turned a carefree girl
into a withdrawn teenager with a vacant stare.</TE>
<TE>   The Guos hope to be vindicated by a second DNA test. If that happens,
declared Yanfeng's father, the baby will have served its purpose. Then
they will give the boy away--to anyone who wants to raise him.</TE>

<HD>In Colombia, Anti-Drug Plan Has Come a Cropper</HD>

<DL>FLORENCIA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>State Department officials have concluded that an alternative
development plan aimed at slashing drug crops has failed, a decision that
raises doubts about the U.S.-backed effort to eradicate the primary
source of cocaine on America's streets.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers in southern Colombia who signed voluntary agreements to
eliminate coca, the source of cocaine, in exchange for aid have
eliminated little or none of their harvest and have no intention of doing
so before a deadline later this year, according to a confidential State
Department report.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, U.S. Embassy officials have decided to largely abandon a
plan to encourage the substitution of other crops and products for coca.
Instead, they will concentrate on building large infrastructure projects
to provide jobs, and improve living conditions and transportation.</LD>
<TE>   And they will rely increasingly on a controversial aerial fumigation
program to show farmers, mostly rural poor with small plots of land, that
their coca will be wiped out if they do not stop growing it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing that we can offer [the farmers] as an alternative
that comes near the value of coca," said Ken Ellis, the head of the U.S.
Agency for International Development in Colombia. "They're not going to
give that up unless there's a credible threat that they will be forced to
eradicate."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. decision represents a radical new direction in the
alternative development program, long touted as the only way to ensure a
permanent reduction in the coca crops that fill valleys and riverbanks
throughout southern Colombia, which is the source of most of the cocaine
that reaches the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on alternative development and peasant farming say that the
changes spell disaster. Small-time coca farmers, who often plant coca
alongside traditional crops such as corn, will face food shortages if
spraying becomes the primary tool to encourage eradication and kills
their food crops as well.</TE>
<TE>   And they say that many of the farmers, who migrated to isolated
southern Colombia in search of work, will simply move to other areas to
grow coca if they are not taught how to raise other crops.</TE>
<TE>   "You can spray all you want, you can spend all the money in Europe and
the United States, but the problem of coca will continue," said Jesus
Bastidas, the director of an alternative development program in
Florencia, the capital of Caqueta state.</TE>
<TE>More Funding Urged</TE>
<TE>   Colombian government officials acknowledge that the alternative
development program has failed to produce results. But they say more time
and money are needed. Only 96 of Colombia's 222 coca-growing counties
have programs in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We need permanent support," said Maria Ines Restrepo, the head of
Colombia's alternative development program. "Our conflict is not going to
end without social investment."</TE>
<TE>   There are few problems more stubborn in the fight against drugs than
what to do about the 100,000 or so small coca farmers in Colombia, a
dilemma involving social, political and economic issues intertwined with
Colombia's nearly 40-year-old guerrilla war.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the farmers moved to isolated corners of Colombia in the 1970s
and '80s in search of jobs or land. Once there, they grew traditional
crops along with coca on small, five-acre plots. They were helped by
narcotics traffickers and leftist guerrillas, who provided seeds, loans
and technical advice.</TE>
<TE>   Although estimates vary, such farmers account for at least 15% of the
coca grown in Colombia, which last year had about 321,000 acres of coca,
according to a State Department report. The rest is grown on huge
plantations.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that wiping out the coca through fumigation would simply
lead to widespread displacement, food shortages and environmental damage,
as farmers push deeper into Colombia's rain forest.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Plan Colombia, the multibillion-dollar U.S.-backed effort
to halve drug production here by 2005, included a budget of more than
$100 million for alternative development. The idea was to wean farmers
off coca by providing new sources of income through alternative crops or
jobs in industries such as rubber production.</TE>
<TE>   As of the beginning of this year, Colombian officials had signed up
nearly 40,000 small farmers who had planted about 45,000 acres of coca
and poppy, the source of heroin. Most of those projects were concentrated
in the southern state of Putumayo.</TE>
<TE>   A program created and initially funded by the Colombian government in
Putumayo provided farmers a package of aid worth as much as $1,000,
including chickens, cows, seeds or technical assistance. In return, the
farmers would pull up their coca crops by this July.</TE>
<TE>   But State Department officials said a confidential, 2 1/2-month study
of the area late last year concluded that the farmers had no intention of
pulling up their crops. The officials added that it was unclear whether
the Colombian government actually expected them to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Similar alternative development programs in the past had failed.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government's aid was slow in reaching the area, whose
drug crops have made it one of the most contested regions in the
guerrilla war. The U.S. government also insisted that farmers pull up all
their coca crops before receiving any U.S. aid. That led to confusion
among many farmers and local alternative development groups, who say they
were told that aid would flow to help soften the blow as farmers pulled
up their crops.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, say those involved in the program, neither side trusted
the other, and few farmers pulled up any coca plants.</TE>
<TE>   A General Accounting Office report in February found that the
alternative development program had made "little progress" and was in
need of review.</TE>
<TE>   "The results to date have been disappointing," said a top U.S. Embassy
official during a recent conference in Miami. "In violation of the
agreements, many of these communities continue to plant new coca."</TE>
<TE>Isolation a Problem</TE>
<TE>   Another problem was that many of the proposed alternatives to coca
crops were simply not viable. Putumayo, just west of the Amazon basin, is
a tropical region long separated from the rest of Colombia. Its isolation
makes it nearly impossible to economically transport agricultural goods
to market. And the region's poor soils cannot sustain intensive farming
or grazing.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to encourage farming of rice, beef cattle, chickens, pigs and
fish have all been shelved. The U.S. will continue to support such
projects elsewhere in Colombia and back some alternative development in
Putumayo, such as a plan to grow trees for specialty lumber.</TE>
<TE>   But even those projects have no guarantees should they prove
unprofitable.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not gone back on our word on these activities," Ellis said.
"Coupled with infrastructure, there are some activities that may be
feasible."</TE>
<TE>   A final problem with alternative development is security. The
Colombian military, paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas are constantly
battling in the region. Two aid workers were killed in Putumayo last
year.</TE>
<TE>   To replace the existing plans, the U.S. is rushing to put into action
a new plan to build about $17 million in infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller projects, chosen by individual communities that eradicate
their coca, will include new schools, health clinics, running water and
electricity. Large projects will be managed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and involve building bridges and roads to better connect
Putumayo with the rest of Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   However, development of infrastructure projects raises fears that U.S.
money will help speed the flow of the region's coca crop to U.S. markets.
It also creates the possibility that U.S. aid will end up in the hands of
the guerrillas, who control much of Putumayo and demand protection
payments from workers and contractors.</TE>
<TE>   One aid worker acknowledged that he already writes up fake invoices
when he distributes aid from a previous alternative development project
funded by the Interamerican Development Bank and the United Nations so
that he can pay off the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you have to do here," said the worker, who asked not to
be identified.</TE>

<HD>French Shooting Suspect Plunges to His Death</HD>
<DH>Violence: Man jumps from police headquarters roof after his arrest
in a rampage that killed eight officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>In a startling twist to a massacre that caused a political uproar,
a 33-year-old psychiatric patient accused of gunning down eight suburban
city council members escaped interrogators Thursday and then jumped to
his death from a rooftop at police headquarters, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   France's justice and interior ministers immediately announced an
investigation into the suicide of Richard Durn, who police say had
confessed to the Wednesday shooting rampage in suburban Nanterre west of
Paris.</LD>
<LD>   The case already had surged to the forefront of a presidential
campaign that has focused on public safety. And the suicide of a suspect
in an extraordinarily high-profile crime underscored questions about a
law enforcement system seemingly overwhelmed by U.S.-style street
violence.</LD>
<TE>   "This, in my view, is a matter of grave dysfunction," said Interior
Minister Daniel Vaillant, who oversees the national police and other
security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Nanterre's mayor was indignant that detectives in Paris could not
control Durn, who had been apprehended by officials who braved a barrage
from two semiautomatic pistols to subdue him.</TE>
<TE>   "They risked their lives and were able to control him, disarm him to
turn over to the police, but at [headquarters] they aren't able to guard
him," said Mayor Jacqueline Fraysse, who barely survived the rampage.
"And there will be no trial. The families will not know. They had a right
to know."</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors said Durn was being questioned Thursday at the
headquarters of the national investigative police, part of a complex of
19th century government buildings on the cobblestoned Isle de la Cite, an
island in the Seine River in central Paris. The room had an unbarred
window facing onto a rooftop, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The two interrogators were high-ranking and experienced detectives.
Durn, who was not handcuffed, was allowed to get up to review a document,
according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "He suddenly bolted in the direction of the window, which he opened,
and he hurled himself toward the roof," a police statement said. "The two
officials tried to stop him by grabbing his legs, but the determination
of the suspect, whose body was already mostly out of the window, thwarted
that attempt."</TE>
<TE>   Durn then killed himself by leaping from the rooftop into a courtyard,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   French law enforcement has a reputation for effectiveness when it
comes to fighting complex crimes such as terrorism. Nonetheless, the slow
pace of justice has prompted reforms intended to reduce overcrowding and
improve conditions in dilapidated jails and prisons. Police on the beat
have struggled as crime goes up.</TE>
<TE>   "There is really something that doesn't work anymore in France," said
Francois Bayrou, a candidate in the presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities want to know how Durn eluded tough gun laws. He obtained a
license for his guns in 1996 and belonged to a shooting club despite a
history of ominous behavior. He had undergone psychiatric treatment for
depression and suicidal tendencies since 1990, according to his mother.
Moreover, he used a gun to threaten staff at a psychiatrist's office in
1998, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Durn did not renew his license in 2000, he possessed his three
handguns illegally, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Gun-related crime has become a concern in France as the result of a
flow of weapons from the Balkans. Once smugglers enter the European
Union, the absence of borders makes for booming business.</TE>

<HD>Pro-Mugabe 'Witch Hunt' Is Targeting Opposition Supporters,
Activists Allege</HD>
<DH>Africa: Rights groups say ruling party militants have torched homes
and killed four people in Zimbabwe since the president's reelection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Pro-government militants in Zimbabwe have launched a "witch hunt"
for suspected opposition supporters in the wake of that country's
presidential election, according to human rights activists and opposition
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The activists said Thursday that ruling party militants had killed
four supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change since the election
that returned longtime President Robert Mugabe to power earlier this
month and that hundreds of others had been chased from their homes. In
other incidents, opposition supporters have been abducted and scores of
their homes have been torched and their possessions stolen, the activists
said.</LD>
<LD>   The assaults came in reprisal for refusal to vote for Mugabe and his
ruling ZANU-PF party, MDC officials and human rights groups said. They
charge that the government is trying to eliminate any political
opposition.</LD>
<TE>   "It's extremely serious," said Nkanyiso Maqeda, an information officer
for the MDC. He spoke by phone from the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. "It's
actually a calculated retribution action by the government. It's not
something coincidental. It's not something spontaneous. It's something
planned."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials dismissed the charges of a state-sponsored witch
hunt as ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   "The only truth is that the MDC are bad losers," said George Charamba,
Zimbabwe's secretary of state for information and publicity. "Because
they lost the elections, they are trying to win sympathy on the basis of
claims and accusations."</TE>
<TE>   Many local and foreign observer groups have condemned the election as
deeply flawed and rigged to guarantee Mugabe's victory. Mugabe's main
challenger, the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai, called the vote "daylight
robbery."</TE>
<TE>   The Commonwealth, consisting of Britain and its former colonies, has
suspended Zimbabwe from the organization for a year, citing the "high
level of politically motivated violence" surrounding the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Forty people, mainly opposition supporters, have been killed in
political violence since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition officials said their polling agents were the main targets.
The names of polling agents representing the various political parties
were published in newspapers before the election, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation "has intensified and become more focused, in that now
they are actively looking for MDC supporters and are hunting them
accordingly," said Frances Lovemore, a doctor with Armani Trust, a
leading human rights group in Zimbabwe. "They are on a door-to-door witch
hunt. It's dreadful at the moment."</TE>
<TE>Evidence of Opposition Supporters on the Run</TE>
<TE>   Lovemore said her group, which provides medical treatment to victims
of political violence, has evidence that about 1,250 MDC supporters are
on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Lovemore said she has treated a variety of injuries, including soles
that were beaten raw, whipped buttocks, lacerated backs and ruptured
eardrums.</TE>
<TE>   Munyaradzi Bidi of ZimRights, a human rights group based in Harare,
said last week that members of the Zimbabwean election observer team,
drawn largely from church groups and civic society, had been "threatened
for having taken part in the observing."</TE>
<TE>   Also of mounting concern for opposition activists is the continued
existence of so-called terror camps--in places such as school halls and
community centers--where youth brigades with the ZANU-PF, or Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front, allegedly gather to stage attacks
on opposition supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Government official Charamba said that reports by local human rights
groups couldn't be trusted because the organizations are notoriously
pro-MDC and therefore the information they give is unlikely to be
objective.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't forget who the Armani Trust is. Don't forget who the Zimbabwe
Human Rights Network is. They are part of the propaganda infrastructure
of the MDC . . . of the British government," Charamba said.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe has accused the opposition of being a puppet of Britain,
Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler. He accuses the MDC of seeking to
recolonize Zimbabwe by handing power back to the country's minority white
population, many of whom are British descendants and have traditionally
made a living in Zimbabwe as industrialists or commercial farmers.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't surprising, therefore, that white farmers say there has also
been a surge in violence against them and their laborers since the
election ended.</TE>
<TE>   A white farmer was killed in the week after Mugabe's March 17
inauguration, bringing to 10 the number of white farmers killed in the
two years since the government launched its controversial "fast track"
land reform program that seeks to wrest land from whites for
redistribution to landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,500 white farmers own 70% of the country's best farmland. The
government wants to seize at least 20.5 million acres of the 29.6 million
acres now in white hands. Not all the farms have been taken, but veterans
of Zimbabwe's independence war and other pro-government militants have
illegally occupied some of them.</TE>
<TE>Harassment and Looting at Farms</TE>
<TE>   Colin Cloete, president of the predominantly white Commercial Farmers'
Union, which backed Tsvangirai in the election, said last week that
incidents of harassment, trashing and looting, forced eviction, extortion
and political retribution had reached "alarming proportions" on farms
since the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Black farm laborers have borne the brunt of the assaults.</TE>
<TE>   CFU spokeswoman Jenni Williams said about 5,000 farm workers in the
area of Marondera, about 50 miles southeast of Harare, had been forced to
leave their homes in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers said the labor force in the Marondera area could have shrunk
by as much as 50% because of the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Charamba, the government official, said that in some cases, the
farmers had only themselves to blame for any clashes because many of them
were "illegally staying on properties that used to be theirs, because
they don't want to acknowledge that the government has taken over those
farms."</TE>
<TE>   But opposition supporters charge that the land issue is being used as
a smoke screen to shield the government as it uses underhanded tactics
against the MDC.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an absolute nightmare," said Roy Bennett, an MDC politician from
the country's southeast. "It is a nationwide strategy that is being
carried out by the government. It's going to continue until they wipe out
any opposition support in Zimbabwe."</TE>

<HD>Polish Archbishop Resigns as Rumors Swirl</HD>
<DH>Religion: Cleric denies that he made advances to seminarians and
young priests. The publicity of the case is unprecedented in the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>A Polish archbishop accused of making homosexual advances toward
seminarians and young priests announced his resignation Thursday in a bid
to end a scandal that has rocked the Roman Catholic Church in Pope John
Paul II's homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, 67, has repeatedly denied the allegations,
which erupted in the Polish media late last month.</LD>
<LD>   "My kindness and spontaneity have been taken advantage of," Paetz told
his congregation in the western Polish city of Poznan at his farewell
Mass on Thursday. "My words, gestures and behavior were distorted and
misrepresented."</LD>
<TE>   Polish media have reported in recent weeks that rumors of Paetz's
alleged advances had circulated among priests in Poznan for at least the
last three years. The rumors became public in February when
Rzeczpospolita, a Polish daily widely seen as responsible and cautious,
reported the allegations on its front page, quoting unnamed priests.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, the Vatican confirmed that John Paul had accepted the
resignation of Paetz, who served as a top aide to the Polish-born pope
from 1978 to 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The Paetz case differs from sex scandals that recently hit the
Catholic Church in the United States in that the charges in Poland were
raised by priests rather than parishioners. Also, in heavily Catholic
Poland, issues of sexual behavior by priests have almost never been
spoken of openly in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Polish church, this is an experience without precedent,"
Father Adam Boniecki, editor in chief of Krakow-based Tygodnik
Powszechny, a weekly publication largely focused on church issues, said
Thursday on state-run television. "Never before has such a problem been
discussed publicly."</TE>
<TE>   In Polish media reports, Paetz was accused of making homosexual
advances such as touching, cuddling and kissing and of paying unannounced
visits to the lodgings of seminarians, sometimes using a 200-yard
underground tunnel leading to their dormitory.</TE>
<TE>   Rzeczpospolita, in its original article, reported that the rector of
the seminary eventually banned Paetz from visiting unless the archbishop
made arrangements in advance.</TE>
<TE>   No victims of sexual abuse have come forward publicly or sought legal
redress.</TE>
<TE>   "All the priests talking about the case do not have evidence for
homosexual acts," Marcin Przeciszewski, head of the Catholic Information
Agency, a religious news service run by the church in Poland, said
recently. "These accusations are only about the behavior of the
archbishop, gestures. These clerics considered them as proposals. The
archbishop says he is innocent and that he is like a father to them. The
situation is not very clear."</TE>
<TE>   But some sought more aggressively Thursday to distance the church from
Paetz.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this going to paralyze and dispirit us? No," Jozef Zycinski, the
archbishop of Lublin, said at a Mass. "After all, among the apostles,
there was a drama of betrayal by Judas, and the fact that Judas was a
traitor did not erase the fact that John was faithful."</TE>
<TE>   Paetz said Thursday that he was resigning because "the church in
Poznan, to live and grow, needs unity and peace."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in a letter that Paetz distributed to be read in Poznan
churches March 17, he denied "all the information published by the media"
and declared: "The biggest criminals have a right to anonymity unless a
court decides otherwise. I was deprived of that. Mass media have already
judged me and sentenced me."</TE>
<TE>   Some priests refused to read the letter to their congregations,
according to media reports.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican announced Thursday that John Paul had named Stanislaw
Gadecki, 52, an auxiliary bishop from nearby Gniezno, as Paetz's
successor.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's action came a week after John Paul broke his silence on sex
abuse cases in the United States and several European countries by saying
that those who were guilty had succumbed to evil and had cast a shadow of
suspicion over all priests.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul referred to the issue again in a homily at the Vatican on
Thursday, inviting prayers for "those priestly brothers of ours who have
not lived up to the commitments they made when they were ordained or who
are going through a period of difficulty and crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials have said the pope has been deeply saddened by the
Paetz scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Polish media have reported that at the urging of local priests, the
Vatican sent an investigative team to Poland in November to look into the
allegations, and that no direct evidence was found that Paetz had
sexually abused anyone. But it did conclude that he should be removed
from his post for unspecified inappropriate behavior toward seminarians
and priests, the reports said.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Mine Kills Navy SEAL</HD>
<DH>Military: Another is wounded in the blast during a training
exercise in Kandahar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A Navy SEAL was killed and another wounded in Afghanistan on
Thursday when a land mine exploded during a training exercise near
Kandahar, U.S. military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Chief Petty Officer Matthew Bourgeois, 35, of Tallahassee, Fla.,
became the 33rd American killed in the nearly 6-month-old Afghan
campaign. Bourgeois, a member of the Navy's elite Sea, Air and Land
force, was involved in small-arms training at 8:30 a.m. when the
explosion occurred.</LD>
<LD>   The injuries to the second SEAL, who was not identified, were not
considered life-threatening, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Thirteen servicemen and a CIA agent have been killed in combat-related
deaths in Afghanistan, and 19 U.S. military members have been killed in
nonhostile incidents, including plane crashes. The largest single loss of
life came March 4, when two helicopters came under enemy fire near Gardez
in eastern Afghanistan and seven Americans were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Bourgeois, a 14-year Navy and SEAL veteran, left a wife and
7-month-old son, said Lt. Cmdr. Denise Shorey, a spokeswoman at the
Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk, Va.</TE>
<TE>   In a news briefing, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld conveyed his
condolences to Bourgeois' family and said he was "enormously grateful for
his service. . . . This is, we're reminded almost weekly, a dangerous
effort."</TE>
<TE>   After decades of war, Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined
countries in the world, and the landscape is littered with aging
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Five peacekeepers--three Danes and two Germans--were killed near
Kabul, the Afghan capital, this month when an old Soviet-made SA-3
antiaircraft missile exploded as they were trying to destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Thursday, Rumsfeld said U.S. forces would keep
prisoners they consider dangerous in custody, even if they were acquitted
of specific charges. He suggested that the detentions would last through
the war on terrorism, not merely the Afghan campaign. U.S. leaders would
consider the war over, he said, "when we feel there are not effective
global terrorist networks functioning in the world that [the detainees]
could go back to."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said it was "a matter of simple common sense" to hold
prisoners who might pose a danger if released. He asserted that the same
practice had been followed in earlier wars and that it was in keeping
with the Geneva Convention.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question but that the United States has every right to
defend itself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has detained hundreds of suspected Taliban and Al
Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in
southeastern Cuba. Officials have turned some over to other countries for
trial and let others go because they were believed to pose no threat.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rumsfeld acknowledged that the United States and other
countries in the anti-terrorism coalition are having trouble figuring out
how to establish internal peace and security for Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Some United Nations officials, private analysts and others have argued
that the 4,500-member international peacekeeping force that now patrols
Kabul needs to be expanded to other cities to provide the security that
will allow Afghanistan to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has opposed this expansion, arguing that it
could hinder the U.S. mission of fighting and destroying remaining Al
Qaeda and Taliban forces. In addition, some major European countries,
including France and Germany, have declined to provide more troops.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said those calling for an expanded international force "are
not offering troops, nor are they offering money" to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that the United States has begun training Afghans to be
part of a new national army and is committed to taking other steps to
improve the Central Asian nation's security.</TE>

<DL>NAHRIN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Land mines disgorged by aftershocks and landslides are slowing aid
workers trying to reach earthquake victims in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Crews trying to deliver food and tents must now move gingerly on roads
once considered safe, the United Nations and private aid groups said
Thursday. Other shipments are being brought in by British and U.S.
helicopters.</LD>
<LD>   "When the land moves like this, it litters the areas that have been
de-mined," said Chris Hyslop, an emergency program officer with the aid
group Mercy Corps. "I can't speak for all the humanitarian agencies, but
we don't go anywhere it isn't safe."</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the battered country observed a national day of mourning
as it struggled to count the dead from Monday's quake.</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude 6.1 temblor heavily damaged nearly 80 villages in a
mountainous region nine miles wide, leaving an estimated 100,000 people
homeless or cut off from food supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations said the estimated death toll stood at about 600
Wednesday, but the final number was expected to be between 800 and 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, relief workers brought food, medicine and tents to
Nahrin, 105 miles north of the capital, Kabul. U.S. and British forces
dispatched six helicopters laden with food and blankets.</TE>
<TE>   In the largely isolated Burka region, an estimated 12,000 people were
homeless, Hyslop said. The quake leveled 95% of the mud-brick homes in
the area's 11 villages, and aftershocks took care of the rest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not destroyed," Hyslop said, "it's about to fall down."</TE>

<HD>Italy Says Warning Unfounded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Thursday that there is "no
need for particular concern" as his defense chief criticized the U.S.
government for warning that extremists might target Americans in four
Italian cities on Easter.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Italy stepped up security in the wake of the State
Department's warning Wednesday that a "possible threat exists to U.S.
citizens in the cities of Venice, Florence, Milan and Verona on Easter
Sunday from extremist groups." It urged Americans to be alert and avoid
large crowds.</LD>
<LD>   After a Cabinet meeting Thursday, Berlusconi said Italy was ready to
deal with any possible terrorist threat. "We have put anything that can
be put on alert on alert," he said, "but based on the information we
have, there is no need for particular concern."</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. official said the warning was based on information developed in
cooperation with Italian authorities. But Italian Defense Minister
Antonio Martino, who commands both defense forces and paramilitary
police, said the U.S. decision to issue the warning was "unfortunate and
inopportune."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher stood by the
decision to issue the warning, saying the United States feels a strong
obligation to speak out when there is a credible and specific threat that
cannot be eliminated in advance.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Captures No. 2 Leader of Gulf Drug Cartel</HD>
<DH>Crackdown: Adan Medrano's arrest is the latest strike in the
government's offensive against narcotics rings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Mexican authorities claimed another trophy in their crackdown on
drug bosses, arresting a man who they say is second in command of the
Gulf cartel, a major heroin-, marijuana- and cocaine-smuggling ring based
in the border state of Tamaulipas.</LD>
<LD>   Adan Medrano, believed to be the cartel's operations chief, was
arrested Wednesday afternoon in Matamoros as he bought ice cream for a
family member. He was armed with a gold-plated .38-caliber pistol but did
not resist arrest.</LD>
<LD>   The capture is the latest blow to the Gulf cartel, and the latest
strike in the offensive by President Vicente Fox's administration against
the half a dozen major narcotics rings that former U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration head Thomas A. Constantine once called more powerful than
the Mexican government.</LD>
<TE>   It's unclear whether the cartels have been so crippled that the flow
of drugs to American consumers has been slowed. But U.S. law enforcement
officials have nonetheless applauded the Fox administration's resolve in
attacking cartels that were once thought "untouchable."</TE>
<TE>   Medrano, 32, was indicted in U.S. federal court in Brownsville, Texas,
in 2000 on charges of marijuana trafficking and threatening the lives of
federal agents. The U.S. had offered a $2-million reward for Medrano's
arrest, equal to that offered for Osiel Cardenas, the Gulf cartel's
chief.</TE>
<TE>   Medrano's capture follows the arrest in April of another Gulf cartel
boss, Gilberto Garcia Mena. Mexican and U.S. officials say Cardenas'
arrest may be imminent.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference here Thursday, Mexican Deputy Atty. Gen. Estuardo
Mario Bermudez said that Medrano had been under observation for months
and that he expects the United States to seek Medrano's extradition after
he stands trial in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "This weakens in a substantial manner the structure of the [Gulf]
cartel," Bermudez said.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-drug campaign's biggest prize so far is Benjamin Arellano
Felix, head of the Tijuana cartel, who was seized March 9 by Mexican army
soldiers at his home in Puebla, about 70 miles east of Mexico City. His
brother Ramon had been killed in a police shootout in Mazatlan in
February.</TE>
<TE>   The Juarez cartel was hit by the arrest in June of logistics chief
Alcides Ramon Magana. The fugitive former governor of Quintana Roo state,
Mario Villanueva, who allegedly helped facilitate drug shipments for the
Juarez cartel in return for $500,000 per planeload, was caught in May.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Caro Quintero of the Sinaloa gang was arrested in December. His
brother Rafael was jailed in connection with the 1985 torture-murder of
DEA agent Enrique Camarena.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Medrano was transferred to a nearby army barracks,
then taken via airplane to a secure location in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1999, Medrano and Cardenas allegedly stopped a car in
Matamoros carrying two U.S. agents and threatened them with death.</TE>
<TE>   Bermudez, who is Mexico's chief drug fighter, said the arrest of
Arellano Felix opens the possibility of a bloody fight for dominance,
especially in the lucrative Baja California smuggling corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "A violent wave may be unleashed in order to take over rights to use
the shipment routes formerly under the Arellano Felix organization,"
Bermudez said.</TE>

<LD>A Tokyo court rejected a lawsuit today filed against Japan by two
"comfort women" from China who had demanded redress, saying they were
kidnapped and forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War
II.</LD>
<LD>   The rejection of the lawsuit, which was filed in February 1996, is in
line with the Japanese government's position that all wartime
compensation issues with China were settled by a September 1972 joint
statement that established diplomatic ties.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs, 75-year-old Gou Xi Cui, and Hou Qiao Lian, who died in
May 1999, had demanded that Japan pay each of them $173,300 in damages
and publish apologies in four major Japanese newspapers.</LD>

<HD>U.N. Calls On Rebels to Seize the Chance for Peace in Angola</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Security Council, endorsing what U.N. officials call Angola's
best chance for peace in a generation, urged that country's UNITA rebels
Thursday to embrace a new government proposal for "reconciliation" with
insurgent forces.</LD>
<LD>   The battle death last month of UNITA founder Jonas Savimbi led to
almost immediate cease-fire talks between rebels and the Angolan army in
the war-ravaged province of Moxico, about 500 miles southeast of Luanda,
Angola's capital. The negotiations could produce a truce within a few
days, Angolan officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. officials are urging Angolans to follow any cease-fire deal with
wide-ranging political negotiations that would lead to UNITA's
disarmament and the full participation of rebel leaders in the country's
political life after nearly three decades of war.</LD>
<TE>   "The Security Council urges UNITA to recognize the historic nature of
this opportunity to end the conflict with dignity, to give a clear,
positive response to the government's offer of peace," the council said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel forces should begin by "disavowing the use of arms and
demilitarizing completely," while the government should cooperate with
U.N. mediators to "ensure the transparency and credibility of the peace
process," the council said.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.N. officials say some leaders of UNITA, or the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, are cooperating with the
peace initiatives, they have expressed concern that without rapid
demilitarization, the rebel forces could splinter into regional factions
that would try to retain control over territory and lucrative
diamond-smuggling enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Angolan government asked UNITA to select
representatives for a peace commission that would revive a failed attempt
at negotiations to end a war that has killed an estimated 500,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special advisor on Africa, Ibrahim
Gambari, told the council last week that Savimbi's death and the
government's offer had given Angola a major opportunity to end the
bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   But Gambari said that some rebel bands have refused to lay down their
arms and that local residents continue to flee UNITA's remaining rural
strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   Angola has what the United Nations says is the world's highest
proportion of internal refugees, with an estimated 4.5 million of the
country's 13 million people living in temporary shelter far from their
home villages. An additional 450,000 Angolans are housed in refugee camps
in Zambia and other neighboring countries, according to the Office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Gambari said negotiating efforts have been complicated by competition
among "the many UNITAs"--rebel fighters in the countryside, die-hard
Savimbi loyalists in the rebels' political leadership, the UNITA Renovada
movement that favors peace talks, and UNITA diplomatic and business
operatives outside Angola.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important to get them organized so that there can be a
single voice of UNITA," Gambari said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After a week of both staggering bloodshed and intriguing offers
from the Arab League and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
U.S. peace efforts in the Mideast remained dependent on the answers to
two broad questions: Are any of the parties actually on the same
wavelength about what should happen next? And is anyone really listening
to the United States?</LD>
<LD>   The most hopeful reply to both, amid conflicting signals, is a very
tentative "maybe."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the cautiously optimistic spin offered Thursday by U.S.
officials, they privately acknowledged that the crisis could get far
worse before any progress is made. And that was before the attack on
Arafat's office early today.</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe welcomed the Arab League's
decision Thursday to embrace a proposal from Saudi Arabia that offers
Israel "normal relations" in exchange for its withdrawal from territories
occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. And President Bush pledged that
the United States will continue to push for progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the Middle East looks like there'll never be peace. But I can
assure you, we're not giving up. We're not going to let murderers disrupt
a march to peace," he said at a Dallas fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the U.S. efforts basically are stuck in a bloody limbo, as
illustrated by the events Thursday. To pave the way for deeper U.S.
mediation, Arafat announced his willingness to accept an unconditional
cease-fire--at the same time that Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a
Jewish settlement near the West Bank town of Nablus, killing four people.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israel expressed skepticism about the overtures from both
the Arab League and Arafat. Arafat "has to take real action," said Raanan
Gissin, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Israel laid siege to Arafat's Ramallah headquarters,
fought fierce gun battles with his bodyguards and began demolishing the
outer walls of his compound. It formally declared the Palestinian leader
an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   So despite a new sense of movement generated this week, the gap
between the two sides is still wide--perhaps the biggest chasm since the
peace process began more than a decade ago. "I don't know if we've ever
witnessed such a total collapse of trust," a Bush administration official
lamented. "It's hard to see how to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides appear to be playing for points with their own
constituencies, not each other, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat's offer is disingenuous. If he were able to deliver on a
cease-fire, why didn't he do it before?" said Henry Steigman, a Mideast
expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Without a commitment from
Israel to end the occupation and agree to the emergence of a Palestinian
state, there's no way he can enforce a cease-fire. So it's a desperate
ploy to hold off Israeli retribution.</TE>
<TE>   "And Sharon's approach has given more importance to annexing the
territories and maintaining settlements than to peace with his neighbors.
So his objective is to avoid returning to the borders of 1967, which
means there is no reason to expect him to pay attention to the Saudi
offer."</TE>
<TE>   Even the United States appears to be on a different wavelength. The
Bush administration virtually dismissed Arafat's cease-fire offer
Thursday because it didn't include an agreement on specific steps called
for in a plan mediated last year by CIA Director George J. Tenet. And the
State Department called the Arab League proposal a catalyst for peace,
rather than a specific plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vision. It's an idea. [But] how to get there is still the
problem," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "Many of the
issues need to be negotiated by the parties."</TE>
<TE>   Just how far apart the Israelis and the Palestinians remain is
underscored by the very means of communication between them.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have come to believe that violence is the most important
instrument in preventing the other side from compelling them to accept
undesirable terms," said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert at the
University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Palestinians and Israelis often appear deaf to the
appeals, proddings and proposals from the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Arafat has refused to heed the now-daily U.S. calls to rein
in militants and end the escalating cycle of violence. He repeatedly
promises to act but fails to follow through.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such an anti-U.S. attitude that has developed among the
Palestinians, because they perceive the administration is so pro-Israel
that I doubt if they'll be responsive to Bush and company," said Los
Angeles fund-raiser Stanley Sheinbaum, who helped broker breakthrough
Mideast meetings in Stockholm in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   And Sharon openly spurned calls from Vice President Dick Cheney and
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to allow Arafat, who had been confined
to his West Bank headquarters, to attend the Arab League summit in
Beirut. Sharon has also failed to act on appeals to lighten the economic
pressure on the Palestinians, who have seen incomes more than halved and
unemployment skyrocket during Israeli crackdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon is such a hard-liner that he doesn't care what the U.S.
thinks," Sheinbaum said. "In the final analysis, he needs U.S. support,
arms and aid, but he's a hard-nosed guy."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledge the difficulty of the situation. "Neither
side is heeding the message. There's little regard for our
pronouncements, and there's almost no sense of urgency for action," the
administration official said. "Both sides have instead become focused on
what they perceive as the complete unreliability of the other party, and
it's hard for us to prove otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "And unfortunately, in the meantime, there's still a lot of fight left
in both sides."</TE>

<HD>Celebration of an Escape Turned Into a Death Trap</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Isaac Atsits and friends were marking Jews' exodus from
Egypt when a suicide bomber struck.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KFAR SAVA, Israel
</DL>
<LD>His daughters had warned him that spending the Passover Seder at a
crowded hotel would be dangerous. Undeterred, 73-year-old Isaac Atsits
joined his fellow retirees at table No. 17 in the festive dining hall of
the Park Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   As the group of 12 got comfortable, chatted and waited for the dinner
to begin, a 25-year-old Palestinian armed with a powerful bomb planted
himself smack in the center of the room. The deafening explosion brought
the ceiling down, hurled tables and chairs into the air and plunged the
dinner guests, covered with glass and metal shards, into awful darkness.</LD>
<LD>   Partially blinded by a blow to an eye, Atsits managed to escape,
crawling over debris and climbing out of the wreckage. Around him, 22
people lay dead or dying.</LD>
<TE>   Atsits and about 60 other Israelis and foreign Jews who were visiting
for the Passover holiday remained in half a dozen hospitals Thursday. He
doesn't know yet what happened to the friends he was sitting with.</TE>
<TE>   "We get used to these attacks daily, but last night's was especially
painful," he said in the Meir Hospital in Kfar Sava, about 20 miles
southeast of the coastal city of Netanya, where the attack occurred. His
left eye was bloodshot and badly bruised, as was the left side of his
nose; his left eardrum had been slightly torn.</TE>
<TE>   "I would describe it as 10 attacks all together, like the 10 plagues,"
he said, alluding to the biblical story recounted on Passover in which
God visited locusts, frogs, pestilence and other scourges on the Egyptian
pharaoh because he refused to free the enslaved Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Forensic experts had been able to identify only 14 of the 21 dead by
Thursday evening, 24 hours after the explosion. The bomber blew himself
up in a closed, crowded room, intensifying the deadly force, and his bomb
contained screws, nuts and other sharp metal pieces that bored through
the bodies of his victims. Entire families suffered casualties.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel dining hall was packed with about 250 people, most of whom
paid the equivalent of $100 for the meal and a night's stay.</TE>
<TE>   Atsits and his friends, men and women in their 70s and 80s, were
retirees from the Israeli court system. The Syrian-born Atsits, who
immigrated to what is today Israel in the 1930s, had worked in Israel's
Supreme Court as an administrator and Hebrew-Arabic translator until his
retirement in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The retirees always did things together. They took vacations and
gathered for Hanukkah parties. Atsits had never before joined them for
the Passover Seder. He preferred to spend the holiday that marks the
exodus of the Jews from Egypt with his wife and daughters at home.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, his wife was sick and he didn't trust his daughter to
observe Passover's strict Kosher rules in her preparation of the Seder.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the group was to celebrate at another hotel up the road.
Then the Park offered a special deal, the same price for a hotel with one
more star. The group was to have Seder and spend a four-day holiday at
the Park.</TE>
<TE>   Atsits' daughters were worried about him. But it's not like his home
was such a refuge. Atsits lives on downtown Jerusalem's Jaffa Street,
site of repeated bomb and shooting attacks in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this happens every day," he said. "But we have to continue
with our lives. We can't give them the joy of interrupting our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Atsits, like many Israelis, thinks the United States is holding Israel
back and preventing it from wiping out Palestinian violence once and for
all. The reason, he said, is that the Bush administration needs to curry
Arab support for any eventual action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. wants to do their war, not our war," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Park on Thursday, crowds gathered to watch the cleanup and see
the destruction. A couple of men shouted at anyone who would listen,
demanding that Prime Minster Ariel Sharon "do more" and get rid of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Workers filled a mammoth dumpster with debris. The dining hall of the
hotel was in shreds. Amid the wreckage, some tables still had their white
cloths and Passover dishes ready for the meal.</TE>
<TE>   Paulette Cohen, the owner of the hotel, said she was determined to
rebuild. "They won't bend us," she said, cradling a small machine gun.</TE>
<TE>   Medical examiners worked around the clock to identify the bodies, some
so badly mangled that DNA samples would have to be used. Among those
identified were Andre and Edith Fried, a couple in their 40s who
regularly went to the Park for Seder. They were seated when the bomb
exploded; their two children, 16 and 20, were running late and were
spared. Andre's father was also killed.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Abu Kabir forensic institute south of Tel Aviv, where all
the bodies were taken, families gathered. One man, who gave his name as
Yitzhak, said his brother-in-law was killed and most of his family was
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was injured, my mother, my brother and daughter," he told
Israeli radio. "His wife and their twins and son were not hurt, but my
sister was, with her children. . . . They told me, 'Come along, it will
be fun.' " But he didn't go.</TE>
<TE>   Among others being identified: a 70-year-old woman visiting from
Sweden and a 67-year-old Holocaust survivor. The brother of the latter
woman was at Abu Kabir. He had hoped to identify his sister by her red
fingernail polish but was told that DNA samples would be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "She had been through the Holocaust and came here from Russia as a
little girl," he said. "She was raised on a kibbutz. What the Nazis
didn't do, Arafat finished."</TE>

<DL>SHATILA REFUGEE CAMP, Lebanon
</DL>
<LD>She is 54 years old and has lived her entire life in a cramped,
polluted warren of cinder-block buildings. She never had children, she
says, because of the life they would have as the offspring of a
Palestinian refugee.</LD>
<LD>   "We are the living dead here," Khadijeh Khatib said as she sat in her
one-room, unheated grocery store, lighted by a single candle, her knees
bouncing to keep warm. "There is nothing, no decent living conditions, no
security. We are living in total chaos."</LD>
<LD>   This refugee camp, the scene of a massacre two decades ago by a
Lebanese Christian militia allied with Israel, presents a serious hurdle
to anyone looking to bring peace to the region. The camp is filled with
16,000 refugees, Palestinians whose families fled into exile when the
state of Israel was created in 1948.</LD>
<TE>   Nobody wants them--not Lebanon, which for more than half a century has
denied them citizenship. And not Israel, which says the viability of its
state would be threatened by their return.</TE>
<TE>   The refugees in Shatila and neighboring Sabra camp are among about 4
million worldwide, most of them in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. The
refugees came in two great waves, the first in 1948 and the second in
1967, during the Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs have consistently said that Israel must acknowledge the
Palestinian refugees' "right of return" as part of any peace treaty. But
Israel has insisted that it cannot possibly take in millions of
Palestinians without undermining the very nature of the Jewish state and
for that reason flatly rejects the concept.</TE>
<TE>   In crafting his peace initiative, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invoked
a 1948 U.N. resolution that proposes repatriation or compensation for the
refugees. Abdullah's proposal said peace must include "achievement of a
just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem to be agreed upon in
accordance with U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194."</TE>
<TE>   In this grim refugee camp, there is a palpable sense of anger and
abandonment.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every family here has a rusted key or old yellowed document
proving ownership of a piece of property they were forced to abandon.
Everyone has a sense they are owed something.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who lost families in the 1982 massacre--after which
Israel's then-defense minister, Ariel Sharon, was forced to resign--there
is also hatred.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not just a personal matter, but one that threatens to
undermine efforts at peace.</TE>
<TE>   Nohad Srour, 37, has also lived her entire life as a refugee. Her
family fled the Hebron area of the West Bank when her mother was 5 and
her father was 7. The only home she knows is here, amid the concrete and
cinder-block rooms.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, she was home when the Lebanese Christian militia massacred at
least 700 refugees in Shatila and Sabra--including her father, four
brothers and her sister. She was shot in the shoulder but says she
survived by playing dead.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Srour sat in her damp apartment, an old color television
shoved in a corner broadcasting images of the Arab summit taking place in
Beirut's most posh hotel a few miles away. She opposes the Saudi peace
initiative endorsed at the summit. The only solution, she says, is to
continue to fight so that someday she can return.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just like an anesthetic to our people," she said of the peace
plan. "There is no solution but resistance and jihad. This is a scam. The
Arab leaders have been conspiring against our people."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Ali, got together a few years ago with other refugees
from his birth village and published a book. In it are hand-drawn maps,
tax receipts, even black-and-white pictures, anything he could come up
with to keep the memory alive for his children.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing will ever convince Ali of a key element of the Saudi proposal,
that Israel has a right to exist--at the expense, as he sees it, of his
family.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be very hard to coexist with the Israelis," he said. "Jihad
is the only solution."</TE>

<HD>Excerpts From Arab League's Statement on Regional Issues</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are excerpts from the 21-page, 50-point final statement
issued by the Arab League summit in Beirut, at which the leaders also
approved a new peace initiative with Israel. In the final statement, Arab
leaders decided, among other things, to:</LD>
<LD>   * Affirm the right of the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese people to
resist Israeli occupation and aggression. The leaders say it is necessary
to clearly differentiate between terrorism, which they condemn, and the
legitimate right of people to resist foreign occupation.</LD>
<LD>   * Donate $55 million monthly over the next six months to support
Palestinians, renewable if violence continues, plus $150 million to be
donated to two funds set up in October 2000 to support Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   * Confirm that they will continue to abstain from setting up new
relations with Israel as long as the deterioration continues. They call
on the United States to work on resuming peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   * Renew their total condemnation of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
rejection of all kinds of terrorism, readiness to contribute to every
U.N. effort in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   * Reject exploitation of the war on terrorism to threaten force
against any Arab country and singling out Iraq, saying they are keen to
protect its unity and consider such threats an aggression and
infringement to the region's security and stability.</TE>
<TE>   * Welcome Iraq's confirmation that it would respect Kuwait's
"independence, sovereignty and security" and guarantee the unity of its
land to avoid any repeat of the 1990 invasion.</TE>
<TE>   * Reaffirm past calls for lifting U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq and
for Iraq to respect U.N. resolutions.</TE>

<HD>A Look at Initiative Endorsed at Summit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is the official English text of the peace initiative endorsed
Thursday by the 22-member Arab League.</LD>
<LD>   The Council of the League of Arab States at the summit level, at its
14th ordinary session,</LD>
<LD>   * Reaffirming the resolution taken in June 1996 at the Cairo
extraordinary Arab summit that a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East is the strategic option of the Arab countries, to be achieved
in accordance with international legality, and which would require a
comparable commitment on the part of the Israeli government.</LD>
<TE>   * Having listened to the statement made by his high royal highness
Crown Prince Abdullah ibn Abdulaziz of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in
which his highness presented his initiative, calling for full Israeli
withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967, in
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, reaffirmed by
the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the land-for-peace principle, and
Israel's acceptance of an independent Palestinian state, with East
Jerusalem as its capital, in return for the establishment of normal
relations in the context of a comprehensive peace with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   * Emanating from the conviction of the Arab countries that a military
solution to the conflict will not achieve peace or provide security for
the parties, the council:</TE>
<TE>   1. Requests Israel to reconsider its policies and declare that a just
peace is its strategic option as well.</TE>
<TE>   2. Further calls upon Israel to affirm:</TE>
<TE>   a. Full Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied since
1967, including the Syrian Golan Heights to the lines of June 4, 1967, as
well as the remaining occupied Lebanese territories in the south of
Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   b. Achievement of a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem
to be agreed upon in accordance with U.N. General Assembly Resolution
194.</TE>
<TE>   c. The acceptance of the establishment of a sovereign, independent
Palestinian state on the Palestinian territories occupied since the 4th
of June, 1967, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as
its capital.</TE>
<TE>   3. Consequently, the Arab countries affirm the following:</TE>
<TE>   a. Consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ended, and enter into a peace
agreement with Israel, and provide security for all the states of the
region.</TE>
<TE>   b. Establish normal relations with Israel in the context of this
comprehensive peace.</TE>
<TE>   4. Assures the rejection of all forms of Palestinian patriation which
conflict with the special circumstances of the Arab host countries.</TE>
<TE>   5. Calls upon the government of Israel and all Israelis to accept this
initiative in order to safeguard the prospects for peace and stop the
further shedding of blood, enabling the Arab countries and Israel to live
in peace and good neighborliness and provide future generations with
security, stability and prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   6. Invites the international community and all countries and
organizations to support this initiative.</TE>
<TE>   7. Requests the chairman of the summit to form a special committee
composed of some of its concerned member states and the secretary-general
of the League of Arab States to pursue the necessary contacts to gain
support for this initiative at all levels, particularly from the United
Nations, the Security Council, the United States of America, the Russian
Federation, the Muslim states and the European Union.</TE>

<LD>   The state's congressional delegation has lobbied for more disaster aid
as critical to helping producers.</LD>

<LD>   The truck was at a store with its rear doors open and engine running,
police spokesman Rob Callahan said.</LD>
<LD>   Two people hopped in the truck and sped off, with doughnuts spilling

<HD>Surgeon General Pick Gets Mixed Reviews in Tucson</HD>
<DH>Nominee: Richard Carmona, an Arizona doctor and part-time lawman,
does not shy from controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON
</DL>
<LD>In his 17 years in this desert city, Richard Carmona, President
Bush's choice for U.S. surgeon general, has become one of Tucson's most
visible and sometimes controversial figures.</LD>
<LD>   As a doctor and SWAT team member, his swashbuckling persona has made
him a cult figure in law enforcement. But he also hasn't shied from
controversy, which may well come up during his confirmation hearings.
Carmona, for his part, is taking it one step at a time.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm brand new to this," he said Thursday after his return from
Washington. "I've never been through a process like this. It's a big
learning curve."</LD>
<TE>   And he is also demurring from opinions on health and medical subjects,
saving that for his hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still in the process," he said. "I can't address that."</TE>
<TE>   Those who admire Carmona point to his take-charge attitude as a major
plus for the new job. It was he, for instance, who assembled a task force
of mental health experts in the aftermath of Sept. 11 to deal with the
emotional needs of traumatized Tucson residents.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Carmona's history also yields controversy. He has done battle,
verbally and in court, with the medical center that hired him to revamp
its trauma unit. And three years ago he resigned as the Pima County
health director after being criticized by government officials about the
mounting debts of a community hospital he oversaw.</TE>
<TE>   His firing in 1993 also led to a career change away from trauma
surgery and into the public health field.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of other opportunities opened up that I hadn't anticipated," he
said. "The intensity of day-to-day trauma surgery is more than a
full-time job."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Carmona has stepped on some toes in the medical
community here. That would include a wrongful termination lawsuit he
filed against the Tucson Medical Center that was settled for a reported
$3.9 million in 1993. In the suit, Carmona contended he was fired for
complaining about violations of federal law and hospital policy. The case
remains under seal.</TE>
<TE>   His friend and fellow physician Terry Valenzuela said Carmona's moving
away from trauma surgery coincides roughly with the date of the lawsuit
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "What's tragic for the community and for injured persons is that he
hasn't been able to do what he does so well," said Valenzuela, who
teaches emergency medicine at the University of Arizona. "I think people
have envied him and been jealous of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have many times tried to find out why he is persona non grata,"
Valenzuela said. "But certainly it hasn't kept him from making
contributions in other ways."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela also said Carmona has not discussed the matter in years.
"He may know, but he doesn't go around telling stories," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the medical center, Jack Jewett, declined to comment
because of a confidentiality clause, but he confirmed that Carmona no
longer practices trauma medicine there.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center lawsuit was followed six years later by his
resignation from the Pima County health director's job. Carmona quit at a
time when Tucson's Kino Community Hospital was facing mounting financial
difficulties. At the time, Carmona was criticized for not keeping
officials apprised of the hospital's problems, while Carmona's defenders
say not all the difficulties can be laid at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those who look at it critically would say he did a good job,"
said Mike Rollins, former chairman of the hospital board. "The problems
existed before he entered the system."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Carmona said he had been planning to quit the health
director's post for some time and in no way felt pressured to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to the point where I didn't feel I could be as productive as I
wanted to and it was time for someone else to give it a try," he said.
"There were no hard feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Campoy, who chaired a citizens committee that oversaw the
county health-care system while Carmona was in office, said the nominee
can learn from the difficulties he faced in Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is appointed, my wish would be that he take everything he has
learned in Tucson, both good and bad, and build on those," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, meanwhile, paint Carmona as an extremely active leader in the
community, usually with a twist that combines his twin vocations of
physician and part-time deputy sheriff and SWAT team member. In Tucson,
his derring-do has put law enforcement squarely on his side.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the most decorated police officer in the country," said
Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who met Carmona in 1985. One of
those he has worked closely with is Tucson Fire Department Battalion
Chief Les Caid, who was charged with implementing the federally funded
Metropolitan Medical Response System two years ago. The system is
designed to integrate city and county services in the event of a major
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "The first person I thought about was Rich," Caid said. "He's worked
his tail off. If we added up all the time he's put in, we probably paid
him a nickel an hour over the last two years."</TE>

<HD>History, Geography at Odds In Nov. Elections</HD>
<DH>Congress: The party in the White House usually loses seats in
midterms. But critical contests are in pro-Bush strongholds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>In a potential advantage for Republicans, the states where
President Bush is strongest are emerging as the critical battlefields in
the struggle for control of Congress this fall.</LD>
<LD>   This tilt in the electoral map gives Republicans hope that they can
leverage Bush's wartime popularity to maximum advantage in the campaign.
"If the races get defined in national terms--as in, the Republican is for
the Bush agenda and the Democrat is against it--that's a huge advantage
for Republicans," Atlanta-based GOP pollster Whit Ayres said.</LD>
<LD>   The vast majority of Senate races considered most competitive are in
states Bush won in 2000--the so-called red states on the political maps
popularized on television.</LD>
<TE>   In the House, the most closely fought contests are more evenly
distributed. But analysts in both parties agree that to win that chamber,
Democrats must seize opportunities in the pro-Bush South and West created
by Republican retirements and the addition of seats through
reapportionment.</TE>
<TE>   These circumstances are escalating pressure on Democrats to find ways
to reach culturally conservative, often rural voters who summarily
rejected Al Gore in 2000. It's also forcing Democrats running in states
Bush won to argue for change without allowing Republicans the chance to
portray them as an impediment to a popular wartime president.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the president makes the case for what he is doing abroad,
you have to support [him]," said Jack Conway, a Kentucky Democrat
challenging one of the few vulnerable House Republicans from a pro-Bush
state. "But I am not the least bit scared in stepping forward and saying
that I am part of the loyal opposition on the other issues."</TE>
<TE>   As these races develop, the election is pitting history against
geography. History is behind the Democrats: Almost always, the party
holding the White House loses congressional seats in the election midway
through a new president's term.</TE>
<TE>   But the geography of the most competitive races is raising GOP hopes
they can break that precedent. "Politics is a lot like real estate: It's
location, location, location," said Mitch Bainwol, executive director of
the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</TE>
<TE>Democrats' Main Targets Are in the Red</TE>
<TE>   The three Republican incumbents that Democrats consider most
vulnerable all are running in red states: Sens. Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas, Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Wayne Allard of Colorado. So are
two of the three incumbent Democrats viewed as targets for defeat: Sens.
Jean Carnahan of Missouri and Tim Johnson of South Dakota. (The one
exception is Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, a state Gore narrowly
carried.)</TE>
<TE>   Retirements are forcing the GOP to defend four open Senate seats,
which could lead to Democratic gains. But all those seats are in Southern
states Bush won handily: North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Texas.</TE>
<TE>Uphill Battle Against Regional Tendencies</TE>
<TE>   In all, of the 20 Senate seats Republicans must defend this year, 17
are in states Bush carried (the exceptions are Maine, New Mexico and
Oregon.) Democrats are defending only 14 seats, but half of those are in
pro-Bush states.</TE>
<TE>   The trend isn't as pronounced in the House. But the largest
concentration of Democratic opportunities may be in the red states.</TE>
<TE>   GOP retirements and the creation of new seats after reapportionment
have given Democrats chances for wins in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
North Carolina and Tennessee in the South, and in Arizona, Nevada and
Colorado in the mountain West. Democrats also are aiming at GOP House
incumbents in North Carolina, West Virginia, Texas and in the Kentucky
district where Conway is challenging three-term Rep. Anne M. Northup.
Bush carried all those states.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Democrats can break through in at least some of these red-state
races, it's difficult to see how they can regain a majority in the House
or maintain their one-seat control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   And to win, Democrats have to fight the tendency of these regions to
increasingly align their votes for Congress and the presidency. When
Bush's father was elected president in 1988, Democrats held 59% of the
House seats and 55% of the Senate seats in the states he carried. Today,
in the 30 states George W. Bush won, Republicans hold two-thirds of the
Senate seats and three-fifths of the House seats.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats may have more success in the red-state House races than in
the Senate contests. That's because, almost without exception, Democrats
are targeting seats in parts of these states where Bush showed the least
strength in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But in these districts, the model for Democratic candidates isn't Gore
but Mark Warner, the Democratic venture capitalist who won the
governorship of Virginia--another Bush state--in 2001 by neutralizing
issues such as gun control and emphasizing a fiscally responsible
government activism.</TE>
<TE>   Conway, a charismatic former aide to Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton, is
following Warner's lead by assuring hunters that he "won't take your gun
away." Conway casts himself as a fiscal conservative committed to
returning the federal budget to balance while emphasizing
bread-and-butter Democratic issues such as education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   But even in this district--which Gore narrowly carried--Bush looms as
a complicating factor. Conway aides agree it will be difficult for him to
criticize Northup over the return of federal budget deficits without
urging reconsideration of Bush's tax cut, which Conway is reluctant to
do. And Northup, a fierce competitor who has survived three close races,
is certain to take every opportunity to stress her ties with Bush--who
appears much stronger in the district than he was in 2000.</TE>
<TE>Theme Emerges in GOP Strategy</TE>
<TE>   Terry Carmack, Northup's chief of staff, previewed what's ripening as
a common theme for red-state Republicans when he said: "Do we want
someone who is helping the president move his agenda along, or someone
who is being sent to Washington to . . . stand in the way of the
president?"</TE>
<TE>   Republicans may be driving that message even more aggressively in the
Senate races. Already, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has
run ads accusing five Democratic senators of blocking Bush's proposals to
stimulate the economy. The committee's Bainwol said Democrats in states
leaning toward Bush should brace for more of the same on issues such as
judicial confirmations.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be wrong to say that is all we will do, but when Democrats
separate from the president's agenda in states where the president enjoys
strong support--and fortunately that's a great many of them--that will be
part of the mix of what we want to demonstrate."</TE>

<HD>Dog Has His Day, Others Pay for Bush's Attention</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>For Pepe, the presidential handshake was free. Others paid $25,000
for the privilege. They also got a strong presidential complaint about
the Senate's refusal to support a controversial judicial nomination.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush encountered the black-and-white dog resembling a border
collie at a fire training center and the paying customers at a Republican
fund-raising luncheon, during a visit to Dallas on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   During a long Easter holiday built around what a spokesman called
"outdoor projects," the president planned no other excursions from his
1,500-acre ranch--apart from the trip aboard Marine One, the presidential
helicopter, to help Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn pick up $1.4 million for
his campaign for the U.S. Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Bush, who was accompanied by a skeleton
staff to Crawford, was relying on the State Department to monitor
developments in the Middle East. The president had no direct comment on
the offer Thursday by Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian Authority,
of a cease-fire in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But in political speeches Wednesday and again in Dallas, he offered
his most pointed response to the refusal of the Democratic-led Senate to
vote on his nomination of U.S. District Judge Charles Pickering to a seat
on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get good, conservative judges appointed to the bench and
approved by the United States Senate," he said. "I want people on the
bench who don't try to use their position to legislate from the bench. We
want people to interpret the law, not try to make law and write law."</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raiser Bush headlined Thursday was his third in two days and
the 13th he has attended in recent months, reflecting his concerted
effort to help the Republican cause in November's elections.</TE>
<TE>   Cornyn is running for the seat held by Republican Phil Gramm, who is
retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stopped for about half an hour at a firefighter training center
in the Dallas area. The White House said the visit gave him a chance to
promote his proposals to improve the nation's readiness to respond to a
terrorist attack. He made no public comments.</TE>
<TE>   But in a quick aside to reporters, he said with a smile: "Welcome to
Texas. Your day is better for it."</TE>
<TE>   And he gave Pepe the full presidential handshake treatment.</TE>
<TE>   When the president makes political appearances outside of Washington,
the White House regularly adds nonpolitical events to his schedule. Thus,
the government shares the cost of his travel with the political group he
is helping, in this case the Cornyn campaign and the state Republican
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Cornyn were filmed during the visit to the training site,
with the footage expected to be used in Cornyn campaign commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising luncheon was expected to raise the money for Cornyn
and--by charging contributors $25,000 for photos with the
president--$400,000 for the state Republican Party.</TE>

<HD>Adolescents' TV Watching Is Linked to Violent Behavior</HD>
<DH>Psychology: A 17-year study tracked 700 young people into their
adult lives. Hours of viewing were correlated with acts of aggression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adolescents who watch more than one hour of television a day are
more likely to commit aggressive and violent acts as adults, according to
a 17-year study reported today in the journal Science.</LD>
<LD>   The study, which tracked more than 700 adolescents into adulthood,
found that young people watching one to three hours of television daily
were almost four times more likely to commit violent and aggressive acts
later in life than those who watched less than an hour of TV a day.</LD>
<LD>   Girls as well as boys exhibited increased aggression, according to the
study, which was hailed by psychologists and social scientists as more
evidence of TV's harmful effects.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very important study and has a great deal of credibility--it
very niftily isolates television as a causal factor," said George
Comstock, a researcher on media violence at Syracuse University in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   It is also the first study, Comstock said, to clearly link TV viewing
among adolescents to later, adult violence.</TE>
<TE>Families Were Selected Randomly</TE>
<TE>   The study authors, from Columbia University and Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York, used data from a wider-ranging survey of the behavior
of children in 707 New York state families. The families had been
selected randomly--not because their children had any behavior problems.</TE>
<TE>   Over the study's 17 years, the children and their parents were
periodically interviewed about TV habits, violence and aggression.
Interviews began in 1983, when the children's average age was 14;
follow-up interviews were conducted at average ages of 16, 22 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists also examined state and FBI records in 2000 to find out
if any of those in the study--who by then had reached an average age of
30--had been arrested or charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The authors found that 5.7% of those who reported watching less than
one hour of TV a day as adolescents committed aggressive acts against
others in subsequent years--either by their own admission, a parent's
report or legal records. Those acts included threats, assaults, fights,
robbery and using a weapon to commit a crime.</TE>
<TE>   That figure rose to 22.5% of those who watched TV for one to three
hours a day and to 28.8% of those who watched more than three hours
daily.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the effect was surprising, said lead author Jeffrey
Johnson, assistant clinical professor of psychology in Columbia
University's psychiatry department.</TE>
<TE>   He and his coauthors, who conducted the study with federal funds,
believe the findings help cement the link between TV and violence. The
authors used statistics to rule out other possible causes, such as
neglect, poverty and living in a violent neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The study did not describe the kinds of programs children were
watching, drawing criticism from Jonathan Freedman, a professor of
psychology at the University of Toronto. He also said such studies don't
clearly demonstrate that viewing programs is the cause of subsequent
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "To suggest that because you get this effect that watching two hours a
day causes aggressiveness is going so far beyond the data it's shocking,"
Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>Critics Say Parents Can Monitor Viewing</TE>
<TE>   The Motion Picture Assn. of America declined to comment on the report
until staff members had a chance to read it. Association spokesman Rich
Taylor said parents have the technology to easily control what their
children watch.</TE>
<TE>   "The V-chip puts a new level of control into a parent's hands,
allowing them to determine and set the level of programming that they
wish to allow in their home at any given time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Six major medical groups--including the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and
the American Medical Assn.--have stated that they believe TV violence is
a significant problem.</TE>
<TE>   Fears about the negative influence of TV have been voiced almost since
1946, when TV broadcasting began in the United States. The study
published today is the latest in a string of investigations aimed at
figuring out the link.</TE>
<TE>   One study in the early 1960s shocked the public by showing that
children shown a TV program of adults beating a toy clown were more
likely to repeat the behavior. Other studies similarly showed a rise in
aggressive attitudes and behaviors after people watched violent programs.
Subjects were more likely to fight in the playground or "punish" people
with fake zaps of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have explored the relationship between violent
programming and real-life, serious violence--and have also found smaller,
although statistically significant, links.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of such viewing pale, by comparison, with the effect of
living in an abusive home or hanging out with delinquent peers.</TE>
<TE>   But TV watching is far more prevalent, said Joanne Cantor, professor
emeritus of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and a longtime media
violence researcher.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications for parents is that unfettered access to television
is not good for your child," Cantor said. "It has these negative
effects--which affect them personally in terms of feeling more hostile.
And it looks like it affects other people too--through expression of that
hostility in aggressive behavior towards others."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the study, National Assn. of Broadcasters spokesman
Dennis Wharton said, "For every study of this sort that finds a
correlation between TV violence and real life violence, there are studies
that conclude just the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Freedman, meanwhile, said that finding a correlation between TV
viewing and violence does not prove TV programs are to blame. Children
who are naturally more aggressive may be drawn to watch more violent TV,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   While this may be true, Johnson countered, this study and others show
that even-tempered children also became more aggressive after watching a
lot of television.</TE>

<HD>Pa. State Police to Start Study on Profiling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>Beginning Monday, as part of a study on racial profiling,
Pennsylvania state troopers will report the race and ethnicity of
motorists they pull over.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, 37 state agencies are collecting similar data,
said Trooper Linette Quinn, a spokeswoman for the state police.</LD>
<LD>   Troopers will have to fill out a form after any contact with a
motorist, whether or not they issue a citation. The form includes spaces
for showing whether a motorist is white, black, Latino, Native American
or Middle Eastern.</LD>
<TE>   Troopers will not ask motorists about race or ethnicity but will write
down their perception of the person's race, Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   "Out there in the public, there is a perception of racial profiling on
traffic stops. In order to prove otherwise, we want to collect the data,"
she said. "We're going to have stats to prove we don't do this as a
department."</TE>
<TE>   Within the last five years, the department has received 20 allegations
of racial profiling, all of which were found to be unjustified, Quinn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Information from the forms will go to the Population Research
Institute at Penn State University, which will draw conclusions as to
whether troopers are profiling motorists. Troopers will be anonymous and
project managers are barred from disclosing the identity of an officer.</TE>

<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>The joint task force overseeing the detention of 300 prisoners from
the Afghanistan war received a new commander Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Rick Baccus took over for Marine Brig. Gen.
Michael Lehnert, who will head back to Camp Lejeune, N.C. The change was
planned and represented no policy shift, said Maj. James Bell, mission
spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Baccus, 49, is a 28-year Army veteran who was stationed in Warwick,
R.I. Army soldiers also will replace about 125 Marines, Bell said.</LD>
<TE>   Guantanamo officials also said Thursday that 45 detainees from the war
in Afghanistan had skipped several recent meals. Three were hospitalized,
said Capt. Al Shimkus, the field hospital's top surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Those three were the same prisoners who went weeks without eating
after the first hunger strike began Feb. 27. It was unclear when they
began refusing meals again.</TE>
<TE>   The first hunger strike began after guards stripped an inmate of his
turban, but military officials said participants later claimed they were
concerned about their futures.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Thursday whether the detainees refusing food were on a
hunger strike or were fasting for the Muslim holy day of Ashura, which
commemorates the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet
Muhammad, in 680.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners are accused of having links to the fallen Taliban regime
of Afghanistan or the Al Qaeda terrorist network believed responsible for
the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>

<HD>An Art Lover Who Liked to 'Buy Nice Things and Swap'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I met Billy Wilder, nearly 13 years ago, he was brimming with
life and wicked wit, but death was on his mind. As we sat and chatted in
his second-floor office on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills, he told me that
he was planning to sell his renowned collection of modern and
contemporary art because he was confronting his own mortality.</LD>
<LD>   "The moment comes when you suddenly realize that friends who were
collectors have died, and the widow, the children and maybe a new husband
are having all this fun at an auction. I want to be alive while that
auction is going on. I want to get that kick," he said, at the age of 83.</LD>
<LD>   Then he regaled me with anecdotes about the artworks he intended to
put on the market. "My God, what a waste," he said of Fernando Botero's
painting of a plump nude woman standing in a bathtub. "Giacometti could
have made three figures with that, and there still would have been enough
left over for one small William Morris agent."</LD>
<TE>   As usual, Wilder's timing was impeccable. His collection brought a
whopping $32.6 million at Christie's New York on Nov. 13, 1989--just a
few months before the art market collapsed. He got his "kick" seated near
the front of the jampacked sale room as seven works were sold for more
than $1 million apiece and record prices were established for a dozen
artists. When the crowd dispersed, he said the dramatic event was "less
nerve-racking than a film preview," hailed a taxi and disappeared into
the Park Avenue traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But not for long. He was an inveterate collector who couldn't stifle
his interest in art any more than he could quell his passion for the kind
of "pictures" that made him famous. He started collecting
Toulouse-Lautrec posters in the late 1920s in Germany and got going in
earnest in the 1930s, after he fled to America and started putting money
aside for art purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "My good luck in all those years was that I never bought racehorses, I
never had a yacht, I never bought a Ferrari," he said. "I have no villa
in St. Tropez, I cut down on my ballooning in Bavaria and I stayed away
from junk bonds. I just buy nice things and swap."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't an easy mark, however. Recently, when his longtime friend
dealer Louis Stern tried to interest him in an early Picasso drawing,
Wilder responded, "Early, middle, late, what do I care?" Taking another
tack, Stern showed him the drawing's back side, covered with notations on
its distinguished history of ownership. Lowering his head and peering
over the rims of his glasses, Wilder said, "Look how many people didn't
want it."</TE>
<TE>   His taste in art was eclectic but veered toward piquant Expressionism,
explicit sexuality and spicy humor. This was especially clear when he
collaborated with artists who developed his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   On one memorable occasion in late 1993, he curated an exhibition at
Stern's former gallery in Beverly Hills. The show included a series of
painted sculptures that he dreamed up with artist Bruce Houston. Called
"Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete II" and executed in the
styles of famous modern and contemporary artists, the sculptures are
takeoffs on a historic bust of the Egyptian queen that Wilder admired as
a youth at the Berlin State Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Wilder's artistic taste went public again, at Christie's in
Beverly Hills in an auction of modestly priced art, furniture and
memorabilia from his collection, which brought a total of about $2
million. "I'm just closing up before checking out," he said before the
sale. But not completely. He couldn't part with a drawing of his
director's chair by David Hockney, one of his favorite artists.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Wilder's health declined and he complained bitterly about
impairments to his hearing and eyesight, he had a zest for life. He loved
lunching with friends at Mr. Chow and Matsuhisa, after a few glasses of
very good sake. When I asked him to sign copies of Cameron Crowe's book
"Conversations With Wilder" for his admirers at The Times, he seemed
surprised but pleased that relatively young people still revere his work.</TE>
<TE>   One of the last times I saw Wilder was at the Norton Simon Museum in
Pasadena. From 1979 to 1990, he served on the board of trustees of two
foundations that support the museum, but he hadn't seen the renovation of
the facility that was completed in 1999. He was nearly speechless when
Simon's widow, actress Jennifer Jones Simon, greeted him, and director of
art Sara Campbell conducted a brief tour. After he had taken it all in,
he gave the Wilder seal of approval in a single word, "Wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable lines in Wilder's films often reflect his caustic
assessment of human frailties. But the words I'll remember are those he
uttered with increasing frequency toward the end of his life: "God bless
you."</TE>
<TE>   That phrase served many purposes for Wilder, from heartfelt thanks and
good wishes to polite dismissals of strangers who showered him with
compliments. To me, Wilder's "God bless you" signified the soft side of a
prickly genius.</TE>

<HD>Experts Urge Debate on Voluntary Smallpox Inoculations</HD>
<DH>Policy: Despite the risks, some say the time may be right for mass
vaccinations to protect against bioterrorism. But others disagree.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top federal health official and several prominent medical experts
suggested Thursday that voluntary vaccinations for smallpox may be
appropriate, three decades after immunizations stopped in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, and other researchers said they want to open a
national debate on mass inoculation to prepare the nation for an
unlikely--but potentially devastating--bioterrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   The smallpox virus, which is highly contagious, was eradicated
worldwide in the 1970s, but officials are worried that vials of the virus
kept in storage in the former Soviet Union may have fallen into the hands
of Iraq or North Korea. No concrete evidence of this has been made
public.</LD>
<TE>   Restarting vaccinations, raised as a possibility in several medical
journal articles and at a news conference Thursday, runs counter to
current smallpox recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. In one of the articles, Fauci calls the desire for access to
vaccinations "reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, with only 15.4 million vaccine doses on hand, the CDC
concluded that the best way to contain a smallpox outbreak would be to
identify cases, quarantine those infected and try to vaccinate anyone
possibly exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, supply is becoming less of an issue. The government is
expected to announce today that it is acquiring an additional 70 million
to 90 million doses held by a manufacturer. In any case, the government
is on track to have enough vaccine to treat all Americans by the end of
the year, making it possible to reexamine the CDC's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that mass voluntary vaccination is not recommended
in the CDC plan," Fauci wrote in a New England Journal of Medicine
editorial released Thursday, "there are many who would like to have the
opportunity to make their own decision about smallpox vaccination."</TE>
<TE>   Without directly endorsing vaccination, Fauci said that "the strongest
argument for preemptive mass vaccination is that it would eliminate
smallpox as an agent of bioterrorism. Accordingly, it would eliminate the
disarray, confusion and panic that would most likely accompany
simultaneous attacks at multiple locations."</TE>
<TE>   He said the downside is that the approach carries serious risks that
people need to be aware of. Of every million people vaccinated, one to
two will die and hundreds more will become seriously ill, studies show.</TE>
<TE>   "In most circumstances, that would be unacceptable," said Dr. Edward
W. Campion, a senior deputy editor of the New England Journal. But "'we
now fear bioterrorism in a way [that] seven months ago was unthinkable,"
he added, cautioning that any decision would have to be made on rational,
not emotional, grounds.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how voluntary vaccinations would work, although experts
said Thursday that public health officials, hospital workers,
firefighters and police officers would probably be first in line.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, who will be
heavily involved in making the administration's decision on this issue,
said at Thursday's news conference that he still backs the CDC's
rapid-containment policy, given the current vaccine supply. But he did
not reject the idea of a change, saying more discussion is necessary
about voluntary vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly discussion going on . . . and that discussion will
continue as further doses of the vaccine [are] made available," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fauci, a close advisor to Thompson, went one step further. "Any time
you do have an open discussion, you almost by definition open the door
for reconsideration as things evolve."</TE>
<TE>   Though Fauci declined Thursday to say whether he supports voluntary
vaccination as public policy, he said at a Senate hearing in November
that he would take the risk of having his own family vaccinated, given
the choice.</TE>
<TE>   Fauci said researchers are working to develop a smallpox vaccine with
fewer side effects. If that happened, he said, the decision to use
widespread inoculation would be easy because the threat of attack could
be eliminated with few risks.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about a smallpox attack has run high in Washington since
anthrax-laden letters sent through the mail system shut down parts of
Capitol Hill last fall and turned up elsewhere too. Five people were
killed, at least 13 others sickened and tens of thousands of people were
forced to take antibiotics in an attack that remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   At a November hearing to explore U.S. vulnerability to a smallpox
attack, Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said the decision to take the smallpox
vaccine should not be left up to the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the American people what the risks are, have the vaccine
available and let them make the decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Health and Human Services officials announced research
findings that could make voluntary vaccination more feasible.</TE>
<TE>   One study released Thursday by the New England Journal found that a
15-million-dose stockpile of smallpox vaccine could be diluted fivefold
without compromising effectiveness, which would produce enough doses to
inoculate 75 million Americans. Given those results, the stockpile of an
additional 90 million doses expected to be announced today, would make it
possible to treat most Americans much sooner than expected.</TE>
<TE>   The call for mass vaccination grows out of the belief that the
government is ill-equipped to contain an outbreak once it begins. About
157 million U.S. residents have been vaccinated for smallpox, but it is
unclear how long that protection lasts. An additional 119 million
Americans were born after the program of mass vaccination was terminated
in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   In the New England Journal, several experts said that because of the
numbers of people unprotected, the CDC's strategy of "containment" is
unlikely to work in a deliberate attack. "Widespread, voluntary
vaccination before exposure will greatly reduce the number of victims, if
an attack occurs," wrote Dr. William J. Bicknell, a Boston University
professor and former director of the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health.</TE>
<TE>   The post-outbreak containment approach advocated by the CDC would
probably result in thousands of deaths before the public health system
even had a chance to respond, said Charles Pena a defense policy expert
at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank. "If
it's the government responsibility to protect against a future attack,
the best way is to take preventive measures, not responding afterwards."</TE>
<TE>   But some public health experts called voluntary vaccination a
ridiculous idea. Leaders of the global eradication campaign said high
levels of vaccination don't keep the virus at bay.</TE>
<TE>   In Bangladesh, for instance, 80% of the population was vaccinated in
1972, but the country still reported 70,000 infections. Four years later,
after health officials employed a strategy of rapid containment, the
nation had no cases even though only 78% of the population was
vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   "I say at the moment, the risk of a complication from smallpox
[vaccine] is far higher than the risk of smallpox," said Stanley Foster,
a former federal health official who headed the eradication effort in
Bangladesh.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox symptoms, including high fever, fatigue, and severe headaches
and backaches, appear about 12 to 14 days after exposure. A rash develops
on the face, arms and legs, then quickly spreads to the rest of the body.</TE>
<TE>   The virus is not contagious before symptoms appear. But once pox
develop in the mouth, the disease can be spread by coughing, shedding
scabs or talking to anyone within a few feet.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Investigates Army Secretary's Use of Jet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon's inspector general is looking into Army Secretary
Thomas E. White's use of a military plane in March on a trip to Colorado,
defense officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   During the Colorado stay, White completed a house sale in Aspen,
raising questions as to whether he used the plane for personal business.</LD>
<LD>   The inspector general, Joseph E. Schmitz, informed Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld's office that he is checking the travel portion of
White's affairs, one official said.</LD>
<TE>   A second Pentagon official who confirmed the inspector general's
investigation said it doesn't mean White did anything wrong. Both
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   White was told several days ago of the inspector general's intentions
to conduct the investigation, an Army spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He will be cooperating with the investigative committee and he
welcomes the investigation," Col. Stephanie Hoehne said.</TE>
<TE>   During a meeting with reporters Wednesday, White said he had traveled
with his wife on an Army plane to Colorado at the beginning of March. The
plane they used was a Gulfstream jet, an Army version of those used by
corporate executives, that costs between $1,200 an hour and $6,000 an
hour to fly.</TE>
<TE>   White said he was traveling outside Washington as part of the Bush
administration's "continuity of government" plan, which requires some
senior leaders to be outside the capital to ensure the government's
survival should a major terrorist attack occur.</TE>
<TE>   He said he also went to Dallas and Seattle on Army business during the
trip and Colorado was a convenient weekend stopover in between.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to be in Seattle on Monday for a meeting with Microsoft. I had
official duties in Dallas on Friday. And if you draw a straight line
between Dallas and Seattle, it probably crosses over Colorado, so that's
the way I did it," White said.</TE>
<TE>   White also has been the subject of attention in connection with his
sale of Enron Corp. stock after taking over as the Army's top civilian.</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday he would resign if the investigation into the
bankruptcy of his former employer, Enron, distracts him too much from his
military duties.</TE>
<TE>   A top Enron executive until he took over as Army secretary in May,
White denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with the company. He said he
was as surprised as the rest of the country by the energy trading
company's collapse in December and the subsequent allegations of massive
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   White said he had sold all of his interests in Enron, as required by
his Army post.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Clinic's Brochure Needn't Mention Cancer Risk, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A North Dakota judge on Thursday rejected a lawsuit aimed at
forcing the state's only abortion clinic to warn patients that
terminating a pregnancy could lead to an increased risk of breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   District Judge Michael McGuire ruled in favor of the Red River Women's
Clinic after hearing three days of clashing testimony by medical experts.
McGuire said the Fargo clinic had every right to distribute a brochure
stating that there is no established link between abortion and breast
cancer. The National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society say
evidence of such a link is inconclusive.</LD>
<LD>   Antiabortion activists had hoped the judge would classify the clinic's
brochure as false advertising. They say patients should be told, at a
minimum, that some studies do suggest an abortion-cancer link.</LD>
<TE>   But Linda Rosenthal, the lead attorney for the clinic, called those
studies "pseudo-science," and commended McGuire for rejecting what she
called an unethical "scare tactic."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs plan to appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court.
"Women have a right to know about this," attorney John Kindley said.</TE>

<HD>Yates' Lawyer Seeks Insanity Law Changes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The lawyer for convicted child killer Andrea Yates wants to change
Texas insanity law to assist other mentally ill defendants and give his
client something to live for.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be extremely difficult, but I think we can use Andrea's case
like the Hinckley case was used," attorney George Parnham said Thursday
after talking with law students at Texas Southern University about the
failure of Yates' insanity defense and his reasons for an appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Insanity statutes were stiffened by many states and by the federal
government following John W. Hinckley Jr.'s acquittal by reason of
insanity for shooting and wounding President Reagan in 1981.</LD>
<TE>   Parnham said he hopes his client's conviction will lead to changes in
Texas law so mentally ill defendants have a chance at being acquitted for
something they were compelled to do because of an illness.</TE>
<TE>   Yates, 37, was convicted this month of drowning three of her five
children. She was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, defendants must prove they didn't know their actions were
wrong at the time of the crime to prove they were insane. Jurors found
that Yates knew what she was doing was wrong, rejecting her insanity
claim.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the law did not work in this case and it does not work
in many cases," said state Rep. Garnet Coleman at the discussion. "The
way the law has been applied has nothing to do with the science and what
we know about mental illness."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who suffers from bipolar disorder, said he will work with
Parnham and mental health organizations to try to bring legislative
change.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Owmby and Kaylynn Williford, who prosecuted Yates, were out of the
office Thursday and not available to comment.</TE>

<HD>Judge Scolds Traficant for Vulgarity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>A judge reprimanded Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) on
Thursday for making a vulgar, belittling comment about prosecutors in the
congressman's corruption trial.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells ordered him to sit down and then
lectured him after Traficant referred derisively to the prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Although not a lawyer, Traficant is defending himself against charges
of taking kickbacks from staff members, accepting gifts and free labor
from businessmen for his political help and filing false tax returns.</LD>
<TE>   He could face up to 63 years in prison if convicted of all 10 counts,
though the sentence would probably be shorter because of federal
sentencing guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   He has struggled with his defense over the last week, failing to
persuade Wells to allow testimony from several of his witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he was notified by reporters on his way into court that
the judge had denied him the chance to play audiotapes in court that
include witnesses suggesting that government agents pressured them into
testifying. The congressman earlier had called the tapes "the best
evidence in my defense."</TE>
<TE>   He challenged the judge before the jury came into the courtroom,
telling her: "I am very upset. You are a prosecution witness, as far as I
am concerned. I would like to subpoena you."</TE>
<TE>   But Wells said she had filed the order Wednesday, and it was his
responsibility to read her rulings.</TE>
<TE>   After Traficant made his comment about the prosecutors, Wells called
it a "childish remark" and reviewed the rules for courtroom procedure and
decorum.</TE>
<TE>   But she stopped short of imposing any penalties on the nine-term
lawmaker. Prosecutors last week asked her to sanction Traficant for
violating rules of evidence. She had not yet ruled on that request.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant called four members of his Youngstown office to his defense
Wednesday, but the judge blocked their secondhand statements as hearsay.</TE>

<HD>INS Chastised for Action Against 2 Agents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service violated federal
whistle-blower protection laws late last year when it demoted and
penalized two U.S. Border Patrol agents who openly complained about lax
security along the Canadian border in the wake of Sept. 11, according to
two independent federal offices.</LD>
<LD>   The Border Patrol agents, based in Detroit, talked to a newspaper and
appeared on NBC-TV's "Today" show, where one of the agents said that "the
northern border is vulnerable" and "terrorists know it."</LD>
<LD>   The statements prompted INS supervisors to try to fire the agents, but
eventually they settled on reassignments, 90-day suspensions and one-year
demotions, discipline that was put on hold after the Justice Department
inspector general initiated an investigation.</LD>
<TE>   INS supervisors told the Office of Special Counsel that the INS
punished the agents--local Border Patrol union President Dan Hall and
local Vice President Robert Lindemann--for violating a media gag order.</TE>
<TE>   The special counsel office ruled that the move was retaliation and a
violation of the federal whistle-blower act. The Justice Department
inspector general agreed.</TE>
<TE>   It's the fourth time in four years that the INS has been taken to task
by the independent Office of Special Counsel for retaliating against
whistle-blowers who testified before Congress, talked to investigators or
talked to reporters. In each case, the INS reversed its disciplinary
actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing what we felt necessary to make America a safer place,"
said Hall, 41. "I took an oath to defend and protect the U.S.
Constitution, not the immigration service."</TE>
<TE>   Lindemann, 40, a former Marine who has spent his career with the
government, said the actions have been hard on their families. "To be
turned on like this, it is just devastating."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine, whose office also
investigated the Detroit case, essentially agreed that the discipline was
probably in violation of the whistle-blower act.</TE>
<TE>   "We seriously question the decision to propose discipline against Hall
and Lindemann and believe it would not be upheld," Fine wrote INS
Commissioner James Ziglar.</TE>
<TE>   "In sum, we believe the INS' proposal was unsound and that the INS
should reevaluate whether it has a basis to go forward with discipline
against the two agents," Fine wrote.</TE>
<TE>   INS spokesman Russell Bergeron declined to comment Thursday about the
special counsel and IG reports because they "address issues that are the
subject of an ongoing personnel action."</TE>

<HD>Smoking Ban for Restaurants, Workplaces OKd for Fla. Ballot</HD>

<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A proposed constitutional ban on indoor smoking at many workplaces
and restaurants can go on the November ballot, the Florida Supreme Court
ruled unanimously Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The justices rejected the contention by the restaurant and hotel
industry and tobacco companies that the ballot measure pushed by a
coalition of health groups was misleading.</LD>
<LD>   The measure states that the smoking ban would protect people's health,
an assertion opponents of the measure said was unproven.</LD>
<TE>   The amendment, which requires a simple majority of voters to be added
to the constitution, would outlaw smoking inside restaurants and enclosed
workplaces, including break rooms. Exceptions would be made for
stand-alone bars, designated guest rooms in hotels and home businesses
that don't provide child care.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies are backing a competing ballot measure that seeks to
put current laws limiting smoking areas to 35% of restaurant seating in
the constitution.</TE>

<HD>Senate Bid Puts Clinton Back in the Picture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>For weeks, Republicans hammered at Democratic Senate candidate
Erskine Bowles for avoiding links to his former boss, President Clinton.
Now those attacks will be a little harder to make.</LD>
<LD>   New TV ads airing this week show Bowles, a former White House chief of
staff, with his old boss.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-second spots tout Bowles' part in the government's response to
the April 19, 1995, bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
They include images of bloodied victims and the bombed-out shell of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, where 168 people were killed.</LD>
<TE>   Both ads include a photo of Bowles sitting across a table from Clinton
on Air Force One. A narrator says, "Within hours, the president turns to
North Carolina's Erskine Bowles to take charge of our nation's response."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier ads and campaign literature had omitted Clinton's name and
image. One even showed the candidate with Republican Sen. Trent Lott, who
was Senate majority leader at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Take all the commercials together, and it's very clear that he is
avoiding any association with Bill Clinton," state GOP spokesman Jonathan
Jordan said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said that even the latest ad never refers to Clinton by name,
and never mentions that Bowles worked directly for him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saying he's ducking Clinton," Jordan said. "I can't imagine
anyone else having a problem with saying the name of the president he
worked for."</TE>
<TE>   Bowles spokesman Brad Woodhouse said he was incredulous that the GOP
still is trying to make the charge stick.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is fully aware that Erskine worked for President Clinton,"
Woodhouse said. "They are also fully aware that no one has ever been
harder on the president, publicly or privately, for his personal
failures. He has said it was just plain wrong what the president did."</TE>
<TE>   Bowles is one of nine Democrats seeking the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by Republican Jesse Helms, who is retiring after 30 years.
Elizabeth Hanford Dole is considered the GOP front-runner.</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Heavily armed Americans were involved in a series of raids in
Pakistan that resulted in the arrest of about 40 suspected members of Al
Qaeda, Pakistani newspapers reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   One person was killed in a gun battle that broke out in Faisalabad,
about 160 miles south of the capital, Islamabad, when police raided a
house inhabited by suspected extremists. Four suspects and a police
officer were wounded in the predawn operation.</LD>
<LD>   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said more than 35
people were taken into custody in raids in Faisalabad and two other
Punjab province towns, Lahore and Multan. The sources said the raids were
continuing late Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   One senior Pakistani police official said the raids had cracked a
major Al Qaeda cell operating in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Nation and the Dawn newspapers, which both reported U.S.
involvement, said the raids were part of the investigation into a March
17 grenade attack on a Protestant church in Islamabad in which five
people were killed, including a U.S. Embassy employee and her 17-year-old
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Concern has been growing in Pakistan about Islamic extremism following
the collapse of Taliban rule in neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, about 35 uniformed and plainclothes police officers
stood guard at the hospital where the wounded suspects were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Raza, who lives near the scene of the Faisalabad raid, said
police surrounded the house and called on those inside to surrender.
Instead, the occupants began shooting, triggering a half-hour gun battle.</TE>

<HD>Horton Foote: "I Stick With It"</HD>
<DH>Theater * The playwright, 86, keeps very busy and has won a new fan
at SCR, where his 'Getting Frankie Married' world-premieres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Horton Foote achieved his first great success in the theater by
laying on the histrionics.</LD>
<LD>   That was some 70 years ago, when he was a schoolboy from Wharton,
Texas, competing in a statewide drama contest. The play, he recalls, was
about three college roommates. He was the one with the bad drug habit.</LD>
<LD>   "He needed a fix, and I remember [performing] this catastrophic
breakdown onstage," Foote recalled. "When it was all over, the judges
called my teacher over and said, 'Is that boy afflicted, or is that
acting?.' She said it was acting, so they gave me first prize."</LD>
<TE>   Somewhere along the line, Foote changed his tack. By his mid-20s he
had concluded that writing, not acting, was his true calling. And since
1940, when his first play was produced, he has secured a niche as an
admired, Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist who eschews stage histrionics
and invites audiences to absorb the subtle, detailed ebb and flow of life
in Harrison, Texas, the fictional small town modeled on Wharton where his
stories unfold.</TE>
<TE>   On March 14, Foote spent a chunk of his 86th birthday at New York
City's Lincoln Center, where his play "The Carpetbagger's Children" was
in rehearsals for its New York premiere this week. After the opening, he
was planning to take a day off, then fly to Costa Mesa in time for
tonight's first preview performance of another new play, "Getting Frankie
Married-and Afterwards," at South Coast Repertory.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the theater, and I'm always there"  when a major production is
gearing up, Foote said over the phone recently from a New York hotel
room. "I'm sure I'm a bother, but there I am. I stick with it."</TE>
<TE>   Foote is five months younger than his more famous, and similarly still
productive peer, Arthur Miller. But Foote has a four-year head start on
Miller when it comes to getting plays produced: Miller's debut didn't
come until 1944, with "The Man Who Had All the Luck." (Miller's next
play, "Resurrection Blues," opens Aug. 9 at the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapollis.)</TE>
<TE>   Foote has written more than 60 plays. He won the Pulitzer for his 1994
drama, "The Young Man From Atlanta." He won Oscars for his adaptation of
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" and his original screenplay for
"Tender Mercies." He won an Emmy for his TV adaptation of William
Faulkner's story "Old Man." In 2000, President Clinton awarded him a
National Medal of Arts.</TE>
<TE>   And now, finally, he has stuck with it long enough to see one of his
plays produced on a major Southern California stage.</TE>
<TE>Overlooked in Southland Until a New Fan Emerges</TE>
<TE>   His work has been done occasionally here in small theaters. But until
South Coast Repertory secured the world premiere of "Getting Frankie
Married," the area's leading resident companies-including the Mark Taper
Forum, Ahmanson Theatre and Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, the Globe
Theatres and La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego County and the Laguna
Playhouse, Pasadena Playhouse and South Coast itself-had been pitching a
career shutout against Foote.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Benson, the South Coast artistic director and director of
"Getting Frankie Married," acknowledges having overlooked Foote until the
playwright's agent sent the "Frankie" script about 18 months ago. Benson
went for it immediately. Now he is reading his way through the Foote
oeuvre, with an eye toward producing more of his scripts--"The Trip to
Bountiful," which was made into a movie with Geraldine Page in 1985, is a
leading candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a great admirer of his now," said Benson, who spent time in
Wharton with Foote, meeting some of the townsfolk and soaking up the
atmosphere in hopes of capturing some essence of small-town Texas onstage
in Orange County "Maybe one reason he's not produced as much as he should
be is that sometimes his plays seem simplistic on the page. You can
think, 'Oh, rural America' and that it's oversimplified and a cliche. But
when you get up to act them, they're incredibly rich, with enormous
depths. That's been my discovery with this play."</TE>
<TE>   Foote wrote "Getting Frankie Married" around 1990, the year in which
the play is set. One reason it may not have been produced until now is
that it requires a cast of 12--a huge number for a contemporary play. Its
central figures are Fred Willis, a wealthy, 43-year-old landowner, and
Frankie Lewis, the girlfriend he has been stringing along for more than
20 years. Frankie is a wife in all but name and an object of small-town
gossip. Fred makes a series of choices-motivated, he thinks, by love and
honor-that turn out horribly for him.</TE>
<TE>   Foote rates Fred as perhaps the saddest character he has ever drawn.
"That last moment is certainly very moving. to me. There's nobody there
to comfort him, and he has to struggle through it for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Although Southern California has been a tough nut for Foote to crack
in terms of productions, it was, long ago, the seedbed for his theater
career. After  winning schoolboy laurels for his acting in Texas, he
managed to get his reluctant parents" approval of his plan to skip
college and get more theatrical training. They wouldn't countenance his
going to New York--"They thought it was a wicked place"--so he headed
West and enrolled in the Pasadena Playhouse's acting conservatory. Foote
said s the event that shaped him most in Pasadena--apart from having his
Texas accent whitewashed in elocution lessons--was the touring production
of "Hedda Gabler" he attended in Los Angeles on his 18th birthday with
his visiting grandmother. Eva Le Gallienne's performance enraptured him,
and he came back to see "A Doll's House" and "The Master Builder," the
other plays the noted actress was performing in repertory.</TE>
<TE>   "It really rocked me," Foote recalled. "I'd had this sense of 'Maybe
I'll end up in the movies.' This made me go to New York to be a [stage]
actor." In New York, Foote began writing plays as well as acting in them.
"Texas Town," staged in 1941, won a rave from New York Times critic
Brooks Atkinson who loved Foote's writing but panned his acting. Writing
became his focus. Foote said he is searching these days for his next
idea, making notes and hoping inspiration will take hold. "There's
something I've been thinking about for 20 years, searching for a way to
do it," he said. He declines to elaborate because "I think it's death to
talk about something when you're working on it."</TE>
