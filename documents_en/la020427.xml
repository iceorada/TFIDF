<HD>Judge Denies Andersen Trial Delay</HD>
<DH>Courts: The accounting firm's attorney seeks a six-week
postponement, citing too much publicity and tainted jurors.
Prosecutors disagree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday refused Arthur Andersen's request that its
trial on criminal obstruction charges for shredding tons of Enron
Corp. documents be delayed six or seven weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Rusty Hardin, who insisted on a speedy trial after the
accounting firm was indicted in March, told U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon his client has been hurt by media coverage of the case
and that prospective jurors already have formed negative opinions
about the firm.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot overemphasize how unfairly we've been treated so far,
not by the court, but by the court of public opinion," Hardin said.
"We do think that to protect our client we have to have some
breathing space."</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors opposed the request, saying there was no
reason why the trial--scheduled for May 6--should be put off.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their day in court and they just don't want it,"
Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Weissman said.</TE>
<TE>   Of Hardin's publicity argument, Weissman added: "There is just no
way that can be taken as an argument or a true real reason to
postpone this trial."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin contended that lawyers have examined hundreds of
questionnaires from potential jurors and determined that one-third of
them believe Andersen is guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want another panel," he said. "I want an atmosphere
that's not a hanging atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin also cited published reports that quoted unidentified
sources close to the government's case divulging details. He accused
prosecutors of being the sources.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman denied that.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon, after listening to a discussion that lasted about 45
minutes, said the May 6 trial date remains in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Andersen will be in any different position in terms
of publicity six weeks from now, six months from now," she said.</TE>

<HD>Tourism Rebounding in California</HD>
<DH>Leisure: Thanks in part to ad campaigns urging residents to
vacation in their home state, signs of a recovery are emerging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marketing aimed at keeping California's 34 million residents close to
home after Sept. 11--along with a much-needed lift in consumer
confidence--has helped accelerate a rebound in the state's tourism
industry, which was severely hurt after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Although some cities have fared better than others, signs of
recovery are being noted throughout the state, with many tourism
officials adjusting their travel forecasts from less optimistic
predictions. In January, for example, overall summer travel in
California was expected to be down 9% from last year; the projection
has since been changed to a 5% decrease.</LD>
<LD>   But that still means the state will collect about $4 billion less
in visitor spending, which in 2001 amounted to $76 billion. Tourism
accounts for about 6% of the state's economy and employs more than 1
million workers.</LD>
<TE>   "Things were just real sad and dismal in the beginning," said Skip
Hull, director of CIC Research, which tracks tourism statistics for
several visitor bureaus in California. "No one was real hopeful about
what 2002 would bring. But you can see things changing now."</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, with foreign tourists disappearing and
domestic travelers avoiding the skies, heavily populated California
became the golden market for tourism officials in places such as
Texas. Suddenly, anyone within a 14-hour drive was a potential
customer.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to lose their share of the "drive market" to other
states, California tourism officials quickly doled out more than $12
million on a print, radio and television advertising campaign
encouraging residents to rediscover their home state.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase, called California, Find Yourself Here, featured
scenic portraits of the state and instrumental music meant to inspire
family togetherness, said Caroline Beteta, executive director of
California Tourism, the state's tourism agency.</TE>
<TE>   The second phase, called We're Californians, showcased famous
residents such as Clint Eastwood golfing at Pebble Beach and Jack
Nicholson attending a Lakers game. Both series targeted state
residents--a first for California Tourism officials, who
traditionally focus on international and out-of-state visitors and
leave in-state customers to individual tourism bureaus.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had to do something different, and we had to do it
quickly," Beteta said. "So we went straight for Californians and
tried to convince them to vacation in their own backyard."</TE>
<TE>   By January, requests for travel packets from the state's tourism
Web site jumped 100% from the same month last year, and marketing
surveys showed that Californians' awareness about traveling within
the state quadrupled, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Regional convention and visitor bureaus soon followed the state's
cue, launching drive-market campaigns of their own that offered
discounts, packages and "rediscover us" themes.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, an offer of two nights for the price of one at
some hotels is credited for adding nearly 8,000 "room nights" through
February, said Robert Barrett, marketing director of the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau. The $625,000 campaign generated more
than $1 million in hotel revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel occupancies in Los Angeles have averaged 64% this year,
which is slightly behind total U.S. occupancies, said Bruce Baltin, a
lodging industry specialist at PKF Consulting in San Francisco. But
the number continues to inch upward each month, and downtown hotels
have managed to increase average daily room rates by 11%, to $123,
from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a tough market," he said. "But recovery is underway."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, hotel occupancies are expected to increase 5%
this summer over last year--a projection that was changed from an
earlier forecast for a 2% drop, according to Smith Travel Research.</TE>
<TE>   Officials partly credit their ad campaign, Objects in Orange
County Are Closer Than You Think, for boosting drive-in business and
overall occupancy rates, along with strong attendance at the
Disneyland Resort and steady convention traffic.</TE>
<TE>   A $1-million Rediscover San Diego campaign has helped lift
occupancy rates from the estimated 70% to 75% this year, said Kerri
Kapich, marketing spokeswoman for the San Diego Convention and
Visitors Bureau. The city attracts about 33% of its overnight
visitors from Los Angeles and Orange counties and already has
launched a second phase of its campaign directly for those markets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a better position than others to weather this situation
because we are primarily a drive-to destination anyway," Kapich said.</TE>
<TE>   But cities that rely more heavily on air traffic--such as San
Francisco, where 84% of overnight visitors arrive by plane--could
benefit from retooling their marketing plans and looking farther
outward instead, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are going to drive will come anyway, especially
when you have a population base of 34 million," said Rolfe
Shellenberger, a travel consultant at Runzheimer International.
"Focus on Canada or the East Coast or the Midwest, because they're
going to come and stay for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center,
said the latest national consumer confidence index surged to 110.2 in
March after a small drop in February. The increase was the largest
monthly gain in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This can only translate into increased consumer spending, which
can only mean good things for the tourism industry," Franco said.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by results so far, state officials plan to launch a third
and final advertising phase next month. This time, however, they will
target four key markets just outside California--Portland, Ore.; Las
Vegas; Seattle; and Phoenix--in an attempt to build on the drive-in
campaign and spread their message beyond state lines for the first
time since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Some destinations simply never realize how valuable the near-in
market can be," said James Cammisa Jr., an analyst at Travel Industry
Indicators in Miami. "Targeting the drive market is the only way to
pick up the slack from the loss of foreign travelers. The strategy is
sound because it recognizes where the consumer's head is--shorter
trips, closer to home."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Despite being nibbled down to multi-month lows Friday against major
currencies, the dollar still is considered at its most overvalued
point in the 16-year history of the Economist magazine's Big Mac
Index, which measures the cost of the ubiquitous sandwich in 120
countries.</LD>
<LD>   "Overall, the dollar now looks more overvalued against the average
of the other big currencies than at any time in the life of the Big
Mac Index," the weekly wrote in its edition dated today.</LD>
<LD>   The index measures the exchange rate that leaves a McDonald's
Corp. Big Mac costing the same in the U.S. as elsewhere, also known
as purchasing-power parity, or PPP.</LD>
<TE>   The PPP for Big Macs shows that the yen still is 19% undervalued
against the dollar, while the euro is 5% undervalued against the
greenback, the magazine said.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's dollar is undervalued against the U.S. dollar by 35%,
the most among major currencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian dollar also is undervalued against the U.S. dollar,
by 15%, according to the Big Mac Index.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of a Big Mac in the U.S. is $2.49.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, the cheapest Big Mac can be found in Argentina at the
equivalent of 78 cents, largely as a result of the devaluation of the
peso from its decade-old one-to-one peg with the dollar in January.</TE>
<TE>   The most expensive Big Mac is in Switzerland at $3.81.</TE>

<HD>Report in Patent Case Hits Shares of Gemstar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN DECKER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. shares fell 16% after the
publication of a report saying its rivals didn't steal Gemstar
technology and the company misused patents to thwart competition.</LD>
<LD>   The stock fell $1.77 to $9.37 in Nasdaq trading. The shares have
lost three-quarters of their value in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena-based Gemstar, a publisher of on-screen television
program guides, had accused Pioneer Corp., Scientific-Atlanta Inc.
and EchoStar Communications Corp. of illegally importing cable-TV
boxes with guides that infringe its patents. It asked the
International Trade Commission to block the imports, and a hearing is
scheduled for June, when a final determination is expected.</LD>
<TE>   "None of the asserted claims of the patents at issue are infringed
by the accused products," Thomas Fusco, a trade commission
investigative attorney, wrote in an opinion submitted to the agency,
an autonomous body that measures the effect of trade on U.S.
companies.</TE>
<TE>   A public version of the opinion, dated Nov. 28, was posted on the
trade commission's Web site last week.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stone, an analyst at SG Cowen, called the report "very old
news" because the attorney's report was first filed in November. He
said the report doesn't include information submitted before the
commission in an evidentiary hearing. That hearing was in December,
according to the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing new here," said Lauren Snyder, a spokeswoman for
Gemstar. She said the company disagrees with Fusco's position. "We
have confidence in our case and eagerly await the judge's ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Fusco wrote that even if there were infringement, Gemstar has
"engaged in a pattern of aggressive business behavior and that at
least some of their practices rise to the level of patent misuse."
Thus, it shouldn't be allowed to enforce its patents against
competitors.</TE>

<HD>Nissan CEO Named Heir Apparent to Renault Chief</HD>
<DH>Autos: Carlos Ghosn may keep current job while taking reins
of French firm in 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, architect of a
turnaround plan that shattered centuries of Japanese business
tradition and brought the country's No. 3 car maker from insolvency
to profit in just two years, was crowned heir apparent Friday to
Renault Chief Executive Louis Schweitzer.</LD>
<LD>   It has long been anticipated that Ghosn, who joined Nissan from
Renault, would replace Schweitzer when the 59-year-old executive
retired.</LD>
<LD>   But Schweitzer made it official during the French auto maker's
annual shareholders meeting in Paris, saying that when he steps down
in 2005, Ghosn would be his replacement as chief executive.
Schweitzer would remain chairman of Renault, which acquired
controlling interest in Nissan in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   The move won't necessarily mean Ghosn will leave Nissan. In
remarks to reporters in Detroit earlier this week, Ghosn said it
would be possible to have a single chief executive preside over both
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I need to be replaced at Nissan. You could imagine a
scenario where you have one CEO for two companies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Ghosn as chief executive of the so-called Alliance, separate
chief operating officers would be responsible for daily operations at
Renault and Nissan and would report to Ghosn.</TE>
<TE>   Ghosn, who was elected to a seat on Renault's board at Friday's
annual meeting, said in Detroit that "a lot of people worry what
happens to Nissan after Ghosn, [but] 'after Ghosn' is going to take a
long time."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts greeted the news with approval, noting that Ghosn, 49,
has proved himself capable of overcoming major obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   When he took the reins at Nissan in mid-1999, he was faced with
resurrecting a company that had been losing money for nearly a decade
and was $19 billion in debt. Nissan was mired in a web of supplier
contracts based on personal relationships rather than cost and
quality. Ghosn recently disclosed that the company often paid 25%
more than other car makers for parts and components.</TE>
<TE>   He did away with the system, required suppliers to slash prices by
an average of 20% and, in a move unprecedented in Japan's
apprentice-to-retirement employment system, laid off thousands of
workers as he shuttered five unprofitable factories in Japan and
moved the work to other facilities, including some in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Ghosn made it clear that he considered Nissan's North American
operations to be crucial to the company's future. The U.S. is one of
Nissan's few consistently profitable markets.</TE>
<TE>   The company reported a $2.7-billion profit last year for its 2001
fiscal year, up from a $6.4-billion loss the previous year. Ghosn is
expected to announce an even bigger profit for fiscal 2002 on May 9.
Nissan's half-year profit, announced in November, was $1.4 billion</TE>
<TE>   A Brazilian-born Frenchman of Lebanese descent who once headed
tire maker Michelin Group's North American operations, Ghosn has
proved that globalization can work in the auto industry, said Bob
Reilly, a senior partner at J.D. Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as Ghosn's plans for Nissan started bearing fruit, the
Japanese began idolizing him.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers wrote features about the stores where he shopped for
suits, and one of the popular adult comic books, or manga, that are
ubiquitous in the island nation serialized Ghosn's life story and saw
circulation jump by 500,000 copies for each of the five issues.</TE>

<HD>Honda Posts Record Fourth Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Honda Motor Co.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 70% as it sold
more profitable models in the U.S. and gained from a weak yen.
Japan's No. 2 auto maker predicted that net income would rise by more
than 25% this year.</LD>
<LD>   Group net income for the maker of Accord mid-size cars rose to a
record 107 billion yen, or $832 million, for the three months ended
March 31, compared with $490 million a year earlier. The gain matched
analysts' forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. demand for light trucks, notably the MDX sport utility
vehicle from the company's Acura brand, was so strong in the last
year that Honda was able to avoid costly discounting that dented
rivals' results.</LD>
<TE>   The weaker yen also sharpened its competitiveness, with the auto
maker posting a jump in exports to the U.S. of almost two-thirds last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Honda is promising to do even better this year, thanks to rising
production capacity in the U.S. and the planned total revamp of the
best-selling Accord," said Naohiko Sasaki, an equities manager at
Kokusai Asset Management Co.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the fourth quarter rose to $16.3 billion, an increase of
14% from the year-earlier period. Operating profit gained 55% to $1.3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   For the fiscal year just ended, Honda's net income rose 56% to a
record 363 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, from $1.8 billion a year
earlier, the company said. Sales rose 14% to $57.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Honda predicts it will break most records for a third year, with
net income rising 27% to $3.6 billion this year. Sales are projected
to increase 10% to $63 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "An increase in operating profit this year will come from the
opening of the new Alabama plant, which will raise minivan production
and sales," said Koichi Amemiya, a Honda executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the auto maker's expected gains this year will be a
revival of demand in the U.S.--the world's biggest market and the
source of as much as 85% of Honda's profit.</TE>
<TE>   The company predicts industrywide U.S. sales of 16 million new
cars and trucks in 2002, up from a previous estimate of 15.5 million.
The extra demand is likely to translate into 15,000 extra sales for
Honda, the company said.</TE>

<HD>City of Hope Rests Its Case on Genentech</HD>
<DH>Courts: The hospital seeks $445 million in royalties for
medications that resulted from discoveries made by two of its
scientists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City of Hope National Medical Center rested its breach-of-contract
case against Genentech Inc. on Friday. The company is accused of
failing to pay $445 million in royalties on a City of Hope invention
that launched the biotechnology revolution.</LD>
<LD>   This is City of Hope's second try for a verdict. The first trial
ended with a hung jury in October.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute centers on a 26-year-old contract between the hospital
and Genentech that established a profitable collaboration.</LD>
<TE>   In 1976, Genentech agreed to fund work by City of Hope scientists
Arthur D. Riggs and Keiichi Itakura. The company also agreed to pay
the hospital royalties on products that resulted from the scientists'
work. City of Hope, in turn, agreed to give Genentech the patents on
any of their discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   No one knew what to expect from the contract at the time. However,
it led to a discovery by Riggs and Itakura that made it possible to
mass produce human proteins, such as insulin, to treat disease. Their
invention--a method of producing the proteins in bacterial
cells--remains widely used.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech obtained patents on the discovery by Riggs and Itakura,
and, since 1980, has 22 licensing deals with other drug firms. City
of Hope claims it is owed $445million in royalties on drugs produced
under the third-party licenses. Genentech says it does not owe the
hospital royalties on those sales.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech, the second-largest biotechnology company next to Amgen
Inc., has argued that City of Hope is entitled to royalties on only
two drugs produced under the patent, human insulin and human growth
hormone. The company has paid the hospital more than $285million in
royalties on those drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A favorable jury verdict for City of Hope, which could come as
soon as next week, would arrive at an opportune moment for the
Duarte-based hospital. The royalty stream under the Riggs and Itakura
patents ends in 2003, when the patents expire. The hospital would
have been in the red for fiscal 2001 without the $16 million in
royalties it received from the patents.</TE>
<TE>   However, City of Hope previously denied that the lawsuit was
financially motivated.</TE>
<TE>   During five weeks of testimony, City of Hope lawyers called
several present and former Genentech officials as hostile witnesses
in an effort to build the hospital's case.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Perkins, a legendary Silicon Valley financier, spent two
days on the stand. Perkins provided start-up funds for Genentech and
served as its first chairman. He testified that he approved the 1976
contract, but could not clearly recall discussions about its terms.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins, 70, said he did not tell City of Hope about third-party
licenses and did not instruct anyone at Genentech to do so. He denied
an implication by City of Hope attorney Morgan Chu that Genentech
intended to cheat City of Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins told Chu it was "mathematically a true statement" that
Genentech's profit would rise if the company underpaid royalties. But
when Chu asked if higher profits would boost Genentech's stock
price--and benefit Perkins personally--he responded: "You are
implying a conspiracy by the board."</TE>
<TE>   Perkins on several occasions contradicted testimony he gave in
depositions. He said he could now remember which drugs were covered
by the contract, when in his deposition he did not know. And he
recalled previously forgotten conversations about the contract with
Genentech's deceased co-founder, Robert Swanson.</TE>
<TE>   Chu repeatedly pointed out the discrepancies, causing Perkins to
blurt out at one point: "Your Honor, there is such a thing as
remembering."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Krinsky, general counsel for City of Hope, said he believed
the contradictions undermined Genentech's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But Sean Johnston, vice president for intellectual property at
Genentech, said it is not surprising that Perkins remembered new
details after seeing documents in court. Perkins' testimony, he said
"is entirely credible."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital closed its case in Los Angeles Superior Court after
testimony from City of Hope scientist Itakura. Under questioning from
City of Hope lawyers, Itakura described his role in the discovery.
Itakura told jurors that he used chemicals to make the gene for
insulin and to make a small portion of the gene for human growth
hormone. A gene is a chemical recipe that tells a cell how to make a
specific protein. At the time, in 1976, Itakura was among the few
scientists in the world adept at building genes with off-the-shelf
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by Genentech lawyer Susan Harriman,
Itakura testified that Genentech scientists had important roles in
the discovery.</TE>

<HD>VeriSign Shares Sink on Results</HD>
<DH>Internet: Stock plunges 46% to 52-week low a day after the
firm posts a net loss and lowers forecasts. 'Technology downturn
definitely caught up with us,' chief executive says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Shares of VeriSign Inc. fell more than 46% on Friday after the
Internet name registrar and provider of online trust services
reported deteriorating business conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The Mountain View, Calif.-based company said after markets closed
Thursday that domain name registrations fell far short of forecasts
in the first quarter. Other divisions also were flat.</LD>
<LD>   "The sustained technology downturn definitely caught up with us,"
Chief Executive Stratton Sclavos said.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it would lay off 10% of its work force, or 350
employees, to restructure and cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   VeriSign shares sank to a 52-week low Friday, closing down $8.35
at $9.89 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The division that handles the registrations ended the first
quarter with 12 million active domain names under management but
reported a renewal rate of only 40%.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter sales for the group were $113 million, compared with
$137 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Domain names typically are renewed every two years. In 2000,
businesses and individuals were snapping up addresses as they
prepared to reap the rewards of the "new economy."</TE>
<TE>   The results are in line with a report by research firm SnapNames
that showed more than 372,000 domain names ending in ".com," ".net"
and ".org" vanished in March as sites shut down and speculation
cooled.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen analysts downgraded their rating of VeriSign
stock Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a total debacle now," said C. Eugene Munster, a research
analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   He said the first-quarter results confirmed some investors' fears
and popped the bubble of "true believers" who had supported the
firm's business model and stock.</TE>
<TE>   VeriSign reported a first-quarter net loss of $20.9 million, or 9
cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.4billion, or $6.90, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding acquisition-related charges, the company earned
$68million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $49 million, or
23cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had predicted earnings of 20 cents a share, according to
a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. VeriSign's results matched
expectations when adjusted for taxes anticipated by analysts but not
paid by the company.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter sales were $328million, up from $213 million in the
same period last year. Analysts had expected revenue of $342million
in the first quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Sclavos said second-quarter sales would range from $320 million to
$330 million. Analysts had expected $360 million.</TE>

<HD>Economic Worries Push Stocks Lower</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow drops below 10,000 as uncertainty rises,
profit outlook disappoints. Dollar sinks; gold surges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A widespread stock sell-off Friday sent major U.S. indexes to their
worst weekly losses since September as a softening dollar,
uncertainty over the pace of economic growth and fears of inflation
rattled investors.</LD>
<LD>   The day's declines--a near-50-point slide in the Nasdaq composite
to 1,663 and a 124-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average to
9,910--left Nasdaq down 7.4% for the week and the Dow off 3.4%
despite a surprisingly strong first-quarter tally of gross domestic
product.</LD>
<LD>   A fresh spate of corporate earnings disappointments reinforced the
air of economic uncertainty on Wall Street.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar continued to weaken against the euro and
Japanese yen, while gold surged above $311 an ounce. The euro, which
has rallied from below 86 cents in the last three months, closed
Friday at 90.2 cents, up from 89.8 cents Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "When the dollar softens up like this it feeds on itself by making
U.S. investments less attractive" to foreigners, said Jay Mueller,
economist and portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management in
Milwaukee. "It reinforces the trend of foreign investors to step away
from our markets."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the weaker dollar and the shaky stock market during
the last few weeks reflect waning confidence among global investors
in the notion that the U.S. economy "is in the clear and heading for
a major expansion."</TE>
<TE>   Some nervous investors turned to a traditional sanctuary:
Near-term gold futures in New York soared to a two-year high of
$311.60 an ounce from $308.10 on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In active trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq sank 49.81 points, or
2.9%, to 1,663.89, its lowest since Oct. 18. It was the tech-heavy
index's biggest weekly drop since the week ended Sept. 21, when it
plunged 16.1% as trading resumed after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow lost 124.34 points, or 1.2%, on the day, to 9,910.72,
closing below 10,000 for the first time since Feb. 22. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 slid 1.4% to 1,076.32 and was down 4.3% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners Friday by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and 3 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The three major U.S. indexes now are in the red year-to-date. The
largest technology and telecom names have taken the brunt of the
blow: The Nasdaq 100 index, comprising the largest non-financial
stocks on Nasdaq, is down 20.7% since year end.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dollar remains historically strong against other
currencies, it remains highly valued based on underlying U.S.
economic fundamentals, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells
Fargo in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   That raises the risk of further declines, which in turn could fuel
"a cycle of higher inflation and interest rates--two things the stock
market doesn't like," Sohn said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Hondas and Toyotas become more expensive because of the
currency translation, then General Motors and Ford can raise their
prices," Sohn said. If the Federal Reserve sees such inflationary
signs, it is likely to raise interest rates starting in the summer,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most economists expect higher interest rates by year-end,
Mueller said he considers corporate earnings, rather than inflation,
the key issue for the stock market. The consumer price index and
other inflation indicators remain "well behaved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product
grew at an annualized real rate of 5.8% in the first quarter, the
best showing since the fourth quarter of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But profit warnings from the likes of General Mills and JDS
Uniphase raised new questions about whether the economic rebound will
translate into the earnings recovery that the powerful post-Sept. 11
stock rally had signaled.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in the University of Michigan's monthly consumer confidence
index also muted enthusiasm over the GDP data.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the economy is likely to recover more mildly, perhaps
in the 3%-to-4% range, over the next three quarters. "This looks like
a 'Goldilocks' recovery--not too hot and not too cold. The problem
is, the stock market wants it to be hotter."</TE>
<TE>   Sohn said he expects GDP growth of about 3% over the next three
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't much pent-up demand among consumers," he said, noting
that sectors such as housing never ran out of steam. In addition, the
possibility of another spike in oil prices stemming from the Mideast
crisis could thwart any recovery, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two years, the widening trade gap could become a
bigger drag on the U.S. economy, Sohn said. The current account
balance, the closest thing to a measure of the nation's cash flow,
now runs about $1.3 billion a day in the red, and by 2003 it could be
$1.6billion a day, he said: "That's a lot of negative cash flow."</TE>
<TE>   The current-account balance essentially measures U.S. dependence
on foreign capital. "The question is whether [foreigners] might
become reluctant to invest, and even pull money out, because of
rising interest rates and the weakening dollar," Sohn said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Treasury bond market isn't showing signs of heavy
foreign withdrawal: Demand for bonds rose this week as stocks fell.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note dropped to 5.05% Friday
from 5.09% Thursday, and now is the lowest since March 6.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * General Mills lost $2.37 to $42.93 after trimming profit
estimates for this year and next, citing problems integrating its
Pillsbury acquisition and a dearth of new products.</TE>
<TE>   * JDS Uniphase fell 50 cents to $4.53 after the maker of
fiber-optic equipment reported a wider-than-expected loss last
quarter and said sales remain sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the tech sector, Microsoft dropped $2.23 to $51.50,
weighing on the major indexes; VeriSign plunged $8.35 to $9.89 after
cutting second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts; and Intel
slipped 97 cents to $28.12.</TE>
<TE>   * Walt Disney fell 90 cents to $24.10 after UBS Warburg downgraded
the shares to "hold" from "buy," citing weak ratings for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   * Goldman Sachs rose $1.94 to $79.15 after Merrill Lynch
recommended the shares, saying the company's customer base of
institutions rather than individuals may shield it from
conflict-of-interest lawsuits over analysts' conduct.</TE>
<TE>   * Dynegy dived $4.31 to $14.90. Moody's Investors Service put the
firm on review for possible credit downgrade, citing accounting
concerns.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch CEO Apologizes for E-Mails</HD>
<DH>Brokerage: The company addresses accusations of misleading
investors in research reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PLAINSBORO, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The chief executive of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. apologized to shareholders
Friday over a series of analyst e-mails that privately disparaged
companies they publicly touted.</LD>
<LD>   "The e-mails that have come to light are very distressing and
disappointing to us," CEO David Komansky said at the brokerage's
annual meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "They fall far short of our professional standards, and some are
inconsistent with our policies. I want to take this opportunity to
publicly apologize to our clients, our shareholders and our
employees."</LD>
<TE>   New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer is using the e-mails to
allege that Merrill, the No. 1 U.S. brokerage, misled investors in
research reports on companies.</TE>
<TE>   In a court filing April 8 after a 10-month probe, Spitzer alleged
that Merrill's Internet analysts recommended some stocks in 2000 and
2001 merely to help generate lucrative investment banking business
for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the company for taking this important first step in
recognizing there is a problem," a spokeswoman for Spitzer's office
said after Komansky's apology. "Contrition has always been one of the
critical first aspects to resolve this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill remains in negotiations with Spitzer over the probe and
possible penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Komansky also said Merrill would adopt some new research policies
but did not disclose what they might be. Merrill's analyst
compensation policy probably will not change, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never compensated our analysts for any particular
[investment banking] deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would
launch a formal inquiry of Wall Street analysts' practices, prodded
in part by the Spitzer investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill shares inched up 88 cents to $43.38 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Lockheed Aims to Kill TRW Deal</HD>
<DH>Defense: In latest twist, the No. 1 contractor has begun to
lobby the U.S. to deny Northrop's bid on antitrust grounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp., the nation's largest defense contractor, has
begun to lobby Pentagon and Justice Department officials to kill the
proposed merger of Northrop Grumman Corp. and TRW Inc., arguing that
it would be anti- competitive.</LD>
<LD>   In an unexpected twist to Northrop's hostile $6.7-billion bid for
TRW, Lockheed executives have suggested that the deal could turn
their company into a two-bit player in the lucrative military
satellite market. Boeing Co. currently leads that business, followed
closely by Lockheed; TRW ranks a distant third in annual sales.</LD>
<LD>   "We want it stopped," a Lockheed executive said, asking not to be
named.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Lockheed source said the company had no interest in
making a rival bid for TRW and had not signed a confidentiality
agreement with TRW to gain access to its financial records.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's stock has been trading above Northrop's offer of $53 a share
on speculation that Lockheed would enter its own bid; TRW closed
Friday at $54.50, down 33 cents for the day, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   TRW said Friday that it had signed confidentiality agreements with
several "interested parties" but did not identify them.
Representatives of both TRW and Lockheed declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the situation said Honeywell International Inc.
has been reviewing the possibility of acquiring TRW's aircraft parts
business, one of three major operating units the company plans to
spin off.</TE>
<TE>   In rebuffing Northrop's offer, TRW directors have said they want
to break up the company, disposing of its aeronautical systems and
automotive parts businesses. The company would then focus on its core
defense and space operations.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed's antitrust complaints could add another obstacle to
Northrop's bid. Facing resistance from TRW directors, Century
City-based Northrop has been appealing directly to TRW shareholders,
hoping to persuade them to accept a sweetened offer of $53 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed's $5.6 billion in annual military space revenue ranks it
second in the industry behind Boeing, at $8 billion. TRW ranks third,
with about $2 billion. (The revenue figures may not include all
classified programs.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Boeing and TRW, which make spacecraft and components,
Lockheed is a system integrator. It relies heavily on suppliers such
as TRW and Northrop for communication and sensor systems that go into
satellites.</TE>
<TE>   If Northrop acquired TRW's space business, headquartered in
Redondo Beach, it would become both a prime contractor and a supplier
and thus would be reluctant to pass along key technology to
competitors, Lockheed has argued.</TE>
<TE>   "It would diminish our role," the Lockheed executive said. "We
wouldn't be competitive anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives dismiss suggestions that acquiring TRW would
dramatically change the landscape in the military satellite industry,
arguing that the combination would enhance competition by
strengthening TRW's position.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, I would argue that our acquisition of TRW would
actually provide three space houses with more equal footing," said Al
Myers, Northrop's treasurer and chief of mergers and acquisitions.
"Northrop's expertise in weapons systems would complement TRW's
capabilities and would place it on a more competitive posture with
the two big players."</TE>
<TE>   Antitrust officials initially underplayed Lockheed's concerns, but
in recent weeks an intense debate has broken out within the agencies
over the merits of its arguments, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department last week expanded its probe by making a
second request for information from Northrop and its competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't [serious] when they started, but it may be now," a
source close to the debate said. "This is a survival question for
Lockheed."</TE>
<TE>   A Lockheed spokesman declined to comment. But in an interview
Thursday before the company's annual meeting in San Diego, Chairman
Vance Coffman said the company has been responding to requests for
information.</TE>
<TE>   "We shared those thoughts with the Pentagon," he said. "We are
fully capable of understanding what this combination of TRW and
Northrop Grumman would bring to the table."</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon spokesman said the department was reviewing the
possible merger and added that "during the course of these types of
review we reach out to those who may have information for us." He
declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   If Lockheed were successful in scuttling the TRW-Northrop deal, it
would represent another twist to the defense industry's consolidation
wave.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Northrop won a bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc., becoming the world's largest military shipbuilder after it
successfully protested a rival's bid on antitrust concerns. The
rival, General Dynamics, dropped its proposal to merge with Newport
News after the Pentagon and the Justice Department agreed with
Northrop that such a combination would create a monopoly in nuclear
shipbuilding.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Northrop's quest to merge with Lockheed was killed after
Pentagon and Justice Department officials agreed with Raytheon Co.
and other companies that the deal would stifle innovation.</TE>

<HD>Overture Shares Surge on News of Deal With Yahoo</HD>
<DH>Technology: The pay-for-performance search engine wins a
three-year extension of contract with Net portal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Overture Services Inc. rose nearly 32% on Friday, the day
after the Pasadena company said Yahoo Inc. extended its contract to
use Overture's Internet search results by three years.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's announcement came as a surprise because Yahoo, which
had until this summer to renew the contract, had stated publicly that
it was interested in creating its own pay-for-performance search
engine. Terms of the Yahoo deal weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Overture, formerly known as GoTo, provides pay-for-performance
searches on portal sites such as Yahoo, Microsoft Corp's MSN and AOL Time
Warner Inc.'s America Online.  Advertisers bid for placement in the search
listings, which usually appear as "sponsored sites," and pay Overture when
someone clicks on their link.</LD>
<TE>   "This agreement demonstrates that we've got a business model
that's proven," said John Gentry, senior vice president and general
manager of Overture's affiliate business group. "We are the leader in
the space."</TE>
<TE>   Overture shares leaped $8.14 to $33.77 in Nasdaq trading Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The company's pay-for-performance search is one of the few
profitable online advertising services, and other firms have been
eager to take away some of its market share. Rival search engine
Google Inc. began offering a similar service this year and won a
contract with EarthLink Inc. in February.</TE>
<TE>   But Overture's latest agreement should help the company secure
more long-term agreements with the major portals, said Safa Rashtchy,
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Overture is in talks with AOL over a new contract. The company
Wednesday extended its present agreement, which was to expire this
week, until May 1 to continue discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "Overture is still a very young company, but they have become a
major force in online advertising," Rashtchy said.</TE>
<TE>   Overture generated 587 million paid clicks during the first
quarter, compared with 442 million paid clicks during the fourth
quarter of 2001. The search engine's 60,000 advertisers--the largest
base of advertisers on the Internet, Rashtchy said--spent an average
of $2,540 during the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Overture posted a first-quarter profit of $29.2
million, or 48 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $6.7 million,
or 13 cents, a year earlier. Revenue nearly tripled, rising to $142.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   For the second quarter, the company projects a net income of
$16million, or 27cents a share, on revenue of $133million. Overture
reported a net loss of $2.9 million, or 6 cents a share, on revenue
of $62.5million a year earlier.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese consumer and industrial electronics giant Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. posted a loss of $3.4 billion for the last
fiscal year--its biggest annual loss--hurt by restructuring costs and
a global slump that battered sales.</LD>
<LD>   The company behind the Panasonic and National brands said its
group net loss totaled $3.4 billion for the year ended March 31 on a
10.5% drop in sales to $53.7billion.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was the largest since the company's founding more than 80
years ago and reflects Matsu- shita's problems in dealing with the
global technology slump as well as weak marketing of its best-known
brands.</LD>
<TE>   In New York, Matsushita shares closed down 13 cents to $13.42 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>News Corp.'s Fox Entertainment Group said it is pulling out of its
planned movies-on-demand joint venture, Movies.com, with Walt Disney
Co. after deciding the venture was not "appropriate" for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   Fox said that "after considering the potential regulatory process
and logistical issues and carefully examining technological and
marketplace developments, it had determined that the joint venture
was not an appropriate initiative at this time."</LD>
<LD>   Disney did not say whether it planned to go forward with
development of the service, which was intended to provide movies and
other entertainment to U.S. consumers via the Internet and cable
television lines.</LD>
<TE>   The two firms said they have "chosen to pursue alternative
strategies to distribute their films to the growing broadband
audience."</TE>
<TE>   Disney said it will continue to own and operate the existing
Movies.com Web site, a movie information service offering movie
reviews, trailers, listings and other content for movie fans.</TE>

cases of hypospadia, a malformation of the penis, among children
whose mothers took Claritin while pregnant. European authorities
announced Thursday they had launched a safety investigation at
Sweden's request.</LD>
<LD>   The defect can be corrected through surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Maryanne Mann, an official with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, said the agency was not aware of any reports of the
condition in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough said both Claritin and its newer drug, Clarinex, a
derivative of Claritin, are safe.</TE>
<TE>   Mann said agency officials were reviewing previous animal studies
of Claritin to try to determine whether it could be linked to the
birth defects. Officials also are reviewing information from birth
registries in the United States.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Sees Signs of Voting Fraud</HD>
<DH>Media: The company suspects system was hacked into. It will
call a new shareholder meeting as early as June.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>In a stunning development, Vivendi Universal disclosed Friday night
that it had discovered what appeared to be sabotage to the electronic
voting system used at its tumultuous annual meeting Wednesday--a
development that could reverse some controversial shareholder votes.</LD>
<LD>   Among the resolutions that could be reversed: a motion to
authorize the dismissal of former Canal Plus Group Chairman Pierre
Lescure, whose supporters staged protests and booed and heckled
Chairman Jean-Marie Messier throughout the four-hour meeting.</LD>
<LD>   The strange turn of events is forcing the company to call another
annual meeting and potentially face another angry crowd of
shareholders and more vocal protests from workers.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi said it suspected someone had hacked into the computerized
voting system.</TE>
<TE>   "Checks of the votes made electronically during the April 24
[meeting] indicate a systematic malfunction of the voting machines of
the main shareholders," Vivendi said. "This malfunction very likely
stems from a hacking into the system."</TE>
<TE>   The company said it did not have a suspect yet, but it had
contacted law enforcement agencies. Vivendi said it planned to file a
legal complaint with the French state court, a move necessary before
calling a new meeting, possibly as early as June.</TE>
<TE>   The irregularities affect all 18 of the shareholder resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution on Lescure's ouster won support in a 55%-to-45%
vote, which was unusually close for such a management proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders, steamed over the 40% slide in Vivendi's share price
this year, protested by voting down the management stock option plan,
as well as a second proposal that would have allowed the company to
raise new capital without giving shareholders first rights to
purchase new shares.</TE>
<TE>   Messier, having just emerged from a two-week period that brought
management upheaval to Canal Plus, almost certainly isn't eager to
face another crowd of hostile shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The recounts, though, could work in his favor if large investors
support the stock option plan, which would let the board grant
options on as much as 5% of Vivendi shares to management.</TE>
<TE>   Employees grew suspicious of the vote tallies because the
percentage of people voting to abstain on most of the resolutions was
high, 19% to 20%, compared with the 3%-to-4% range that was typical
in previous meetings, a source familiar with the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi identified the problem after contacting leading
shareholders--including Saint-Gobain, which owns 1% of the
shares--which said their votes had been incorrectly counted as
abstaining, according to the source.</TE>
<TE>   A Vivendi spokesman reached Friday night said he could not recall
a similar incident at previous shareholder meetings and declined to
discuss further details.</TE>

<HD>Mould Still Rocks, but Band-Less Show Lacks Some Intensity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The past and future are often in balance or conflict in pop music,
and no less so for your typical indie rock pioneer. Bob Mould has
chosen the future for now, melding the emotional spasms of hard rock
he first created as leader of Husker Du with a surprising, and risky,
layer of electronics.</LD>
<LD>   That is the sound of his newest album, "Modulate," and it often
works, mingling delicate computerized melody with sudden eruptions of
noise and pain. (One highlight is "Semper Fi," which cleverly uses
tape noise and chatter as sole musical accompaniment.)</LD>
<LD>   But Mould's concert at the El Rey Theatre on Thursday only dabbled
in this new electronic obsession.</LD>
<TE>   Most of his 90-minute set rocked typically hard and naturally,
accompanied only by his guitar and prerecorded tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't an ideal setting for any rocker, especially when
playing to a seated audience. Some intensity inevitably gets lost.
And yet Mould's sound hasn't changed so much since his days with
Husker Du and Sugar, finding rich melody within roaring guitar riffs,
and singing such inward-looking sentiments as, "down again, seems
like I might not be the only one."</TE>
<TE>   Mould has clearly matured as a songwriter and performer. That was
made clear during "Makes No Sense at All," a Husker Du modern rock
hit, which sounded surprisingly thin in the context of such recent
solo work as the pained "Lost Zoloft."</TE>
<TE>   Mould stood on stage almost unrecognizably trim, but still dressed
the same, in casual jeans and a T-shirt. With two video screens
behind him, constantly flashing scenes timed specifically to his
songs, Mould was all emotion and edginess, his electric guitar
occasionally set against a disco beat.</TE>
<TE>   The music was aggressively tuneful, with lyrics that were
typically evocative and yearning for understanding. It all sounded
full-bodied and convincing, but some songs simply cried out for a
full band, some musical and visual collaboration and tension, to make
the live experience feel whole.</TE>

<DH>What made 'The Bachelor' such a guilty pleasure? For the
series' exhibitionist contestants and voyeuristic viewers, it was a
match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, excuse me for coming late to the party, but it took "The
Bachelor" to seduce me. Until Alex Michel, the highly eligible, soul
mate-shopper of ABC's hit "reality" show came along, I was a
confirmed hater of the unscripted programs that surfaced on
television a few seasons ago.</LD>
<LD>   Without ever having seen "Survivor," I decided it was stupid,
contrived and boring. When "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" was on at
the gym, I'd leave the room. I feared that those relentlessly hyped
phenomena and their sorry offspring would elbow out the unreal series
I enjoy: well-crafted fare like "The West Wing" and "Six Feet Under."</LD>
<LD>   I wish I could say I would have spent this spring's Monday
evenings rereading the complete works of Virginia Woolf if I hadn't
been flattened by a nasty bout of pneumonia. But, if truth be told, I
didn't tune into "The Bachelor" just because I was weak and feverish.
About halfway through its six-week run, in which 31-year-old Michel
fishes for Mrs. Right in a pool of 25 carefully selected women, I
began hearing murmurs from smart, sophisticated, highly evolved
female friends. "I know it's sexist and ridiculous, but I'm addicted
to 'The Bachelor,'" they confessed.</LD>
<TE>   So I watched Episode 4. Ensconced in a Malibu mansion that is to
the new millennium what the "Dynasty" homestead was to the '80s,
Michel had winnowed the group down to a quartet of beauties. In a
hometown-hopping hour, he met each of their families. Then, in the
show's final minutes, one of the hopefuls was eliminated. Oh, my God,
I thought. This is stupid, contrived and often slow enough to be
boring. I was addicted too.</TE>
<TE>   The scholarly component of my fascination stemmed from analyzing
how cleverly a drama was constructed from the basic one-man, 25-women
premise. "The Bachelor" (and for all I know, its unscripted
predecessors) is a triumph of clever editing. The most romantic,
amusing or titillating moments from hours of undoubtedly tedious
encounters are shown. I write nonfiction for a living. Why wouldn't I
be transfixed by the show's skill at spinning a compelling narrative
from the dross of life? Part of the fun is busting the essential
manipulativeness of the format.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Michel has a wonderful time with Trista's family in
St. Louis. They're warm and welcoming. Talk flows, laughs come
easily. When he meets Shannon's parents in Dallas, the atmosphere is
so chilly it's a wonder he didn't put on a parka. Were the good times
in Texas edited out? Were the conversational dead ends in Missouri
trashed? Call me cynical, but I think so.</TE>
<TE>   In a "reality" show, reality is plastic. The players' appeal,
their vulnerability and even wit can be adjusted as deliberately as a
TV set's volume control. Michel would have been insufferable if he'd
been too perfect. Thus the decision to show him losing his lunch, as
he and Trista hover above Hawaii in a helicopter, only made him more
endearing.</TE>
<TE>   Enough intellectual rationalization. There's much more to a
"Bachelor" fixation than a desire to bust the show for being faux.
Millions of women, and some men, have become obsessed with the
program, whose audience and media presence steadily grew. As Diane
Sawyer said on "Good Morning America" after admitting she'd fallen
under "The Bachelor's" spell, "It's a strange thing we're all doing
when we watch, but we are watching." Inquiring minds wonder why.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone's a voyeur.  With the exception of Monica Lewinsky and
her married boyfriend, we don't usually become privy to what goes on
between men and women behind closed doors. But we are curious. "The
Bachelor" is part of a genre that finds sport in the brutality of
modern courtship. It's less cheesy than "Blind Date," "Shipmates,"
"Temptation Island" or "Change of Heart." Michel is a poised,
personable management consultant with an MBA from Stanford. The
show's bevy of bachelorettes is uncommonly telegenic, outgoing and
seems to have triple-digit IQs. "The Bachelor" lets us see the sort
of genetically blessed population you'd think would be immune to the
more barbaric aspects of singlehood being humiliated. There's a
certain wicked comfort in knowing no one is safe from the dating
jungle's hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Shallow is good. We come to know the characters we care about in
dramatic series over time. We know their back stories and
idiosyncrasies. If "The Bachelor" moved at a more leisurely pace, it
would have more depth. Yet its effectiveness is in direct proportion
to its shallowness. Its cast is reduced to archetypes. Michel is the
catch, choosing among the good girl, the ditz, the hottie, the
mystery woman and the neurotic handful. By skimming the surface, the
show lets the audience fill in its many blanks, sparking the sort of
debate that fueled its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Pass the popcorn. Let us not underestimate the howl factor. It's
so easy to mock Michel and the girls for their verbal tics, hairstyle
goofs or awkward giggles. Nothing like sitting in front of the TV
feeling superior to cap off a hard day.</TE>
<TE>   Take this cringe-inducing exchange: As they ride home from a date
in one of the show's ubiquitous stretch limos, Michel asks Kim, a
nanny from Arizona, what she likes to do in her free time. She tells
him she finds turning the pages of magazines relaxing, but she
doesn't really "read fiction/nonfiction." The very thought that a guy
who majored in history and literature at Harvard might stroll into
the sunset with a gal who confines her reading to Us magazine and
self-help tomes makes you screech at the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Women have organized "The Bachelor"-watching parties, because the
urge to nudge a friend while cackling is often irresistible. Most of
the time, everyone involved seems in on the joke. On a pre-show
broadcast just before Thursday's finale, it was evident that the
producers and most of the participants have a sense of humor about
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Champagne wishes and caviar dreams. Perhaps "The Bachelor" hooked
me when "Survivor" and "The Mole" didn't because romance is more
entertaining than power struggles. The show has put Michel and his
inamoratas into soft-focus fantasies sure to warm the heart of every
woman who believed the glass slippers didn't give Cinderella
blisters.</TE>
<TE>   At every turn, Michel and the woman he's with are pampered. The
dazzling settings they find themselves in obscure the fact that
nothing that might pass for interesting conversation ever occurs. In
the snippets we see, the dates have all the charm of job interviews,
as Michel grills the women about everything from the authenticity of
their body parts to whether they expect relationships to follow a
preordained sexual timetable. Michel may sound platitudinous when he
tells each woman she's "awesome," but style trumps content. It can be
hard to quibble with such a pretty fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat Steps 1 through 4. There's a notion currently rampant in
the culture that the right way to find a mate can be diagramed the
way Popular Mechanics teaches you how to install a carburetor. Some
women are looking for tips, as if whatever wiles "The Bachelor"
winner used could be practiced at home. For them, "The Bachelor" is
the "Name That Tune" of relationship shows--"I can get that man to
propose in six dates!"</TE>
<TE>   If the mysteries of attraction could be reduced to a strategy,
everyone would follow it. If there were a love potion, everyone would
drink it. Just because Michel ultimately chose the bustiest, most
blandly agreeable and sexually adventurous woman who, he said, "made
him feel good," doesn't mean there aren't terrific single men looking
for flat-chested, high-maintenance brunets who'll make them
miserable. Just don't tell that to the faithful who think the show is
a dating manual.</TE>
<TE>   The big complaint about "The Bachelor" has been that it's
demeaning to women. ABC, already casting for a sequel, may try to
eviscerate that charge by letting one bachelorette choose from 25 men
in a future edition. The really bold move would be to have a
geriatric version, or even a middle-aged one. That would never fly,
because the show is about people who look good in a mud bath looking
for a partner. And it is very much about almost regular folks who
want, more than anything, to be on TV. Women can't imagine why Michel
would have to wife-hunt so publicly. Men don't understand why the
women would risk getting their hearts broken in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the show is as much about the quest for fame as the
search for love. As they've been doing the rounds on talk shows, the
women who were dumped admitted that falling in love would have been
nice. But being on TV was cool enough. "The Bachelor" isn't the story
of the perfect union of Alex and Amanda Marsh. Between commercials
for diamond rings and herpes medications, it celebrates the wedding
of a voyeuristic audience and a group of exuberantly exhibitionist
players--a match made in TV heaven.</TE>

<LD>The finale of "The Bachelor" provided ABC some good ratings news for
a change, as the dating program steadily built over its two hours
Thursday to help the network score a competitive finish in the
opening night of the TV season's final rating sweeps.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at just 9.6 million viewers opposite "Friends" (viewed by
an estimated 22.2 million people), "The Bachelor" built to 19.5
million in its final half-hour--second only to CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation"--as bachelor Alex Michel revealed which woman he had
chosen.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the concluding hour averaged 18.2 million viewers.
Notably, an estimated 10.2% of women age 18 to 49 watched the
program, compared with 4.4% of men in that demographic, based on a
breakdown of Nielsen Media Research data. The percentage was even
slightly higher among women age 18 to 34.</LD>

<HD>Conductor Conlon Makes a Welcome Return</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a long absence from Los Angeles, the American conductor James
Conlon returned this week for four performances with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. He conducted the orchestra during three consecutive
summers, 1978-80, at the Hollywood Bowl, but he had not appeared at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion until Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   His Russian program on this occasion revealed what his
European-made reputation has long promised: a masterly conductor of
mature sensibilities--the New York-born musician is now
52--accomplished craft and deep, communicative skills. The orchestra
gave Conlon all the respect he deserved.</LD>
<LD>   The Prelude and Finale to Mussorgsky's opera, "Khovanshchina," in
the Shostakovich orchestration, introduced the conductor's penchant
for revealing telling contrasts and arching phrases, as well as the
niceties of uncovered inner voices.</LD>
<TE>   The program's conclusion was Conlon's own arrangement--in dramatic
order--of a suite from Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," the
work Conlon has called "the most important Russian opera of the 20th
century."</TE>
<TE>   This kaleidoscopic orchestral performance lived up to the
rhetoric; it was multicolored, violent, compellingly dramatic,
brilliant and seductive. The orchestra played up to its best powers,
screeching climaxes were matched by ethereal lyricism, and solo lines
supported the dramatic narrative.</TE>
<TE>   The soloist of the evening, Sarah Chang, played Tchaikovsky's
Violin Concerto with the virtuosic flair and solid technique previous
visits have made us come to expect from her. Still, the tone she
makes is not invariably handsome--her sounds in the heart of the
piece, the Canzonetta, seemed perfunctory. And she shows some
distracting mannerisms--kicking the floor, bending her knees, in her
tight, glittery gown.</TE>

<HD>Ashanti Is Low-Price Leader</HD>
<DH>Sales of the singer's album are helped by a $2 rebate to
retailers from her label. Such incentives boost other artists as
well.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few short weeks ago, CDs were gathering dust in the nation's record
stores, where sales of new albums were down 10% from a year ago. Then
along came Ashanti, a 21-year-old R&amp;B singer who was a virtual
unknown until late last year.</LD>
<LD>   In its first week of release, her self-titled debut album sold
502,000 copies, the year's second-highest first-week total, behind
the 527,000 copies of Celine Dion's "A New Day Has Come." After three
weeks, Ashanti's album has sold 940,000 copies and is still No. 1 on
the charts.</LD>
<LD>   "I expected it to be huge, but it was bigger than expected," says
Violet Brown, director of urban music for the Wherehouse retail
chain. "There was a lot of noise on that record. Everybody was asking
about it."</LD>
<TE>   The success reaffirms the importance of radio in selling records:
Ashanti preceded the album with her own hit single and guest
appearances on two others. But it also demonstrates how labels are
looking for ways to revive their comatose business.</TE>
<TE>   A key strategy in the Ashanti splash was a rebate of $2 per album
offered to retailers by her label, Murder Inc./Island Def Jam
Records. That allowed stores to sell the album at a price lower than
the average of nearly $15 for its first two weeks in stores.
Wherehouse, for instance, listed it at $11.99. The idea was to
sacrifice some income for the sake of momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "For the consumers that have been waiting for the project to come
out, I just wanted to give it to them for a nice price," says Irv
Gotti, president of Murder Inc. "All the ones that get it first, they
set the trends. It's their word of mouth. When you've got a strong
album, I want as many people to buy it so I can get a good word of
mouth goin'. Next thing you know, everybody's talkin', 'Yo, that
album's hot.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Ashanti figure might have stirred things up industrywide.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since that happened, a lot of labels now are looking at it,"
Brown says of the low-price incentive. "They're just being a little
bit creative in the way they're doing it. Some are rebates and some
are deeper discounts on the opening orders....</TE>
<TE>   "The Naughty by Nature that's coming is gonna have a good price.
The P. Diddy remix album. They're doing something interesting with
the new Eminem album. It's a $19.98 and it has a DVD in it. That
should really help too as far as bootlegging goes."</TE>
<TE>   Other artists whose early sales may have been spurred by low sale
prices include John Mayer, Josh Groban, Tweet and Norah Jones, who
benefit from "developing artist" pricing that allows stores to sell
their albums for less than $10.</TE>
<TE>   But that kind of lure helps only if there's some interest to begin
with, and Murder Inc. had taken care of that. Gotti, who is also an
in-demand record producer (he just recorded an Eve-Alicia Keys duet),
paired Ashanti with his label's star rapper, Ja Rule, on his single
"Always on Time," which hit the charts before Christmas and quickly
moved to No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   He also put her on "What's Luv," a single he produced for rapper
Fat Joe, and released her own solo single debut, "Foolish" in
February. This week, the latter is No. 1 on the Hot 100, and "What's
Luv" is No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds like a precision military campaign, Ashanti's
ascent is actually something more organic. Ashanti Douglas, a native
of Glen Cove, N.Y., has sung most of her life and developed her
writing skills in high school. A mutual friend brought her to Gotti,
who was busy at the time producing Ja Rule's "Pain Is Love" album.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Just be a studio rat, hang around and we'll see what
happens,'" he recalls. "She kept coming to the studio and I kept
throwing tests at her."</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti impressed Gotti especially with her writing ability. She
co-wrote all the songs on "Ashanti" and also is a co-writer on the
remix of Jennifer Lopez's "Ain't It Funny." Convinced, Gotti signed
her to Murder Inc., which is a 50-50 partner with the powerful Island
Def Jam.</TE>
<TE>   The recording of "Ashanti" went quickly, says Gotti, who tried to
hook listeners by using a sample of DeBarge's "Stay With Me" as a key
element in the single "Foolish." The same sample had also appeared in
a recent remix of the Notorious B.I.G.'s "One More Chance."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if we put out a record on her, and if the people take
to it, it's gonna be crazy," says Gotti. "That's why I chose the
DeBarge loop as the sample, because I wanted a familiar beat that
people would recognize, and then I wanted her lyrically to write
something that's gonna make people feel her. So it really worked
out."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect things to die down. Ja Rule and Ashanti will spend
much of June performing in radio-sponsored concerts, including
KIIS-FM's Wango Tango on June 15 at the Rose Bowl. Gotti describes
her next single, "Happy," as "a massive summertime record," and
another teaming with Ja Rule, "Down Wit You," is also due soon. Then
they'll start work on Ashanti's second album.</TE>
<TE>   Says Gotti, "Once I have people's attention, I like to keep it
goin'."</TE>

<HD>Adventurous Hip-Hop, With Minimalism</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* DJ Vadim, still tangling with the FCC, uses a
sparse style yielding to something deeper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can take a while for a song to become a hit. In the case of "Your
Revolution," it took two years for it to take a hit--from the Federal
Communications Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "Your Revolution," a track on which the Russian-born, British-bred
hip-hop producer DJ Vadim crafted an insinuating beat to accompany a
poem by African American feminist performance artist Sarah Jones,
appeared on Vadim's 1999 album "USSR: Life From the Other Side"--and
somehow spent two years under the government's decency radar.</LD>
<LD>   In the caustic polemic tradition of Gil Scott-Heron's "The
Revolution Will Not Be Televised," Jones' poem takes male rappers to
task for their casual misogyny and disrespectful attitudes toward
women by quoting and then denouncing lyrics from the likes of LL Cool
J, Jay-Z, Akinyele and Notorious B.I.G.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, the source lyrics come from songs that have received
immense amounts of commercial airplay but when KBOO, a noncommercial
radio station in Portland, Ore., played the track around the time
Vadim's album was released, one listener complained to the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months later, the FCC fined KBOO $7,000, charging "the
rap song 'Your Revolution' contains unmistakable, patently offensive
sexual references" intended to "pander and shock."</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of crazy, but that's America," says Vadim of the FCC
controversy. "This is a country of stark contrasts, where you
supposedly have freedom of speech, but in fact things that are
derogatory and controversial get played, like a lot of that style of
hip-hop [criticized by Jones]. Yet when someone stands up against
that, that's the song that will be banned.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that says something about how the licensing bodies would
rather keep people down than have people stand up and be strong," he
adds. "When people stand up to be counted, they get worried. But when
people in the hip-hop communities are putting each other down,
they're less of a threat." In February, Jones filed suit in federal
court against the FCC. (KBOO has separately appealed the FCC fine.)
Meanwhile, Vadim reports that he and Jones have collaborated on a new
track for his upcoming album.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 'Area Coded,' a response to Ludacris' 'Area Code,'
where he goes, 'I got hos in all kinds of area codes.... ' Sarah does
a response, saying she has strong black sisters in area codes and
they're not 'hos.'"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this one will have to carry the parental advisory that no
one thought about putting on "Life From the Other Side." Or maybe it
will inspire an album about government conspiracies--except that
Vadim already explored that territory with 1997's "Tapping the
Conversation." Vadim created a disturbing audio tribute to Francis
Ford Coppola's 1974 paranoid thriller, "The Conversation," in which
Gene Hackman plays a surveillance expert caught in an unraveling web
of political intrigues. It was an unsettling masterpiece that, like
Coppola's film, made you listen hard to figure out just what was
going on--a hallmark of Vadim's work.</TE>
<TE>   "In the music that I do, I like to put a lot of different things
into it," he says. "I like to add an element of humor, of comedy and
irony, but there's also a serious side, a fun side, a chilling side.
I try to bring lots of different feelings in there and hopefully that
comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Adventurous concepts and mesmerizing minimalism--that's been
Vadim's modus operandi since he started releasing records in the
mid-'90s, with his debut EP, "Abstract Hallucinating Gasses" and his
first full-length effort, "U.S.S.R. Repertoire (The Theory of
Verticality)." The Vadim sound is a spare, masterful amalgam of
clipped beats, keyboard washes and manipulated elements, including
vocal samples ranging from the hilarious to the spooky. It's
old-fashioned headphone music that requires one's full attention, an
effect Vadim says is intentional.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always made the kind of music where it's minimal, but people
confuse minimal for nothing, and that's not what minimal is," he
explains. "It's usually a lot of stuff, but in a way that leaves a
lot of space--that's what minimal means to me. It gives you the idea
that it's very sparse but on second listen, you find more stuff."
These days, Vadim finds himself wearing "three kinds of armor suits."
Though he records for Ninja Tune, he still operates and does
production for his own Jazz Fudge label. Beyond that, Vadim is both
an internationally booked DJ and a "live act" with his Russian
Percussion ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Vadim admits, "In terms of sound, you can be much more complex on
a record than you can be live. The venues we play are hip-hop or rock
venues. It's not like a classical concert where people sit down and
listen to every single sound. It's very difficult to convey that in a
club, so we really have to simplify what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Vadim's been a world traveler since his family moved to England
when he was 5, and DJing has taken him to several dozen countries.
Last year, he embarked on an intriguing project underwritten by the
BBC. "Around the World in Eight Relays" was a specially created track
featuring contributions by musicians from eight countries, all using
instruments indigenous to their homelands.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the musicians met each other, but I met all of them,"
says Vadim, who interviewed the musicians as part of the BBC series,
which tracked each new layer of sound being added on. "Each musician
added a layer of sound, and I was the link in the chain."</TE>
<TE>   The final link was Jones, who layered her poetry above it all.</TE>
<TE>   Vadim probably hopes the FCC doesn't get wind of it.</TE>

<LD>If you think rock concerts are loud, wait till you hear hundreds of
preschoolers and toddlers shriek with delight over sightings of Elmo,
Cookie Monster and Big Bird.</LD>
<LD>   At the newest "Sesame Street Live" stage extravaganza, "Everyone
Makes Music," which launched its Southland tour this week at
Hollywood's Kodak Theatre, opening-night Muppet-mania was loud enough
to drown out the show's mightily amplified soundtrack.</LD>
<LD>   Enthusiasm wasn't even dampened by the show's late start, due to a
false fire alarm that kept the audience waiting outside the theater
many minutes past curtain time.</LD>
<TE>   Decibel levels aside--and overlooking the lobby merchandising of
those not-so-cheap, gotta-have-'em Elmo lights, T-shirts, dolls and
plastic "sports bottles," and helium balloons sold at intermission
for five bucks apiece--this "Sesame Street Live" show is the best
I've seen.</TE>
<TE>   The razzle-dazzle lights, backdrops and sets are fresh and
sparkling, the humor goes down easy, and the playful educational
elements from the TV show--projections of animated and film bits, a
letter and number ("J" and "8") for the audience to remember, an
"Elmo's World" segment--plus loads of audience sing-alongs,
clap-alongs and spoken responses, are smoothly integrated into the
mix.</TE>
<TE>   In the simple plot, non-Muppet Jenny (who is miked, not
prerecorded) is a music teacher whose instruments were lost during
her move to Sesame Street. Her new Muppet friends, trying to help,
find music in wooden spoons, pots and pans, empty bottles, bicycle
horns, alarm clocks and Baby Bear's homemade broom bass.</TE>
<TE>   As Jenny, Nicole Wintemberg, a polished, sweet-voiced singer, is
the gentle, easy-to-relate-to center of the production as the
music-making "discoveries" segue into creative song-and-dance
extravaganzas, including a black-light number that bowls kids over
when oversize shoes seem to dance by themselves. The hard-working
cast must be sweltering inside those Muppet body suits, but they
dance up a storm nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   Most unforgettable moment: Disco king Bert, in a white "Saturday
Night Fever" suit.</TE>
<TE>   Credits for the appealing show, a VEE Entertainment Corp.
production, include writer Annie Evans; musical director Jon Baker;
Cheryl Baxter, who directed and co-choreographed with JoAnna Hayes
Wagner; lighting designer David Agress and art director Greg Lucas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of last century's ironies is that Winston Churchill's heroism
would not have been possible without Adolf Hitler's villainy.</LD>
<LD>   They rode opposite ends of a teeter-totter. History would not have
summoned Churchill to greatness had there been no Third Reich to
resist as Hitler's forces occupied much of Europe and menaced
Britain.</LD>
<LD>   That makes HBO's "The Gathering Storm"--drawn largely from the
volume of Churchill's memoirs spanning the period between World Wars
I and II--all the more fascinating, and it gives Albert Finney one of
his meatier roles as the British leader (earlier played by actors
ranging from Robert Hardy to Richard Burton) who led his nation
through a devastating war after emerging from his own personal and
political wilderness when already deep into his 60s.</LD>
<TE>   Vanessa Redgrave ably supports Finney as Churchill's wife,
Clementine. It's worth noting, too, the other standout British actors
appear here in relatively minor roles, including Oscar-winning Jim
Broadbent ("Iris") as Churchill's political ally, Desmond Morton;
Oscar-nominated Tom Wilkinson ("In the Bedroom") as Sir Robert
Vansittart, another ally; Derek Jacobi as Prime Minister Stanley
Baldwin; Celia Imrie as Churchill's secretary, Violet Pearman; and
John Standing as Lord Moyne, who is barely a footnote. Either roles
are sparse or these actors welcome association with quality in any
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill was one of those historical figures for all seasons. He
was a talented writer, an able artist and, like many successful
politicians, a kick-butt performer. His unlikely comeback from the
brink of obscurity was remarkable, as was his speechwriting and
speechmaking. He is possibly as renowned today for his oft-quoted
eloquence under fire as for his courage and vision as a war leader,
most notably in those grim early days when the British buckled but
didn't falter while standing virtually alone against Germany. His
speeches contain passages that still deliver lumps in the throat
across decades, as when he urged on his people against the Nazi
threat in 1940 with these famous words:</TE>
<TE>   "Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that, if the British Empire and Commonwealth last for a
thousand years, men will still say: 'This was their finest hour.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's 1934, at his darkest hour, when we meet Churchill here, five
years after he had lost his cabinet post as Chancellor of the
Exchequer when the Tories were swept from power by the Labor Party.
His pedigree includes a slew of ministerial posts since 1908, and he
remains a Member of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   But he is now a fraying, out-of-favor, almost decadent aging
statesman. "Look at me," he protests. "No power. No prospective
power." Then he adds, almost admiringly about the fame and influence
of the criminal whose destiny will alter his own: "Look at Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   His finances in arrears, his life burning down along with his
famous cigars, his spellbinding oratory and once-thriving government
career apparently behind him, he paints, gardens, putters and
grumbles around his Chartwell country estate in what a political foe
calls "the evening of his days."</TE>
<TE>   Hardly, as it turns out, for Hugh Whitemore's teleplay concludes
with Churchill again being named First Lord of the Admiralty in 1939.
The storm first gathers, then blows Churchill right to 10 Downing
Street, his warnings about the Nazis and his pleas for the nation to
rearm ultimately sinking in after Germany attacks Poland. In 1940, he
succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   He was not all-wise. As young First Lord of the Admiralty early in
World War I, for example, he hatched a plan for a naval attack on
Constantinople that failed badly, and then approved a disastrous
invasion of Gallipoli, for which his critics continued to fault him
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Churchill's thinking always unflawed in this story directed
adroitly by Richard Loncraine and staged lushly in London and at
Chartwell. If right about Germany, he is wrong about India, playing
the blowhard when harrumphing about Britain possibly losing colonial
control to a "gang of seditious Hindus" led by Mohandas K. Gandhi
"striding half-naked up the steps ... to parley on equal terms with
representatives of the ... king."</TE>
<TE>   Finney's Churchill is persuasively arrogant, stubborn,
hot-tempered and robust, passionately debating Baldwin and arguing in
Parliament against pacifying Hitler. He builds his case from
confidential information fed privately to him by Ralph Wigram (Linus
Roache) and others in the Foreign Office who oppose the government's
appeasement policies.</TE>
<TE>   He is also despairing, however, a spirit muted by frequent
melancholia that he and Clementine call his "black dog." Based on
this account and others, she must have found living with him
intolerable at times, and at one point here angrily hits him with a
plate of sprouts.</TE>
<TE>   Family conflicts are sometimes punctuated by his impish humor,
too, as in Winston knifing through a ferocious argument at home with
this mock admonition: "Don't interrupt me while I'm interrupting!"</TE>
<TE>   As clouds darken, these Chartwell skirmishes are innocent foreplay
for the great battle that will make Churchill an epic figure of
history.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gathering Storm" premieres tonight at 8 on HBO. The network
has rated it TV-PG-DV (may be unsuitable for young children, with
advisories for suggestive dialogue and violence).</TE>

<LD>The design of the new Children's Museum ("Realm of the Child," by
Nicolai Ouroussoff, April 22) looks like a pile of discarded material
waiting to be thrown into a dumpster. It may be "innovative and bold"
but my adjective for it would be just plain "scary."</LD>
<LD>   Who are the architects designing this junk for? Other architects?</LD>
<LD>   CAROL THOMPSON</LD>
<TE>   Anaheim Hills</TE>
<TE>   Ouroussoff describes the building's "folding planes" as appearing
"like an origami sculpture." Yet traditional origami is rooted in
symmetric and asymmetric harmonies, neither of which appear here.</TE>
<TE>   More obviously, and I feel more ominously, we are looking not at
origami, but at a model of a crumpled piece of paper that will be
architecturalized to stand inappropriately for destruction and
unyielding self-assertion, qualities that should not be made central
in the minds of developing children or adults who are going to
properly participate in community living.</TE>
<TE>   MILANO KAY</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the proposed Children's Museum: It looks just like the
old Monsanto House at Disneyland would after a really big earthquake.
And it screams "Imagine, Be Curious," just like a train wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this, The Times' coverage would have been strengthened by a
companion piece acknowledging the Little Tokyo community's long
campaign for a recreation center at this site. Let's consider all the
issues and not just build the museum because it'll be housed in a
really cool building.</TE>
<TE>   WES JOE</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Talk about the emperor's new clothes! If that museum gets built,
San Fernando Valley residents will have to look daily at this latest
pile of "architecture"--resembling fallen space junk--until somebody
with brains safely removes it. What a travesty!</TE>
<TE>   HILDA E. WENNER</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   Design Dressing</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra's interest in
reaching out to the broader community, the number of seats that will
have to be filled in the new Disney Hall, and the enormous resources
that are going into its construction, one would hope the artwork
would be a little more universal than "a giant white collar and bow
tie" ("Ideas for Accessorizing Disney Hall," by Christopher Reynolds,
April 23).</TE>
<TE>   What is the message here? That the Disney Hall is by and for the
tuxedo class? Passing by such elitist symbols on the way into the
auditorium would put a damper on the musical experience for many.</TE>
<TE>   GENEVIEVE MARCUS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Uh Oh, Not Again</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column ("With Another Celebrity Arrest, the
Circus Returns to Town," April 20) was right on the money about the
Thursday night fiasco of the Robert Blake arrest coverage. What a
waste of talent, time, airwaves, gas for the helicopters, cops' time,
etc. I couldn't believe that they were all covering the same
story--ad infinitum, ad nauseum.</TE>
<TE>   JIM TIERNEY</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   As a criminal defense lawyer of 25 years' experience, I am
embarrassed to see alleged lawyers like Dan Abrams and Catherine
Crier jump on the air and critique the lawyers and the case without
having a scintilla of hard information or evidence.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the NBA playoffs. It's a real trial of a real person
charged with a real crime. Unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   MARC TRIPLETT</TE>
<TE>   Bellefontaine, Ohio</TE>
<TE>   Not too long ago, I was telling a friend why I was fed up with the
24-hour news media and rarely watched Fox, CNN and MSNBC. My reasons
reflected what Howard Rosenberg so eloquently described in his
article.</TE>
<TE>   I am tired of seeing/hearing these so-called experts, analysts and
pundits fill time and space by second-guessing, speculating and
projecting outcomes of whatever event or situation the media are
obsessed with at the time. I find it cumbersome, tiring and an insult
to people in the government, military and public service who are
trying their best to do their jobs.</TE>

<TE>   TV Diversity or Not</TE>
<TE>   I first thought the Counterpunch article ("Diversity Isn't So Black
and White an Issue," by Marlon Mohammed, April 22) would champion the
cause of Native Americans, Asians, Latinos and others who are missing on
television. To my horror, the article chose to castigate the efforts of
groups such as the NAACP that have been, in no small part, responsible for
making sure that the issue isn't completely disregarded.</TE>
<TE>   In criticizing a movement that has very little power to do
anything proactive besides speak for minorities, Mohammed belies the
work necessary to achieve real change in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   When the time comes that we can turn on the television and see so
many different races of people that we can't ask, "Where are the gay,
blind, black rabbis?," then I will believe what he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   I offer this challenge: Watch television for a full 24 hours (you
can even flip through DirectTV). If you find two Native Americans
playing Native Americans within a five-hour time block, I'll eat the
newsprint this letter is written on. If not, a simple "touche" will
suffice.</TE>
<TE>   HERMAN WILKINS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   I would suggest to Mohammed that the issue of diversity is no more
complex than for casting directors to get past stereotyping and
typecasting and commit themselves to changing the widely accepted
negative image of African Americans and other minorities.</TE>
<TE>   If we can achieve that goal, Los Angeles and the world would be a
better place and our children would have a brighter future.</TE>

<TE>   Equity and 'Music Man'</TE>
<TE>   Don Shirley's article, "Musical to Strike Up a Band Without Union
Members" (April 25), about the upcoming engagement of "The Music Man"
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, misrepresents Equity's
position about the "qualitative difference" between union and
nonunion performers in this tour.</TE>
<TE>   As reviews and audiences have proven and as we agree, the cast of
"The Music Man" is indeed very talented. Having an Equity card
doesn't make you a better--or a worse--actor. The card does mean that
you enjoy benefits that have been negotiated through collective
bargaining. We hope to begin this process on behalf of the actors and
stage managers in "The Music Man" very soon.</TE>

<HD>Publicity, Halfheartedly</HD>
<DH>Craig T. Nelson is proud of his CBS show, 'The District,'
and how it tackles edgier issues. Who cares if dealing with media
isn't his favorite part of the job?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting people to watch a television show these days is like running
for political office--making sure your core constituency turns out,
courting the undecided, disseminating the message through whatever
media outlets will provide a platform to pitch your programs.</LD>
<LD>   Craig T. Nelson should know the drill, having spent much of the
last 15 years as a television star. After nine seasons starring in
ABC's "Coach," he returned to prime time last season with "The
District," a program that continues to perform reasonably well for
CBS Saturday nights, when ABC and NBC have bowed to low overall TV
viewing levels by running movies in lieu of original series.</LD>
<LD>   Still, for all his experience, Nelson remains uncomfortable with
one obligatory part of the job--namely, pressing the flesh on behalf
of his series, especially when that means dealing with the press
itself.</LD>
<TE>   Nelson participated in a conference call with reporters this week
to promote a crossover episode connecting his series, in which he
plays flamboyant Washington, D.C., Police Chief Jack Mannion, with
CBS' first-year CIA drama, "The Agency." Yet anyone listening could
discern his heart wasn't in it, that he approached the session--which
included a question about whether he's irked his show isn't written
about more--with the sort of enthusiasm reserved for a firing squad.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, at least he showed up. When "Coach" signed off in
1997, Nelson let a written statement to fans speak for him, eschewing
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "So often there's just nothing to say," Nelson said after the
conference call, explaining his reticence. "You're repeating some
kind of drivel, and there is so much to my life that is more
important than drivel.... It's always a very difficult thing for me."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson doesn't exactly qualify as his generation's Greta Garbo.
He'll talk to reporters, he said, to get the word out if there's an
episode he feels especially proud of. Yet he's also skeptical of
bringing additional people to the set in that process, and besides,
"I get bored listening to myself talk, anyway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Nelson has managed to enjoy considerable success
without being a media darling. Critics seldom had much nice to say
about "Coach," but the series endured 15 time-period changes en route
to completing 200 episodes. "Not only the critics were trying to kill
it, but the network," Nelson quipped, noting that the show also
survived four executive regimes at ABC.</TE>
<TE>   By the time "Coach" ended, Nelson was one of its producers, a role
he also plays on "The District." At this point, he said, having a
level of influence in a program is the best part of the job. "I stick
my nose in where it doesn't belong, of course," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson started as a writer as well as a performer, beginning his
TV career in the 1970s on the "Lohman and Barkley Show," a variety
series for which his collaborators included director Barry Levinson,
actor John Amos and comic Art Metrano. Last year, Nelson arranged for
Metrano--who is still performing after a fall off his roof in 1989
left him paralyzed--to appear in a guest role on "The District."</TE>
<TE>   The real-life figure upon whom the show is based, Jack Maple,
moved from city to city to overhaul police departments before dying
from colon cancer last year at age 48. In discussions regarding how
to keep the series fresh should it continue for several years, the
producers have considered the possibility of a similar shift, with
Mannion being transplanted to reform law enforcement in a new city.</TE>
<TE>   What little discussion "The District" did generate in the media
before its premiere was mostly negative, with some critics taking the
show to task for presenting Mannion as a sort of Great White
Father--dispensing law, order and wisdom to a department previously
run by an African American deputy chief and mayor.</TE>
<TE>   CBS wasn't thrilled by the criticism, but it fizzled quickly, and
the show went on to become one of last season's surprises, currently
averaging 10.4 million viewers a week and regularly winning its time
slot.</TE>
<TE>   Its star, meanwhile, had a different perspective on the fleeting
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very excited by that," Nelson said. "Does a show have to be
politically correct to make it? Those are interesting issues and
should be explored. This is exactly what the show should be."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "The District" is seeking to tackle thornier issues,
including a story next month focusing on the death penalty.
Co-written by producers John Wirth and Pam Veasey, the episode
represents the writers' attempts to be edgier and "not to play it
safe," as Nelson put it, breaking from whatever formulaic
expectations surround the show.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I wanted to accomplish is to try to
rehabilitate the reputation of the show with critics, which has
proved to be very difficult," said Wirth, who joined the series this
season.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether that creative drift will inspire the
press to talk about "The District," but it's a safe bet that its star
would just as soon not have to talk back.</TE>
<TE>   "The District" airs tonight at 10 on CBS.</TE>

<LD>   Prager's Talk Show Heads to Middle East</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Prager is taking his radio talk show to trouble-plagued
Jerusalem next week in what he describes as a show of support for
Israel. Prager's syndicated program airs locally on KRLA-AM (870),
weekdays from 9 a.m. to noon.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel it's important to tell Israelis that they're not alone,
that they have support outside of Israel," Prager said in an
interview. "The country has a bunker mentality, with justification.
Israelis look at the United Nations and at Europe and see either
outright hostility or evenhandedness, which, when people want you
dead, is pretty much the same as hostility."</TE>
<TE>   The parallels between Israel and the United States, he says, were
another motivating factor. "I want to bring my listeners a sense of
what it's like for a democracy to live under siege," he said. "Part
of me worries that this is a glimpse of our future, too: people
walking into supermarkets with bombs strapped to them. I pray we
don't have to prepare for that."</TE>
<TE>   The trip is sponsored by the Media Line, a group that produces
programs on the politics of Israel and the Middle East--with no
strings attached, Prager maintains. Arab Israelis and Christians will
be part of the mix in an attempt to put "a human face on the
conflict," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prager, who broadcast for 18 years on KABC before moving to KRLA
two years ago, will also shoot a video documentary examining people's
response to daily terror, aimed at cable or public television.</TE>
<TE>   Programs Mark Riots'</TE>
<TE>   10th Anniversary</TE>
<TE>   The Beat, also known as radio station KKBT-FM (100.3), will hold a
town hall meeting Sunday morning to discuss the 10th anniversary of
the Los Angeles riots.</TE>
<TE>   The public is invited to attend the event, which will be broadcast
live on the weekly program "Street Science," from 8 to 11 a.m. The
meeting will be held at Magic Johnson's TGI Friday's, 6721 La Tijera
Blvd., in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On television, meanwhile, KCBS-TV Channel 2 will present a
half-hour special on the anniversary at 6:30 p.m. Sunday. The
program, "30 Minutes of Special Assignment: L.A. Riots: A Decade
Later," will be hosted by Harold Greene and Ann Martin.</TE>
<TE>   And MTV will repeat its hourlong documentary about South-Central
Los Angeles, "Back to the Hood," at 7 p.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   'Seinfeld' Tops List</TE>
<TE>   of TV Guide Favorites</TE>
<TE>   What's the greatest television show of all time? The editors of TV
Guide have selected "Seinfeld," which edged out "I Love Lucy" on its
list of the Top 50.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Gleason's "The Honeymooners" ranked third. Rounding out the
top 10 are "All in the Family," "The Sopranos," "60 Minutes," David
Letterman's "Late Show," "The Simpsons," "The Andy Griffith Show" and
"Saturday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   TV Museum Salutes Bowie's Music Videos</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills will present
"David Bowie: Sound + Vision," the first retrospective devoted to the
singer, from June 7 through Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Marking the 30th anniversary of "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
Stardust and the Spiders From Mars"--the album that ushered in the
glam era--the exhibition will feature 50 of his music videos,
interviews, documentaries and rarely seen performances.</TE>
<TE>   Ripa's Book Club Already Making Waves</TE>
<TE>   Move over, Oprah.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the announcement that Oprah Winfrey will be making
only infrequent book club selections, Kelly Ripa, of the syndicated
TV show "Live With Regis and Kelly," is picking up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   The "Reading with Ripa" book club, announced on Thursday's show,
is off to a flying start, the New York Post reports. Kara White's "If
Looks Could Kill" was the first of Ripa's picks. And as soon as the
selection was made public, the novel moved from No. 7,000 to No. 7 on
Amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Books, the publisher, has ordered an additional 25,000
copies.</TE>

<HD>The Jokes Grow Old With Repetition</HD>
<DH>A David Shrigley show presents more than 100 of the
prankster's works, showing that comic relief is better in small
doses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In talented hands, comic relief provides timely pauses that intensify
the effect of almost any narrative. In untalented hands, this
dramatic device is frequently overused, swamping the story with glib
silliness.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for visitors to the UCLA Hammer Museum, David
Shrigley falls into the latter category. A young British artist who
lives in Glasgow, Scotland, he shows himself to be a one-trick pony,
a supercilious prankster whose jokes aren't all that funny. When
filling two galleries, more than 100 of his sculptures, drawings,
collages and photographs are tedious: too trite to be memorable but
too much a symptom of the art world institutions that support them to
be ignored.</LD>
<LD>   On a low pedestal in the center of the first gallery rests a
Styrofoam brick on which Shrigley has written, "We place too much
importance in objects. Objects really aren't very interesting.
Personally, I prefer sounds (and also smells)." He means it, sort of,
but not really.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty-five years ago, Conceptual art broke new ground by arguing
that the ideas a work generates are more important than the objects
that get such processes started. Shrigley's lightweight brick doesn't
pretend to break anything (not even a comic-strip window, through
which such message-laden projectiles are often hurled). Instead, it
merely makes fun of museum-goers who want something more from
contemporary art than a joke about dead-end fifth-generation
Conceptualism.</TE>
<TE>   His sculptural gag is meant to appeal to viewers who have been
marching through room after room of art they don't care about. This
experience is common on the proliferating biennial circuit, where a
clique of regulars is regularly commissioned to make spectacular
installations that are as forgettable as they are bombastic. In such
a setting, Shrigley's sculpture would provide some welcome comic
relief.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that it's installed among more than 100 other works
that make the same basic point. If his pieces could speak, the chorus
would be, "The outside world is infinitely more interesting than
what's here in the gallery, but if we abandoned the security of the
art world, the guy who makes us wouldn't get any attention."</TE>
<TE>   Several of Shrigley's photographs document his in-the-street
pranks. In one, a sheet of paper, posted on a tree in a city park,
informs passersby that a pigeon has been lost: "Normal size. A Bit
Mangy Looking. Does Not Have a Name. Call 257-1964." In another, a
wooden sign has been stuck in a lush grassy lawn. It states, "imagine
the green is red." A third depicts an empty urban lot on which the
artist has placed a refrigerator-size box. On the front of his
make-believe building he has cut a door and painted "Leisure Centre."</TE>
<TE>   This oversize snapshot is an obvious critique of modern society's
refusal to give leisure its due. But as an artist, Shrigley doesn't
take leisure seriously. Rather than cultivating his talents, refining
his facilities or clarifying his thinking, he acts as if he's too
exhausted (or just too cool) to do anything more than crank out
slacker cliches.</TE>
<TE>   At their best, his ham-fisted drawings and scrawled texts give
form to an attitude of muddled detachment and self-satisfied
alienation. His lists, in which he alphabetizes an afternoon's
thoughts or keeps score of the absurd relationships between workers
and their tools, are his most promising pieces. Otherwise, stick
figures predominate, accompanied by captions that describe a world in
which bad things happen with such regularity that you'd have to be a
fool to hope for anything different.</TE>
<TE>   Even when nothing takes place, blase indifference washes over
everything. One crudely rendered landscape announces, "There is
nothing in the desert." Another is labeled "Magnification reveals
nature to be boring." It's no accident that Shrigley's drawings
resemble what junior high students scribble in their notebooks. Both
embrace a type of knee-jerk nihilism that's easier to forgive in
adolescents than in adults who get stuck in its shallow negativity.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of technique, Shrigley's collages and acrylics are even
cruder than his drawings: They mimic the work of grade school
students. In terms of content, they deliver more of the same
one-dimensional sentiments that fill his black-and-white works.</TE>
<TE>   His well-made sculptures, which include a realistic walnut the
size of a bowling ball, a big bent nail stuck in the wall and a huge
leaf of lettuce covered with cigarette burns, add some production
value to the installation. But Shrigley's attempt to translate his
cartoon vision into three dimensions comes off as cutesy. His
sculptures have the presence of props from insufficiently developed
dramas.</TE>
<TE>   Organized by the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, Shrigley's U.S. debut betrays the
conservatism at the heart of his art. Although his down-and-out works
pretend to stand apart from the art world's institutional support
structure, they are designed to fit right into its normal operations,
making a joke or two without changing anything.</TE>

<HD>Latino Museum Finds a Downtown Home</HD>
<DH>Development* The move to the L.A. Mall will clear the way
for a new Caltrans building and a public plaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forced out by downtown redevelopment, the Latino Museum of History,
Art and Culture will leave its Main Street location in May and move
to a temporary home in the city-owned Los Angeles Mall, next to City
Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The museum, which has no full-time staff, has struggled with debts
to past employees and vendors and was closed for most of 2001. It
reopened in February with a photography exhibit about Mexicans of
African heritage, which closed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The museum's location at 112 S. Main St. has been targeted by city
and state officials in a plan to move Caltrans offices and create a
public plaza across First Street from City Hall, where the main
Caltrans building now stands. Under that plan, Caltrans will build
new offices on Main Street between 1st and 2nd streets, where the
Latino Museum and a handful of other business now stand. Construction
crews have already begun preparing the ground on much of that block.</LD>
<TE>   The Latino Museum's property, donated by the Bank of America in
1999, includes roughly 20,000 square feet of exhibition, office and
storage space, a bas-relief concrete facade created by artist Roberto
Delgado and a parking area that generates monthly income. The
museum's leaders had been reluctant to move, citing the difficulty of
matching their current central location and complaining that the city
hasn't offered sufficient compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The city, eager to move the project forward, opened condemnation
proceedings, had the museum property appraised and offered the
museum's trustees $2.9 million for it, said Gerry Miller, the city's
assistant chief legislative analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations over the property's price continue, said museum
spokesman Mark Landon. But under a new agreement between the city and
the museum, representatives of each side said, the museum will move
in May to a 6,000-square-foot space near the food court of the Los
Angeles Mall, at Suite 2, 201 N. Los Angeles St. Under the deal, the
museum will have up to a year rent-free in the space, which
previously served as home to the city Ethics Commission. (The
commission has moved back to the recently renovated City Hall.)</TE>
<TE>   City officials are hoping the museum's Main Street space will be
vacated by May 10, Miller said; Landon said the move could take two
weeks longer than that.</TE>
<TE>   Once the site is vacant, said Miller, the building will probably
be demolished within 30 days. Museum officials said the timetable for
reopening to visitors at the new site is not yet certain.</TE>
<TE>   Still unresolved are the museum's debts to vendors and past
employees, which last year were estimated at $400,000. In a March
interview, several museum board members said that they'd begun paying
that figure down, reducing the debt to about $300,000, and that their
tentative strategy is to continue gradual repayment while using much
of the sale revenue on forward-looking issues, like finding a
permanent home.</TE>

<HD>10 Years Later, 'Which Way' Still Fosters a Civil, Civic
Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Kyle McKinnon, managing editor of the radio show "Which Way,
L.A.?," whisked himself and a wireless microphone from one side of
University Hall auditorium in Westchester to the other fielding
questions, host Warren Olney loomed like a boxing referee ready to
jump in whenever necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "Ninety-two was about injustice" and about Latasha Harlins, a man
in the audience told the panelists in reference to the 1992 Los
Angeles riots, the topic under discussion.</LD>
<LD>   "Latasha Harlins," Olney interjected, explaining that Harlins was
a 15-year-old black girl shot in 1991 by a Korean grocer, "Soon Ja
Dao, Soon Ja Do.... "</LD>
<TE>   "Soon Ja Du," the man said, correcting Olney.</TE>
<TE>   Olney's memory of some details of 10 years ago, when he began
hosting "Which Way, L.A.?" on KCRW-FM (89.9), may be a bit hazy, but
with quick wit and tough questions he showed during the National
Public Radio program's live anniversary broadcast at Loyola Marymount
University Thursday that he's not any less sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "Which Way, L.A.?" made its debut in May 1992, just days after
city residents erupted in looting and violence in response to the
acquittal of four LAPD officers accused of beating Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   "There was, I think, a real hunger to think about and discuss some
of the issues that caused this huge conflagration," Olney said.
"Since then, we've continued to do it because we think the needs
still exist."</TE>
<TE>   And at least the dozens of people who showed up to address the
panelists--City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, former mayoral candidate
Antonio Villaraigosa and representatives from the LAPD as well as the
black and the Korean communities--are still interested.</TE>
<TE>   The show has had to change with the times, expanding from a
monthlong series to "the program you couldn't kill," said Ruth
Seymour, KCRW's general manager. "I think it has an amazing track
record of capturing whatever the pulse is like in the city at any
time."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, "Which Way, L.A.?" was an hourlong series broadcast
twice a day with panelists and call-in guests. But after hearing the
same people call in year after year, that segment was eventually
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 2000, Olney began hosting a nationally syndicated program
called "To the Point," employing the same format as "Which Way,
L.A.?" The rebroadcast of "Which Way, L.A.?" stopped, and the show
cut back to a half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Olney maintains, and an estimated 74,000 weekly listeners would
appear to support, that the issues raised by the program are as
important today as when it began.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't seem as urgent now, until you remember what happened
10 years ago and reflect on how little has changed," Olney said. "No
radio program is going to create solutions. All we can do is provide
a forum, raise the issue and conduct discourse."</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's panel, Delgadillo said, "One of the great
legacies of the civil unrest is that we have an incredible, popular
public show that debates the issues that are important to Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, "Which Way, L.A.?" has taken on Valley secession, the
debate over retaining Chief Bernard Parks and the legacy of Cesar
Chavez. The program doesn't often address the 1992 riots anymore, but
Olney said, "You don't have to mention the riots themselves to talk
about the issues that still exist. I feel a personal responsibility
to keep raising the issues."</TE>
<TE>   And he does it in a way that's not overbearing. Many have remarked
about how elegantly Olney allows the guests to debate challenging
issues, such as racial tensions, the income gap and Los Angeles
schools, without arguments ensuing.</TE>
<TE>   If Olney has any bones to pick of his own, he says they're with
television news.</TE>
<TE>   Olney worked in local news for 25 years as a reporter, editor and
anchor at various Los Angeles TV stations before quitting his job at
KCOP-TV in December 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "I left [TV news] because it wasn't doing any longer what I got
into it to do, and that's public service, investigative journalism.
News," Olney said. "I would have to say that it has not gotten any
better.</TE>
<TE>   "I find what I'm doing now much more interesting," he said.</TE>

<HD>Figuring Out the John Nash Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When true stories get the Hollywood treatment, facts get fudged.</LD>
<LD>   A variety of groups have weighed in on the movie version of John
Nash's life in "A Beautiful Mind," from Latinos disappointed that the
film doesn't indicate that his wife is Salvadoran-born, to mental
health professionals who dispute the movie's depiction of
schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's PBS "American Experience" documentary on the Nobel
Prize-winning mathematician, "A Brilliant Madness" (9 p.m. KCET,
KVCR), fills in some facts that the movie left out, providing new
insights into this man who made theoretical breakthroughs, then faced
the more complex equation of how to find his way back from
schizophrenia.</LD>
<TE>   The hourlong program's greatest asset is Nash himself, who in
present-day interviews helps to tell his story. Looking professorial,
he is at once candid and good-natured as he says things like, "To
some extent, sanity is a form of conformity."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary points out that unorthodox thinking is prized in
the mathematical community, so that Nash found himself in a
relatively safe, tolerant environment during his illness. More so
than the movie, the documentary indicates that Nash was actively
watched over by colleagues, as well as by his wife, Alicia--who had
divorced him but took care of him nevertheless. This
it-takes-a-village perspective is even more heartening and
inspirational than the one in the feel-good, Oscar-winning picture.</TE>
<TE>   Combining personal photographs and interviews (with Alicia Nash
and biographer Sylvia Nasar, among others) with artful imaginings of
Nash's mental states, producer Randall MacLowry and director Mark
Samels have organized another fascinating tour through this beautiful
mind.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc. Chief Executive and President Margaret Whitman got stock
options worth as much as $47.8 million last year, as shares of the
world's biggest Internet auction site more than doubled.</LD>
<LD>   Whitman was granted options to buy 750,000 EBay shares at $40.06,
according to a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. That came on top of a base salary of $241,256 and a bonus
of $139,332 for the 45-year-old executive.</LD>
<LD>   The options would be worth as much as $47.8 million if shares rise
10% or more during the life of the grant, which expires in January
2011. EBay shares fell $2.09 to $49.70 on Nasdaq. They have risen 8%
in the last year.</LD>

participating in the carrier's financial recovery plan but will
discuss labor cost relief only as part of a bigger plan that includes
sacrifices by all employee groups.</LD>

statement from any employee group at the No.2 U.S. airline, which is
struggling with financial losses in the wake of Sept. 11.</LD>

<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to offer money transfers from its 2,760
U.S. stores as it tries to attract shoppers with added services.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest retailer will offer Viad Corp.'s MoneyGram
Payment Systems service between the U.S. and 150 countries by
mid-May, the company said. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company has
allowed customers of its Mexican stores to receive money transfers
for two years.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart is testing new concepts, such as leasing space near its
Houston stores to a used-car dealer, to bring in more customers. It's
also in talks with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's second-largest
bank, to open branches in U.S. stores.</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart shares closed down $1.20 to $55.80, and shares of Viad,
based in Phoenix, rose 39 cents to $30.56--both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>United States Steel Corp., the nation's largest integrated steel
maker, reported a first-quarter net loss on weak prices but forecast
a profitable 2002 based on a better outlook for prices and shipments.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was $89 million, or 93cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net income of $9 million, or 10 cents. Sales fell 8.3%
to $1.43 billion, the Pittsburgh-based company said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Steel said its loss from operations before special items
totaled $81 million, down from a loss of $97 million a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   However, Chief Executive Thomas Usher said he expects steel price
increases, combined with strong orders, will help swing the company
into profitability for the balance of the year.</TE>

Department of Securities had launched an investigation into the

communications network connects 125 U.S. cities, said it had informed
the Oklahoma agency that it would cooperate fully with the
investigation.</LD>

Williams Communications and Williams Cos. may have violated certain
sections of state securities laws.</LD>

had any time to meet with them," said Deborah Trevino, a Williams
Communications spokeswoman.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who says there's no change of seasons in Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   The careful observer doesn't need colorful leaves, falling snow or
blooming flowers to know the time of year. If it's fall, everyone's
complaining about USC's football coach. In winter, everyone's
complaining about UCLA's basketball coach. And in the spring, the
Portland Trail Blazers are going through their ritual meltdown at
Staples Center before getting bounced from the playoffs by the
Lakers, while the Kings are battling the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   And the only thing that never gets old is Kings-Avalanche.</LD>
<TE>   It might lack originality, with the teams following the same route
as last year to get to Game 6, including a Kings' overtime victory at
Colorado in Game 5. But it also has almost everything you could ask
for in a playoff: Stars and goaltenders rising to the occasion, drama
and controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing missing is some quality trash talk. King Coach Andy
Murray even went into painstaking, sentence-parsing detail to ensure
that what he wrote on his team's board wouldn't end up on Colorado's
board. Before Game 5, he wrote: "Win Thursday and we will be playing
Game 7 Monday."</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't use the word 'guarantee,'" Murray said Friday
afternoon. "To me, guarantee means it's gonna happen. You've got to
make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The only time Murray talked tough was when he discussed the
prospects of playing without defenseman Philippe Boucher (out because
of an eye injury) and right wing Adam Deadmarsh (doubtful because of
a neck strain).</TE>
<TE>   "That's just a test for us; a challenge," Murray said. "Bring it
on."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings don't want to antagonize Colorado goalie Patrick Roy,
because there's a perception that he plays better when he's angry,
whether it's at opposing players or hometown reporters and fans who
dare question his greatness.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get him mad with anything that I say," Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   Here's something that can't be construed as trash talk, simply an
observation of what has happened: Felix Potvin has matched or
surpassed Roy in the nets the last three games. And Roy has been at
his all-world standards.</TE>
<TE>   One hot goaltender can nullify everything else that happens on the
ice and make up the difference in depth. Potvin has allowed two goals
in the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's played great every year in the playoffs," center Jason
Allison said.</TE>
<TE>   Like a baseball player in a hitting streak, Potvin didn't want to
elaborate on his stellar play.</TE>
<TE>   "Playoff hockey, goalies are stepping up, there's not a lot of
goals scored," he said. "You have to be on top of your game all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   After the wide-open play that characterized the first three games,
the middle of the ice has been shut down like a freeway lane under
repair. So it's going to come down to one or two breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got them Thursday night, when a shot by Colorado center
Joe Sakic hit the crossbar, and an overtime pass by Jaroslav Modry
bounced off Craig Johnson's skate and past Roy into the net.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where the big C--for Controversy--jumped over the
boards and skated into this series. The Avalanche players and coaches
thought Johnson kicked the puck into the net, a violation of NHL Rule
70A.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much talk about kicking on Friday it felt like a
Rockettes' performance. The Kings are convinced that Johnson did not
make "a distinct kicking motion," which is how the rulebook defines
it. Murray even replayed the goal for reporters, while pointing out
that the Colorado broadcasters on the videotape didn't squawk about
the play. Johnson might have turned his skate for an optimum angle,
but he didn't kick.</TE>
<TE>   For a clear distinct kicking motion, check the tape of Thursday's
Laker game when Dale Davis punted the ball over the baseline press
table.</TE>
<TE>   Man, the Trail Blazer act sure is getting old. Let's get that
series over with. I pleaded with Robert Horry to end it on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try my hardest," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   Maximum effort from Horry--another sure sign it's spring.</TE>
<TE>   The request of the Kings is to extend it. Go back to Colorado for
Game 7. That way we'll have an upset victory or the sight of the
defending champions coming through when pushed to the limit. Quality
stuff either way, with the prospect of more great battles in years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's goal is the type of play that can simmer all summer and
cook up a good rivalry. You don't think Roy already has bad memories
of the Kings piling up in front of him after the winning goal,
trapping him in his own net?</TE>
<TE>   It will be bumpin' at Staples Center today.</TE>
<TE>   One of the motivational tidbits Murray gave his team before Game 5
was the thought of how great it would be to step on the ice for Game
6 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's here. It feels just like last year. It feels like

<HD>Clemens Handles Mariners Again, 7-1</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Clemens shut down Seattle again and Derek Jeter had three hits
as the New York Yankees defeated the Mariners, 7-1, Friday night at
Seattle in a rematch of the American League championship series.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees, who defeated Seattle in the playoffs the last two
years, picked up where they left off in October.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens (3-2) gave up one run and six hits in eight innings,
striking out four. He improved his career record to 22-12 against the
Mariners--the most victories for any pitcher against Seattle--and
tied Jim Kaat for 26th place with his 283rd career victory.</LD>
<TE>   Robin Ventura led a 15-hit attack for the Yankees by going three
for three, with his seventh homer of the season. Jeter was three for
five with two runs batted in and Alfonso Soriano also drove in two
runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees battered James Baldwin (2-1) for seven runs and 13
hits in 42/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Yankee Manager Joe Torre said he was anxious to
see his team matched up against a premier opponent. Seattle tied the
major league record with 116 victories last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the second on Ventura's homer and
made it 4-0 with three more in the third.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners got their first hits, three singles, in the fifth for
their run off Clemens. Ichiro Suzuki had an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki, last year's MVP, left the game at the start of the seventh
with a cut on his left knee. He ran into a fence in foul territory
when he attempted to catch Coomer's fly ball in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Tampa Bay 2--John Burkett pitched six scoreless innings
in his Red Sox debut at Fenway Park, and Manny Ramirez hit a two-run
homer to lead the victory over the Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Burkett (2-0) gave up three hits, struck out six and walked one in
his second start after beginning the year on the disabled list with a
shoulder injury. The 37-year-old right-hander signed an $11 million,
two-year contract in the off-season after going 12-12 with a 3.04 ERA
for Atlanta last year.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Chicago 4--Ramon Hernandez homered twice, and Terrence
Long hit a two-run shot as the Athletics defeated the White Sox at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Lidle (1-3) got off to a shaky start but worked through seven
innings, giving up two runs--one earned--on five hits. He matched his
career high with eight strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 7, Texas 4--Russell Branyan homered twice off Doug Davis
(2-2) at Arlington, Texas, as the Indians won for only the second
time in 11 games after a 10-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Vizquel also homered for the Indians, and Chuck Finley (2-2)
gave up two runs in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Minnesota 2--Robert Fick led off the bottom of the 10th
inning with a home run off Bob Wells (0-1) to win it for the Tigers
at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger pitcher Seth Greisinger made his first major league start
since Sept. 26, 1998, after missing most of the last three seasons
with elbow injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Greisinger gave up two runs, six hits and two walks in five
innings, striking out five.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Kansas City 5--Tony Batista had four RBIs, including
a tiebreaking two-run single off Jason Grimsley (1-1) in the Orioles'
five-run 10th inning at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Conine went four for five with two RBIs and Batista hit a
two-run homer for the Orioles. Buddy Groom (1-0) pitched 12/3 perfect
innings of relief for the victory.</TE>

<HD>Appier Chews Up Innings, Blue Jays</HD>
<DH>Angels: Veteran pitcher, acquired in Vaughn trade, takes
shutout into seventh, then gets help from bullpen in 4-0 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere on his beloved East Coast, Mo Vaughn struggles. A recently
mended broken bone is in his right hand and--odds are--a large
sandwich in his left.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Appier, meanwhile, is just eating up innings in Anaheim.
Certainly, that's food for thought.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' 4-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday had
to make them feel better about the $80 million they spent to sign
Vaughn. Sure, Vaughn was a fish out of water in his three seasons on
the West Coast, but he was ample trade bait to land Appier in Anaheim
during the off-season.</LD>
<TE>   There was no doubt which one would have won a popularity vote
among the 25,296 at Edison Field. Appier (2-1) went 62/3 shutout
innings, staying in command without looking overwhelming. Still, for
the few fans who might miss the rotund first baseman, Appier provided
a Vaughn-like number. Appier stranded five runners in scoring
position ... Blue Jay runners, though.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine and Troy Percival finished the shutout, Percival
striking out Raul Mondesi and Carlos Delgado on off-speed pitches
with the bases loaded to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a two-pitch pitcher, and you need to have two or you're going
to be in trouble out there, especially against those two guys,"
Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-collar Appier made the most of his repertoire in another
workmanlike performance. He has pitched into the seventh inning in
three of five starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Ape really had to work for that one," Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"He made some great pitches with runners in scoring position. That
was a great outing."</TE>
<TE>   One of many in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Appier has pitched at least 200 innings in eight of the last 11
seasons. He bounced back from arm surgery in 1998 to win 42 games in
the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He was in typical form Friday. His fastball rarely broke 90 mph,
but he did strike out five batters. He gave up loud doubles to Dave
Berg, Eric Hinske and Vernon Wells, but worked out of each jam.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit the ball off me better than the score reflects," Appier
said. "I did make some big pitches with runners in scoring position.
I also got away with some atom balls."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia hopes his younger pitchers were taking notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Having him out there every fifth day is something a lot of our
pitchers can feed off," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Appier was therapeutic for all the Angels, who had been put in
their place--a distant third--by AL West opponents the last three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were 17-41 against Seattle, Oakland and Texas last
season. That pattern has continued this season. They were 6-12 during
an 18-game stretch against West teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team is not intimidated in any aspect of any club we play,"
Scioscia said. "I have no questions at all about the confidence level
of this club, the self-esteem, the feeling that they can win."</TE>
<TE>   Still ...</TE>
<TE>   "It will be nice to see some different uniforms out there," Tim
Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays' attire was easy on Angel eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia stuck with his mini-three lineup, with David Eckstein,
Adam Kennedy and Orlando Palmeiro at the top of the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   They set up things in the first inning. Eckstein was hit by a
pitch, Kennedy sacrificed him to second and Palmeiro bunted for a
base hit. Without hitting the ball more than 80 feet, the Angels had
runners on first and third.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson singled to score Eckstein, his ninth RBI in the
last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus, who solved his vision problem last week with new
contact lenses after a visit to the same Bay Area eye doctor who
helped Mark McGwire, sliced a double into the right-field corner.
Palmeiro and Anderson scored. One out later, Brad Fullmer flared a
single to right to score Glaus.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Erstad Says He's Close to Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster and Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a vigorous workout Friday, center fielder Darin Erstad said he
is confident that he will return to the Angel lineup within days.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad has been out since April 19, when he suffered a mild
concussion attempting to make a diving catch against Oakland. He was
examined by Dr. Craig Milhouse on Friday and then pushed himself
through a workout.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel a lot better than I did a couple days ago," said Erstad,
who returned to Anaheim after being injured. "I feel like I've slept
for five days, which basically I have.</LD>
<TE>   "I understand this is a little different than a little nick or
something. I'm not setting any dates and I'm not saying anything is
out of the question. I pushed myself pretty hard today and we'll see
how I come out of it. If I feel good tomorrow, it's going to get a
little tougher to say no."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Sunday remained a possibility for
Erstad's return to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a lot better shape right now than I envisioned he would
be," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad went through a light workout Thursday. On Friday, he took
early batting practice, ran the bases, worked out in the outfield,
hit some more and lifted weights.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything but running into a wall today," Erstad
said.</TE>
<TE>   That is something the Angels already know Erstad is ready to do.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad slammed face-first into the center field fence chasing a
fly ball against Texas on April 16. Three days later, he was taken to
the hospital after a chin-first dive in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like someone burst my bubble and I just wanted to go to
sleep," Erstad said. "My body felt like it was a piece of spaghetti,
all loosey-goosey."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's return will force Scioscia to make some lineup decisions.
Orlando Palmeiro hit .429 on the Angels' recent road trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Until everyone starts swinging the bat well, we'll look for ways
to keep hot bats in the lineup," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham businessman Donald Watkins has told associates he
believes Peter Ueberroth is bidding against him for the Angels,
several sources said, but the former baseball commissioner says his
investment group is not interested in buying the team at this time.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, he has no competition," Ueberroth said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Benji Gil, out since April 5 with a sprained left ankle,
said he is two or three weeks from being ready to play. He has been
unable to work out since the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working on putting weight on it," Gil said. "Hopefully
I'll be able to start running next week."</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Avengers opened the season with a 43-25 victory over
the New York Dragons at Staples Center. Offensive specialist Chris
Jackson had 12 catches for 145 yards and four touchdowns. In the last
three games against Arizona, Jackson has 31 catches for 383 yards and
11 touchdowns. Quarterback Tony Graziani came off the bench last
season in his Arena Football League debut to lead the Avengers to a
54-48 overtime victory over the Rattlers in Phoenix. Now the starter,
Graziani completed 23 of 39 for 273 yards and four touchdowns in last
week's victory over New York. Arizona opened the season with a 52-51
loss at San Jose. The Rattlers are led by 10-year veteran Hunkie
Cooper, who has more than 600 career receptions, but had only three
for 28 yards against San Jose. Quarterback Sherdrick Bonner of Azusa
High and Cal State Northridge was intercepted in the end zone with a
little more than a minute to play in the loss to San Jose, but
completed 17 of 36 passes for 223 yards and five touchdowns. Chris
Horn caught five passes for 73 yards to lead Arizona.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buddy Bell was fired as manager of the Colorado Rockies on Friday
with the team off to the worst start in club history.</LD>
<LD>   Clint Hurdle, the Rockies' hitting coach for the last six years,
replaced Bell.</LD>
<LD>   "I am disappointed that this has not worked out the way I wanted
it to," Bell said in a statement. "I wanted to see this thing
through."</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Dan O'Dowd said the change was not about assigning
blame but about trying to turn around the team's 6-16 start under
Bell.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honestly, we need to start playing the game with more joy
and more confidence than we've played already this year," O'Dowd
said. "We really need to start building some positive momentum. This
is about a new step forward."</TE>
<TE>   O'Dowd said Hurdle, 44, is the "manager of the Rockies--not
interim manager--for the remainder of the season. Clint brings
passion, he brings enthusiasm, he brings a charisma I think this
ballclub needs."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies have the worst record in the National League and the
second-worst record in the majors, ahead of Detroit, and are eight
games behind first-place Arizona in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Omar Vizquel uncorked some of those old stories about Albert
Belle's infamous bats and Belle isn't happy about it.</TE>
<TE>   In his new autobiography, "Omar! My Life On and Off The Field,"
Vizquel, the Indians' Gold Glove shortstop, reveals that Belle, his
Cleveland teammate from 1994-96, used corked bats.</TE>
<TE>   Belle, who lives in Arizona, went on Jim Rome's nationally
syndicated radio talk show on Thursday to counter Vizquel's claims
and insist that he was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I never used a corked bat," Belle said. " ... And if I was
using cork, don't you think I would have hit 60 or 70 homers in a
season? If all my bats were corked, how come they haven't surfaced? A
lot of my bats were lifted from my locker."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners are temporarily moving third starter Paul
Abbott to the bullpen and replacing him in the rotation with Ryan
Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, who won his first career start 1-0 Tuesday night against
the Angels, will take Abbott's starting assignment Tuesday in Chicago
against the White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott lasted only 22/3 innings and saw his earned-run average
climb to 10.97 in a 10-6 loss to the Angels on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas slugger Juan Gonzalez is still more than a week away from
being able to swing a bat.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger Manager Jerry Narron said that it would be another seven to
10 days before Gonzalez, who has torn muscle fiber between the thumb
and index finger on his right hand, would be able to resume batting
practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics activated outfielder Jermaine Dye from the
15-day disabled list and optioned infielder Mark Ellis to triple-A
Sacramento. Dye was in the lineup as the A's right fielder for the
first time this season for Friday night's game against the Chicago
White Sox.... The San Diego Padres put right-hander Kevin Jarvis and
outfielder Ron Gant on the 15-day disabled list. Jarvis, put on the
DL retroactive to April 18, has a strain in his right elbow. The move
with Gant, who has a fractured right pinky, is retroactive to April
24.... The Detroit Tigers put first baseman Dmitri Young, who has a
hernia, on the disabled list and activated pitcher Seth Greisinger
for the first time in over three years.</TE>

<LD>Now what?</LD>
<LD>   Trailing two games to none in their best-of-five opening-round
series against the Lakers, the Portland Trail Blazers face two
daunting tasks before the teams meet again Sunday in Game 3 at the
Rose Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, there are three items the Trail Blazers need to correct
and improve upon, but regaining their composure after drawing four
technicals and a flagrant foul in the second half of Game 2 is a
given.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to showing more maturity, Portland must prove to the
Lakers and the basketball world that it can shoot better than 40%. So
far in the series, the Trail Blazers have made only 62 of 162 shots
(38.3%).</TE>
<TE>   Above all else, the Trail Blazers must find an answer for Laker
center Shaquille O'Neal, who did as he pleased Thursday at Staples
Center, scoring 31 points and taking 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We really can't stop Shaq," guard Bonzi Wells said. "It's tough.
He's just too big. I mean the whole league can't stop this guy. He's
just dominant right now. Then you have guys like Kobe [Bryant] and
Rick Fox and Derek Fisher, who play off him very well. It's tough to
beat them. They're a good team."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if the Trail Blazers didn't try to muzzle O'Neal in
Game 2, but they took it to extremes and were penalized. Guard Ruben
Patterson was assessed a flagrant foul late in the game against
O'Neal, but insisted it wasn't all that bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even hurt that old monster," Patterson said. "That
ain't hurting him and he knows I ain't hurting him. I barely hit
him.... It's the playoffs. It's basketball. He's a big old monster.
You don't have to call a flagrant foul for him like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers aren't getting much offense in the series from
their poor-shooting guards. Wells has made seven of 23 shots and
Damon Stoudamire is two for 15. Patterson, the self-proclaimed
Kobe-stopper, is five for 15.</TE>
<TE>   If not for Derek Anderson, the Trail Blazers' backcourt would be
almost useless to them. Anderson has made 10 of 18 shots, including
eight of 14 in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and Fisher, the Lakers' starting guards, have outscored
Portland's top four backcourt players, 83-71.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. crowds aren't known for getting on the opposition's nerves,
but the Game 2 crowd Thursday had Patterson talking afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It don't mean nothing to me," he said. "They can boo me and say
what they want to say. That don't bother me. I don't care. I know
they [the Lakers] are going to get the same treatment when they come
to our place Sunday. I want the fans to do the same thing to Kobe or
Shaq or whoever touches the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only six teams in NBA history have rebounded from an 0-2 deficit
to win a best-of-five series. The Dallas Mavericks were the most
recent team to accomplish the feat, rallying last season to defeat
the Utah Jazz.</TE>

<LD>GolfWorld magazine reports that media applications for the U.S. Open
were mailed out recently and the U.S. Golf Assn.--perhaps influenced
by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the proximity of Bethpage State
Park, where the tournament will be held, to New York City--is taking
unprecedented security steps.</LD>
<LD>   All media members planning to cover the national championship are
being asked to submit to a background check, including permitting the
USGA and "any authorized security agency" unfettered access to all
records concerning driving and criminal history.</LD>
<LD>   Just a guess, but the media "field" might be limited this year.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker playoff record for rebounds in a
game?</TE>
<TE>   Not amused: Running back Ricky Williams, whom the Miami Dolphins
acquired from the New Orleans Saints, once posed in a wedding dress
with tuxedo-clad Mike Ditka for the cover of ESPN The Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole 49er defense was on me about it one time, all game," he
recently told the Miami Herald. "None of it was clever, though. I
would have laughed right with them if it had at least been clever."</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Even
trash talk is judged on artistic merit."</TE>
<TE>   We're stuck with 'em: Patrick Hruby of the Washington Times on
some of the worst sports ideas ever:</TE>
<TE>   * "The prevent defense: a passive, gutless brand of football that
runs counter to the game's rock-'em, sock-'em nature and, more often
than not, prevents exactly nothing--save a round of ulcers for both
fans and the defensive staff of the team with the lead."</TE>
<TE>   * "Aluminum bats: a pinging pox on college baseball. Blessed with
plus-size sweet spots, aluminum bats have turned the sport into a
hit-happy burlesque, one in which the bottom of the order bats .350
and USC captured the 1998 College World Series by the football-like
score of 21-14."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1956, undefeated heavyweight boxing
champion Rocky Marciano retired. Marciano finished 49-0, with six
title defenses and 43 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1994, Scott Erickson, who had
given up the most hits in the majors the previous season, pitched
Minnesota's first no-hitter in 27 years as the Twins defeated
Milwaukee, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Oh no! Reader John Hughes to the San Francisco Chronicle on why
the Cleveland Browns cut running back Ben Gay: "He must have rubbed
Coach Butch Davis the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain, 33, against the Chicago Bulls on
April 4, 1971.</TE>
<TE>   And finally:  Bob Kravitz of the Indianapolis Star News is
apparently turned off by the Pacers' series with the New Jersey Nets:
"It was fun when it was Hicks versus Knicks. It was good, clean,
perpetually nasty fun, led by the legendary Reggie Miller-Spike Lee
debates.</TE>
<TE>   "The Knicks represented all big-city evils Hoosiers found so
repulsive, and the Pacers were the face of a dull backwater where
daylight-saving time continues to be a hot-button issue.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Pacers and New Jersey Nets? Hicks Versus Swamp Rats?"</TE>

<HD>King Dismisses Capriati From Fed Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-time Australian Open champion Jennifer Capriati was removed from
the U.S. Fed Cup team by captain Billie Jean King on the eve of its
match today against Austria for not agreeing to comply with team
rules.</LD>
<LD>   The unprecedented development not only leaves the U.S. without its
No. 1 player for the weekend competition at Charlotte, N.C., it also
forces the U.S. to forfeit Capriati's match against Evelyn Fauth
because Capriati's dismissal came after Friday's draw.</LD>
<LD>   The forfeit means that the only match the U.S. can win today is
Monica Seles versus Austria's Barbara Schwartz. Austria will be
awarded the other point.</LD>
<TE>   Tension had been simmering between the Capriati camp and King most
of the week. At practice Tuesday, Stefano Capriati, Jennifer's father
and coach, was told that it was a closed session and that he would
have to leave, according to Capriati's agent, Barbara Perry.</TE>
<TE>   The issue came to a head Friday after the draw and the teams' news
conferences. Despite hours of discussion and negotiation, the
differences remained unresolved. Capriati was dismissed, and the
family left Charlotte Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed Cup competition is comprised of team play, and our team's
rules apply to all players to ensure a team concept," King said. "We
are disappointed that Jennifer did not agree to comply with our
closed, team-only practice policy, and as a result was excused from
the team. We wish Jennifer the best of success in the upcoming
European swing and in defense of her French Open title."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati said she tried to stay within the framework of the team
rules. After practice Friday, she arranged for another session with
her coach and a hitting partner, and Capriati said she was told that
was against team rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly protested this directive, and consequently was
dismissed from the team before this practice even took place,"
Capriati said. "I never did practice and do not believe I did
anything to hurt the team. It is amazing to me that I am being
penalized so severely for simply wanting to prepare as best I can for
the Federation Cup and my other commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati's reaction came in a nine-paragraph statement issued by
her agent, Perry, and management company IMG.</TE>
<TE>   "It never occurred to me that little-known policies that
conflicted with my serious preparation for upcoming tour events would
result in this ending," Capriati said. "I feel a responsibility to my
career, to my sponsors and to my fans. This is detrimental to all of
those."</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy, who is scheduled to play doubles with
Raymond, is a likely candidate to play singles in Capriati's spot
Sunday.</TE>

<HD>It's a Near-Perfect 10</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Perez gives up only a bad-hop infield single in
the seventh and faces the minimum 27 hitters in Dodgers' 10-0 victory
over the Cubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Wrigley Field didn't bring its A game Friday. It was cold all right,
a frigid 43 degrees, and the winds were whipping at 15 mph, certainly
B-plus material for one of baseball's most inhospitable April climes.
But it's going to take a lot more to faze Dodger pitcher Odalis
Perez. Maybe a blizzard.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-year-old left-hander from the Dominican Republic warmed to
the conditions as he does to his pregame merengue music, coming
within one bad-hop single of a perfect game to lead the Dodgers to a
10-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs before 23,686.</LD>
<LD>   Perez faced the minimum 27 batters--Corey Patterson was erased on
a double play after his seventh-inning infield hit--and struck out
six, narrowly missing what would have been the 16th regular-season
perfect game in major league history and first since Yankee
right-hander David Cone's gem against Montreal on July 18, 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Perez threw 91 pitches, 62 for strikes, and had only two
three-ball counts, becoming the first Dodger pitcher to face the
minimum 27 batters since Tim Belcher accomplished the feat in a
one-hit, one-walk shutout of Pittsburgh on July 21, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to get a grip on the ball because it was so dry and
windy," said Perez, who is 3-1 with a 1.64 earned-run average in five
starts. "But nothing is going to bother me. Whether it's hot or cold,
you have to have the same approach."</TE>
<TE>   Perez breezed through six innings, striking out five of 18
batters, and the closest the Cubs came to a hit was Patterson's
fourth-inning popup, which caused confusion between first baseman
Eric Karros and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek before Grudzielanek
made the catch, and Sammy Sosa's low liner to first, which Karros
stabbed to end the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy Patterson opened the seventh with a grounder up the
middle. Shortstop Cesar Izturis was there, but the ball took a bad
hop into his chest. Izturis was able to cradle the ball, but his
throw was not in time to catch Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis ranged to the hole for Chris Stynes' ensuing grounder to
start a 6-4-3 double play, and Perez retired the next seven batters
for his second complete game in his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   "That was absolutely a phenomenal performance," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "He was one bad hop away from a perfect game. If that ball
doesn't take a funny bounce, Cesar makes the play. He did a
phenomenal job just to catch that ball."</TE>
<TE>   There was no hesitation from official scorer Don Friske, who
immediately ruled the play a hit, and there was no dispute in the
Dodger clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure a one-hit shutout won't disappoint [Perez], but you
would have liked to have seen a hard-hit line drive or grounder up
the middle," Tracy said. "But a hit is a hit. Patterson was probably
the only guy who would have beaten that out. It was scored
correctly."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Perez went on to retire the next eight batters after
Patterson's hit didn't make it any easier for Izturis. If not for
that bad hop, Perez would have become the second Dodger to throw a
perfect game, joining Sandy Koufax (Sept. 9, 1965 against the Cubs).</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to think that's all that separated him from a perfect
game," said Izturis, who had three hits, including a run-scoring
double in the Dodgers' six-run sixth. "It ticked me off because it
was a routine play, and the ball kicked off my shoulder. It was
tough."</TE>
<TE>   So is Perez. The Dodgers raved about Perez's stuff when they
acquired him with outfielder Brian Jordan from Atlanta for Gary
Sheffield in January, and Perez has masterfully mixed his fastball,
slider and changeup, but what has impressed them most is his
confidence and fearlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Perez didn't flinch when facing San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds
in his first two starts, brushing back baseball's home run king
several times, and he threw a complete game in the hitter's haven
that is Coors Field on April 15. As easy as it was to blow on his
hand between pitches Friday, he blew away the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   "He has that attitude, that swagger, and he's dominant right now,"
catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Everything he throws, he throws with
conviction. He has that I-don't-care attitude and the stuff to back
it up."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said Perez has been buoyed by the confidence the Dodgers
have shown in him. In Atlanta, Perez shuttled between the rotation
and bullpen, often getting demoted after a subpar start.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're pitching behind Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, it's
easy to get overshadowed," Jordan said. "He's a young guy, and he was
always looking over his shoulder in Atlanta. I knew if he just got
the ball every fifth day, he'd relax and show what he can do."</TE>
<TE>   Now look at him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's more aggressive; he's not afraid to throw inside and take
control out there," Jordan said. "He's just having fun. He plays his
Latin music before the game, he's relaxed. You don't even realize
that it's his day to pitch."</TE>

Odalis Perez faced the
minimum 27 batters in the
Dodgers' 10-0 victory over
the Chicago Cubs on Friday,
but he had to settle for a
one-hitter. Here are the
seven Los Angeles Dodgers who
have thrown no-hitters:
4                               Sandy Koufax (1962, 1963, 1964, 1965*)
1                               Bill Singer (1970)
                                Jerry Reuss (1980)
                                Fernando Valenzuela (1990)
                                Kevin Gross (1992)
                                Ramon Martinez (1995)
                                Hideo Nomo (1996)

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Perez Is Making a Good Deal Better</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>When Dodger General Manager Dan Evans began talking to Atlanta GM
John Schuerholz about trading Gary Sheffield for Brian Jordan and a
pitcher in January, the Braves kept pushing right-handers Kevin
Millwood and Jason Marquis.</LD>
<LD>   Don Welke, the Dodgers' senior scouting advisor, and Jeff Schugel,
a special assistant to the GM, kept pushing for left-hander Odalis
Perez, a 23-year-old from the Dominican Republic who showed promise
with several fine starts but was inconsistent, falling apart in
several others.</LD>
<LD>   When push came to shove, Evans listened to those closest to him.
Evans held out for Perez, acquiring the pitcher and Jordan for
Sheffield, a trade that was criticized by many who thought Jordan for
Sheffield, one of baseball's most feared right-handed sluggers, was
not a fair offensive exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan has been solid, hitting .289 with 10 runs batted in, but if
Perez keeps pitching as he has, he's going to make Jordan look like a
throw-in to the deal. Perez was dominant Friday, throwing a one-hit
shutout in a 10-0 victory over the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy for Welke and Schugel because throughout the
thought process with the Braves, they continued to push for Perez,"
Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had seen him multiple times, and they helped me hold my
ground. I don't think we got the best of the deal; it was good for
both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Perez (3-1, 1.64 earned-run average) is not overpowering, but his
fastball had a little extra movement Friday. The Cubs had so much
trouble with Perez's slider and changeup, they rarely hit the ball
hard. Perez's control was so good, only two Cubs worked three-ball
counts.</TE>
<TE>   That made for an extremely relaxing and enjoyable day for Jim
Colborn, the Dodgers' pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a good pitching coach today," Colborn said. "When Odalis
came into the dugout, I patted him with my left hand and said,
'Thataboy.' When he went out to the mound, I patted him with my right
hand and said, 'Go get 'em.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perez's performance overshadowed the Dodgers' best offensive game
of the season so far, an afternoon in which they scored three runs in
the fifth inning and broke open the game with six runs in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff batter Dave Roberts reached base five times with a double
and four walks, and he scored three runs. No. 2 hitter Cesar Izturis
had three hits, including two doubles, and scored twice.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, who entered with a .220 average, smacked a two-run
single in the fifth and a run-scoring double in the sixth. Paul Lo
Duca and Eric Karros each had two hits, and Adrian Beltre had a
two-run double and a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perez's one-hitter Friday was the first complete game thrown
against the Cubs since then-St. Louis right-hander Pat Hentgen's in
September 2000.... It has been 37 years since a pitcher threw a
no-hitter against the Cubs. The last? Dodger left-hander Sandy
Koufax, who threw a perfect game against Chicago on Sept. 9, 1965.
The last no-hitter in Wrigley Field was by the Cubs' Milt Pappas in
1972.</TE>

Lawrence, Colorado's Shawn Chacon and Jason Jennings and former Cub
Ruben Quevedo. Ashby suffered losses in his last two starts, giving

<HD>Patriotism Aside, Jones Is Torn to Leave Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's see, play a string of early season games for your Major League
Soccer club, or go overseas to represent your country in the pinnacle
of the world's most popular sport, the World Cup?</LD>
<LD>   A no-brainer, right?</LD>
<LD>   While the club vs. country debate is anything but contentious,
players worry about leaving the clubs that pay their salaries to run
the pitch in their national colors.</LD>
<TE>   Just ask Cobi Jones, who will be playing his final game for the
Galaxy today against the Colorado Rapids before joining the United
States national team for training camp in Cary, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "It does leave you a little torn," said Jones, 31, the United
States' most-capped player (153), who will be making his third
consecutive trip to the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to stay with your club, not only because your club is
paying your wages ... but it's a situation where you want to keep
your starting position. It's a Catch-22.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to see your club do well. But if they do so well
without you, then it's like ... when you come back are they going to
throw you right back into the lineup, or are you going to have to sit
out on the side and work your way back into the position?"</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a member of the Galaxy since MLS' inception in 1996, is the
face of the organization and should harbor no worries about losing
his starting spot, though he has yet to score a goal this season.</TE>
<TE>   The drought is not a reflection on Jones, the Galaxy's all-time
leading scorer with 158 points and 54 goals. Only rookie forward
Carlos Ruiz has found the back of the net for the Galaxy thus far,
and he's leading the league in scoring with 12 points on six goals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the earliest Jones could be back to play for the Galaxy
would be June 22, meaning he will miss at least seven MLS games.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are things that the players have to deal with," Jones said,
"but it's more so a situation for the coach because a coach has to
decide--is the club on a roll without you there?</TE>
<TE>   "But a player obviously wants to go to the World Cup and showcase
yourself at the highest level. You want to see how you do against the
best players in the world, so you're not going to give up that
opportunity, so you go there and you do it. You take the chance, you
take the risk."</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said Jones has little to worry about in
terms of upsetting team officials.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have concerns about leaving," Schmid said. "You want
to be missed a little bit. He's our captain and he's going away but
we're going to try to hold the fort without him."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy went 6-2 while Jones was in France with the U.S. for
the 1998 World Cup.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Gold Rush, a day featuring California-breds and
Hollywood Park's answer to Oak Tree's California Cup, has brought out
the best in Spinelessjellyfish.</LD>
<LD>   Spinelessjellyfish, a son of Skywalker owned by a partnership that
includes breeder Cardiff Stud Farm and trained by Jenine Sahadi, is
perfect in the Gold Rush, which will be run for the third time
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Spinelessjellyfish, a 6-year-old, won the $175,000 Khaled Stakes
in a record 1:392/5 for the 11/16 miles on turf in 2000, then
followed with another victory in the same race last year.</LD>
<TE>   His victory in 1:403/5 12 months ago also provided regular jockey
Chris McCarron with his 7,000th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Native Desert, a 9-year-old who defeated Spinelessjellyfish by a
head in last fall's California Cup Mile, will make his 64th start and
will be trying for his sixth victory at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Native Desert was third in the Khaled in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron, who won two other stakes on the Gold Rush card last
year, has four other mounts Sunday. He has contender Super High in
the $200,000 Melair Stakes, Lady Evergreen in the $70,000 Lakeview
Thoroughbred Farms Stakes, Highly Suspect in the $250,000 Snow Chief
Stakes and maiden Mada Moon in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   The Snow Chief, named in honor of the California-bred who was the
champion 3-year-old of 1986 and a multiple-stakes winner for the
partnership of Carl Grinstead and Ben Rochelle and trainer Mel Stute,
is the day's richest race and it drew a field of 12 3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   If McCarron is to win the Snow Chief for a second consecutive
year--he scored in 2001 with Romanceishope--he'll do it with a
longshot. Highly Suspect, a gelded son of High Brite, has only a
maiden victory to his credit in six starts.</TE>
<TE>   The best of the other entrants is Gobi Dan, who will carry a top
weight of 117 pounds and will break from the rail under Delahoussaye.
A son of Huckster purchased for $4,000 last May at Barretts, he has
won three of nine starts for trainer Pat Gallagher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eurolink Raindance, the second longest shot in the field of five
at 9-1, outfinished favored Crazy Ensign by a head and won the
$106,600 Wilshire Handicap in the first Friday night card at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Giving McCarron his sixth victory in the race, more than any other
rider, the 5-year-old Alzao mare covered the mile on turf in 1:341/5.</TE>
<TE>   Eurolink Raindance, trained by Ben Cecil for the Bull Market
Stable, has won two in a row after losing 18 of her first 20 starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Michael Kinane will not be aboard Breeders' Cup Juvenile
winner Johannesburg in the Kentucky Derby after his suspension for
"irresponsible riding" during a recent race at Newmarket was upheld
Friday in London.</TE>

<HD>Brittain's Blueprint Remains Unused</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>In 1986, trainer Clive Brittain brought the English colt Bold
Arrangement to the U.S. and almost won the Kentucky Derby. In the
process, the canny Brittain drafted the perfect blueprint for
shipping a horse from overseas to the Kentucky Derby with a chance to
win.</LD>
<LD>   Yet no one in the ensuing years has thought to copy Brittain's
master plan.</LD>
<LD>   At this year's Santa Anita Derby, I asked Demi O'Byrne what he
thought of Brittain's tactics. O'Byrne, an Irish veterinarian and a
key advisor to Coolmore Stud and Michael Tabor, the owners of
Johannesburg, wasn't familiar with the Bold Arrangement story.</LD>
<TE>   "There aren't any races in England for 3-year-olds at this time of
year," O'Byrne said.</TE>
<TE>   The record is clear. Bold Arrangement ran nine times as a
2-year-old, a high number for a British horse, but appeared to be
nothing more than a sprinter. He won four times in his first seven
starts, never running a bad race but also never running farther than
seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in his eighth race, Bold Arrangement was stretched out to
a mile at Longchamp in Paris. He finished second, was disqualified to
fourth for interference and then in his last 2-year-old race, again
at a mile, he ran third back in England.</TE>
<TE>   With nine races in four months, Brittain had toughened up Bold
Arrangement for what was to come. This was a colt that was going into
1986 with a rock-solid foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Bold Arrangement didn't make his 3-year-old debut until mid-March.
Running against older horses, and making his first start in five
months, he beat only one rival in a four-horse, one-mile race at
Doncaster. At that point, Bold Arrangement had run all his races on
grass, but away from the track Brittain was working him hard on a
sandy training surface not unlike that at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Then in April 1986, Brittain sent Bold Arrangement to Lexington,
Ky., to run in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland--his first race on
dirt, his only race before the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Brittain had inquired about Laffit Pincay riding his horse at
Keeneland and in the Derby, but Pincay, reportedly for a mount fee of
$25,000, had already signed on to ride Groovy, a confirmed sprinter,
in the Derby. So Brittain stuck with Pat Eddery, the top European
jockey who had won with Bold Arrangement as a 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Bold Arrangement, who raced from far back, came from ninth place
at Keeneland to finish third, beaten by only three-quarters of a
length.</TE>
<TE>   Vanned the 70 miles from Keeneland to Churchill Downs, Bold
Arrangement was already virtually racing fit. All Brittain had to do
was maintain his conditioning level. Brittain breezed Bold
Arrangement once at Churchill, a three-furlong work that cleared his
lungs two days before the race. But Eddery, riding back in England,
got into trouble with the stewards and drew a seven-day suspension,
which would keep him out of the Derby. Most of the top jockeys were
taken, and Chris McCarron finally got the mount. McCarron, already a
Derby veteran, had ridden in the Derby five times, finishing second
with Desert Wine three years before.</TE>
<TE>   There were obvious betting choices in '86--Snow Chief, winner of
the Florida and Santa Anita derbies, and Badger Land, the Flamingo
winner, were the favorites--but Broad Brush, on a four-race winning
streak that included the Wood Memorial, was allowed to go off at
14-1, and Ferdinand, a distant third on a slick track in the Santa
Anita Derby, was a 17-1 overlay. Bold Arrangement was 9-1.</TE>
<TE>   After half a mile, Bold Arrangement was 11th, 22 lengths behind
Groovy's ridiculously quick :45 1/5 pace. There hadn't been a faster
opening four furlongs in Derby history. Ferdinand was last of 16
horses.</TE>
<TE>   At the quarter-pole, Groovy was backing up badly, and Broad Brush
took over the lead as the stretch run approached. Leaving the turn,
Ferdinand and Bill Shoemaker, moving toward the rail, were able to
squeeze through a hole that closed in an instant on Rampage and Pat
Day. Bold Arrangement edged ahead of Broad Brush, but Ferdinand
outran them all, beating Brittain's--and Britain's--horse by 21/4
lengths for the Sunshine Boys, the 54-year-old Shoemaker and his
trainer, 73-year-old Charlie Whittingham.</TE>
<TE>   Brittain wanted to stay for the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes,
but the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture had approved Bold Arrangement for
only two races. Back home in England, the veteran trainer was buoyed
by the fact that he had played his cards perfectly here, and had lost
only because Ferdinand and Shoemaker threaded a needle.</TE>
<TE>   No offense to trainer Aidan O'Brien, the wunderkind from County
Tipperary, but his Johannesburg, due in Kentucky on Tuesday, needed a
3-year-old prep race in this country. So did Castle Gandolfo,
O'Brien's other Derby contender, and Essence Of Dubai, another in the
wave of Derby horses from the Persian Gulf. Clive Brittain showed
them the way, 16 years ago. Why hasn't anyone followed his lead?</TE>

<LD>Seeking his sixth consecutive win in the Los Angeles Handicap in
1974, jockey Don Pierce had to settle for third with Soft Victory, a
6-year-old he had ridden to victory in the six-furlong race the
previous year.</LD>
<LD>   In today's $100,000 Hawthorne Handicap at Hollywood Park, Chris
McCarron will try to go one better than Pierce.</LD>
<LD>   A member of racing's hall of fame since 1989, McCarron has won the
Hawthorne, a Grade III run at 11/16 miles on the main track, five
times in a row and has an excellent chance to make it six.</LD>
<TE>   Looking to extend a streak that began with Twice The Vice in 1997
and continued with I Ain't Bluffing, Victory Stripes, Riboletta and
Printemps, McCarron will be aboard Ask Me No Secrets late this
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old daughter of Seattle Slew owned and bred by Earl
Shultz and trained by Dave Hofmans, Ask Me No Secrets will be looking
for her fourth win in six starts and her second graded stakes victory
in six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Sent on the road for the first time last month, Ask Me No Secrets
easily captured the Oaklawn Park Breeders' Cup in Arkansas, winning
by 41/2 lengths after leading from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Second in her only other race at Hollywood Park, she figures to
get her main opposition from Alexine, winner of last month's Santa
Lucia at Santa Anita, and Verruma.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The $250,000 San Francisco Breeders' Cup Mile at
Bay Meadows drew only four entrants, but all--Decarchy, The Tin Man,
Sarafan and Suances--have a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Victor Espinoza. The jockey won four races in the first
two days of the meet, including three on Thursday with Arabic Song,
Fin Entertainment and Aly's Fever.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Oscar Garcia and Ricardo Zamora. The trainers were a
combined 0 for 44 at Santa Anita, which concluded Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the seventh using Saphir
Indien, Greenhills and Natures Candy.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 1/3. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $5/$15. Total money bet: $32.</TE>

<HD>Kings Alive, Maybe Kicking</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Avalanche contends Johnson's overtime goal, which
went off his skate, should have been disallowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing against surfers, starlets or sunsets, but the Colorado
Avalanche would rather not be in Los Angeles today.</LD>
<LD>   Nor do the defending Stanley Cup champions believe they should be.</LD>
<LD>   They believe they should not have to play the Kings in Game 6 of
their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series today at Staples Center
because they believe the goal that won Game 5 at Denver on Thursday
night should not have counted.</LD>
<TE>   They believe that Craig Johnson, in violation of NHL rules, kicked
the puck past goaltender Patrick Roy 2 minutes 19 seconds into
overtime, giving the Kings a 1-0 victory and cutting the Avalanche
lead in the series to 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   And they are not alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The final score was a lie," wrote Denver Post columnist Mark
Kiszla, fervently echoing the Avalanche party line. "The Kings did
not beat the Avalanche....</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings cheated."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL rulebook says, "a goal cannot be scored by an attacking
player who uses a distinct kicking motion to propel the puck into the
net."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who had a Game 1 goal disallowed on a questionable call,
proclaimed his innocence, saying that he repositioned his right skate
slightly to redirect a pass from Jaroslav Modry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's how you interpret it, I guess," Johnson said Friday. "I saw
the puck coming and I just kind of turned my foot a little and tried
to get it to my stick. It wasn't a kicking motion. It was more of a
deflection....</TE>
<TE>   "The puck was coming pretty hard and I just tried to maybe get it
on [Roy's] pads and then get the rebound, and it just went in."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said much the same thing in the postgame excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Kiszla called him a liar.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings are stealing back home, laughing all the way, in
possession of a victory that should have been nullified," he wrote. "
... If the refs had guts or eyes, Johnson's goal should have been
disallowed.... What Johnson did was as subtle and as beautiful as
anything Pele ever did on a soccer field."</TE>
<TE>   To Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley, it was clear that Johnson's skate
"was going toward the net. And if that's not a kicking motion, I
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Said Roy, who had shut out the Kings for more than seven periods:
"The person who made the call missed something because there is no
way [Johnson] could score if he doesn't make a bit of a forward
motion [with his foot] in the direction of the net."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings saw it differently, of course, and replays seemed to
support their view, though the definition of a "distinct kicking
motion" is a little fuzzy.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson did not lift his skate, nor drag it across the ice.</TE>
<TE>   He rotated his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, a kicking motion is getting behind the puck, and what
happened with C.J., his skate blade was not behind the puck," King
Coach Andy Murray said Friday. "His skate was pretty well in front of
the puck when it came toward him.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, a kicking motion is when you go from behind the puck and
move forward on the puck. That's how I would look at it."</TE>
<TE>   To Murray, Johnson's goal was not even questionable.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt in my mind [it was a legal goal]," he said.
"Just the same way there's no doubt in Bob Hartley's mind that it was
kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the nature of it."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, however, Hartley seemed ready to let it go.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be fair to ourselves, we didn't get the job done," the
coach told reporters Friday in Colorado. "Obviously, we're
disappointed with last night's game, but we want to make sure that
we're positive. The important thing right now is to redeem
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   But the Avalanche, which squandered a 3-1 series lead against the
Kings last year before winning Game 7 at Denver, wanted to quell the
Kings, whose 1-0 defeat Tuesday in Game 4 was their only loss in
their last 13 home games.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings aren't going quietly. They played Thursday without
forwards Adam Deadmarsh and Cliff Ronning, sidelined because of
injuries, and in the first period lost defenseman Philippe Boucher,
struck in the right eye by a deflected shot. But Felix Potvin has
given up only one goal in more than 176 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher won't play today and Deadmarsh, who suffered a strained
neck in Game 4, is doubtful. But Ronning is expected to return after
sitting out two games because of concussion-like symptoms, replacing
rookie Jaroslav Bednar.</TE>
<TE>   "I know no one in that [Avalanche] locker room wanted to get on
that plane," King defenseman Aaron Miller said late Thursday night,
"so now we have a chance to get them at home. We don't have anything
to lose now. They're the defending Stanley Cup champions, and we're
trying to knock them off."</TE>
<TE>   By hook or by crook, the defending champions might say.</TE>

<HD>Nothing Is Guaranteed for Murray</HD>

<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By almost any definition but his own, King Coach Andy Murray
guaranteed a victory over the Colorado Avalanche in today's game at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Before the Kings departed for Game 5 of the first-round Stanley
Cup playoff series Thursday at Denver, Murray wrote on a grease board
in the dressing room at the team's practice facility, "Win Thursday
and we will be playing Game 7 Monday."</LD>
<LD>   Sounds like a guarantee of victory in today's Game 6, right?</LD>
<TE>   Murray said no.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't use those terms," he said Friday, a day after the Kings
had cut the Avalanche lead in the series to 3-2 with a 1-0 victory in
Game 5. "In those exact terms, I didn't say that.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I believe if you get to Game 6 it will go to [Game] 7, but
I didn't use the word 'guarantee.' In this sport, unfortunately,
there isn't any guarantee. If we could just guarantee that the other
teams wouldn't play good, it would make my job a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will again be without some key players today. Winger
Cliff Ronning is expected to return to the lineup, but defenseman
Philippe Boucher won't play and winger Adam Deadmarsh is doubtful,
Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody asked me if I felt we were short-handed now," the coach
said. "I don't because the rules say you can dress 20 players, and
we'll have 20 players in the lineup. So, we don't feel short-handed,
and we don't feel sorry for ourselves because nobody else will."</TE>
<TE>   There's no other way to look at it, captain Mattias Norstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise, you're looking for a way out, an excuse," he said. "We
have guys all year long that stepped into positions when we had
injuries. Same last night. You take three guys out of our lineup who
play a lot of minutes and still we battled Colorado as hard as we've
done in any game in this series."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski, on the Kings' approach to overtime Thursday
night: "We just realized that it's in their minds, 'Well, here we go
again. It's going to be a long battle.' You could just see it in
their eyes. We were wearing on them." ... Avalanche Coach Bob
Hartley, on the status of winger Milan Hejduk, who could return to
the lineup any day: "He feels much better. We're going to wait and
see. The medical staff is working with him every day." Hejduk, out
since Feb. 28 because of an abdominal strain, reportedly skated hard
Friday in practice.</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal made a flashy pass to Devean George that led to a
dunk on Thursday night, then looked into the stands at Staples
Center, found a familiar face, pointed and laughed.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the chief of police in Baton Rouge," O'Neal said. "His name
is Bud. He's going to help me run for sheriff when I come down,
hopefully."</LD>
<LD>   Bud, apparently, is big on assists.</LD>
<TE>   "Because when I was at LSU, he was a big supporter of mine,"
O'Neal said, "and I used to do that at LSU. It was just bringing back
memories."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who often wears a law enforcement badge on a chain beneath
his shirt, hopes to become a sheriff when he retires from basketball.</TE>

<TE>   The Lakers had a light day Friday. Today's schedule includes a
midday practice and flight to Portland for Sunday's Game 3.
Regardless of the outcome, they will return to Los Angeles after the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the mood was cheery, and it appeared something in
Friday's film had the Lakers amused. By the time they reached the
court, a few Lakers were impersonating Dale Davis' gruff
third-quarter departure, his shoulders rolled forward, chest sucked
in, jaw jutted.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox nailed the Davis look with his shirt off and shorts
dropped to plumber's depth, to hysterical laughter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant has had an odd two games against the Trail Blazers,
playing well but not shooting well.</TE>
<TE>   He has made only 15 of 49 field-goal attempts, and nine of 42
(28.1%) since starting the series with six field goals in seven
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he has been a tough, active defender, leading the team in
steals, and has found open teammates on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had good ball movement to people, he's getting a lot of
things done right," Coach Phil Jackson said Friday. "He's fine. But I
know he's determined to play a good game on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As strong as O'Neal was in Games 1 and 2, Jackson said he's hoping
for more.</TE>
<TE>   "He was active to get the ball on the boards," he said. "I thought
he was more active on the offensive zone. I want him--I need him--to
run the court better. We need him to get back on defense a little bit
quicker and stay active at the defensive end and help."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his last 11 games, O'Neal has made 69% of his free-throw
attempts. The Lakers, the worst free-throw shooting team in the
league during the regular season, have made 53 of 68 free throws, or
78%, in the first two postseason games.... The Lakers have won 17
consecutive games at Staples Center. They've lost eight of 12 on the
road.... Derek Fisher was nine for 10 from the free-throw line in
Game 2, both career highs.... The Trail Blazers have shot 38.3%
despite vast improvement from Scottie Pippen. He shot 26.8% in four
regular-season games against the Lakers and has made 12 of 24
attempts in two playoff games. Damon Stoudamire is two for 15.</TE>

<HD>Now, Even Hacks Don't Get to Shaq</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Laker center feeling good all over, and he's
not going to settle for only two titles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It occurred to Shaquille O'Neal the other day that he used to wonder
if he'd ever win.</LD>
<LD>   That was back before the tears. Before Phil Jackson. Before his
friendship with the headstrong kid from Philly.</LD>
<LD>   Standing on a shiny gym floor on a gray day in El Segundo on
Friday, O'Neal said the thought led him to a greater appreciation of
these past two years, of the two championship seasons that passed so
quickly and what they'd done for him.</LD>
<TE>   You get the sense it is a good time to be Shaquille O'Neal again.
His game is ferocious and the Lakers are up two games on the Portland
Trail Blazers in a best-of-five series and his toe isn't quite as
bothersome, which has allowed him to get off the Indocin occasionally
so he can eat and sleep normally. Many nights, his children watch him
from cushy seats at Staples Center, directly across from the Laker
bench, from their Shaq daddy, and he smiles sweetly to them when he
thinks no one is watching.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, in a violent game played between personal fouls
and technical fouls and flagrant fouls, he was hacked viciously by a
player with everything to gain by it, and he grinned. He flexed his
left hand to get the sting out, and he went to the free-throw line,
and he made both, even as Ruben Patterson summoned just enough
courage to glare at him.</TE>
<TE>   So pleased, O'Neal dabbed at his temples with his fingers, curled
daintily, as if deeply--and comically--in love with himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really worried about what other teams, other
organizations are doing, and what they're taught to do," he said.
"It's not time for me to lose focus. That would have been an easy
play to retaliate on. But it's the playoffs. I just have to let it
go. I think I sent the message when I stepped up to the line and hit
both free throws--swish, swish."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd chuckled, and so did the Lakers, and O'Neal seductively
flapped his eyelashes at them all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about marketing," he said. "I'm just out there having
fun and trying not to worry about all that other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 28 points, 11.5 rebounds and two blocks in the two
victories over the Trail Blazers. Game 3 is Sunday in Portland. He
moved easily beneath the basket on both ends and is beginning to run
the floor better, including a left-handed dunk to finish a fastbreak
in Game 2. He has made 12 of 19 free throws, becoming so sure of
himself that he's actually stared quizzically at a few he has made.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because the ball is not supposed to hit the rim," O'Neal
said. "I'm upset at the rim when the ball hits the rim, so I'm
looking at the rim, like, '[Darn] it, rim, move out the way.'"</TE>
<TE>   It is his time of year, his time of life.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting back reflecting on when I didn't have any," he said
of championships. "I was saying to myself, 'Just try to get one.' Now
that I have two, I'm focusing on getting No. 3. So, really no
pressure on us. We're just trying to do something for the city, for
the organization, for Phil, for myself."</TE>
<TE>   He was told that it is funny how things work out, how none can
become two in the flutter of his eyelash, and how quickly the strain
of the climb becomes the nerve of the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it that much," he said. "I promised
myself I wouldn't think about it until I hold a press conference and
say I'm not going to play anymore. Then we all can look back and say,
'He did this,' or, 'He did that.' But I'm not satisfied with two. I
won't be satisfied with three."</TE>
<TE>   What would it take to appease him?</TE>
<TE>   "Six."</TE>
<TE>   In a row?</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-uh. Not in a row. The league probably wouldn't like that.
They'd try to break us up."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed, something he does a lot more of now, even in the
tangle of blows brought by the Trail Blazers. A few months ago,
similar beatings brought anger and a punch that whooshed close to one
of those life-jarring moments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concentrating on what they do," O'Neal said. "I'm
concentrating on getting one more of those [trophies]. I'm in my own
type of focus right now. I'm not listening to nobody, I'm not looking
at nobody. I'm just listening to Phil and looking at my teammates,

my game back a little bit so the young fella could try to get MVP. A
couple games I have been slow. But if there's ever a game that I'm
slow, I don't want you to make excuses for me. If I have a crappy
game, I'm not going to say my toe was hurting. So I don't want you to
say my toe was hurting. So, a couple games I haven't been feeling
well, but we're still good enough to do what we do."</TE>

<LD>Dear Commissioner Stern,</LD>
<LD>   Please don't increase the first round of the NBA playoffs to seven
games next year. Everyone knows that the playoffs don't really start
until the second round anyway. If you check your history, you will
see the favored team almost always wins the series, usually by a
sweep, and usually with lopsided victories.</LD>
<LD>   Spare us the boring games. Making the first round a seven-game
series will not only show how greedy you are, but will only prolong
the inevitable ousting of the weak teams who barely made the playoffs
anyway. A five-game series is enough to show us who is the better
team.</LD>
<TE>   Leave well enough alone. And don't make Shaq mad.</TE>

<LD>The Dodger four-game winning streak and six-game home win streak was
broken Sunday by the Padres and by Dodger Manager Jim Tracy.</LD>
<LD>   I understand when Tracy rests players once in a while, but to sit
down four of the regulars in the middle of a winning streak is
unheard of. The 48,000 fans should have asked for their money back.
If Tracy continues this pattern, fans will be calling the stadium to
see who is in the starting lineup before they come to the game and
the Dodgers will have plenty of time to rest during the playoffs.</LD>

<TE>   I am sure the Dodger front office got real confused in the
off-season, and simply got rid of the wrong Terry. How else can you
explain the presence of Terry Mulholland on the roster, and the
departure of Terry Adams? He couldn't get anyone out last year. What
misguided evaluation process returns him to the mound this year?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see now, seven innings, and seven home runs surrendered.
It's as scary and weird as a David Lynch movie. His new moniker
should be "Blue Velvet."</TE>

<LD>The L.A. Times proudly boasts that handicapper Bob Mieszerski led all
public handicappers during Santa Anita's meet with 233 winners. But
what you forgot to mention is that if you bet on all of Bob's
winners, you would have lost money. Even in Bob's Insider Trading
section, he finished with a flat loss over the season.</LD>
<LD>   Now, I know that Bob does not have the luxury of making his daily
selections at post time because of your newspaper deadlines. But the
bottom line in horse racing is not to pick the most winners, but show
a flat profit. Many of Bob's selections are the favorites and
everybody knows that you can not make money betting on favorites.</LD>

<TE>   When King fans consistently boo Rob Blake, it shows nothing more
than how little class they have, as well as what they know about the
game. Who could question Rob's desire to leave, win the Cup, and
achieve the compensation he deserves? In Colorado, Adam Deadmarsh is
consistently cheered for being a class player, and the contributions
he made to the Avalanche. Hockey in L.A. is a joke, but what do you
expect from a city that can't even support an NFL team, even when
they're in bed with Al Davis.</TE>

<LD>Do I have this right?</LD>
<LD>   If a high school player declares for the NBA draft and goes
undrafted, he cannot enter the draft again. He can then go back to
school, play for a few years and, if good enough, entertain offers as
an unrestricted free agent. If he is drafted, say in the low second
round and does not wish to sign, he can attend school with the
drafting team retaining his rights until one year after he has
withdrawn from college. If he improves, he can drop out of school,
wait a year and re-enter the draft, hoping to go in the first round.
He can also approach the drafting team after one or more successful
college seasons, and/or a growth spurt, and let them know that he
will not sit out a year after withdrawing from college, and live on
the sneaker money he has already been offered, if they pay him
first-round money.</LD>
<LD>   What is the downside, other than sitting out a year, for any (or
all) high school players declaring for the draft?</LD>

enough to do this. Mike Scioscia is a good manager and it would be
too bad if he had to prove that with another team.</TE>
<TE>   His analysis of Tuesday night's 1-0 loss to the Mariners was
exactly right and shows that he wasn't outmanaged as much as the
Angels were outplayed. There are two problems (at least): the hitting
and specifically the very large absence of Tim Salmon and Darin
Erstad and the fact that the Angels are stuck behind two of the very
best teams in all the majors, the Mariners and the Athletics.
Scioscia is right not to panic but to stay the course. I hope Disney
can show the same wisdom.</TE>

<LD>I am very disappointed in the lack of research upon your part on the
April 21 Little 500 article by Diane Pucin. You offered very little
chance for the Indiana University Student Foundation to present its
case, especially from IUSF director Jonathan Purvis. Of course, if
you did do your research, you would realize that IUSF did not
challenge the arbitration panel's decision.</LD>
<LD>   I urge you to issue an article stating the other side of the
situation with Team Major Taylor. The fact that this was a
professional team that entered an amateur event. The fact that Josh
Weir lied to many university officials to participate in this event.
And the fact that you failed to offer the readers of the L.A. Times
an unbiased presentation of these facts.</LD>
<LD>   Would UCLA fans have been upset if Missouri's Kareem Rush had been
a current NBA star who had come back to Mizzou to play against UCLA
in the Sweet 16 matchup?</LD>

<TE>   Ms. Pucin: How difficult would it have been for you to accurately
describe the movie "Breaking Away" in your April 21 article? You said
it was about the Cutters (correct), a team of locals (correct) who
loved bike racing (wrong) and attended IU (wrong) while living at
home (wrong) because they couldn't afford to live on campus (wrong).
This movie is available for rent in every Blockbuster store, so it
would have been easy for you to have watched the film instead of just
making something up for your story. I now assume the rest of your
story has other fabrications in it.</TE>
<TE>   You've always struck me as someone who writes sports articles but
knows little about sports. At least the Times movie reviewers can
rest easy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last weekend, Fresno State quarterback David Carr was selected by the
expansion Houston Texans as the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft.
Overnight, this young man has become an instant role model to many
youngsters across the nation. Carr's achievement does the entire
California State University system proud, but not only because he's a
singular talent on the football field. Carr, a senior majoring in
philosophy, is also regarded by his professors as an outstanding
student.</LD>
<LD>   Even more important, his entire Fresno State team is part of an
innovative teaching initiative that is helping to demonstrate that it
is indeed possible to have both a nationally ranked football program
and one in which the players routinely cross the graduation goal
line. Brought to Fresno State in 1997 by associate football coach
John Baxter, the copyrighted Academic Gameplan is a year-round study
skills program that has tremendously improved the football team's
academic performance. The program has been so successful that it has
been profiled in Sports Illustrated and ordered by more than 120
junior highs, high schools and colleges around the country, including
Arizona State and Oregon.</LD>
<TE>   The Fresno State football team's prowess off the field wasn't
always this good. A few years ago, many would have shrugged off the
Bulldogs' poor academic showing as the inevitable byproduct of
success on the gridiron. Instead, Fresno State is showing that with a
campus leadership that is committed to academic excellence and some
creative approaches, seemingly intractable problems can be remedied.</TE>

<LD>Jockey Joe Badilla, Jr. was aboard Mini Rock and Corona Perfection
when those 3-year-old fillies each won a trial for the $161,700 La
Primera Del Ano Derby two weeks ago at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   He will ride Mini Rock in the Derby this evening. A
California-bred daughter of Chicks Beduino owned by Jay Parsons and
trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, Mini Rock was the fastest qualifier
for the La Primera Del Ano, winning by a half-length in 19.99 seconds
for 400 yards.</LD>
<LD>   It was her fourth win in 10 starts and she will break from the
outside in the field of 10 in the Grade II Derby, the ninth of 10
races on the card.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Vinewood Farms and trained by R C Howell, Corona
Perfection won her heat in 20.01 seconds, edging Babe On The Beach by
a nose. It was the Oklahoma bred's third win in seven races and she
will be ridden for the first time by Jacky Martin.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the top qualifiers and Babe On The Beach, the field
is completed by Hollywood La Jolla, Toogoodtobeforgoten, Best To Be
First, She Reigns, Sport Report, Miss Kipty Yawl and Sister Ta.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. BW Rare Lil Goddess. 2. Rubin's Pride. 3. Daring
Dame. 4. Got No Whoa. 5. White Rule. 6. Heza Quick Dash. 7. BDR Bug
On The Dash. 8. Come On Dasher. 9. Mini Rock. 10. Rebel Eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the seventh, let's use BDR Bug On The Dash, Daves Best
Man and Belle Of Tara, Come On Dasher and Proudest Slugger in the
eighth, single Mini Rock in the ninth and A Big Shot Of Brandy,
Classic Royal Secret and Rebel Eyes in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: It's Sinful is dropped in class, gets Lasix and

<LD>Someone forgot to tell Rodrigo Aceves that Harley Man was a 45-1 shot
Friday night at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the odds, Aceves rode Harley Man to victory in the
$156,800 El Primero Del Ano Derby.</LD>
<LD>   The California-bred gelding broke well and led throughout,
finishing the 400-yard race in 19.71seconds for his fourth win in 17
starts.</LD>
<TE>   Harley Man earned $65,856.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was watching, I didn't believe that was my horse," trainer
Adan Farias said, "but at about the 300-yard mark, I started
believing, and I was so excited. Usually Check Him Out will catch him
at the wire, but not tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Check Him Out, the third-place finisher, was the 3-5 favorite, but
the colt was nervous in the gate and broke slowly. By the time jockey
Mike Smith, a last-minute replacement for Jacky Martin, got Check Him
Out rolling, he had too much ground to gain on Harley Man and
second-place finisher Don't Dink With Me.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Hornish Jr. is the defending Indy Racing League champion and its
current leader. Helio Castroneves is the defending Indianapolis 500
champion who scales fences after his victories and trails Hornish by
nine points in the standings.</LD>
<LD>   But the rivalry in their day jobs takes a back seat this afternoon
in the True Value International Race of Champions. They say they
won't be racing against each other as much as against everyone else.</LD>
<LD>   "First thing I'll do is see who won," Hornish said. "The next
thing I'll look for is to see where Tony Stewart finished."</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, second in the Winston Cup series last season, has made a
habit in recent years of competing in the Indianapolis 500 and
Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. The 1997 IRL champion, Stewart was
second last season in the Winston Cup standings, and in 1995 he won
midget, sprint and Silver Crown titles. Everyone knows Stewart can
drive, and he won the first IROC race of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When we come here, it's just driver vs. driver," Hornish said.
"It was such a good feeling to finish second at Daytona, I was so
happy because I started last. I'm not just racing [11] ordinary guys.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough series."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the field are Kevin Harvick, Jack Sprague and Danny
Lasoski, the 2001 champions respectively in the Busch, Craftsman
Truck and World of Outlaws series.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second of four races featuring 12 drivers in
identically prepared Pontiac Firebirds. IRL drivers did exceptionally
well in the opener at Daytona, with Hornish finishing second, Scott
Sharp third and Al Unser Jr. fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Sprague, now driving in the Busch series, was fourth. Others in
the field are Winston Cup drivers Bobby Labonte, Sterling Marlin and
Dale Jarrett, and IRL drivers Buddy Lazier and Scott Sharp.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves, a Brazilian, is looking for redemption. He starts on
the front row alongside Jarrett, the 1999 Winston Cup champion,
because the cars are placed on the grid based on inverted standings.
Castroneves finished 11th among 12 drivers at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that we don't have an IRL type of IROC--this is not
my territory," Castroneves said of driving a stock car. "It would be
great to win a race, especially here in California. I want to climb
the fence real bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying for today's NASCAR Busch Series Auto Club 300 was
rained out, so the grid positions were determined by owner points.
Sprague will start first, Jason Keller second, Jeff Green third and
Randy LaJoie fourth.</TE>
<TE>   It was a blessing for Sprague, Keller and LaJoie. The fastest
among the three was Keller, who was only 14th fastest in the Friday
morning practice.</TE>
<TE>   Sprague, a three-time Craftsman Truck champion, was 17th on the
two-mile oval, and LaJoie 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Green's Chevrolet was fastest in practice before the scheduled
qualifying at 183.052 mph, just ahead of Jeff Burton's Ford. The top
three practice times in the late practice session belonged to Bobby
Hamilton Jr. (180.569 mph), who starts eighth; Greg Biffle, who
starts seventh; and Stacy Compton, who starts 10th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All 92,000 reserved grandstand tickets for Sunday's Winston Cup
race are sold out, but tickets remain for today's Winston West, Busch
Grand National and IROC series races. It is the sixth consecutive
sellout at the speedway for a Winston Cup race.</TE>

<DH>Motor racing: Rookie Newman breaks Fontana track record and
wins pole for Winston Cup race.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>R&amp;R--rest and recreation?</LD>
<LD>   You could have made a half-baked case for "rest" Friday at
California Speedway, since afternoon showers delayed qualifying for
Sunday's NAPA Auto Parts 500.</LD>
<LD>   But on a chilly day with gusting winds making for changing track
conditions, recreation was scarce. It was all business, once the
Winston Cup stock car crowd got down to business, and R&amp;R stood for
rookies and records.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Skinner's 2-year-old track record of 186.061 mph took a
beating, most impressively by Ryan Newman, the newest protege in a
long list of racing proteges presented by Roger Penske.</TE>
<TE>   Newman, teammate of Rusty Wallace, the defending race champion,
qualified his Ford Taurus at 187.432 mph, knocking rookie Chevy
driver Jimmie Johnson of El Cajon off the pole, then withstanding
serious challenges by another young gun and the older hands.</TE>
<TE>   When it was finally over, with darkness approaching--actually, it
had been fairly dark all afternoon--Ford drivers were the brightest
lights. Newman, 24, was on the pole; Kurt Busch, 23 and in his second
season, was on the outside of the first row at 187.412 in another
Ford, and former series champion Dale Jarrett, a graybeard of 45, was
third fastest at 186.853 in still another Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to have performance here," said Newman, who drove only
eight Winston Cup races last season but sat on the pole for one
prestigious event, the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, N.C. "It's
horsepower, it's car, it's downforce, and these weather conditions
just maximize everything--the track grip, the tire grip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wild, going out there at those speeds. Sometimes you go into
the corner a little bit faster than you think you are because of the
wind. We gained over a second from practice and you ask [yourself],
'What do you expect?' So you have to kind of figure out what you
expect and kind of predict the future and it's hard to do in a race
car."</TE>
<TE>   The cool temperatures stimulated other engines as well and
altogether, the first five qualifiers beat the old record. But the
shootout was between the rookies, Johnson and Newman.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had the first shot and made the most of it, qualifying his
Rick Hendrick/Jeff Gordon Chevy at the then-record speed of 186.620
and bumping fellow Chevy drivers Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt
Jr. down a peg.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was sitting on pit road, waiting my turn, I was blown away
by how fast everyone was going," he said. "It's just amazing what the
cold temperature was doing and how much a little bit of speed around
the racetrack will equal up to on the track."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the pole sitter at Daytona in February and again last
Sunday at Talladega, held the top spot through five challenges, then
along came Newman, who posted his record speed on the first of his
two qualifying laps over the two-mile track, and had an inkling it
was coming as he finished his warmup lap.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized it as soon as I rolled through [turns] 3 and 4 coming
to the green flag," he said. "When the car feels that good, you can
push it hard and have the confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Newman said he had been well aware of Johnson's speed and took
particular pleasure in knocking his fellow rookie off the pole.</TE>
<TE>   "I do pay attention to Jimmie because we're both in the running
for rookie of the year and it's important to know who your
competition is," he said. "I don't treat him any different on race
day but at the same time, we are running a little race of our own."</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, barring a drastic weather change, his car would be
as strong Sunday as it was Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Aerodynamics and horsepower are so important here, and those
things don't usually change here from Friday to Sunday. We've got a
good vehicle package for this track. At some other tracks, that's not
as important as it is here."</TE>
<TE>   Busch was going out as Newman was coming in and nearly claimed the
pole for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good lap and we came up a little bit
shy--four-thousandths of a second," he said. "There's not really much
you can do to determine what the difference between that was. I may
have let the car drift up a little bit too high coming off the
corners ... so it may have affected the overall lap."</TE>
<TE>   Among those impressed with the young speed demons was Jarrett, who
didn't do badly himself.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got great race cars and they know what to do with them,"
he said. "We know they can go fast, but I wanted to show them that we
can still do it too, whenever it comes down to it."</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett's qualifying got him a great starting spot in Sunday's
race, but to get it, he had to give up something he'd wanted to do.
He'd been scheduled to throw out the first pitch Friday night at the
Angels' game against Toronto but the rain delay scuttled that.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart qualified eighth in the fastest Pontiac, and Casey
Atwood was 12th in the fastest Dodge.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, defending race winner, qualified outside in the fifth
row, and Jeff Gordon, defending series champion, qualified 17th and
will start inside Row 9. Shawna Robinson, the only woman who tried to
qualify, didn't make the race on her car's speed but will start last
in her Dodge, thanks to a provisional entry based on car owner
standings.</TE>

<HD>It's Kittles Time as Nets Hold On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>New Jersey's Kerry Kittles wanted one more chance to make up for all
of his missed shots.</LD>
<LD>   Kittles made a game-winning three-point shot with 22.5 seconds
left, and the New Jersey Nets survived a last-second miss by Reggie
Miller to beat the Indiana Pacers, 85-84, Friday night at
Indianapolis to take a 2-1 lead in the first-round playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   Indiana trailed by one with 0.6 seconds remaining, but it got one
final shot. On the inbound play, with Jason Kidd hung up in a screen,
Miller broke toward the top of the key and was wide open on a shot
just inside the three-point arc. But he missed badly, hitting only
the backboard.</LD>
<TE>   "Knowing that I was that wide open, I probably would have took my
time," said Miller, who scored 30 points. "I thought Jason was going
to get through the pick and I was going to have to get it up over
him. When I turned around, I didn't see him."</TE>
<TE>   Game 4 is Tuesday night, with Game 5, if needed, in New Jersey on
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared that once again Miller had added another memorable
shot to his postseason portfolio when he made a three-point basket
with 34 seconds remaining, giving the Pacers an 83-82 lead and
sending a sold-out Conseco Fieldhouse into a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Then New Jersey's Keith Van Horn rebounded Kidd's missed jumper
and swung the ball back to Kidd, who dished to Kittles on the left
wing.</TE>
<TE>   Kittles, shooting 40% in the series, finished with five points.</TE>
<TE>   "When you struggle like that, you've just got to figure if you
have an opportunity, you have to make it happen," Kittles said. "I
was thinking confidently the whole time."</TE>
<TE>   But the Pacers still had two more opportunities for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine O'Neal took the ball in the low post, but his shot was
blocked by Aaron Williams. O'Neal grabbed the rebound, missed again,
but got the rebound and was fouled by Keith Van Horn.</TE>
<TE>   With 3.6 seconds left, O'Neal made the first free throw but missed
the second. Williams got the rebound and was fouled.</TE>
<TE>   Williams missed two free throws, giving Miller one final look.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, as he has done in so many playoff series before, carried
Indiana, this time compensating for a frontcourt that never got on
track.</TE>
<TE>   "I live for these times in the playoffs," said Miller, who made 11
of 19 from the field. "We've had a lot of good times and a lot of
heartbreaking losses and this was one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd led New Jersey with 24 points and 11 assists, Kenyon Martin
scored 21 and Van Horn added 14. Kittles' three-pointer was only his
second basket in 11 shots from the field.</TE>

<HD>Back Injury Will Keep Robinson Out of Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Antonio Spurs will be without starting center David Robinson
today when they face the SuperSonics in Game 3 of their first-round
playoff series at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The series is tied at 1-1, with Game 4 scheduled for Wednesday in
Seattle. Robinson, who did not travel to Seattle, is doubtful for
that game as well, Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson's sprained lower back kept him out of Monday night's game
in San Antonio, when the SuperSonics scored a 98-90 victory. He
played only seven minutes in Game 1, a 110-89 victory for the Spurs.</LD>
<TE>   The underdog SuperSonics, seeded No. 7 in the West, say they
believe they can beat the Midwest Division champion Spurs, and they
have a better chance to do it with Robinson out. The 7-foot-1 center,
a 10-time All-Star, averaged 12.2 points and 8.3 rebounds during the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "Two big towers like that in the middle is a lot different,"
Seattle All-Star point guard Gary Payton said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know if you get away from one, the other one is going to be
there."</TE>
<TE>   With Robinson missing, 7-foot power forward Tim Duncan had to play
47 minutes in Game 2. He had 32 points and 12 rebounds, making nine
of 19 shots from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle outrebounded San Antonio, 49-35, with Payton leading his
team with 11 rebounds and Vin Baker grabbing 10.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, an MVP candidate after averaging 25.5 points and 12.7
rebounds, hopes Robinson can return to action in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot tougher doing it without him," he said. "We really
missed him in situations like the last game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do better as a team, keeping our blocks out and
putting bodies on people."</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics could be missing a key player too. Vladimir
Radmanovic, a 6-10 rookie forward, has a sore right big toe that kept
him out of practice this week. He was on the injured list from March
22 to April 5 with the toe injury. In Game 2, Radmanovic had five
points and five rebounds in 22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Mashburn will remain in Charlotte, N.C., and be treated for
anemia and vitamin deficiency while his Hornet teammates play Game 3
of their playoff series today at Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets practiced in Charlotte on Friday, then boarded a plane
for Orlando without their leading scorer. The best-of-five series is
tied, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte has not ruled out the possibility of Mashburn playing in
Game 4 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to him [Thursday] and he's still a little lightheaded
and weak," Hornet Coach Paul Silas said.</TE>
<TE>   "So we'll just plan that day to day. I'll give him a call over the
weekend and see how he is feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn, who averages 21.5 points, has played only 10 minutes in
the series. He left in the first quarter of Game 1 with what was
believed to be a virus.</TE>
<TE>   He was hospitalized overnight, checked himself out on Sunday, and
was with the team for shooting and stretching on Monday. But he began
to feel bad again on Tuesday, hours before Game 2, and was sent back
to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the anemia and a B-12 deficiency was discovered, and
he remained hospitalized for two nights for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte may also be without guard Baron Davis, who has picked up
much of the scoring load in Mashburn's absence.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, suffering from a strained back, has been using a
chiropractor, masseuse, ice and stretching. Despite the therapies, he
said he is only "50-60%."</TE>
<TE>   But Silas scoffed at Davis' status, and said: "We'll see. He'll
play, he'll play."</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady, the series' leading scorer at 25.5
points, said his injured back is improving.</TE>

<LD>Robert Gamez, who won twice on the PGA Tour in 1990 to earn
rookie-of-the-year honors but hasn't had a top-10 finish in five
years, shot his second consecutive 67 Friday for a share of the lead
with Mark Calcavecchia in the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic in
North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   The 33-year-old Gamez made the field at Forest Oaks Country Club
as the seventh alternate and he's tied for 201st on the tour money
list with $9,190 in three events.</LD>
<LD>   But Gamez is at 10 under par after carding birdies on Nos. 13-16
and then saving par on No. 17 by holing a 30-foot putt for his second
consecutive five-under round.</LD>
<TE>   Gamez and Calcavecchia, who followed his first-round 65 with a 69,
were one shot ahead of Phil Tataurangi and Rocco Mediate, who both
shot 67s.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evgeni Nabokov had 22 saves and Patrick Marleau had a goal and an
assist as the San Jose Sharks' best season in franchise history kept
getting better with a 4-1 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes, Friday
night at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose won the best-of-seven series, 4-1, to advance to the
Western Conference semifinals with Nabokov holding the Coyotes to one
goal in each of the final three games.</LD>
<LD>   He finished this playoff series with a .947 save percentage.</LD>
<TE>   Adam Graves, Vincent Damphousse and Marco Sturm also scored for
the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   After recording 99 points and their first division title during
the regular season, the Sharks are in the second round of the
playoffs for the fourth time in 11 seasons of existence, but for the
first time, the Sharks have the veteran talent and the goaltending to
entertain hopes of advancing even further.</TE>
<TE>   Marleau, the Sharks' 22-year-old center who came alive in the
final weeks of the regular season, scored a point in all five of San
Jose's playoff games against Phoenix. In the second period, he broke
a scoreless tie with a fine rebound goal, then started a sequence
that ended in Graves' goal.</TE>
<TE>   Coyote goalie Sean Burke wasn't as sharp as he had been early in
the series, stopping only 15 shots. Phoenix's only goal came on Mike
Johnson's penalty shot after Nabokov threw his stick to stop a
scoring chance.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Coyotes defied every expectation by even making the
playoffs, they were knocked out in the first round for the 10th
consecutive time since 1987, when they were still the Winnipeg Jets.
Phoenix scored only seven goals in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, New York Islanders 3--Former Islander Bryan McCabe
scored twice at Toronto to help the Maple Leafs take a 3-2 lead in
their best-of-seven series. Jonas Hoglund had two goals and an assist
for the Maple Leafs, who could end the series with a win in Long
Island, N.Y., Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto won despite missing captain Mats Sundin, who is out
indefinitely with a broken bone in his left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders lost captain Mike Peca and defenseman Kenny Jonsson
to injuries. Jonsson left in the first period with a concussion and
neck strain after being checked into the boards by Gary Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second, Peca left with a knee sprain after a low hit
by Darcy Tucker. He did not return.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto fans cheered the American national anthem in response to
New York fans booing the Canadian anthem before Games 3 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, Philadelphia 1--Martin Havlat's goal 7:33 into overtime
at Philadelphia sent the Senators to the second round of the playoffs
for the second time in the franchise's 10-year history. Ottawa won
the best-of-seven series, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, shut out in their previous three games, finally scored
on a power-play goal by Dan McGillis 3:53 into the game. McGillis
one-timed a pass from Eric Desjardins past Patrick Lalime for
Philadelphia's first goal since Ruslan Fedotenko scored in overtime
of Game 1.</TE>

<HD>League Warns Montreal, Boston in Aftermath of Zednik's
Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston and Montreal have been warned by the NHL to keep their
emotions under control for Game 5 of their first-round series today
at Boston, following Thursday's vicious hit on Canadien forward
Richard Zednik by Kyle McLaren of the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not left to the individual clubs to seek justice," NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman said Friday. "That's our job, and the clubs
know that."</LD>
<LD>   McLaren is serving an automatic suspension for at least one game
after he put Zednik in the hospital with a crushing elbow to the face
in Game 4. A disciplinary hearing this weekend will determine the
length of the suspension.</LD>
<TE>   Zednik remained hospitalized Friday with a severe concussion,
broken nose and cut under the right eye.</TE>
<TE>   He'll miss the remainder of the series with Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   McLaren has said he did nothing wrong and said he regretted the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Zednik scored both Montreal goals in Boston's 5-2 loss and was the
team's leading scorer in the series with eight points. The
best-of-seven Eastern Conference series is tied at two games each.</TE>
<TE>   Canadien General Manager Andre Savard wants a severe suspension
and said the hit was worse than the one by Tie Domi of Toronto on
Scott Niedermayer of New Jersey in last season's playoffs. Domi was
suspended for eight games for that hit.</TE>
<TE>   When asked after Friday's practice in Boston whether the Canadiens
have to retaliate, Montreal Coach Michel Therrien said, "We have to
play hard.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to control our composure. Yes, we're still upset. But, on
the other hand, this is a thing that is going to motivate our team."</TE>
<TE>   Montreal called up Matt O'Dette from Quebec of the American Hockey
League. O'Dette, who is 6 feet 5 and 221 pounds, had 136 penalty
minutes and eight points in 48 games this season at Quebec.</TE>

<HD>Estes Just a Little Less Than Perfect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Estes was getting ready to bat in the fifth inning and the
scoreboard at Shea Stadium flashed that he had pitched four
no-hitters in high school.</LD>
<LD>   "You're not supposed to do that. Isn't that a jinx?" Estes said.</LD>
<LD>   He nearly came up with the first no-hitter in the history of the
New York Mets and a perfect game too. But Eric Young lined a single
into left field leading off the seventh inning, becoming the first
runner for the Milwaukee Brewers as Estes pitched a one-hitter for a
1-0 victory Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than that," Met manager Bobby Valentine
said. "It gets one pitch better than that, maybe."</TE>
<TE>   Jay Payton supplied the offense with a second-inning home run off
Glendon Rusch (1-2), Estes came back from a trip to a chiropractor
with overpowering pitches and Mo Vaughn made a great fielding play in
the sixth to keep the perfect game-bid alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, who have played 6,373 games, are among only five major
league teams that have never thrown a no-hitter, joined by four
younger teams: San Diego, Colorado, Arizona and Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the clubhouse TV and seeing the Dodgers' Odalis
Perez pitch a one-hitter against the Cubs, Estes (1-2) retired his
first 18 batters before Young jumped on a 1-1 change-up. The only
other runner he allowed was a two-out walk to Jose Hernandez in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Florida 3--Randy Johnson won for the sixth time in as
many starts this season, striking out 10 in seven innings to help the
Diamondbacks win at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson didn't match his dominating form of last Sunday, when he
threw a two-hitter with 17 strikeouts against Colorado. He walked
three of the first six Florida batters and gave up four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim retired the final five batters for his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez homered for Arizona, and Craig Counsell and Danny
Bautista each had three hits.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, San Francisco 3--Aaron Boone's run-scoring double
sparked an eighth-inning rally at Cincinnati as the Reds won their
sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds was hit by a pitch, walked three times and grounded
out, extending his slump to 0 for 11. Bonds has only one homer since
April 14, when he aggravated his right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   His walk in the eighth inning off Scott Sullivan (3-0) started a
two-run burst that put the Giants ahead, 3-2. J.T. Snow's RBI single
tied it and ended the Giants' 0-for-18 stretch with runners in
scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 9, Houston 0--Tom Glavine pushed his major league-leading
earned-run average even lower, pitching seven scoreless innings to
lead the Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   A night after Greg Maddux gave up a career-high 10 runs, Glavine
(4-1) pitched a game more typical of the Atlanta staff. He gave up
only three hits and ended April with an 0.89 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones went four for five with four runs batted in and the
Braves knocked out Houston starter Tim Redding (0-2) after only three
innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 10, Pittsburgh 1--The Padres finally gave Brett Tomko
some run support, with Ryan Klesko's two-run double highlighting a
five-run third inning in a victory at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko (2-1) made his fifth consecutive strong start, lowering his
ERA to 1.30 by throwing a six-hitter for his first complete game of
the season. The Padres had scored only nine runs in Tomko's first
four starts.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Montreal 6--Kerry Robinson singled off second baseman
Jose Vidro's glove to drive in the go-ahead run in the 11th inning at
Montreal as the Cardinals ended the Expos' winning streak at six.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Drew singled off Tomo Ohka (2-2) to lead off the 11th and,
one out later, Jim Edmonds walked. Robinson hit a sharp grounder
between first and second for an RBI single as the ball glanced off
Vidro's glove as he made a diving attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Philadelphia 1--John Thomson took a shutout into the
eighth inning, and the Rockies ended a five-game losing streak at
Denver in Clint Hurdle's debut as manager.</TE>

<LD>The dispute between tennis diva Anna Kournikova and Penthouse
magazine over nude pictures in the magazine's June issue could be
headed for court.</LD>
<LD>   Kournikova's management agency, Octagon, asserted that the topless
photos said to be of the tennis player in the 10-page spread are not
of her. A libel lawyer who has been referred to the case by Penthouse
said his client contends otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "People who know Anna and see the photos will immediately
recognize these are not photos of her," Octagon spokesperson David
Schwab said. "Penthouse has left us with no alternative but to pursue
legal actions to protect our client's rights and interests."</LD>
<TE>   Penthouse's counsel, Victor A. Kovner, a partner at Davis Wright
Tremaine, called the pictorial "flattering and favorable." Kovner,
according to the law firm's Web site, has represented broadcast and
print media clients in "all aspects of communications law."</TE>
<TE>   "We're surprised they're upset about this article," Kovner said of
Kournikova and her representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Of Octagon's assertion that the topless photos are not of
Kournikova, Kovner said: "I've been advised my clients reviewed it
carefully and are confident this is Miss Kournikova.... It doesn't
suggest she posed topless."</TE>

<HD>Servite's Buchanan Outlasts Long Day and Long Match</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Buchanan is looking to play it again.</LD>
<LD>   The defending champion in the CIF boys' interscholastic singles
division was lucky to play at all Friday, when rains set Ojai Valley
tennis tournament matches back nearly seven hours.</LD>
<LD>   As it was, Buchanan, a senior at Anaheim Servite High, finished
his last match in darkness. The No. 5-seeded player defeated Adrian
Mardyks of Oxnard Rio Mesa, 6-4, 6-2, in the third round and
fourth-seeded Malcolm Scatliffe of San Gorgonio, in a tiebreaker in
the quarterfinals.</LD>
<TE>   "So far, so good," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan will play top-seeded Doug Stewart of Malibu, the
defending Southern Section champion who beat Buchanan for that title
last year, in the semifinals at 8 this morning at Thacher School.
Stewart defeated Santa Barbara's Blake Muller, 6-3, 6-2, in a
quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   If Buchanan upsets Stewart, he will have a chance to become the
first repeat winner in the division since Rick Leach of Laguna Beach
in 1982-83.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Rylan Rizza of Peninsula, a 5-7, 6-1, 10-8 winner
over Thousand Oaks' Andrew Lieu in another quarterfinal, faces either
Chris Surapol of Cerritos Whitney or second-seeded Aaron Yovan of
Irvine University in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   The division final match is scheduled for 2 today.</TE>
<TE>   "He's as ready as he'll ever be," Sevite Coach Dick Fumanti said
of Buchanan.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are more prepared for him too, if they waited around to
watch his long quarterfinal match Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In a match that ended at 7:45 p.m., Scatliffe took Buchanan to a
10-point tiebreaker before falling, 7-6, 4-6, 10-7. Tiebreakers were
used instead of full third sets to shorten matches after the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is a lot tougher," Buchanan said. "I'm a target now and
everybody picks up their game for me."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan takes it as a compliment and and an opportunity to raise
his play.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to stay focused," he said. "I'm staying positive.
There's no real pressure on me. I've already done this. I've been
there."</TE>
<TE>   If Buchanan, a baseliner who previously relied on his return of
serve, reaches the championship match again, it will be because of
more frequent and effective approaches to the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working hard on it, and I think it surprises people
because I've never done it before. I think it catches them off-guard,
especially on the big points."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, who is headed to Notre Dame in the fall, has converted
most of the big points for Servite (16-2) the past three-plus
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He has a record of 205-4 in sets in a four-year varsity career,
losing his first regular-season set to Fullerton Troy's Jeffrey Das
in a nonleague match last week.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan (34-1 this year) went 73-1 last season, losing only to
Stewart in the Southern Section title match. Stewart has won the last
three times they have met.</TE>
<TE>   "He can do basically everything," Buchanan said of Stewart, "and
he's just been on fire."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Will No Longer Buck Trend</HD>
<DH>Tennis: 102-year-old event will award prize money next
year, ending its status as nation's oldest amateur tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ojai Valley tennis tournament will lose the distinction of being
the oldest amateur tennis tournament in the country next year, when
prize money will be awarded to winners in men's and women's open
singles and doubles.</LD>
<LD>   A commitment to a total purse of $10,000, split in a manner still
to be determined, has been made by the Ojai Valley Tennis Club, the
nonprofit organization that runs the 102-year-old tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a sentiment that we needed to rejuvenate the Ojai, and
we hope this will be a step," said Bob Jarboe, club president. "In
today's world, unfortunately, everybody is looking for a buck."</LD>
<TE>   Jack Morrison, club president from 1968 to '78, and his wife,
Ruby, have been members of the all-volunteer group for more than 40
years. He hopes the move doesn't cost the tournament anything more
than money.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid if we're pro, we're not going to have the community
involved," he said. "I've never played tennis in my life, but this
thing is very close to us.</TE>
<TE>   "What if we lose the volunteers? Why should people work for
nothing if we're paying the players? If it wasn't for the volunteers,
there would be no Ojai tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The purse, the result of a financial pledge from a longtime Ojai
resident and tournament supporter, is not enough for the Ojai to be
designated by the U.S. Tennis Assn. as a sanctioned ATP or WTA event
with corresponding tour ranking points.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite competition, the lowest level for developing pros, is
for a share of at least $12,500 in prize money. Futures events have
purses of at least $15,000, and the minimum in challenger events is
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Such events must also stand alone, with no other competitions
going on around them, and Ojai currently would not qualify in that
regard, either.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd have to get rid of all their other divisions," said
Annette Buck, director of adult and junior tennis for the USTA's
Southern California section.</TE>
<TE>   That is unlikely to happen anytime soon, according to Jarboe.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to play it by ear and see what happens," he said. "We're
anxious to do this, but we still want it to be the Ojai too."</TE>
<TE>   Other changes are in store, though Jarboe said the timing is
coincidental and not necessarily related to the awarding of prize
money.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the eight courts at Libbey Park, the primary site of the
tournament, will be renovated in a $250,000 project scheduled to
begin in October. A $45,000 lighting system will also be installed,
allowing for night matches and the possibility of television
coverage.</TE>

<HD>Skating Judgment Day Coming</HD>

<LD>By now, the only judge who hasn't accused Marie-Reine Le Gougne or
Didier Gailhaguet of unethical conduct is Judge Judy.</LD>
<LD>   The mud continues to fly around Le Gougne, the French figure
skating judge who was suspended by the International Skating Union
during the Salt Lake City Olympics, and Gailhaguet, the head of the
French figure skating federation.</LD>
<LD>   The latest charges, from European judges, are that Le Gougne said
before the Olympics she planned to vote for Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze of Russia over Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of
Canada in the pairs competition, and that Gailhaguet pressured judges
in previous competitions to vote according to his wishes.</LD>
<TE>   Le Gougne, who signed a statement acknowledging she said she had
been pressured to vote for the Russians but later said she misspoke
because of her unsteady emotional state, will have a hearing Monday
at ISU headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. However, her lawyers
have already planted the seeds for an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   They claim the ISU should have subpoenaed all nine judges from the
Olympic pairs panel--only Sissy Krick of Germany was called--and that
its questioning of witnesses showed bias against Le Gougne. They also
objected to the ISU's refusal to consider Le Gougne's claims of
misconduct by referee Ron Pfenning, technical committee chairwoman
Sally Stapleford and Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to present evidence that Stapleford and Pfenning lobbied
for the Canadians. They also contend Le Gougne has been made a
scapegoat.</TE>
<TE>   He said, she said, they said. Who to believe?</TE>
<TE>   Morry Stillwell, chairman of the ISU's Grand Prix management
committee and a past president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.,
isn't sure what to think, except to anticipate the matter to end up
in the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hearing the quotes from some other people, and I have a
strong feeling some of those have an agenda of their own," he said of
judges who have come forward with accusations against Le Gougne or
Gailhaguet. "They have their own reasons to do it, which may have
little to do with this situation."</TE>
<TE>   The pairs judging controversy, which resulted in Sale and
Pelletier being raised to co-gold medalist status with Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze, spurred ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta to propose
reforms that will be on the agenda of the ISU Council meeting in
Kyoto, Japan, in June. Stillwell said he'd like to see the revival of
a proposal made two years ago that would have given national
federations less power over judges and might have helped avoid the Le
Gougne scenario.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal stipulated that once a judge had been nominated by
his or her federation and had taken the required test, that judge
would not have to be nominated each year. Current rules call for each
federation to renominate each judge every May. Judging is considered
a perk, so it's not farfetched to think federations might threaten to
withhold judges' nominations unless the judges promise to obey the
federation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how the federations control their judges," Stillwell said.
"[The proposal] would go a long ways toward stopping that.... It was
vetoed by the federations. There are a lot of things the ISU gets
nailed for, but there are 52 federations voting on these things."</TE>
<TE>   Stillwell said the judging flap didn't hurt the credibility of
figure skating "in the long run." But that seems like wishful
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few weeks after the Salt Lake City Games, the world
championships at Nagano, Japan, were marred by allegations the father
of Israeli ice dancer Galit Chait threatened a coach and skaters, and
that U.S. judge Sharon Rogers received death threats in her hotel
room. Also, about 20 ice dance duos signed a petition protesting the
third-place finish of Chait and Sergei Sakhnovski over Margarita
Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas of Lithuania, but Cinquanta told them
to keep their gripes in-house and suggested ice dancing could be
removed from the Olympic program.</TE>
<TE>   The integrity of the sport rests on the impartiality of its
judges.</TE>
<TE>   If Cinquanta can't devise a system that will guarantee that--or
something close to it--the sport will slowly strangle. Why should
skaters train for years for a chance at a medal, only to run into
judges who have made backroom deals that doom their dreams?</TE>
<TE>   On Track</TE>
<TE>   Everybody's in the pool for the 1,600-meter relay teams at today's
USA vs. the World races at the Penn Relays.</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones is expected to lead a reunion of the quartet that won
gold in the 1,600 at Sydney, joining LaTasha Colander-Richardson,
Monique Hennigan and Jearl Miles-Clark. The U.S.'s second team will
be Michelle Collins, Debbie Dunn, Sasha Spencer and Nicole Teter.
Teams from Canada, Russia and Jamaica are also scheduled to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men will also have Red and Blue teams. They will draw
from a pool that includes Derrick Brew, Leonard Byrd, Antonio
Pettigrew, Andrew Pierce, Alvin Harrison, James Carter, Jerome Davis
and Angelo Taylor. Their competition will include teams from Jamaica,
Canada and Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Deena Drossin of Agoura Hills, who has dominated U.S. distance
running, will compete in the 10,000 Friday at the Cardinal
Invitational at Stanford. Meb Keflezighi, who broke the U.S. record
in the 10K at that meet last year, will enter the 5K.... U.S. track
cycling champion Erin Mirabella of Chula Vista won a gold medal in
the scratch race at the season-opening World Cup track cycling event
last weekend in Monterrey, Mexico. She also won a silver medal in the
individual pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Yebin Mok of Los Angeles won the silver medal in the junior
women's competition last week at the Triglav Trophy figure skating
event in Jesenice, Slovenia. Danielle Kahle of Thousand Oaks won the
silver medal in the novice division. It was the last competition of
the ever-lengthening figure skating season.... Olympic silver
medalist and women's figure skating world champion Irina Slutskaya
left the Champions on Ice tour briefly because of a foot injury but
wasn't expected to be idled long.</TE>
<TE>   Phil McNichol, a U.S. ski team coach for five years and head coach
of the U.S. men's Europa Cup slalom and giant slalom skiers, was
appointed men's alpine head coach.</TE>
<TE>   He chose John McBride as men's downhill/super-giant slalom coach
and Martin Anderson as slalom and giant slalom coach.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Monopoly Is a Bored Game</HD>

<AU>CHUCK CULPEPPER</AU>
<BD>PORTLAND OREGONIAN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm bored. You're bored. The unchallenged Lakers are definitely
bored. Clearly, we all need a specialist.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Caruba founded the Boring Institute in 1984, and initially,
it lampooned bad movies, bad TV shows, and bad celebrities, but that
Herculean task would leave no time for meals or sleep, so nowadays
Caruba studies the more serious effects of boredom on society.</LD>
<LD>   Reached Friday afternoon at home in New Jersey, he said he was
about to take a nap, making one wonder if he'd just watched film of
this sedative we call Trail Blazers-Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   No, he had not. Caruba used to watch boxing, but got bored. "After
Round 1 or 2, you know one side's infinitely superior to the other,"
he said. "Why stick around for the rest of it?"</TE>
<TE>   Missing out on Blazers-Lakers 2002 doesn't preclude Caruba from
lending insight, however, once he learns of the details, then
reawakens.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday he learned that the twice-defending champions, who play
with the transient interest of a team spotting no threat on the
horizon, led Game 2 by 21 points in the fourth quarter against a
Blazer team flexing its peerless skill in blowing gaskets.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the buzzards overhead were real or imaginary seemed wholly
irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, the Lakers led by only six, which, they soon seemed
to realize, felt less preferable than leading by 21.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas theories abound on how this faux suspense could have crept
up on such an unsuspecting game, the most persuasive is that the
Lakers grew bored.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods doesn't need a rival to amaze, but the Lakers might.
They have won 22 of their last 25 playoff games, with one of the
losses in overtime after a layoff caused by their own dominance, and
another when they got bored in a Game 5 at Indiana, and really, who
wouldn't?</TE>
<TE>   They just spent the regular season bored, and now they're spending
the playoffs bored.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, to hear Caruba, boredom plants traps far worse even than
eyesore games, traps the Lakers cleverly have avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why a lot of sports people get into a lot of trouble with
the ladies, with drugs, with anything," he says. "Once you get on
top, you start to look for something interesting, once you establish
yourself and that nobody around can beat you.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't usually expect to see these guys walking through the
local museum soaking up the scientific delights of dinosaurs. They're
raised to deal with the physical results of life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sympathetic to the degree that by the time these guys hit 30,
life is pretty much over for them."</TE>
<TE>   Whew, that's grim. Good thing we're all too bored to dwell on the
gloom.</TE>

<LD>Cerritos Gahr defeated Downey, 3-1, Friday to give Tom Bergeron his
600th victory in 31 years as the Gladiators' baseball coach.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Windle pitched a two-hitter, striking out six and walking
one, for host Gahr (14-7, 10-1) in a San Gabriel Valley League game.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't the best conditions today, wet and windy, but it showed
what Gahr baseball has been about," said Bergeron, whose teams are
600-247 and have won 14 league titles. "We've always had to work for
our wins and have had an awful lot of one-run games here."</LD>
<TE>   Eric Gardea had three hits and scored a run for Gahr.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fortunate, but I had good help along the way," said
Bergeron, 63. "If I had to do it all by myself, I'd have been done a
long time ago."</TE>

<HD>Royal's Patterson Sees Both Races Slip Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior Travis Patterson of Simi Valley Royal High was considered the
hottest middle-distance runner in the state before the Ventura County
track and field championships at Moorpark High on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He left the event with two losses and the knowledge that
over-analyzing a race can lead to a subpar performance.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew I was beat before the [800 meters]," Patterson said.
"Because I was beat both psychologically and physically after the
[1,600]."</LD>
<TE>   The 1,600 was billed as a showdown between Patterson, who leads
the state this year in the 800 at 1 minute 53.69 seconds, and junior
Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio Mesa, the state leader in the 1,600 at
4:12.25.</TE>
<TE>   But Reid ran away from his rival on the last lap of the 400-meter
track to win in 4:15.27. Patterson was second in 4:20.13.</TE>
<TE>   The race appeared to be tailor-made for Patterson and his usually
strong kick.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson had run a 61-second last lap while clocking 4:12.1 for
his 1,600 anchor leg on Royal's distance medley relay team in the Mt.
San Antonio College Relays last Saturday, but his final 400 against
Reid took 65.1 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent too much time thinking about the [1,600]," Patterson
said. "I didn't want to do that, but when everyone keeps asking you
about what you're going to do in the race, it's hard not to."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, who has accepted an appointment to the Air Force
Academy, had used a strong kick over the final 200 meters to win the
800 in a career-best 1:53.69 in the Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia
High on April 13. But Reid began to pull away from him with 350
meters remaining in Friday's race.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been planning to have a buffer [after three laps]," Reid
said after running his final lap in 60.7. "I felt I had to because
he's the best half-miler in the state. I was definitely concerned
about him with a lap left.... I was probably more scared than I was
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson looked relaxed as he followed sophomore teammate Bryan
Rodie through a 55.8-second first lap in the 800, but he faded down
the backstretch and placed third in 2:01.22.</TE>
<TE>   Rodie placed first in 1:57.09, followed by Kevin Lindsey of
Thousand Oaks in 2:00.16.</TE>
<TE>   Although the humble Patterson was visibly disappointed in his
performances, he calmly answered questions afterward. He also took
solace in the fact that his time in the 1,600 lowered his previous
best of 4:22.24 and that he will have a chance for redemption in the
meets ahead, starting with the Marmonte League finals next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't feel like a good mile day," Patterson said. "But
[Reid] ran a good race. I didn't run as good a race as I should have.
But I learned from it and I'll take that lesson with me."</TE>

<LD>Dan Guerrero put the soul back into UCLA athletics Friday. He added a
little color to the bloodless cheeks of a corporate athletic program.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero is a jock, a baseball player who loves the feel of a
tight game and admires the athlete who has learned to play hard all
the time. Guerrero is a Bruin who is not embarrassed to express love
for his school and get all mushy and emotional when talking about his
dream job.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero was introduced as UCLA's new athletic director. He
brought to the news conference his mother, Esther, and his father,
Gene. Also his sister, Nancy, and his brother, Johnny. Of course his
wife, Anne Marie, was there and smiling. His youngest daughter,
Katie, came too. Jenna, his oldest, couldn't afford to cut her
Westmont College classes.</LD>
<TE>   It was sweet that Esther and Gene had tears of pride in their
eyes. It was sweeter that Guerrero wasn't embarrassed to have his
parents, his sister, his brother, their kids, his kids, sitting right
up at the front of the room.</TE>
<TE>   This is what UCLA athletics needs. A man of passion and pride, of
high ideals. A man who will be as much a fan of UCLA athletics as its
boss, who will be as interested in floor burns acquired as budget
surpluses on the ledger.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero grew up as the son of working class parents in
Wilmington. His father worked for the oil companies. His mother was a
bilingual aide in the grade school system. Guerrero had to be in bed
by 7 every night but he would sneak a little radio under his covers
so he could listen to Dodger games. That took discipline and
creativity. Those are good qualifies for an athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   A thick skin will help too.</TE>
<TE>   While Guerrero was being introduced inside the J.D. Morgan Center,
two young men were outside the building. They wore T-shirts that
said, "Lose Lavin," and handed out sheets of paper promoting their
Web site, "www.loselavin.com" that included a collection of reasons
why Steve Lavin shouldn't be UCLA basketball coach anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Just in case Guerrero didn't know, there are some UCLA fans who
are unhappy with the men's basketball coach. And a few more who
aren't thrilled with Bob Toledo, the football coach.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe the basketball coach and the football coach should worry
a little.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero made it clear what he expects from his teams. "I want
student athletes who, on the playing field, have strong fundamentals,
who fire out every night, who never take a night off."</TE>
<TE>   That would not describe the UCLA basketball team that Guerrero saw
struggle the last two years to eke out narrow victories over UC
Irvine. Or the football team that collapsed at the end of the 2001
season.</TE>
<TE>   Asked specifically for his opinion of Lavin's team, Guerrero was
diplomatic--but pointedly so.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to talk to Steve," Guerrero said. "I need to see how he
builds his program, what his plan is from the first day of school
until the last day. I need to evaluate an entire year, through the
summer. There's a process that needs to occur. Are we taking
advantage of all the opportunities that exist for improvement here?</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see, how does this team fire out on Oct. 15. I want to
see if there's a sense of purpose every game. The teams that
consistently do well, get to the Final Four, always play with a sense
of purpose."</TE>
<TE>   It would be unfair to think Guerrero would come in and immediately
dismiss Lavin or Toledo. It would be wrong. But he's looking for the
right things. Sense of purpose. Playing hard.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero's father said that his eldest son "took such pride in
wearing a UCLA uniform. It was such an important thing to Danny that
he did the UCLA uniform proud."</TE>
<TE>   That has seemed missing in some UCLA athletes as well, pride in
that uniform. The football players who used handicap parking placards
or drove drunk or accepted the illegal use of vehicles from
hangers-on, the basketball player who threw a vicious elbow in
frustration and knocked out an opposing guard who was 10 inches
shorter, the players and coaches wearing Bruin colors who didn't
think twice about losing to Ball State or Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   As much as he loves UCLA and as much as this was his dream job,
Guerrero said he would not have left Irvine if, as he said, "I would
not have the ability to run this program." There has been the thought
that UCLA's athletic director is a powerless person, that Chancellor
Albert Carnesale will decide whether Lavin and Toledo stay or go.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Guerrero raised boys who are independent thinkers, stubborn
men who know what they want. He did not raise sons who will easily
accept another's vision of excellence.</TE>
<TE>   When Dan Guerrero, the former UCLA baseball player, arrived at UC
Irvine, he made it no secret that he wanted a baseball program
reinstated. It was. He wanted a basketball program the university
could be proud of. It has one. The student body was cajoled by
Guerrero into voting to spend its own money, via increased student
fees, to make sports better.</TE>
<TE>   At the school he loves more than anything, deposited now into his
dream job, it is hard to imagine Guerrero will be convinced to accept
UCLA teams that are haphazardly coached, unconvincingly disciplined,
or uncaring in the way they play or behave. Steeped in the tradition
of UCLA, Guerrero feels the place. Just like so many Bruin fans.</TE>

<HD>Guerrero Puts Athlete in Athletic Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale introduced Dan Guerrero as UCLA's
next athletic director Friday by invoking every exalted ideal
imaginable.</LD>
<LD>   He talked about the importance of Guerrero continuing the "breadth
and depth of athletics and academics" that he believes separates the
school from the competition.</LD>
<LD>   He made it clear that nothing is more important than personal
integrity, "both real and perceived."</LD>
<TE>   He assured everyone that a "truly" national search was conducted,
that Guerrero was chosen from a list of supremely qualified
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Then Guerrero spoke and the tone swiftly came back to earth. The
new athletic director and former Bruin second baseman did not spit
tobacco juice, but it quickly became clear he is able to view the
world through the lens of an athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a middle infielder and one of the first things you learn
when turning a double play is to always expect a bad throw," he said.
"Being prepared and anticipating the unexpected is something
paramount for an athletic director."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, 50, said his first task on taking over for the retired
Pete Dalis on July 1 will be to learn the names of every coach,
athlete and administrator he will supervise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the obvious strategy is to develop a relationship with
people on staff and with coaches," he said. "That's the way to find
out where we are and what needs to be improved. If I don't have
buy-in, it's a vision that isn't going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero also came off as a realist, shooting down any dream of
building a football stadium on campus while making it clear that
improving facilities is near the top of his to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   He projected the comfort and confidence of a man at home,
remembering that the first person who recognized his potential as an
athletic director was none other than J.D. Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   The baseball team wanted an on-campus stadium and the players
confronted the longtime athletic director, displaying little
diplomacy. Guerrero was something of a ringleader and Morgan called
him to his office the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "His veins were bulging and he had a go at me," Guerrero recalled.
"It was an interesting exchange. But he finished by saying, 'Dan, I
respect your position and how you represented your team.'"</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Guerrero was in private business and wrote Morgan
a letter saying, "while you probably don't remember me, I want to
thank you for your leadership and the impression you made on me."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan wrote back and said, "Dan, I will never forget you. You
will make a good athletic director some day."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero soon got into athletic administration at Cal State
Dominguez Hills, eventually became athletic director there, then
moved to UC Irvine 10 years ago. He turned the prediction into a
reality, and in two months will move into a new office, in the Morgan
Center.</TE>

<HD>Spring Is a Time for Job-Hunting</HD>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott McEwan isn't sure he'll be able to watch his former UCLA
teammates in the fall. A Bruin reserve quarterback the last five
years, he is close to signing a contract with the British Columbia
Lions and doesn't know whether he'll have the necessary cable
channels in Vancouver.</LD>
<LD>   So he's getting his fill by attending UCLA spring practices. And
he considers himself filled in.</LD>
<LD>   "It is real interesting watching the scrimmages," McEwan said. "We
have a lot of holes because we had so many seniors, but I think we'll
be all right."</LD>
<TE>   About half of the 23 seniors have been cut-and-pasted from UCLA to
NFL rosters as draft picks or free agents. Others, such as McEwan,
have sought playing opportunities elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   All left voids viewed as opportunities by the current squad.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of guys fighting for jobs and most of the battles
will continue in the fall," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no single player increased his stock the way running back
Manuel White did last spring with a devastating performance, many
have gradually gained the attention of the coaching staff, which
returns intact.</TE>
<TE>   The progress of several players has been slowed because of injury,
the latest a broken right hand suffered by cornerback Ricky Manning
Jr. Safeties Matt Ware and Ben Emmanuel, guard Shane Lehman, center
John Ream and receivers Ryan Smith and Craig Bragg also missed all or
part of spring workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Also, defensive back Chad Rogers, a transfer from Air Force
projected as a backup, was dismissed from the team this week.</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown:</TE>
<TE>   * Offensive backfield: Cory Paus entered the spring in a swirl of
uncertainty caused by his short stint in jail for a drunk driving
conviction and a thumb injury that plagued him last season. He has
taken charge in the huddle and thrown the ball reasonably well,
although occasionally he is off-target with the shortest, seemingly
easiest passes.</TE>
<TE>   John Sciarra, a freshman who redshirted last season, has displayed
an improved arm. Freshmen Matt Moore of Hart High and Drew Olson of
Piedmont will join the team in the fall, although Moore attended most
spring workouts in street clothes.</TE>
<TE>   White and Akil Harris, who shared the tailback position after
starter DeShaun Foster was suspended for the last four games, again
are about even. White is stronger; Harris is shiftier. Three redshirt
freshmen--Tyler Ebell, Wendell Mathis and Jason Harrison--all ran
well in spring scrimmages.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Norton and Ray Cassaday are the fullbacks, filling holes left
by seniors Matt Stanley and Ed Ieremia-Stansbury.</TE>
<TE>   * Receiver: Big-play threats Tab Perry and Bragg continue to
improve and have been joined by another wideout with great
speed--Junior Taylor, a freshman who was ineligible last season. The
dependable Smith missed spring because of ankle surgery and will be
ready in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end is a position of strength. Senior Mike Seidman was a
frequent target during spring scrimmages. Keith Carter is an able
back-up and blue-chip freshman Marcedes Lewis of Long Beach Poly High
comes in during the fall.</TE>
<TE>   * Offensive line: Once center is resolved this should be the
strength of the offense. Tackles Mike Saffer and Bryce Bohlander and
guards Eyoseph Efseaff and Shane Lehman return.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Mociler, a reserve at tackle and guard last season, moved to
center during the spring because Ream is injured. Mike McCloskey has
been the most impressive among five freshmen who redshirted last
season.</TE>
<TE>   * Defensive line: This was the Bruins' deepest position last
season, so despite the loss of seniors Kenyon Coleman, Ken Kocher and
Anthony Fletcher--all of whom will be in NFL camps--plenty of talent
remains.</TE>
<TE>   Mat Ball has moved to end after spending last season at outside
linebacker and is joined by his twin, Dave, a starter last season,
and solid reserves Asi Faoa and Rusty Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Leisle was dominant during the spring and could be an
All-American candidate at tackle. He is joined by veterans Sean
Phillips, Steve Morgan and impressive junior college transfer Ryan
Boschetti.</TE>
<TE>   * Linebackers: All-American Robert Thomas, a first-round draft
pick of the St. Louis Rams, left a huge hole in the middle. Marcus
Reese, a versatile reserve last season, gets first crack at replacing
him, but ultimately could move to the weakside, where departed senior
Ryan Nece left another void.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Chillar was a pleasant surprise at strongside linebacker
last season and is the only sure thing on the unit. Senior Audie
Attar is the front-runner at weakside and redshirt sophomore Tim
Warfield is a good run-stopper who can play the middle or strongside.</TE>
<TE>   * Secondary: Despite concerns about his durability, Ware has moved
from cornerback to free safety. Emmanuel, who played well in
abbreviated stints last season, takes over at strong safety.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite Manning at cornerback will be Joe Hunter or Matt Clark,
who spent the spring in a fierce battle.</TE>
<TE>   * Special teams: Punter Nate Fikse and kicker Chris Griffith are
back. Toledo placed more emphasis than normal on special teams in
spring practice because kick coverage and punt returns were weak
points last season.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of turnover in the coaching staff should be a plus.
Phil Snow will begin his second year as defensive coordinator and
Kelly Skipper his second year as offensive coordinator and play
caller.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins lack a marquee name such as Foster or Thomas and
perhaps will miss some senior leadership, but McEwan has noticed a
more cohesive attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seems to be excited and on the same page," he said.
"There isn't anybody out there for their own best interests.
Everybody is there for the team."</TE>

<HD>No. 1 Waves Get Hawaii Next</HD>

<LD>Pepperdine hasn't lost a men's volleyball match since February. The
Waves have won 15 in a row and have been taken to five games only
twice in that stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Which is not to say the Waves seem unbeatable. Even after Brigham
Young lost to Pepperdine in four games Thursday in a Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation semifinal, Cougar All-American outside hitter Mike
Wall wasn't completely sold.</LD>
<LD>   "They're a good team," Wall said. "But they can be beat."</LD>
<TE>   Hawaii is next up to try against Pepperdine, the nation's
top-ranked team, in the MPSF championship match tonight at 7 in
Firestone Fieldhouse at Pepperdine. The winner earns the conference's
automatic berth into the NCAA Final Four next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves (27-4) have followed the lead of their coach, Marv
Dunphy, in terms of concentrating on the next match and blocking out
the winning streak. Seniors such as setter Beau Daniels, middle
blocker Chris Van Reusen and outside hitter Lance Walker will have to
focus even more with graduation ceremonies also scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't tell you what our record is," Dunphy said. "I never
think of that because I don't look backward. When a match is done, I
immediately turn my attention toward the next match."</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors (23-7), paced by 21 kills from Costas Theocharidis,
advanced with a four-game victory over UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy said the team's focus can't be solely on Theocharidis, last
year's national player of the year. "We'd love to limit his impact
but I don't think anybody has done that for two years now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine defeated Hawaii in four games on consecutive nights in
March. But the Warriors will have a different look with freshman
middle blocker Delano Thomas in the lineup. Thomas missed those
matches to shore up his academics.</TE>

<HD>A Richly Detailed Look at 5 Unconventional Spiritual Groups</HD>
<DH>GODTALK: Travels in Spiritual America; By Brad Gooch;
Alfred A. Knopf: 390 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH ANDREW ELLENSON</AU>
<BD>Ruth Andrew Ellenson writes about religion, arts and
culture for the Forward, People magazine and the Jewish Journal of
Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious life is one of the cornerstones of American identity, but
any binding ideal of how and why we approach our spiritual lives is
hard to pin down. In a country founded on the principle of religious
freedom, unorthodox ideas about God and how to worship him flourish.
In "Godtalk," Brad Gooch explores these unorthodox ideas on a mission
to document some of the nation's more unusual spiritual communities.</LD>
<LD>   A self-described Episcopalian from Manhattan, Gooch sets out to
describe a sometimes unconventional group of spiritual communities
and to place them in a world in which religion is increasingly a
hyphenated identity.</LD>
<LD>   "What were they wearing? How did they talk?" he asks himself, as
he sets out to perform research from the field. To answer those
questions, "Godtalk" delves into five different groups: the followers
of the cultish "The Urantia Book"; New Age guru Deepak Chopra's
packaging Hinduism for export into America; the monastic lives of a
group of Trappist monks in Kentucky; a gay Christian community in the
South; and the life of a Sufi mosque in New York City. Gooch seeks to
trace the origins of these movements to their modern-day
incarnations--to connect the dots between what these movements were
in their origin to what they have become today.</LD>
<TE>   On a visit to the Trappist monks of Kentucky's Our Lady of
Gethsemani (the monastery that inspired the spiritual awakening of
Thomas Merton), Gooch's portrayal of the flourishing of spiritual
tourism--vacations to a monastery for a week of spiritual
renewal--versus the drastically declining numbers of the actual monks
speaks volumes about our contradictory culture.</TE>
<TE>   Gooch suggests that Americans desperately seek the solace and
comfort religion can provide, but are unwilling to make the
self-sacrifices to ensure the survival of religious communities. When
one monk comments on his brothers' declining numbers--"We're not here
to keep an institution going; we're here to lead honest
lives"--Gooch's observation that "the abbeys are simultaneously dying
and trending up" is right on the nose.</TE>
<TE>   Where Gooch's careful detailing is less successful is in the
somewhat digressive chapter on "The Urantia Book." Gooch traces the
unusual history of "The Urantia Book" in Chicago as the work of a
psychiatrist connected to the Kellogg family of cornflakes fame. That
psychiatrist, William Sadler, claimed the book was transmitted
directly from extraterrestrial beings to a medium, who then channeled
the otherworldly messages that are a bizarre mixture of science
fiction and Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Though trying to be respectful of his subjects, Gooch sometimes
doesn't apply enough critical thought to make the discussion seem
worthwhile. When he writes of "The Urantia Book" followers that "so
far the movement is making up its rituals as it goes along," the
reader's response is: Then how are they formed enough to be written
about? Instead of illuminating the reader about what believers of
this movement expect their fulfillment to be, he devotes most of the
chapter to speculations as to how much of the book was directly
channeled from extraterrestrials or taken from scientific and
spiritual writing of the 1920s. Not surprisingly, the one member of
the community who seeks to find the answer to that question finds
himself living in exile in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Godtalk" is a compelling chronicle of some decidedly odd-ball
religious beliefs, even though it doesn't give a real sense of how
spirituality can transform us in the new millennium. Perhaps it is
too soon to tell.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the book is a richly detailed examination of fringe
religious movements in America that seems to prove the point that it
has been a continual theme in our country to innovate ever more
creative ways of connecting to our various ideas of God.</TE>
<TE>   Reading about that might be amusing, even if it is certainly
nothing new. As for America's religious future, Gooch says that
conversations he has had in researching this book have led to him the
conclusion that "in the next five years, more Americans would be
traveling with spiritual passports--often dual passports--stamped
with some very colorful visas."</TE>

<LD>What a feast for the flames! The rows of tents, the thousands of
bookshelves and tables, holding hundreds of thousands of books!
Montag, the grinning fireman of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
would take one look at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books,
unholster his kerosene nozzle, flip his igniter and--thwump--flame
would blossom everywhere. Thank goodness it's fiction.</LD>
<LD>   Bradbury's 1953 tale of censorship, social repression,
book-burning and rebellion is, for the rest of this month, Los
Angeles' "city book." It wasn't really fire that L.A. native Bradbury
worried about but its metaphorical equivalents of competing media and
social apathy. He foresaw, 50 years ago, "earbud" portable sound
systems and wall-size televisions, spewing mind candy at high volume.
Even the televised slow-speed chase: "Twenty million Montags running,
soon, if the cameras caught him running like an ancient flickery
Keystone Comedy, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and
the hunted." He heard the rumble of wars. And Taliban-esque
censorship even of human figures in art.</LD>
<LD>   In 1953 the fear was Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his witch hunts for
Communist sympathizers. Today, substitute Al Qaeda--or intolerant
extremists anywhere, the people who would outlaw Harry Potter.
"Fahrenheit 451" (the temperature at which paper combusts) is
hair-raisingly apt for the post-9/11 world.</LD>
<TE>   Multiply Bradbury's brain food by the thousands and you have the
book fair, taking place today and Sunday for its seventh year at
UCLA. It includes an appearance by Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Another cheering development for literature and literacy is the
city-book and state-book movement. Seattle, city of readers, started
it in 1998 with Russell Banks' brilliant, gloomy "The Sweet
Hereafter." Chicago picked up the idea last fall, choosing Harper
Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird." L.A.'s is a more provocative and less
dutiful choice.</TE>
<TE>   The press releases last month said Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
had picked the Bradbury book himself. It seemed like so much PR, but
it truly was personal. In a Times biographical sketch in 2000 he
listed "Fahrenheit 451" as his favorite book. "Ray was from L.A.,
['Fahrenheit'] was about books and written in a library" at UCLA,
Hahn said this week. "As an avid young reader, I was in love with
sci-fi and Bradbury," because he wrote about human beings, not just
rocket ships.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" becomes the
first "state book." It is about California's past, its dust-bowl
migrants, rather than Bradbury's world future. But the Central Coast
author's best and most famous novel offers similar shivers of
recognition and--no peeking allowed--a final scene that no one ever,
ever forgets.</TE>

<LD>There's nothing "friendly" about a 500-pound laser-guided U.S. bomb,
whether dropped on an enemy or, as recently, on allied Canadian
troops in Afghanistan. The sadness over the four deaths that resulted
is powerful in both countries. Investigations are underway, as they
should be, just as investigations have been made into other "friendly
fire" incidents in Afghanistan. Bad things happen in wars,
intentionally and accidentally.</LD>
<LD>   The overheated reaction of some Canadians highlights a perennial
delicacy in U.S.-Canadian relations, even without Canadians serving
under U.S. command. As a nation, Canada has been a most loyal ally
and cooperative neighbor, especially important during the long Cold
War years when only it separated the Soviet Union from the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   As the physically larger and less populated half of North America,
Canada has long displayed a penchant for perceiving slights and
feeling underappreciated, even abused. Canadians still mutter that
during World War II's ill-fated Dieppe raid, the British fought to
the last Canadian. American leaders, particularly, it seems, Texans
who live with Mexico as the neighbor, have displayed insensitivity.
President Johnson kept confusing Prime Minister Pearson with
Britain's Prime Minister Wilson. Although President Bush phoned
private condolences to Prime Minister Jean Chretien immediately, he
was slow to say anything publicly that could be televised to
Canadians suffering their first hostile military fatalities since the
Korean War--and at the hands of their ally.</TE>
<TE>   A columnist for Toronto's Globe and Mail was particularly
strident. "We went to help out the Americans with their war," wrote
Margaret Wente, "and they used us for target practice." Wente is
actually a Chicago native living in Canada, but she spoke for
numerous Canadians living in the comfy commercial shadows and
security of the American colossus and both enjoying and resenting it,
sometimes simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are, shall we say, not famous for their sensitivities
toward foreign cultures, especially when, like Canada's, they don't
seem very foreign. The fact of life in today's world, however, is
that the United States is inevitably more important to other nations
than they are to the U.S. Countries like Canada know this very well.
One country--the U.S.--often needs a reminder that more, not less, is

<HD>Abortion Issue a Plus for Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ENCINITAS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The instant Donna Repp learned that Bill Simon Jr. opposes abortion
rights, she all but ruled out voting for the Republican candidate for
governor.</LD>
<LD>   "I know that's too cut and dried for many people, but something
about that just turns me off," said Repp, a Republican. "I don't care
to listen any longer. I don't think I could vote for this man."</LD>
<LD>   If Gov. Gray Davis has his way, voters like Repp will doom Simon's
quest to bounce Davis from office.</LD>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent has made abortion rights a showcase issue
in his reelection campaign. His aim is to undermine Simon among the
moderates who dominate general elections--particularly women in
suburban areas such as this prosperous oceanfront city north of San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Conversations with nearly three dozen Encinitas voters suggest why
abortion remains a powerful issue for Davis to exploit.</TE>
<TE>   In pressing the issue, the governor reminds abortion rights
activists of his longtime support of their cause. But more broadly,
among those who are not single-issue abortion voters, he uses it to
suggest that Simon is out of touch with the values of voters at
large.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't allow a woman her right to choose, you start from
there and move down the list of rights they'd take away," said coffee
shop waiter Scott Bertone, 30, an independent.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, beset by weak public approval ratings, has sought to stir
fears that as governor Simon would roll back abortion rights. He used
the same tactic with great success in his 1998 campaign against
Republican Dan Lungren, a staunch abortion rights opponent whom Davis
defeated by 20 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, backed by the National Right to Life group's California
chapter, has said he will respect current laws on abortion, but has
declined to discuss the issue in detail other than to say he opposes
abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Though Simon insists that it's a closed issue in a state where
about two out of three voters favor abortion rights, Davis has gone
out of his way to emphasize the impact a governor can have, from
judicial appointments to public money for contraception.</TE>
<TE>   Colleen McNanie, 45, is one of the Encinitas Republicans who
crossed party lines to vote for Davis in 1998, and she expects to do
so again, in part because of his stand on abortion. She's a sports
attorney's assistant who pulled up in a black BMW to a 7-Eleven on
Pacific Coast Highway on her way to work.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, people have to give each other the credit
and say it is your right to choose, not as a woman, but as a human
being," she said. "If that's what Gray Davis is doing, I think that's
a pretty good motivating thing."</TE>
<TE>   When Davis is asked about Simon, abortion is typically the first
topic he raises. The governor, however, avoids the emotionally
charged word "abortion," instead saying that he supports "a woman's
right to choose."</TE>
<TE>   The carefully chosen phrase is meant to suggest to voters like
retired teacher Linda Schooler, an independent, that more than
abortion is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a whole host of issues covered by a woman's right to
choose," Schooler said while scouting for geraniums at an Encinitas
nursery. "Minority rights. Gay rights. Protective rights of families
in the workplace."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' pitch doesn't always work. To Cathy Burns, a Democrat
watching her two toddlers frolic on a park lawn, Davis "totally
dropped the ball" on energy. She said she was "very strongly" in
favor of abortion rights, but would vote for Simon and take a chance
that he won't curb those rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping he doesn't have the authority to upset the apple cart
too much," she said.</TE>
<TE>   By party affiliation, Encinitas would seem a safe bet for Simon.
Republicans outnumber Democrats by 40% to 34%. The city's mayor and
its members of the Legislature and Congress are all Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Encinitas has a history of backing centrist Democrats in state
and national elections, among them Davis, Al Gore and Bill Clinton.
All three have used abortion rights to gain support, particularly
among moderate Republican women. Pete Wilson, the last Republican
whom Encinitas backed for governor, also supported abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   The split political identity of Encinitas, a city of 58,000, is
partly a reflection of its distinct neighborhoods, spread over 19
square miles of rolling hills on a spectacular stretch of coastline
between Carlsbad and Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   On the oceanfront is Leucadia, a liberal enclave. Along the coast
highway are surfboard shops, a tie-dyed T-shirt stand, art galleries
and a trailer park. It's the part of town that Mayor Christy Guerin
calls "funky." Leucadia is home to many of the city's 586 Green Party
members.</TE>
<TE>   On the opposite side of Encinitas--a few miles inland beyond the
coastal bluffs--is Olivenhain, a haven of the wealthy and a GOP
stronghold. Spanish-style mansions are surrounded by ranches with
citrus groves. Jaguars and Lexus sedans are parked in the driveways.
Eucalyptus-shaded horse trails thread around the hillside estates.
Cool ocean breezes blend the sweet scent of orange blossoms with a
faint odor of horse manure.</TE>
<TE>   But most of Encinitas is a patchwork of tract houses covering
hills between Olivenhain and Leucadia.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Encinitas' residents are affluent, well
educated and sensitive to ocean pollution and unchecked suburban
sprawl, leanings that offset the Republican registration edge.
Because the city mirrors California's moderate political posture on
social issues, the governor's message on abortion rights resonates
with many of its voters.</TE>
<TE>   "When a candidate is anti-choice, voters assume they carry with
them a whole host of right-wing positions," said Democratic
consultant Roy Behr. "It says this guy is outside the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Whalin, who runs a beach clothing store on the coast
highway, is a Democrat whose favorite for governor was Republican
Richard Riordan, an abortion rights supporter.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon beat Riordan in the primary, so now Whalin plans to vote
for Davis because of Simon's stand on abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to take that step backward, you wonder what else
they're going to do," she said. "You start thinking, are they going
to invite Jerry Falwell out here? Or Pat Robertson?"</TE>
<TE>   Down the block at Honey's Bistro and Bakery, hairdresser Starla
Adkins, 43, was eating waffles at a table on the sidewalk. She
described herself as a conservative, Roman Catholic "woman of
prayer," but said "abortion is something that should be between a
woman, her doctor and God."</TE>
<TE>   "Stay out of my womb," she said. "That's what I like to tell a lot
of these political men."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Is Stuck on the Wings of a Dilemma</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Small and old, Lindbergh Field hampers the area's
economy, but no one can agree on building a new airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As regional airport planners ponder the demise of the El Toro airport
plan, officials here are hip deep in the latest chapter of a
decades-old struggle to replace the city's tiny international
airport.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy over building an airport at the former El Toro
Marine base in Orange County was intense. But it was a
flap-come-lately compared to the debate about Lindbergh Field.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 40 years, officials have repeatedly warned that San
Diego's economic vitality is being stunted by Lindbergh's cramped
downtown location and single runway. In terms of myriad reports
written, consultants hired and proposals forwarded, Lindbergh tops
the list of unsolved civic dilemmas.</LD>
<TE>   It also epitomizes the struggle being repeated throughout Southern
California, where the convenience and commercial benefits of improved
air transit continue to ram into concerns that new airports will
bring more jet noise, air pollution and vehicle traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Every possible replacement location in San Diego County has
brought implacable opposition from homeowners, politicians or the
military.</TE>
<TE>   But under the guiding hand of state Sen. Steve Peace (D-Chula
Vista), the Legislature drafted a plan to overcome NIMBYism and solve
the Lindbergh dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   A bill passed last year created a regional airport authority,
whose members are not beholden to voters. The agency gradually is
taking control of Lindbergh Field and assuming responsibility for the
daunting task of finding a new location to serve more passengers and
planes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to make the hard political choices no one has been
willing to make," said San Diego Councilman Byron Wear, a member of
the authority's interim governing board.</TE>
<TE>   At 526 acres, Lindbergh is the smallest of any hub airport in the
United States. The downtown location is convenient for many of the 16
million passengers it serves a year, but it provides a steep and
harrowing approach for pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Because Lindbergh has only one runway, two-thirds of local
manufactured goods must be trucked to Los Angeles International
Airport or the Ontario airport to get to market, the kind of added
expense that keeps companies from locating in San Diego, officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   The latest study predicted that the airport will hit gridlock in
2012 and be unable to accommodate growth in passenger service. That
would force flights, and big-spending tourists, to other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Even a $232-million improvement project completed in 1998,
including an expanded terminal and a new baggage area, was seen as
only a temporary solution.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the new San Diego County Regional Airport Authority
are aiming at a public vote in November 2004 on a proposal for a new
airport to either replace or supplement Lindbergh. Another option,
which also would require a vote, would be to expand the old downtown
airfield.</TE>
<TE>   A committee composed of transportation specialists with the San
Diego Assn. of Governments and the Unified Port District of San Diego
has compiled a list of 20 possible sites as part of a study costing
$1.9 million, most of it from the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The list, which was unveiled last week at a meeting of the
authority's interim board, included Marine Corps Air Station Miramar,
northeast of downtown; Camp Pendleton on the county's northern coast,
and McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   The choices gave one member a sense of deja vu. Oceanside Mayor
Terry Johnson noted that the list has several sites that have been
rejected in the past. Johnson believes that, once all the studying
and talking is finished, the only alternative will be to expand
Lindbergh Field.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the same sites that have been on the table for 40
years," Johnson said. "When you come down to it, we'll have three
choices: Expand Lindbergh or build at Miramar or Camp Pendleton."</TE>
<TE>   Of those three choices, only expanding Lindbergh Field is viable,
Johnson said. "I don't see the military any time soon giving up those
sites."</TE>
<TE>   Wedged between homes and an industrial site, Lindbergh Field,
which opened in 1928, would be difficult to expand. Even if the
Marine Corps relinquishes its adjacent boot camp, those 388 acres are
seen by most airport planners as providing only a Band-Aid.</TE>
<TE>   Airport planner Ted Anasis, of the San Diego Unified Port
District, is confident that the public has finally realized that the
county's economic future is dimmer without a bigger airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether you want your children to have the kind
of good-paying jobs that come with a better industrial base or the
kind of jobs you get with a service and tourist economy," Anasis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anasis believes that the solution to Lindbergh may come in several
steps.</TE>
<TE>   But others before Anasis also have predicted that San Diego's mood
has tipped in favor of finding a home for a second airport.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Erie, a political science professor and infrastructure
specialist at UC San Diego, is skeptical that the airport authority
will succeed where the Port District, the current operator of the
airport, has failed.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, council and Board of Supervisors will each appoint
one member to the authority's executive board--to be paid a salary
equivalent to a Superior Court judge, $136,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Erie jokes that the authority bill is "term life insurance for
Byron Wear and Steve Peace." Both politicians are prevented by term
limits from seeking reelection and both have shown interest in being
appointed to the authority executive board.</TE>
<TE>   Though San Diego has been debating what to do with Lindbergh
Field, widespread residential growth has ensured that any possible
site will have political and legal opposition, Erie said. Also, the
Marine Corps has invested heavily in Camp Pendleton and Miramar.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken a step forward with a regional authority," Erie said.
"I just wish we'd done it 10 years ago, when we still had options."</TE>

<HD>Workers Warned Navy of Concerns Over Jets</HD>
<DH>Safety: Point Mugu maintenance program was plagued with
problems, say pair who quit. Two airmen died last week when one of
the planes crashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jet that crashed at the Point Mugu Air Show last weekend was in a
maintenance program that two former Navy aircraft specialists warned
officials last summer was plagued with problems and jeopardized the
squadron of aging fighter planes.</LD>
<LD>   Darrell Ellington, a mechanic on the QF-4 Phantoms, and Ken
Okesson, a quality assurance specialist, said they quit their jobs
last year because of persistent management and maintenance problems
associated with the Point Mugu Naval Air Station's QF-4 jet program.
They said they made their concerns known to officials at the Ventura
County base in resignation letters and exit interviews.</LD>
<LD>   So concerned was he about problems at the base, Ellington said
this week, that when Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, the pilot killed in
last Saturday's air show crash, asked him why he was quitting, the
mechanic responded bluntly.</LD>
<TE>   "I told him they were going to crash an airplane and kill
someone," said Ellington, who now lives in Oregon and continues to
serve in the Air National Guard. "Or at least they were going to get
someone hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Navy spokeswoman Mary Ann Freeman said Friday that employee
resignation letters expressing concerns about safety or workplace
issues "are always taken seriously. However, in this case there were
no specific allegations cited upon which to act."</TE>
<TE>   Confidential exit interviews were conducted with Ellington and
Okesson, Freeman said. And Capt. Mike Rabens was briefed on their
letters when he took over as commander of the Naval Test Wing Pacific
last summer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The QF-4 jet that crashed at the air show was just delivered to
Point Mugu in February from the Naval Aviation Depot in Cherry Point,
N.C., Lance said. The cause of the crash has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is currently conducting a full investigation of the QF-4
mishap at Point Mugu," Lance said. "In the past 20 years, this is the
only QF-4 flight mishap the Weapons Test Squadron has ever
experienced, with over 118,000 accident-free flight hours logged."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who has worked closely with
base officials on a number of projects and issues, said he was
unaware of employees' concerns involving the QF-4 program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disturbing that these things are coming forward because we
have a very good dialogue with the guys on the flight line," said
Gallegly, who was at the air show and witnessed the crash. "You can
be assured we will be very aggressive in trying to get some answers
to these allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Corps Capt. Andrew Muhs, 31,
who lived on the naval air base, were killed when their two-seat
Vietnam-era jet wobbled out of control and slammed into a marshy
field west of the runway during Point Mugu's 39th annual air show
before nearly 25,000 spectators. Norman was the pilot and Muhs the
navigator.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the crash investigation have said that nothing
has been ruled out as a possible cause, including mechanical
malfunction, faulty maintenance or even the possibility that birds
were sucked into the jet's engines.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington and Okesson's letters and verbal warnings echoed the
concerns of a Navy inspector who two years earlier issued a highly
critical report of Point Mugu's civilian-operated QF-4 maintenance
program and warned of potential safety hazards. The report was part
of a routine annual inspection.</TE>
<TE>   All concerns outlined in the inspector's report were addressed at
the time and a follow-up investigation indicated that improvements
were made, said Doris G. Lance, another Navy spokeswoman. Squadrons
are required to correct problems within 30 days or to submit plans
that may require more time.</TE>

<HD>Barbara G. Harrison, 67; Writer Known for Her Fierce
Opinions</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, a journalist and essayist whose writing on
topics as diverse as the Jehovah's Witnesses and Spike Lee was
distinguished by strong opinions and a willingness to cast herself
into the action, died Wednesday in New York of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. She was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison was the author of eight books, including a novel and two
collections of articles and essays that originally appeared in such
magazines as Ms., Esquire, Harper's and the Nation.</LD>
<LD>   Her nonfiction books included "Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in
School" and "Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's
Witnesses."</LD>
<TE>   The latter book, published in 1980, received wide notice as a
compelling autobiography as well as for its profile of an often
poorly understood religion.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholic by birth, she converted to the Jehovah's Witness
faith at the age of 9 along with her mother. Harrison remained a
member for 13 years, going so far as to live and work in the
Watchtower Bible and Tract Society headquarters in Brooklyn Heights,
N.Y., when she was 19. She renounced the faith three years later.</TE>
<TE>   In the book, she wrote of the kindness Jehovah's Witnesses showed
to one another and the persecutions they suffered. She also portrayed
the faith as racist, sexist and totalitarian.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers responded positively to the book. Vivian Gornick,
writing in the New York Times Book Review, said "Visions of Glory" is
"well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the
personality of its author is extremely appealing."</TE>
<TE>   Many reviewers found it impossible to critique Harrison's work
without acknowledging her fierce opinions and strong personality,
which enlivened her writing.</TE>
<TE>   "To refuse to make essential discriminations, to abdicate the
responsibility of judgment, is to lessen one's being as a person,"
she once wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Thus in "Off Center: Essays," published in 1980, she delivered a
stunning dissection of Joan Didion, the highly regarded prose
stylist. Harrison described her as a "neurasthenic Cher."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison grew up in a dysfunctional family in the Bensonhurst
section of Brooklyn. Her father sexually abused her and tried to kill
her. Her mother, volatile and deeply disturbed, dragged her off to
join a religious sect that does not permit saluting the flag or
receiving blood transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, Harrison worked as a
secretary, wed and began a family. She was married for eight years to
W. Dale Harrison and lived with him in Libya, India and Guatemala
when he was a worker with the relief agency CARE.</TE>
<TE>   She was known as a gifted interviewer, whose subjects ranged from
Phyllis Schlafly to Gore Vidal.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what her secret was, she said the first step was
exhaustively researching her subject. But "the trick beyond that,"
she told Contemporary Authors, was to "pay absolute attention when
you're with that person. Usually when I interview, the person I'm
interviewing is the most interesting person in the world to me at
that moment. And that is not an act."</TE>
<TE>   Her other books include "An Accidental Autobiography" in 1996;
"Italian Days" in 1989, which combined travelogue book and
autobiographical musings and won the American Book Award; and a
novel, "Foreign Bodies" in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison is survived by a daughter and a son.</TE>

<HD>Blake Pays Bodyguard's Bail</HD>
<DH>Jail: Actor, charged in death of his wife, provides $1
million to release co-defendant Earle Caldwell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Robert Blake posted $1 million in cash to bail his bodyguard
out of county jail Friday afternoon, eight days after both men were
arrested in the killing of Blake's wife.</LD>
<LD>   Earle Caldwell, 46, of Burbank was released from the Twin Towers
Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles. Blake, 68, is being
held in the Men's Central Jail without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Both men pleaded not guilty Monday in the May 4, 2001, fatal
shooting of Bonny Lee Bakley near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Harland W. Braun, who represents Blake, said the actor
believed he should help Caldwell, both as his employer and friend.
Blake is also paying Caldwell's legal bills, Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell "is falsely accused of a crime arising out of his
employment," Braun said. "He would not have been charged with a crime
if he didn't work for Robert."</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell is charged with conspiring to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, best known as the streetwise detective in the 1970s
''Baretta'' television series, is charged with murder, soliciting
murder and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he will ask a judge next week to set bail for Blake.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, prosecutors announced they will not seek the death
penalty for Blake. He still faces life in prison without parole if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell's attorney, Arna H. Zlotnik, said his client is relieved
and grateful to be out of jail.</TE>
<TE>   "This week has been very difficult for Mr. Caldwell," Zlotnik
said. "He has no prior criminal record or no prior criminal contact.
It's been very traumatic."</TE>
<TE>   Zlotnik and Braun said Blake has an obligation under the state's
labor laws to pay legal defense costs for Caldwell, his employee.</TE>
<TE>   But the law may not apply to criminal cases and may create a
perception problem, criminal defense attorney Leonard Sharenow said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good from a jury point of view that one defendant
is paying the expenses of another defendant," Sharenow said. "It's a
control issue."</TE>
<TE>   According to the criminal complaint, Caldwell provided Blake with
a small-caliber gun in a zippered case. Blake then allegedly offered
the gun to men whom he had asked to kill Bakley. Blake also prepared
a list of items, including shovels, crowbars and swimming pool acid,
for use in Bakley's killing, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Blake shot Bakley, 44, while she sat in the
couple's car near Vitello's restaurant, where they had just dined.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities contend Blake was contemptuous of Bakley, who forced
the actor into marriage after a paternity test confirmed he had
fathered her child.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said prosecutors also will try to prove that Blake had tried
to hire two stuntmen who worked on ''Baretta'' to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   After Blake's arrest last week at his daughter's Hidden Hills
home, the actor, during the ride to police headquarters, told
detectives, "I've been waiting one year for this," according to the
arrest report.</TE>

<HD>Burning Son's Hand: $100 Fine</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge gives Guatemalan father a lighter sentence
for punishing boy because of 'customs.' Prosecutor says he deserves
prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER and JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Guatemalan immigrant who burned his 5-year-old son's hand over an
open flame for stealing a pack of gum was fined $100 by an Orange
County judge who noted "customs and habits" in reducing the charges.</LD>
<LD>   The father, Wellington Soto, had faced a possible sentence of up
to six years in prison had he been convicted of felony child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   "We find ourselves in the cross-current of customs and habits,"
Superior Court Judge James O. Perez said in sentencing Soto on
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The prosecutor on the case urged Perez not to reduce the charges
for a "cross-cultural reason," but the judge responded that the
offense was "an isolated incident with a purpose.... Maybe it will
keep Junior from being one of our customers downstream.</TE>
<TE>   "What Mr. Soto was doing was of a corrective nature, even though I
think if he sat back and thought about what he did, he might have
taken a different approach."</TE>
<TE>   Perez added that many juvenile criminals start out with petty
thefts.</TE>
<TE>   The decision angered the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of any other situation that would merit a felony
than burning your own child on a gas flame," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Karen Schatzle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the physical pain, but the mental anguish of having
your hand placed in a flame, by a parent, no less," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anybody who intentionally burns a child should go to
state prison."</TE>
<TE>   At the Soto apartment in Anaheim on Friday, Wellington and his
wife, Luz Soto, said they regretted what happened and have learned
from the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "We know now that what we did was wrong," Luz Soto said. "This was
a very difficult situation for us, and we are trying to overcome it."</TE>
<TE>   She added that the family was not entirely familiar with American
laws and customs when it comes to disciplining children.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have children understand how trying it is with
children," she said. "We are from another country."</TE>
<TE>   But Armando Navarro, chairman of the Department of Ethnic Studies
at UC Riverside, said burning a child's hand in punishment is not a
cultural norm in Guatemala or anywhere else in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hate for anyone to believe that our culture relies on
that type of punishment in terms of correcting a wrong," Navarro
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the sentencing hearing Tuesday, Judge Perez told attorneys
that he was moved to reduce the charges by the fact that Soto was
trying to discipline his son, even though the punishment was too
severe. Soto, himself, had been disciplined in that fashion when he
was a child, the judge noted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking a package of gum, but you go down to juvenile hall
and start checking around those kids and they all started with little
things," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   A misdemeanor conviction, he added, brings a reasonable resolution
to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare say that we've done two things: Hopefully, the child has
learned a lesson and, hopefully, Senior has learned a lesson," Perez
said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began with a New Year's Day trip to an Anaheim
market. Soto noticed his 5-year-old chewing gum even though they
hadn't purchased any at the store, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   After the boy admitted he stole the gum, Soto took him home,
placed his hand over the gas stove and turned on the flame.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Soto then bandaged the boy's hand and told
him not to tell anyone about what happened. A few days later, one of
the boy's teachers noticed the bandage and called authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was never examined by a doctor, but prosecutors said the
burn was severe and damaged several layers of skin.</TE>
<TE>   In reducing the charges, however, Perez said he had concluded that
the wound was not that severe. Prosecutors presented evidence that
Soto had hit the boy with a belt on several occasions, but the judge
said he did not consider that child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Soto's attorney said her client didn't deserve to go to prison.</TE>

<TE>   "We know now that what we did was wrong," Luz Soto said. "This was
a very difficult situation for us, and we are trying to overcome it."</TE>
<TE>   She added that the family was not entirely familiar with American
laws and customs when it comes to disciplining children.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have children understand how trying it is with
children," she said. "We are from another country."</TE>
<TE>   But Armando Navarro, chairman of the Department of Ethnic Studies
at UC Riverside, said burning a child's hand in punishment is not a
cultural norm in Guatemala or anywhere else in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hate for anyone to believe that our culture relies on
that type of punishment in terms of correcting a wrong," Navarro
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the sentencing hearing Tuesday, Judge Perez told attorneys
that he was moved to reduce the charges by the fact that Soto was
trying to discipline his son, even though the punishment was too
severe. Soto, himself, had been disciplined in that fashion when he
was a child, the judge noted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking a package of gum, but you go down to juvenile hall
and start checking around those kids and they all started with little
things," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   A misdemeanor conviction, he added, brings a reasonable resolution
to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare say that we've done two things: Hopefully, the child has
learned a lesson and, hopefully, Senior has learned a lesson," Perez
said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began with a New Year's Day trip to an Anaheim
market. Soto noticed his 5-year-old chewing gum even though they
hadn't purchased any at the store, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   After the boy admitted he stole the gum, Soto took him home,
placed his hand over the gas stove and turned on the flame.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Soto then bandaged the boy's hand and told
him not to tell anyone about what happened. A few days later, one of
the boy's teachers noticed the bandage and called authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was never examined by a doctor, but prosecutors said the
burn was severe and damaged several layers of skin.</TE>
<TE>   In reducing the charges, however, Perez said he had concluded that
the wound was not that severe. Prosecutors presented evidence that
Soto had hit the boy with a belt on several occasions, but the judge
said he did not consider that child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Soto's attorney said her client didn't deserve to go to prison.</TE>
<TE>   "What he was doing was trying to raise his child correctly,"
public defender Jamalyn Ollinger said. "Although not the appropriate
action to have taken, his motives were appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   But Kathy McCarrell, executive director of the Orange County Child
Abuse Prevention Center, said she believes the judge sided with the
abuser instead of the victim</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think it would have been a $100 fine if he'd done this to
a stranger?" she said. "I think burns are particularly damaging
because they are so painful and permanent."</TE>
<TE>   Luz Soto said she hopes to put the incident behind her. "We don't
want people to interpret what happened the wrong way," she said. "Now
our principal mission is to be better parents every day."</TE>
<TE>   Perez is a veteran judge who retired several years ago and serves
on a part-time basis at the Fullerton courthouse. He is known for
taking great care in how he sentences first-time offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an extremely fair, honorable and compassionate man," said
Nancy Clark, a Newport Beach sentencing consultant. "He treats
everyone in his courtroom as human beings and is not a rubber-stamp
for anyone."</TE>

<HD>Deal May End Bus Drivers' Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Tentative agreement would resolve 25-day dispute
affecting 20,000 students. Union vote is expected Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for striking school bus drivers and their employer,
Laidlaw Education Services, reached a tentative agreement late Friday
night that could have buses rolling by Monday, ending a 25-day strike
that has disrupted the lives of 20,000 children in the Los Angeles
Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough came unexpectedly after the county's top labor
leader, Miguel Contreras, and L.A. schools Supt. Roy Romer intervened
early Friday and urged both sides to come back to the table after a
week of silence.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides said privately that Contreras' intervention and his
threat Friday to publicly and financially attack Laidlaw and the
school district if a settlement wasn't reached quickly was the magic
bullet.</LD>
<TE>   Talks started just after noon at the Biltmore Hotel. The outlines
of an agreement were reached shortly before 8 p.m. All sides
emphasized that details remained to be worked out this weekend, but
union officials were planning to submit the deal to their membership
for a vote Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the agreement was what one union official called "a
creative and technical compromise that will be difficult to explain"
that dealt with health care.</TE>
<TE>   Bus drivers had sought a broad expansion of health insurance
coverage eligibility; before Friday, Laidlaw wanted the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise, said officials on both sides, would be designed to
reduce employee costs in stages, while expanding their coverage over
time.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators agreed to a salary increase that Laidlaw long had
offered. After arguments over pension contributions, both sides
agreed to the status quo on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, both sides agreed to submit some still-sticky details
to arbitration and to pay bus drivers a "longevity bonus" that could
mean cash awards to longtime drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Participants declined to discuss details of the settlement, but
Romer said the school district had given no financial considerations
or promises to Laidlaw as part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Ron English, director of human relations for Laidlaw, said, "We're
happy to have this labor dispute over."</TE>
<TE>   The beginning of the end of the strike came during a late lunch
Thursday between Rick Middleton and Contreras. Middleton, head of
Teamsters Local 572, which represents the bus drivers, had sought the
intervention of the county Federation of Labor for more than week.</TE>
<TE>   At the lunch, Contreras agreed to provide just that.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras then hastily arranged a dinner meeting with Romer at a
downtown restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting just after 7 p.m., they agreed to call both sides back to
the table Friday, with Contreras pushing the union and Romer bringing
Laidlaw.</TE>

<HD>Convictions of Child Workers to Be Revealed</HD>
<DH>Safety: Law is intended to inform parents, but providers
fear that it will unfairly damage employees' reputations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of parents in California will receive some disturbing
news in the next several weeks: Someone with a criminal record is
working at their child's day-care center.</LD>
<LD>   The information is part of a controversial new state requirement
that orders all facilities to inform parents if an employee at their
center or home was guilty of a crime.</LD>
<LD>   The regulation is intended to keep parents informed, but
child-care providers and several advocacy groups say it will unfairly
sully the reputations of valued employees and unnecessarily cause
panic for parents. They call the regulation a well-intentioned but
misguided way of fixing a flawed background-checking system.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at the Department of Social Services, which oversees
licensed child care, say they are doing their best to balance the
interests of parents and the concerns of providers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very difficult matter for some people, but at the same
time, we have gotten an equal number of calls from parents who are
very eager for this information," said Rita Saenz, director of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   About 6,156 of the 275,148 people licensed to work or interact
with children in child care have a criminal background, according to
Social Services. Their crimes are mostly misdemeanors, such as petty
theft and check forgery, but some have older felonies, such as drug
possession convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Licensed workers include gardeners, cooks, administrators and
maintenance workers, as well as teachers. In private homes in which
there are day-care centers, all adults who live there also must
submit to a background check by the FBI and the Department of
Justice.</TE>
<TE>   If a person's offense is old or minor--and they can show they are
now upstanding citizens--Social Services can grant what are called
criminal exemptions, allowing them to work in child-care facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But late last month, reports in the Orange County Register shed
light on a number of cases in which criminals slipped through the
system and obtained licenses to work in child care.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, on March 21, Gov. Gray Davis ordered a six-month
moratorium on granting criminal exemptions and an immediate review of
child-care background checks. He asked Social Services to adopt
"emergency regulations" requiring child-care providers to inform
parents about employees with criminal exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Social Services ordered that providers have all parents sign a
form acknowledging that they have been advised of any criminal
exemptions at the center. Anyone simultaneously caring for children
from more than one family in their home or center is required to be
licensed if they charge a fee.</TE>
<TE>   But although child-care providers must identify past offenders in
their employ, they are not allowed to name the crime or say when it
occurred. Critics say such vague information will create more
problems than it solves.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates doubt in the mind of the parent, because as a parent I
want all the information," said Sheryl Cohen, director of a
child-care center in Lomita. "But as an administrator, you can't give
them the whole picture. It totally puts you in the middle of this."</TE>
<TE>   The types of crimes that would probably worry parents most--child
molestation and rape--are not crimes for which criminal exemptions
are granted. In California, about 50 crimes, including murder, child
abuse, rape and spousal abuse, bar a person from ever working with
children.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the FBI and Department of Justice databases
fail to turn up convictions, and that is how some people with criminal
records slip into the child-care system. Receiving notice that
someone has been cleared to work with children does not tackle the
problem of spotty background checks, child-care workers said.</TE>
<TE>   Child-care workers say news of the regulations caught them
completely off guard. For weeks, they've been trying to find a way to
comply with the rules without creating hysteria, they said. Some
owners of child-care centers, who asked not to be identified, said
they would no longer hire people with criminal exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   At the Child Care Law Center in San Francisco, lawyers
are receiving several calls a day about the governor's order, said
attorney Christine Cleary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major concern. It's no exaggeration to say this is huge,"
Cleary said.</TE>
<TE>   Many day-care center owners, leery of panic-stricken parents and
lawsuits from employees, have decided to hold off on making any
announcements, but the law center has advised that they comply
immediately or face license suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the law center is not taking an official position on the
new regulation, but it is studying the legal ramifications of the
order.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Social Services say they will not cite people
immediately for failing to notify parents. Officials say most
child-care workers with criminal exemptions are good people who made
mistakes a long time ago.</TE>
<TE>   But conveying such a message might be easier said than done, said
one child-care worker who will soon be outed as a former criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally ashamed of what I did," said the woman, who did not
want her name used.</TE>
<TE>   The preschool teacher was convicted of methamphetamine possession
seven years ago and served several days in jail. She said she turned
her life around, thanks to a drug rehabilitation program, and is
horrified at seeing her past become public. "I don't want to be
looked at badly. I have a hard time telling my mother about this, let
alone strangers. I do everything in my power to make it up to her and
my kids ... to show that I'm not that person anymore. But all they're
going to see is a drug addict," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She says she will probably quit once her name is made public. "I
don't want to cause any trouble for my boss, and I just don't want to
relive my past," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, child-care worker records, like those of teachers
and employees at schools, were confidential in California. But in a
state appellate court ruling in August, CBS News won the right to
examine their names and places of work. Their names and employers
became a matter of public record, although the nature of their crimes
remained confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and workers in kindergarten through 12th grade were not
included in the lawsuit, and their records are still private. "As you
know, schools are fairly public places," said Saenz of Social
Services. "Many of our child-care centers are in family homes."</TE>
<TE>   Some parents would like to know what crime their caregiver
committed so they can make a rational decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has a past; I mean, I myself have done a few things I'm
not proud of," said Dawna Elliot, a Manhattan Beach nurse with a
6-year-old in day care. "We need the full story or else you're going
to say 'Did he molest a child? Does he have a drinking problem?' Your
mind is just going to wonder."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) will soon introduce legislation
that would build upon Davis' order, granting parents access to
information on the specific crimes committed.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate decision on whether a given employee should be
caring for their child should be made by the parents, not by the
operator of a child-care center or the Department of Social
Services," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some children's advocates say broader disclosure rules will not
solve the problem of spotty background checks. Nothing will be
accomplished, they say, by publicizing criminal exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Wilson of the San Francisco-based Coleman Advocates for
Children said: "What problem is it that we're trying to fix? Somehow
the public posting of these ... 'criminal' caregivers doesn't seem to
get us where we need to go."</TE>

<HD>Group Urges More Low-Cost Clinics</HD>
<DH>Public health: Report by community coalition finds that
most of the county's uninsured have little or no access to affordable
treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of Orange County community clinics issued a report Friday
concluding that most of the county's 600,000 uninsured residents have
little or no access to low-cost medical care.</LD>
<LD>   The report is the first salvo in the coalition's efforts to expand
a loosely knit group of community clinics that provide free or
low-cost medical service. The report indicates that to reach even
half of those without health insurance, the clinics would need to
more than double their capacity.</LD>
<LD>   The 19 nonprofit clinics, some in tenuous financial shape, treated
135,000 patients in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The report done by pmpm Consulting Group also showed that the
clinics are so spread out in Orange County that many low-income
residents must travel for hours to receive nonemergency medical
attention. Patients with special needs may not find the care they
need in areas such as cardiology and endocrinology.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are hoping is that this study will turn from paper to
policy," said Jon Dunn, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood
in Orange County and president of a task force working on expansion.</TE>
<TE>   While the officials were releasing their findings Friday, Ingrid
Escobar was making her way to the Share Our Selves Free Medical and
Dental Clinic on Superior Avenue in Costa Mesa. It took three buses
and two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Escobar accompanied her father-in-law, who had complained of chest
pains while at their home near Euclid Street and Ball Road in
Anaheim. Escobar had heard of the Costa Mesa facility from a friend.
The father-in-law received X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a long trip, but it's worth it. When you have the need, you
find the way," said Escobar, who works as a housecleaner. Her husband
is disabled and the family has no health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Earlabaugh-Gordon, executive director of the Coalition of
Orange County Community Clinics, said she hopes county supervisors
will consider the plight of the county's low-income residents and
lobby the state for funding.</TE>
<TE>   The study shows that $25 million to $100 million would be needed
to improve and build facilities and $25 million to $60 million would
be needed each year to keep them running.</TE>
<TE>   So-called Measure H funds, the $5 million annually from a tobacco
settlement, "is just a drop in the bucket," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors did not attend the presentation. But in an
interview later, board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said the county
should look into the matter further.</TE>
<TE>   "The belief is very strong that our community clinics are [a] key
component ... in Orange County," said Coad, whose term ends in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding the clinic system could provide care to people with
chronic illnesses who have nowhere to turn other than emergency
rooms, where the cost of care is higher.</TE>
<TE>   Investing in clinics could save the county money and should be
pursued, Coad said.</TE>

<HD>Condor Chick Is Stained With Oil</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Experts have concerns about the bird's long-term
health. Crude may have come from its father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first California condor brooded and hatched in the wild in 18
years was stained with oil this week, raising concerns about the
chick's long-term health and the effect on the ambitious, $35-million
program to reintroduce the huge black birds into the wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists observing the chick in Los Padres National Forest near
Fillmore say the father apparently stuck its own head in a puddle of
crude oil, then flew back to the nest where the oil got on the
chick's white, downy feathers.</LD>
<LD>   Reports of the oily bird swirled as far as Washington on Friday,
where U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Gale Norton was said to
have the situation "on her radar screen."</LD>
<TE>   Norton, former associate solicitor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in the mid-1980s, defended the agency in court over its
decision to capture all the wild condors and bring them into a
captive breeding program.</TE>
<TE>   Norton "has a major personal and professional stake in this," said
Hugh Vickery, spokesman for the Interior Department. "We hope the
chick survives and continues to do well. If it dies, we would be
unhappy but that wouldn't be the end of the program."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Fouk, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
said the chick "did get a little oil on it, but it wasn't drenched in
oil. We don't consider this a setback, but it's definitely a concern.
If we felt there was a danger, we would consider some sort of an
intervention. A lot is riding on this chick."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials say the amount of oil is too small to cause any
serious problems, but they worry the bird may have ingested oil or
that the father may transfer more of it to the 2-week-old chick.</TE>
<TE>   Excess oil on a bird's feathers reduces its ability to regulate
body heat, often causing death by hypothermia, biologists said. It
can also kill a bird after being absorbed through the skin.</TE>
<TE>   The adult condor apparently was near a newly drilled oil well when
he put his head into a puddle of what it probably thought was water,
said Bruce Palmer coordinator for the California Condor Recovery
Program.</TE>
<TE>   "He ended up getting his head and feathers oiled," Palmer said.
"Condors are very fastidious and he rubbed his head on the grass, but
there is likely still oil on his wing."</TE>
<TE>   If the chick shows any signs of being in trouble, biologists will
rappel down a sandstone cliff to remove the bird from the small cave
deep in the forest where it's nesting with its parents.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a serious danger, I would be the quickest to go in
there," said Mike Wallace of the San Diego Zoo, who is leader for the
California Condor Recovery Team. "This is one of the blips in the
life of a condor. If it had oil on its feathers, it could ingest
those by preening itself, but the amount would be too small to cause
any problems."</TE>
<TE>   But those involved in the condor program say there is much at
stake in the continued survival of the chick and the costly efforts
to reintroduce North America's largest bird into nature.</TE>
<TE>   "To say a lot is riding on this is an understatement," Palmer
said. "This is the first real example of the ramifications of the
reintroduction program. This [chick's birth] is a vindication of the
program."</TE>
<TE>   The condor captive breeding program began in 1985. With extinction
imminent, condors were taken from the wild, bred in captivity and,
starting in 1992, released again.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 63 condors living in the wild in California and
Arizona, 18 in field pens awaiting release and 104 more in captivity.
Most of the wild birds, which can have 9-foot wingspans and weigh
about 20 pounds, live in sanctuaries in Big Sur, Los Padres forest
and Grand Canyon National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Condors have had problems readjusting to nature. Some have been
electrocuted on power lines and others have died after swallowing
bullets while feeding on animal carcasses.</TE>
<TE>   In the condor refuge near Fillmore, there are dozens of oil wells
where the birds perch and occasionally poke around puddles of oil.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer dismisses those who say the bird lacks the intelligence to
flourish in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "Hogwash. They are probably too smart for their own good," he
said. "It brings them into harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the oil, the chick is thriving. Its parents have been
gentle, taking turns feeding and brooding it, say biologists who have
spent recent days observing the pair from a nearby perch.</TE>
<TE>   The condor chick is growing, flapping its stubby wings and is
becoming less and less vulnerable to attacks from ravens and crows.</TE>
<TE>   Two other nests with eggs have been spotted nearby, with another
condor chick expected to hatch early next month.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the bird will be fine," said Michael Barth, a biologist
with the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service at the Hopper Mountain National
Wildlife Refuge near Fillmore that supervises condor recovery efforts
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "It is serious and it threw us a little scare, but I think
everything will be OK," he added.</TE>

<HD>Sun Blocked His Vision, Engineer Says</HD>
<DH>Crash: Darrell Wells said he couldn't distinguish signal
colors. Discrepancy arises over at what point train's brakes were
applied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The engineer of a freight train that crashed head-on into a Metrolink
train killing two passengers and injuring hundreds of others on
Tuesday told police he didn't see a crucial signal before the
collision because sunlight momentarily blinded him.</LD>
<LD>   According to police records released Friday, Burlington Northern
Santa Fe engineer Darrell Wells of Dana Point said he slammed on the
emergency brakes when the Metrolink train came into view, but quickly
realized it was too late to avoid impact.</LD>
<LD>   "As the train approached the grade crossing in the area of Kraemer
Boulevard and Crowther Avenue in the city of Placentia, Wells told me
he could not see the signal'' two miles before the collision, Officer
Kelly Kenehan of the Placentia Police Department wrote in his report.
"Wells said that the sun was very bright behind the signal and he
could not distinguish the colors.''</LD>
<TE>   However, parts of Wells' account are contradicted by evidence made
public this week by investigators for the National Transportation
Safety Board, including the freight train's speed and the time its
emergency brakes were engaged.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB officials have determined that the 67-car freight train
caused the crash after running past a yellow, then a red traffic
signal just before 8:10 a.m. Tuesday. Federal investigators have
ruled out brake and other mechanical failure, track problems and
signal malfunctions.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia officials Friday released excerpts of the incident
reports written by officers who arrived shortly after the accident.
The reports include interviews with the freight train and Metrolink
crews.</TE>
<TE>   Police Friday turned over their reports to the NTSB, which has
sole jurisdiction over the investigation, Placentia Police Det.
Corrine Loomis said.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB investigators reinterviewed crew members Wednesday and
Thursday. Spokesman Ted Lopatkiewick declined to disclose what the
crew members told the NTSB. The NTSB's report is expected in nine
months to a year.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink engineer Michael Dudgeon, in a written statement to
police, said that as he approached the grade crossing at the
intersection of Orangethorpe Avenue and Richfield Road he saw
"headlights and [other] lights ahead of our train."</TE>
<TE>   "I then placed the train in emergency immediately, without
hesitation," Dudgeon said.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink train had been powered by a rear locomotive, so the
lead car carried passengers, as well as the engineer in a
front-facing cab.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink conductor Patrick Phillips, interviewed at Kaiser
Permanente Anaheim Medical Center four hours after the crash, told
officers he heard the engineer hit the emergency brake and then saw
Dudgeon dash out of the cab and into the passenger compartment of the
first car.</TE>
<TE>   "Phillips said he then saw the engineer run past him saying 'Duck
and tuck!' and 'We're going to hit!' or something of that nature,"
according to a report filed by Officer Mike Roach.</TE>
<TE>   "The engineer also had said something like 'Santa Fe ran a red
one,'" meaning the Santa Fe [freight train] had gone through a red
signal."</TE>
<TE>   The engineer of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight told
police he hit the emergency brake near the intersection of Tustin and
Orangethorpe avenues, about a mile from the crash point.</TE>
<TE>   As the train continued down the track, Wells said he spotted a red
signal light warning him to stop, about a a third of a mile before
impact.</TE>
<TE>   However, NTSB investigators said the freight train's event
recorder showed that the freight train begin to brake about a third
of a mile before the Metrolink train, near the red signal light. If
Wells had hit the brakes a mile away, the collision might have been
avoided, NTSB officials said earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   About two miles from the accident site, a yellow light signaled to
the engineer that he should slow to 30 mph and be prepared to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Wells told police that when he failed to see that signal because
of the blinding sunlight, he slowed the freight train to 40 to 42 mph
as a precaution "until he was able to see the next signal and
determine what speed he should be traveling at."</TE>
<TE>   But NTSB officials said the freight train sped up after passing
the yellow light, and was traveling at 48 mph when the emergency
brake was applied.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators Thursday tested track conditions using a
train identical to that involved in the crash, and at the same time
of day the crash occurred. They found that the signal lights were
working and visible. However, NTSB lead investigator Mike Flanigon
said the sky might have been more overcast Thursday than on the day
of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Wells told police he began his shift near Los Angeles at 2:30 a.m.
the day of the crash, and was destined for New Mexico. His departure
was scheduled for 2:30 a.m., but was delayed until 7:30 a.m. because
of scheduling conflicts, he told police.</TE>
<TE>   BNSF officials on Friday declined to comment about the accident,
and referred all inquires to the NTSB.</TE>
<TE>   Results from blood tests administered immediately after the
crash--a routine procedure after a major incident--showed no sign of
alcohol use by any crew member.</TE>
<TE>   Tests for drug use also were administered, but the results were
not available Friday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the reports released Friday, one of the injured
Metrolink passengers was pregnant. When Kenehan entered the passenger
car, he saw her lying on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "She was complaining of severe pain in her stomach, and told me
that her water broke," Kenehan said in his report. The officer said
he radioed for paramedics, who quickly arrived. Her name and
condition were unavailable Friday.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans, Denounced for Pollution, Vows Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Environment: Water agencies demand it stem runoff. O.C.
district among worst in state in controlling erosion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caltrans faces mounting criticism from water regulators and
environmentalists over polluted runoff flowing from state highways
and construction projects into environmentally sensitive areas across
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Two local water agencies have issued cease-and-desist orders
against Caltrans, demanding that it stem the tide of runoff from the
San Joaquin Hills tollway and along a stretch of Pacific Coast
Highway near Crystal Cove State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, internal Caltrans reviews have shown that the Orange
County regional district had among the worst, if not the worst,
compliance record in the state when it comes to controlling erosion
at its construction sites.</LD>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said Friday they are taking steps to fix the
problems.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the cease-and-desist orders, Caltrans is finalizing
plans to install improved storm water controls on the San Joaquin
Hills tollway as well as parts of Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Caltrans says it is making significant improvements to
reduce erosion from road projects.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, officials at Caltrans' District 12 office,
which covers Orange County, acknowledged a poor performance record
over the last few years but said they are beginning to reverse that
trend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the first to admit we've had problems," said Hank Alonso, a
deputy director for the district. "But our latest results show
substantial improvements."</TE>
<TE>   The moves come amid efforts by environmental watchdogs and water
regulators to get Caltrans to comply with federal and state
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The regulations require that agencies attempt to clean
contaminants from storm water and other urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   The toxic brew that washes off highways includes lead from vehicle
exhaust, copper dust from brakes, oil leaking from vehicles, animal
waste and other pollutants that could harm humans and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much evidence now of harm, I can't think there is any
thinking person who says this does not matter," said Terry Tamminen,
executive director of Environment Now, a Los Angeles nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest cases involves the San Joaquin Hills tollway,
which stretches from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. Nearly 40
storm filters that were installed to handle the water flow from the
freeway have been deemed faulty and are not being maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso said Friday that Caltrans will soon begin the first phase
of a $13-million project to repair the filters or replace them with a
variety of experimental treatment systems, including catch basins and
skimmers.</TE>
<TE>   At Crystal Cove, a state park between Newport Beach and Laguna
Beach, Caltrans was found by a state water agency to be unlawfully
discharging storm water through outfall drains that run from Pacific
Coast Highway into the Irvine Coast Marine Life Refuge, one of the
state's two dolphin birthing grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso said Friday that Caltrans was preparing to submit a remedy
for Crystal Cove by May. It hopes to comply with the cease-and-desist
order by 2003. Under the $2-million plan, water would be diverted
into nearby Muddy Creek and Los Trancos Creek, filtered through
vegetative beds.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is also trying to address problems identified in internal
reviews conducted since 1997 to see how well the agency is complying
with storm water provisions of the Clean Water Act at construction
sites.</TE>
<TE>   In these studies, Orange County has consistently ranked as one of
the top offenders among all Caltrans districts when it comes to
controlling erosion.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest review, which covered the rainy season from October
2000 to April 2001, the county had the worst record, with more than
half of the 18 projects inspected found to have either critical or
major deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Critical deficiencies" are the most serious violation and require
immediate correction under Caltrans criteria. They involve actual
erosion and siltation unlawfully reaching storm drains, with a
potential of discharging hazardous waste. For example, at a
construction yard where heavy equipment is stored, gasolines or oils
may have been spilled.</TE>
<TE>   "Major deficiencies" require immediate attention and include
unprotected slopes, conditions that can lead to potential discharges
of sediment or hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   One local environmental group, Orange County Coastkeeper, has sent
a letter of complaint to the Caltrans' Orange County director
expressing concern that the construction zone runoff violates the
Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been lots of bad grades handed out when it rains,"
added Richard Horner, storm water consultant for the National
Resources Defense Council, which has successfully sued Caltrans over
runoff issues in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Horner agrees with Caltrans officials' argument that the
reviews show how willing the agency is to police itself and improve
its performance record.</TE>
<TE>   "Headquarters appears to be concerned about this. It is one of the
better things Caltrans does. They are quite critical and the
conclusions are not sugar-coated."</TE>

<LD>An 18-year-old man was on life support and two other men were wounded
in a drive-by shooting on Roscoe Boulevard in Sun Valley, authorities
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Alejandro Padilla of Arleta was shot once in the head
Thursday night as the Chevy Suburban he was riding in was riddled
with bullets near Webb Avenue, said Det. Vince Bancroft of the Los
Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police that three or four men were in a turquoise
compact car that fled east on Roscoe after the 10:15 p.m. shooting.
The assailants first spotted the SUV leaving a gas station and caught
up to it near Webb Avenue, where at least one man opened fire,
Bancroft said.</LD>
<TE>   Padilla was sitting in the back seat of the Suburban. An
unidentified 26-year-old man also was riding in the SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft said the Suburban's 18-year-old driver got on the Golden
State Freeway, but his vehicle was losing fluids from bullet holes in
the radiator. The driver stopped near the Sheldon Street exit, where
a Caltrans crew and a California Highway Patrol officer helped the
men, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was taken to a local hospital and the other two were
treated and released from County-USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting is believed to be gang-related, Bancroft said.</TE>

<HD>350 Mourn Pilot Killed at Air Show</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, who crashed at Point
Mugu, is remembered as a practical joker, part-time actor and role
model.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The pilot's nickname was "Storm" and he charged through life like
one, a bright-eyed, energetic force on the ground and in the sky.</LD>
<LD>   More than 350 mourners packed Santa Clara Church in Oxnard on
Friday to pay respects to Navy Cmdr. Michael Todd Norman, 39, one of
two aviators killed April 20 when their military jet crashed at the
Point Mugu Air Show and exploded before thousands of spectators.</LD>
<LD>   As investigators continued their probe of the accident that killed
the Camarillo father of two and his 31-year-old navigator, Marine
Corps Capt. Andrew Muhs, Norman's family and friends who gathered at
the church sang, sobbed and remembered.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Jon Majarucon told mourners that pilots see each plane as
"a wondrous vehicle with which to access the sky. In many ways, they
see the world as God sees it.</TE>
<TE>   "His flying," Majarucon said, "gave him a perspective on life that
not many people have."</TE>
<TE>   Norman's wife, Sylvia, 3-year-old daughter, Nicole, and 7-week-old
daughter, Brooke, sat in the pews during the 90-minute service, along
with the pilot's mother, brother and sister. Norman's father died
earlier this year, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   A North Carolina native, Norman trained as a military pilot in
Florida and Texas after graduation from Western Carolina University.
After arriving at Point Mugu in 1991, he met his future wife while
exercising at a local fitness center. The couple recently bought a
home in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Norman's deployments took him across the world, to
Oman, Alaska and the Philippines. He won several commendations,
including the Meritorious Service and National Defense medals.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a blessing to us, such a great role model," said his
brother-in-law, Carlos Amaro of Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard about Mike eight years ago, I have to admit I
was a little leery," Amaro told the mourners, laughing through his
tears. "[My sister] told me this Southern guy with an accent was
checking her out."</TE>
<TE>   But Norman quickly won the family over. For his first meeting with
his future in-laws, he had Sylvia tell her parents that Norman had
just gotten a toupee and that they were not to stare at his head. In
reality, there was no toupee; the hair was his. The Amaros struggled
to stay quiet, but finally blurted out, "Oh, Mike, it looks so real!"
Carlos Amaro recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Norman left active duty in 1993 and became a commercial pilot with
American Airlines, based in Los Angeles. He dabbled in acting.
Relatives said he had a bit part in an episode of the TV show "JAG"
and in an independent film.</TE>
<TE>   As a reservist, he twice volunteered to return to active duty,
first in 1997 and again last summer, for what was to be a three-year
stint.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Vietnam-era fighter jet he was flying last week, a
QF-4 Phantom, peeled away from formation and pitched into a marsh,
Norman had logged more than 3,000 high-performance flight hours on
Phantoms, Goshawks and other craft.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Norman liked to brag in a good-natured fashion and believed in
heaven as a resting place for the virtuous, Amaro said. "I can just
picture Mike running to the gates of heaven with a huge smile on his
face and saying, 'Man, I am so good!'"</TE>

<HD>Personal Change With a Global Goal</HD>
<DH>Values: A Pasadena ministry is part of a growing movement
among people of faith to challenge practices of corporate
globalization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marty E. Coleman, a longtime member of All Saints Church in Pasadena,
now grows her own vegetables, shops at Vroman's independent bookstore
instead of national chains and recycles her clothes. The
transformation of her personal consumer habits started with a book
that, at first glance, seems to have nothing to do with religion.</LD>
<LD>   "When Corporations Rule the World," by former Harvard business
professor and international development official David C. Korten,
argues that the global economic order has promoted deepening poverty,
inequality, environmental devastation and social disintegration.</LD>
<LD>   Those premises are hotly disputed by some, but they found a
receptive audience in Coleman, the former social justice minister for
All Saints, a liberal Episcopal congregation.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Aha! That's why things aren't working,'" recalled
Coleman, who has joined demonstrations for nuclear disarmament, an
end to apartheid and higher wages for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Now Coleman and a core group of friends have launched a new
ministry called Sustainable World to bring issues raised by Korten to
a wider audience. They are part of a growing movement among people of
faith to challenge corporate globalization, which some predict may
eventually rival the impact of religious-based civil rights work more
than three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   The ministry began last fall after Coleman and others organized 10
church reading groups on Korten's book--which has provoked sometimes
heated debate within All Saints.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the ministry held its debut event: a weekend
conference featuring Korten and other speakers that drew more than
300 people across the faith spectrum--from liberal Episcopalians to
conservative evangelical Christians from the neighboring Fuller
Theological Seminary. The forum drew nearly twice as many people as
planners expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We carry this banner that our faith is fundamentally about
building a just and peaceful world," said Max Miller, who helped
organize the Korten reading circles as the All Saints coordinator of
small groups. "The Korten book shared our moral perspective--that our
society needs to be accountable to care for all."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said the book helped connect the dots between the poverty
and environmental problems they have cared about for so long and
global corporate operations--how some corporate coffee growers have
yanked out rain forests for massive coffee groves, for instance. Or
how global trade agreements have helped powerful commercial interests
put scores of local farmers out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Korten's book also argues that a growing concentration of
corporate power in the hands of fewer wealthy elites is threatening
democracy here and abroad, and that the ethos of ever-increasing
economic growth is overtaxing the world's natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   The author's proposed solutions include the radical--an end to the
publicly traded, limited liability corporation that values the bottom
line above all else. But they also include more easily attainable
steps, such as supporting local businesses--a call Coleman heeds in
shopping at farmers' markets and buying books at Vroman's.</TE>
<TE>   The dawning awareness of the darker consequences of corporate
globalization--which has also lowered prices, created jobs and broken
down cultural and communication barriers around the world--is
beginning to galvanize what Korten calls the "most global social
movement in human history."</TE>
<TE>   The 45,000 protesters who stunned the world with demonstrations
against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999 have
ballooned to hundreds of thousands of dissidents at global economic
meetings in Europe, Asia, and Latin and North America.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they galvanized the civil-rights movement, churches are
emerging as an increasingly important player in challenging corporate
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Korten said that many of his invitations to speak today are coming
from faith communities, which he says are driven by moral and ethical
values capable of challenging the primacy of the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "If any institution of society can help liberate the mind from the
hypnotic trance of the current system, it should be the church," said
Korten, a burly and bearded man who no longer identifies with the
Christianity of his boyhood, but says his work today is motivated by
a "universal spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Korten, who was raised as a Republican and groomed to take over
the family business in Washington state, said he began to open his
eyes to the problems of corporate globalization as an international
development officer with the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Agency for
International Development during the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   He said development projects often impoverished communities more
than enriched them, citing examples he had seen: a Japanese-financed
copper smelting plant in the Philippines that poisoned the local
environment; the planned eviction of millions of rural people in
Thailand to make room for commercial tree farms; the geothermal
projects that destroyed farm and forest land to meet the energy
demands of export-oriented industries.</TE>
<TE>   After two decades in Asia, Korten returned to the U.S. in 1992 to
work for change. To that end, he lectures, writes and helped launch
the Positive Futures Network (www.futurenet.org), based on Bainbridge
Island outside Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   But the former Harvard professor's views are controversial, and
have caused debates even within All Saints--a wealthy congregation
that includes top corporate leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people feel the book is off base, and think Korten's ideas
are threatening the American free-enterprise system," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture was also criticized
by some for co-sponsoring the recent conference featuring Korten,
according to Grace Dyrness, the center's associate director. She said
some people suggested that corporations should have been represented
as well. Dyrness said the center and others might follow up with
another gathering--perhaps a global conference--that will include
their voices.</TE>
<TE>   Dyrness said the USC center intends to launch a worldwide survey
soon on how actively churches are mobilizing on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In her own travels, she said, she has encountered or heard of
pastors in places as far-flung as Nigeria, Guyana and Italy intent on
examining the impact of corporate globalization on their own
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "People of faith are saying, 'This world isn't working, and what
can we do about it?'" Dyrness said. "For many of them, it is a
mandate that comes out of their sacred scriptures to be a good
steward and to love your neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   At All Saints, the Sustainable World ministry already has an
ambitious list of projects planned. The group plans several
educational events, including a May seminar on how to live more
simply and a June lecture on the consequences of world trade
agreements and organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The ministry also plans to investigate globalization's impact
first-hand with visits to maquiladora plants at the Nogales border
and the sweatshop district in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the group expects to join the growing move to support
the purchase of "fair trade coffee" --organic coffee produced by
local worker-owned cooperatives that guarantee decent wages.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, more than 500 Presbyterian and Unitarian
Universalist congregations across the country have signed up for the
program.</TE>
<TE>   If the recent conference is any guide, the activities are likely
to draw widespread interest.</TE>
<TE>   On the conference's last day, for an hour after Korten was
supposed to end his remarks, more than 50 people stayed on, peppering
him with questions. Coleman said it was the first time she had ever
seen a speaker draw such response in her two decades at All Saints.</TE>
<TE>   A refugee from Rwanda now studying at the Fuller seminary thanked
Korten for "telling the story we don't usually hear." A Chinese
immigrant from Thailand told him he was right on the money; the
immigrant had witnessed how large development projects impoverished
the rural people--money spent to erect golf courses instead of
bringing people clean water, she said. An American horticulturist and
her husband said the conference made them feel for the first time
that they were not alone in their deep unease about society's
mounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disconnected with nature. People are hungry; there is no
community," said John Thurman, 27, a graduate student in psychology.
"If we continue to live this way, the world can't sustain us and
we'll collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," he said, "I have hope."</TE>

<HD>Would-Be Robber Beaten With Helmet</HD>

<LD>A would-be robber ran from a Newport Beach apartment bloodied early
Friday after one of his intended victims beat him over the head with
a Miami Dolphins football helmet, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whom the apartment's residents knew as Randy, was among
several guests invited the night before to watch a basketball game on
television, investigators said. He left the apartment at 7311
Seashore Drive about 2 a.m. and returned shortly before 4:30 a.m.,
according to police and victims.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Darren Smetzer, 34, said he was in the living room
watching television and didn't hear the man's knock on the door.
Instead, his roommate, Wayne "Denny" Corder, 34, got out of bed to
answer it. When Corder let him in, the residents said, the man pulled
a gun and ordered the pair to kneel on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   A third roommate, Parry O'Keefe, 42, said he walked into the fray.
He was ordered onto the floor as well, and the gunman began demanding
money from the trio, O'Keefe said. The gunman pulled a roll of duct
tape from his pocket and told Corder to bind his roommates' hands. As
the gunman headed for a hallway, Corder tackled the man, and Smetzer
grabbed the helmet and began beating him, he and police said.</TE>
<TE>   After a short struggle, the suspect dropped the gun, ran out and
sped off in a red convertible Mazda RX7, leaving a trail of blood.
Police were still investigating Friday. The roommates, meanwhile,
tried to make sense of what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We opened our home to him, and then he comes back with a gun,"
O'Keefe said. "I thought I was going to die."</TE>

<HD>Student Guilty of Plotting Massacre</HD>
<DH>Court: Man faces up to 100 years in prison for possessing
and planning to use an arsenal of guns and homemade bombs at
Cupertino campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CLARA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A man who assembled an arsenal of guns and homemade bombs while
plotting a killing spree of fellow students at De Anza College was
convicted Friday on 108 counts of possessing and planning to use
those weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Al Joseph DeGuzman, 20, whose diary indicated that he intended to
copy the massacre carried out by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., could face up to 100 years
in prison.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose Superior Court Judge Robert Ahern announced his verdict
Friday morning. The trial was held without a jury because DeGuzman's
attorneys worried that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks would influence
jurors.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said during the trial that DeGuzman was hours away
from attacking students at the Cupertino college in January 2001 when
a photo lab clerk alerted police after developing snapshots of
DeGuzman's arsenal of homemade weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was the correct decision by the court, but it's not a
great surprise," said prosecutor Thomas Farris. "We'll never know
what was averted, but we know the potential was very high he was
going to hurt someone."</TE>
<TE>   DeGuzman was convicted on 54 counts each of possessing a
destructive device and possessing a destructive device with intent to
harm. Eight other counts were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Ahern dismissed six counts of possessing a destructive device
because the charges involved Molotov cocktails that did not have
wicks, meaning they did not qualify as destructive devices. One count
each of possessing a sawed-off shotgun and possessing a sawed-off
rifle were dismissed because of clerical errors.</TE>
<TE>   DeGuzman showed little emotion, glancing briefly at family members
and friends as the verdicts were read. Sentencing was set for June
25.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Craig Wormley said DeGuzman was disappointed and
immediately asked how long he'd have to spend in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention all along was [to show] that he never intended to
kill anyone. We still believe that," Wormley said. "He's extremely
remorseful that he's putting his family through this."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles City Hall was formally rededicated Friday in an elaborate
ceremony designed to make the seismically retrofitted structure a
symbol of municipal unity just as the city faces a secession
movement.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the City Hall of Venice, of San Pedro and of Valley
Village," Mayor James K. Hahn told a crowd of about 1,000. "This is
the City Hall of a great, great city. Some want to break up this
city, but I don't think we should allow that to happen."</LD>
<LD>   Friday was the 74th anniversary of the original dedication of City
Hall. After the $299-million modernization was completed last summer,
an earlier rededication had been planned, but the terrorist attacks
of Sept.11 inspired security precautions that caused a delay.</LD>
<TE>   The new date allowed officials to plan a ceremony they hoped would
prove a powerful argument for unity. They hung huge photographs of
the first dedication from the west portico and retained actor Kent
McCord to read the 1928 dedication address.</TE>
<TE>   "This monument symbolizes the soul of struggling, fighting,
building people, never knowing defeat and always climbing upward,
until today it may be said of them: This is their city. They have
created it; they have transformed it from a sleepy Spanish-California
pueblo to one of the mightiest communities of a continent," he read.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe the words of 1928 still apply, said Edward Avila,
head of Project Restore, the nonprofit corporation that shepherded
the renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "This city, like City Hall, has changed dramatically, but the
interests of its people are the same,'' Avila said after the
ceremony. "It would be in the best interest of all of the citizens of
Los Angeles to retain the city as it is today. That is the best way
to retain all of the services we have today."</TE>
<TE>   The project began during the Bradley administration after the 1987
Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused some damage at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The project was subject to sharp debate after Richard Riordan
replaced Tom Bradley as mayor. Riordan, stung by ever-growing cost
estimates, wanted to restrict the work to seismic retrofitting and
not a broad modernization of the building. A blue-ribbon panel
appointed by Riordan and then-City Controller Rick Tuttle proposed a
$165-million plan.</TE>
<TE>   But the council opted instead for a broader plan, with an eventual
price tag of $299 million, that included a refurbished City Council
chamber, new council offices and conference rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The renovated City Hall is now designed to be able to withstand an
8.1 magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas fault, 40 miles north of
the city, and a 6.8 quake on the Elysian Park fault, which passes
only a mile away.</TE>

<HD>Benny Hinn Relentlessly Seeks Souls, Money</HD>
<DH>Evangelism: The popular faith healer brushes off criticism
of his long-running television ministry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GRAPEVINE, Texas--If Benny Hinn puts on a remarkable television show,
the view from his side of the camera is even more incredible.</LD>
<LD>   Looking into viewers' homes recently, the evangelist spotted a
bald, overweight man with a heart problem. Wearing a yellow shirt.</LD>
<LD>   Hinn said he could see the man walking away from his TV, resisting
appeals to donate during a Trinity Broadcasting Network
"Praise-a-Thon."</LD>
<TE>   "Come back," Hinn begged. "If you will come back and make that
pledge, God will heal your heart tonight."</TE>
<TE>   It was vintage Hinn: charismatic, even outrageous, melding the
promise of healing with support for the network that broadcasts his
show.</TE>
<TE>   Such claims, of course, are the hallmark of some TV evangelists.
But though others like Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker and Robert Tilton
have fallen from grace over the last two decades, Hinn plows ahead,
relentlessly seeking souls and money.</TE>
<TE>   Like some colleagues, he embraces his worldwide followers who say
he has cured them, like heavyweight boxing champion Evander
Holyfield, who has credited Hinn with correcting his heart problem.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, he brushes off scrutiny, though not always
gracefully. He once wished aloud for a "Holy Ghost machine gun" to
blow off the heads of his critics, who object to everything from his
unverifiable healing claims to his perfectly coiffed hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a great showman who understands how to utilize both
media and the stage in order to manipulate the audience," said
Stephen Winzenburg, a communications professor at Grand View College
in Des Moines, Iowa, who monitors evangelists' broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Hinn's "This Is Your Day" program appears on the Trinity
Broadcasting Network and airs in 190 countries.</TE>
<TE>   His crusades around the world draw thousands who hope the
diminutive preacher will zap them with the power he says he absorbs
from the graves of dead faith healers. The lucky ones end up on
stage, where, with a motion of Hinn's hand, they are overcome,
dropping helplessly into the arms of a "catcher."</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him for many years, and he's doing a world of good
with hundreds of thousands of people," said Freda Lindsay, co-founder
of Christ for the Nations, a Dallas-based church-building ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay, 88, shares Hinn's belief in faith healing and said prayer
cured her of tuberculosis. "Benny Hinn is very sincere," she said. "I
would vouch for him that he's a man of God. He's not a phony."</TE>
<TE>   Though Swaggart's and Bakker's highflying ministries were leveled
by sex scandals, and Tilton was brought down by reports of false
promises and a legal battle with his first wife, Hinn has tripped
over no such obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a charm and a charisma that some of the other television
evangelists don't have," Winzenburg said. "He's no threat. He's
someone people feel that they can approach."</TE>
<TE>   The man who was the white-suited inspiration for Steve Martin in
the movie "Leap of Faith" has been conducting public healings for
nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Benedictus Hinn, 49, was born in Israel to a Greek father and an
Armenian mother, according to the 1999 book "Religious Leaders of
America." His mother named him after Patriarch Benedictus of the
Greek Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, he was embarrassed by a stuttering problem--an
impediment he says was later healed by God. He attended Roman
Catholic schools and says he had his first religious experience at
11.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Jesus walk into my bedroom," he writes in "He Touched Me,"
his 1999 autobiography. "He was wearing a robe that was whiter than
white and a deep red mantle was draped over his shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   The family later moved to Toronto, Canada, where Hinn was "saved."
Relatives were baffled, and his father got him an appointment with a
psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   The defining moment in his life came in 1973 when he attended a
service in Pittsburgh by the late faith healer Kathryn Kuhlman.</TE>
<TE>   It is often suggested that Hinn has fashioned himself in her
image, and he frequently mentions her influence. He has written a
book about Kuhlman's life but says he never knew her personally.</TE>
<TE>   "He's copied her act almost to the letter," said Joe Nickell,
author of "Looking for a Miracle." "She wore white gowns with gold
trim. He wears white suits with gold jewelry."</TE>
<TE>   In "He Touched Me," Hinn writes that seeing Kuhlman simply pointed
him in the right direction. That path led back to Toronto, where by
1974 he was conducting his own healing services.</TE>
<TE>   He moved his operations to Orlando, Fla., in 1983, where he
married Suzanne Harthern, the daughter of an Assemblies of God
minister. (Hinn calls himself a Pentecostal.) He rose rapidly to
become one of the best-known healing evangelists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he moved his corporate headquarters to Dallas-Fort Worth,
noting that the ministry's legal and accounting firms were already in
the area. Hinn lives in Southern California, home of his World Media
Center, which houses his television production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Hinn nor ministry representatives responded to numerous
interview requests made through World Healing Center Church Inc., his
headquarters in Grapevine.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people work at the Texas office, located along a busy
freeway a few miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Inside the unadorned building, a hallway is lined with large pictures
showing the healer in action.</TE>
<TE>   Hinn has not joined the Evangelical Council for Financial
Accountability, a sort of Christian Better Business Bureau to which
evangelists such as Billy Graham belong. Nor has he revealed his
salary, although he told CNN in 1997 that his yearly income including
book royalties was between $500,000 and $1 million. A spokesman has
said Hinn generates about $60 million a year in donations.</TE>
<TE>   Once questioned about driving a Mercedes-Benz, he answered: "Where
in the Bible does it say I have to drive a Honda?"</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics' objections go beyond fund-raising. They question his
grandiose pronouncements, his motives and his so-called healings,
which they say may harm sick people who abandon conventional medical
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Hinn says he encourages people to keep taking their medicine and
seeing their doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a false prophet. He banks on the fact that people are going
to forget what he has previously said," said Hank Hanegraaff, who
heads the California-based Christian Research Institute and is host
of radio's "Bible Answer Man."</TE>
<TE>   Hanegraaff notes that Hinn claimed the world would end by 1999 and
that Cuban President Fidel Castro would die in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Hinn, who once said women originally were designed to give birth
from their sides, is used to being criticized.</TE>
<TE>   "I do admit there have been times when I have made a statement
that was incorrect," Hinn once wrote. "Because we are continually
growing in the Lord, preachers and lay people alike must be open to
the Lord's correction.</TE>
<TE>   "However, I do not believe it is right when a minister corrects
his theology--or his view on a point of Scripture--and the critics
continue to bring up that same subject."</TE>

<HD>Issa Stop for Speeding Confirmed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) was stopped by a Border Patrol agent
in December for speeding on Interstate 5, the agency confirmed
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A Border Patrol spokesman said although the agency does not have
authority to enforce speeding laws, it sometimes stops motorists who
are seen speeding and in some cases detains them until the California
Highway Patrol arrives.</LD>
<LD>   The incident involving Issa was first reported in the North County
Times, a newspaper in northern San Diego County. The paper said it
had received a copy of a Border Patrol memo stating that Issa was
stopped Dec. 1 for driving 90 mph near San Clemente, where the speed
limit is 65 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The newspaper said the memo indicated that Issa argued with the
agent and told him that he did not have authority to stop him for
speeding. The Border Patrol declined to release or discuss the memo
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Neugebauer, the first-term congressman's chief of staff, said
someone is attempting to embarrass Issa because of legislation he is
sponsoring that would make it easier to fire employees of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which includes the Border
Patrol. Issa also wants a study done to determine if the San Clemente
checkpoint should be closed.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there is a very upset employee who leaked this memo as
an act of retaliation," Neugebauer said.</TE>
<TE>   Issa had a separate run-in with authorities last year. On Oct. 4,
he was denied permission to board an Air France plane at Washington's
Dulles International Airport to accompany another congressman on a
10-day trip to the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Issa, who is Lebanese American, said he was the victim of racial
profiling. An Air France spokesman said Issa was blocked from the
plane because he arrived late.</TE>

<HD>State Bill Targets Slumlords</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Proposal would force apartment owners to live
in their buildings to ensure safety codes are met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community leaders and police officers have tried for years to control
a problematic apartment complex in a crime-ridden North Hills
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, lawmakers announced a new approach to dealing with
troubled buildings: legislation that would force apartment owners to
live in their complexes to ensure that safety measures are
implemented.</LD>
<LD>   "It is time that building owners take responsibility for cleaning
up nuisance properties that serve as a haven for illegal activity,
and bring long-overdue safety to our communities," said City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo.</LD>
<TE>   If passed, the bill, introduced by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood), could affect thousands of complexes in Los Angeles and
throughout the state, Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, Koretz and Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla stood in front of the North Hills apartment complex, where
from August 1999 to February 2001 police reported 21 drug-related
arrests, several shootings and a homicide, according to Gretchen
Smith, a deputy city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Smith worked with Tim Kirkpatrick, a Los Angeles Police Department
narcotics investigator, for more than two years to get an injunction
against the owner of the complex in an attempt to curtail alleged
drug activity and other crimes there.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkpatrick said drug sales have taken place inside the laundry
room, in the parking lot and in front of the building. Some dealers
were tenants, or knew people who lived in the complex.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction asked for more lighting, surveillance cameras and a
working security gate, as well as better tenant screening. However,
the owner sold the property before the injunction was secured and
left the place a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed legislation would make it more difficult to transfer
ownership of a property to avoid making changes and would require
owners to "witness firsthand the problems in their apartments,"
Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll put them in the laundry room if we have to," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the building's sale in September, 50 people were
living in its six units, said Daron Campbell, managing partner for
Apartment Sales Group Inc., a Sherman Oaks real estate firm.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said the problems his company inherited when it purchased
the property will be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm done with the work here, I want this place to be a place
that I am willing to live in."</TE>

<HD>Lisa Lopes, 30; Topped Charts With Band TLC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, the most recognizable and flamboyant member of
the R&amp;B trio TLC, died Thursday in a car crash in Honduras, adding a
tragic new twist to the group's famously tumultuous and historically
successful pop career.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Lopes said Friday that the 30-year-old musician
died from head injuries suffered while driving a rented sport utility
vehicle that flipped over.</LD>
<LD>   The Mitsubishi Montero was packed with seven people, among them
Lopes' two siblings, and although some of the passengers were
reportedly injured, the details were sketchy Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "The car rolled for reasons that we still don't know and that are
being investigated," local police spokesman Luis Aguilar told the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The singer frequently visited Honduras and during this visit was
performing volunteer work with children, her publicist said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The death of the pixieish Lopes will only add to the melodrama of
Atlanta-based TLC, which is nearly as famous for its travails as for
the savvy and sensual brand of urban feminism displayed in such hits
as "No Scrubs," "Waterfalls," "Unpretty" and "Creep."</TE>
<TE>   With only three albums released, TLC has sold more albums than any
other female group in pop history.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes made headlines on her own too, including a 1994 confession
to charges that she burned down the Atlanta mansion of her boyfriend,
professional football star Andre Rison. That incident, along with the
group's feuds and bankruptcy, made TLC a classic example of the
wrenching roller- coaster of pop fame.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we go down in history for being something more than just
another famous act that got ripped off....This is a cutthroat
business full of greedy individuals who take advantage of naive young
artists," Lopes told The Times in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes, Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins and Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas not only
found commercial success with the early 1990s R&amp;B revival known as
"new Jill swing," but also fashioned themselves as message musicians.
Their topics ranged from the dangers of gangs and AIDS in
"Waterfalls" to the more mundane neighborhood louts they called out
in "No Scrubs." The group won four Grammys through the years.</TE>
<TE>   "We had all grown up together and were as close as a family,"
Watkins and Thomas said Friday in a joint statement. "Today we have
truly lost our sister."</TE>
<TE>   Pain and the push for success were part of Lopes' life since
childhood. Born in Philadelphia in May 1971, she was one of three
children and was raised in a home she once described as a "boot
camp." She was an artistic child, and her father, a military veteran,
pushed her through talent contests and punished her physically for
failure, she told Vibe magazine. "He looked at me like I was the
brightest [in the family] and expected more from me," she said. "I
always got beaten before they did."</TE>
<TE>   She said her father also used alcohol to bond with his young
daughter. "He gave me my first drink," she told Vibe, "and my
hundredth." Her father died when she 17, four years before she would
become a success with the fledgling TLC.</TE>
<TE>   The TLC story began in 1991 when R&amp;B singer Pebbles assembled the
group, became its manager and got the band a record deal with a
nascent label called LaFace. One of LaFace's co-owners, Antonio
"L.A." Reid, was then married to Pebbles, whose real name is Perri
Reid. The TLC success would drive LaFace up the charts, but the
group's financial battles would split the Reid marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The 1992 hits "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg" and "Baby, Baby, Baby" gave
the group quick success. Lopes, with a high, rapid-fire delivery,
would become a flamboyant face for the group. In performance, she
covered the left lens of her eyeglasses with a packaged condom,
creating a signature visual for the group and popularizing her "Left
Eye" nickname.</TE>
<TE>   The Lopes persona would become the frenetic third of TLC, and when
the group's 1994 smash album "CrazySexyCool" was described as having
a self-referencing title, there was no doubt that the "crazy" one was
the diminutive Lopes. "All three of the members are extremely
original and unique, and Lisa was the extrovert," music video and
film director Hype Williams said Friday. "She had this crazy energy,
and anybody who knew her can tell you that. She was spur of the
moment and one of the most creative people I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Williams directed the futuristic images of the video for the
single "No Scrubs," which hit No. 1 in 1999 and became a sensation in
nightclubs, where women would cheer its admonishment of parasitic
boyfriends. The sexual politics and slinky harmonies were a critical
sensation as well--"No Scrubs" was selected as the best single of
1999 by the 489 music critics surveyed by the Village Voice in its
annual music poll.</TE>
<TE>   If TLC's brand name ends with the death of Lopes, the group will
still go down in pop history as a powerhouse. It has sold 14 million
albums in the United States, according to SoundScan, and its
worldwide sales top 25 million copies. The Supremes, one of the
archetypes of the R&amp;B "girl groups," trail in albums sold but have
the most No. 1 singles for a female group: 12, triple TLC's total.</TE>
<TE>   The problems with TLC's ledgers, though, may be just as historic.
The group filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995, the same year
"CrazySexyCool" was the year's second-best-selling album.</TE>
<TE>   The group's early contracts with manager Reid and its label became
sources of bitter contention. Lopes told The Times in 1996 that the
members had received less than 1% of the estimated $175 million in
revenues their sales had then generated, although LaFace and its
larger partner, Arista Records, strongly disputed those claims. The
money issues subsided in late 1996 with a deal that included a new
contract. Lopes' most public trouble, though, was not about money.
She confessed in 1994 to setting fire to Rison's $1.3-million mansion
after an argument. She was fined $10,000 and sentenced to probation
and a halfway house, but also left the courthouse holding Rison's
hand. Last year the couple announced wedding plans, which did not
materialize.</TE>
<TE>   The bumpy ride for Lopes appeared to have smoothed in recent
years. The group's 1999 album "FanMail" ended a five-year hiatus for
TLC, earned eight Grammy nominations--including album of the
year--and sold robustly. In recent months the group had recorded four
songs for an album planned for September, according to its label.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Marose, a Lopes publicist, said Friday that she had been
enjoying a personal renaissance. She had completed a book of poetry
and personal essays to be titled "Open" and adopted a 10-year-old
girl from a tumultuous home setting. She had also hoped to build a
clothing line and a solo music career. "She had a spiritual and life
change," Marose said.</TE>
<TE>   Marose said funeral arrangements are pending in Atlanta.</TE>

<HD>Southland Priests Are Eager for Reforms</HD>
<DH>Religion: As American bishops ready for a key meeting in
June, some local clergy urge deep changes in lay powers, sexuality
teachings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After this week's Vatican sessions on clergy sex abuse, Southern
California's Roman Catholic priests are urging their leaders to seize
the historic moment. They want American bishops to debate not only
abuse prevention but far-reaching reform measures, from healthier
teachings on sexuality to more lay oversight of clergy personnel
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   America's cardinals, meeting with Vatican officials in Italy,
called Wednesday for steps making it easier to defrock priests guilty
of sexual abuse. But they disappointed many critics by stopping short
of a "zero-tolerance" dismissal policy. That reluctance increased
pressure on American bishops to formally adopt a more specific plan
when they meet in Dallas in June.</LD>
<LD>   Interviews with area priests, however, made it clear that far more
was on their minds.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the worst scandal since the Reformation," said Father
John McAndrews, parochial vicar for St. Angela Merici Church in Brea.
"This is the moment for reform."</TE>
<TE>   Greater lay involvement in church affairs as a way to increase
accountability seemed to top the list of their hopes for reform.</TE>
<TE>   McAndrews said Diocese of Orange priests are discussing a proposal
to place lay members for the first time on boards that hire and
assign priests. Some Los Angeles clergy back that idea as well.</TE>
<TE>   "If there had been more parents involved in the personnel process,
nobody would have allowed priests accused of sex abuse to be
reassigned," said Father David O'Connell of St. Frances X. Cabrini
Church in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Rome, however, has indicated less enthusiasm for empowering the
laity than the American church. In 1997, for instance, Pope John Paul
II approved measures to bar the laity from governing the church,
preaching homilies, using the title "chaplain" and other duties. That
occurred the same year that 500 Southern California priests
unanimously decreed at a Palm Springs conference that the priest's
most important role was to empower the laity.</TE>
<TE>   In Dallas, the bishops are expected to discuss ways to beef up
seminary admission requirements. O'Connell said he saw a need for
wholesale changes in the way men are trained for the priesthood to
counter "arrested psychosexual development," which has been cited as
a contributing factor in numerous sex abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than a traditional seminary education, he said, candidates
might spend most of their time working as student priests in
parishes, taking courses at general colleges and receiving
specialized training at diocese centers.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this year, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is requiring
seminarians to spend a year working in parishes--an increase from the
previous six-month requirement--before ordination. But O'Connell said
more time in the trenches would help, especially at the front end of
the training process.</TE>
<TE>   "By interacting with parishioners and doing work in the parish,
you might get a much faster maturing process than being in the
rarefied seminary environment for four or five years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell added that in seminaries, "you can get much too clerical
much too fast"--attached to the legalistic rules and hierarchical
structures and roles of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Father George O'Brien, a professor at Mount St. Mary's College in
L.A., said he hopes the Dallas meeting will spark a "rethinking of
the theology of sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who also serves at Good Shepherd Church in Beverly Hills,
said sexuality has been presented through a "rather negative
approach," as something to avoid--although the archdiocese today
offers regular seminars on human sexuality that are more positive.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien said he hoped the bishops would take the discussions
further and affirm sex as "God's great gift, and not something to be
denied, repressed and hence made to come out in unhealthy ways."</TE>
<TE>   Several priests agreed that uniform policies on sex abuse should
be adopted throughout the nation and even the world. But they were
less certain about Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's call for "zero
tolerance"--the notion of ousting even those priests who had
committed abuse decades ago and had stayed clean since.</TE>
<TE>   If the primary concern is protecting children and youth from
abusive priests, Mahony said Friday, "zero tolerance is the only
answer. That's the only solution.... It doesn't get any more clear
than that."</TE>
<TE>   The zero-tolerance idea has deeply divided the church. The June
bishops meeting is expected to struggle with the tension between
protecting children and living up to the Christian notion of
forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   McAndrews called zero tolerance the "ecclesiastical death
penalty," adding: "The world wants these priests to cease to exist,
but we don't believe in the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Mahony outlined other issues expected to
be considered in Dallas. They include a proposal for a special
process to remove from the priesthood clerics determined to be a
threat to children and youth--even if their cases are not
"notorious"; and the creation of a national lay board to oversee
issues of sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Mahony said he will probably announce next week the
appointment of two judges to head an expanded board to oversee sexual
misconduct issues in the three-county Los Angeles archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   That board will be expanded to 15 members. He will also establish
education programs for children in all the parishes, and he will
create spiritual healing groups for victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also said he sent a letter Thursday evening to all the
parishes in Ventura, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties
discussing some of the outcomes of his trip to the Vatican. He will
include the pope's statement as well.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell said bishops meeting in Dallas should keep one point
foremost in mind: "These decisions on how the church should change
can't be made by just bishops and priests. They have to include the
laity."</TE>

<HD>Morro Bay Power Plant Replacement Hits Snag</HD>
<DH>Energy: State regulators don't like Duke Energy's seawater
cooling plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans to replace an aging power plant in Morro Bay hit a potential
snag this week when state regulators recommended against using
seawater to cool the plant.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Energy wants to expand and update the 47-year-old plant,
which can produce enough energy for 1 million homes.</LD>
<LD>   But a staff report by the California Energy Commission says
pumping hundreds of millions of gallons of seawater through the plant
each day, as Duke proposes, would kill too many fish and other
organisms in the bay. Instead, the report suggests using giant fans
to cool the plant.</LD>
<TE>   Duke has expressed doubts about the feasibility of so-called dry
cooling. Company officials said it would require construction of huge
buildings to contain the fans and add $39 million to the estimated
$800-million plant replacement cost. They also said it would be noisy
and an even bigger eyesore than the current plant, whose towers loom
over Morro Bay's central tourist district.</TE>
<TE>   Duke spokesman Pat Mullen reiterated those objections Friday, but
said he is confident the company can turn the decision around when
the full Energy Commission begins hearings on the plant application
in June.</TE>
<TE>   To operate the plant, Duke needs permits from the Energy
Commission and the state water board.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already been working with the [water board] on habitat
restoration" to minimize damage to the marine environment, Mullen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mullen did not sound overly concerned, project opponents
celebrated the staff report as the most important development in the
project's three-year struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "We are elated that the [Energy Commission] staff ... has
concluded that this national estuary should not be subjected to the
great and possibly permanent harm that a new and larger power plant
would inflict," said Henriette Groot of the Coastal Alliance on Plant
Expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The group said the new plant could kill a third of the bay's fish,
larvae and eggs each year.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen disputes that. He said studies show the fish population has
not been affected by the current plant, which already uses seawater
for cooling. He said screens over the intake system prevent anything
larger than 3/8 of an inch from being drawn in, so only fish larvae
would be endangered.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is expected to take nearly two years.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman whose son was beaten on his birthday by classmates at an
Orange middle school in October has filed a lawsuit against the
school district and the attackers.</LD>
<LD>   Robyn Worden, 40, alleged in the lawsuit that Portola Middle
School officials were negligent in failing to prevent three
13-year-old boys from viciously pummeling her son Jeremy on his 14th
birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy was hospitalized for 11 days with spleen injuries, his
mother said.</LD>
<TE>   He has recovered and is back at Portola.</TE>
<TE>   Several students have said it was common to lightly strike those
celebrating birthdays but that Jeremy's alleged assailants had gone
beyond the playful ritual.</TE>
<TE>   Worden's lawsuit, filed on behalf of her son, also blames the
parents of the three boys.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, parents can be held responsible for certain types
of misconduct by their children.The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified
damages, follows an administrative claim filed this year and rejected
by the district April 11.</TE>
<TE>   That claim sought $1 million in general damages and about $55,000
in medical expenses from the district.</TE>

<LD>I've mentioned recent approaches by high-tech panhandlers, including
one who asked a driver if he could "spare some cell minutes" and
another whose sign read, "www.any sparechange.com."</LD>
<LD>   But old-fashioned appeals survive. Cliff and Phyllis Kirst of
Glendale spotted a street person with a sign that admitted, "I won't
lie. I need beer."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of handouts: In the latest issue of FHM magazine, Heidi
Fleiss, once known as the Madam to the Stars, was asked by an
interviewer about big tips her workers received.</LD>
<TE>   "The men gave huge gifts," she said. "One girl got two apartment
buildings completely paid off, no mortgage. Now they're income for
her. She owns apartment buildings!"</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss added that she didn't get so much as an apartment parking
space as a cut.</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Some questionable offers uncovered by readers (see
accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   * A copy shop sale colored by a strange qualification (Harriet
Walther of Santa Ana).</TE>
<TE>   * A mattress price that any buyer would find uncomfortable (Harry
Hultine of La Canada Flintridge).</TE>
<TE>   * A not-so "bonus" buy (Ana Tiburzio of Arcadia).</TE>
<TE>   * And one city's free seminar, which would cost most attendees a
lot of sleep (Rose and John Orcutt of Carson).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: The L.A. Independent's crime blotter says
a police officer pulled up behind a disabled vehicle on a Culver City

<HD>Davis Urges Probe of Software Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis called Friday for an investigation by Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer into an embarrassing and apparently overpriced $95-million
software contract with Oracle Corp., and accepted the resignation of
a department head who had a hand in negotiating the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor's moves, announced after 6 p.m. Friday,
come amid a legislative investigation into the deal and a highly
critical state auditor's report. With Davis facing reelection, the
contract, coupled with campaign donations from Oracle, gave fodder to
his challenger, Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Lockyer, Davis said the auditor's report and recent
news accounts "raise serious questions about how state departments
decided to enter into the agreement." Davis asked that Lockyer
"determine what occurred and the steps by which this contract was
negotiated."</LD>
<TE>   Davis also accepted the resignation of Barry Keene, a former state
senator whom the governor appointed to head the Department of General
Services in 2000. Keene helped negotiate the deal.</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation letter, Keene took responsibility, saying: "It
has pained me to see those close to you being blamed by political
detractors for a poor decision that I made, and with which they had
nothing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, who had already opened a preliminary inquiry, said he
will continue his review and "investigate whether there was any
wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) said Friday that
Keene's resignation will not end the legislative inquiry. "If this is
the only fallout, it doesn't close the case," he said. Leonard is on
the legislative committee investigating the deal, and said he
believes others closer to the governor also had significant roles in
striking the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Elias Cortez, the Davis appointee who is state Department of
Information Technology director, also has come under scrutiny for his
role in arranging the deal but remains on the state payroll. Cortez's
department was established to help avoid such missteps after the
state made a series of bad computer deals in the 1990s. Lawmakers now
are considering abolishing the department.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the governor's office also signed off on the deal,
including Susan Kennedy, one of his top policy advisors, and Steve
Nissen, a former top aide who now works for Manatt, Phelps &amp;
Phillips, a law firm that represents Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   An audit released earlier this month concluded that the
$95-million software contract would not save the state $111 million,
as Oracle had said. Rather, the audit found, the contract could end
up costing the state $41 million more than if there had been no
contract.</TE>
<TE>   The state awarded the contract without going through a competitive
bidding process, a fact that the auditor said could void the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   State Auditor Elaine Howle found the state improperly relied on
claims by Oracle and its partner in the deal, Logicon, that their
software would save the state money. The audit also found that the
state was evidently unaware that Logicon, a subsidiary of Northrop
Grumman, stood to make more than $28 million on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   By March, no state department had begun using the software, even
though the contract had been in effect for nearly 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Republican challenger, Simon, issued a statement calling
for a thorough investigation, saying: "Given the administration's
reputation for linking policy and fund-raising, and the governor's
personal style of micromanagement, I'm not convinced that the buck
stops with Mr. Keene."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle donated $25,000 to Davis in June, shortly after the state
signed the contract with the firm. It contributed an additional
$20,000 to Davis' reelection campaign in February. Logicon is not
among Davis' donors. But its parent company, Northrop Grumman, has
donated $55,993 to the governor's campaign committee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Press Secretary Steven Maviglio said "there is absolutely no
connection" between donations and the contract, adding: "The people
responsible for the contracts would be in no position to know about
contributions to the governor, nor should they be. There are no dots
to connect."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Oracle and Logicon could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<HD>Shopping Village in Camarillo Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After buying the last major parcel of undeveloped commercial land in
the city, the owners of Camarillo Premium Outlets plan to build a
hotel, restaurants and an open-air shopping village near the
successful discount center.</LD>
<LD>   Chelsea Property Group, the New Jersey-based developer of the
outlet center south of the Ventura Freeway at Las Posas Road,
purchased the 45-acre vacant parcel in November from Prime Retail of
Baltimore for an undisclosed sum.</LD>
<LD>   "The ball is really in Chelsea's court now to submit some plans
for the city to review," Assistant City Manager Larry Davis said.
"We're anxious to work with them as they come up with ideas."</LD>
<TE>   Chelsea is in negotiations with city officials to refine an
existing development plan for the property. "This will be a companion
center that will obviously be good for the shopper," said Michele
Rothstein, Chelsea's vice president of marketing. "And if you're a
shopper like me, more is a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo Promenade would be 220,000 to 300,000 square feet and
designed in the style of a Spanish or Mediterranean village that
would devote about a third of its space to landscaping and several
plaza areas for shoppers to stroll and gather. City officials
compared the proposed "lifestyle center" to the Promenade at Westlake
in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The company operates 57 shopping centers in 28 states and Japan,
but Rothstein said this project would be a first for Chelsea. Unlike
large discount centers, such as its Desert Hills outlet in Cabazon
near Palm Springs, this lifestyle center would feature national chain
specialty stores selling apparel, books, music and home furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Although no prospective tenants have been announced, Jim Jevens,
Camarillo's economic development consultant, said the city compiled a
wish list of the sort of tenants it thinks would complement the
city's current retail mix. The city wants the village to have a
high-end family-style restaurant, specialty food outlets, book, music
and clothes stores and other specialty retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo planning director Bob Burrow said the project is divided
into three parcels. The shopping village would cover about 30 acres
and include about 1,500 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 11 acres at the south end of the parcel, next to the
Edwards Theaters, is currently zoned for industrial space and could
accommodate another 908 parking spaces. Jevens suggests that if this
parcel's zoning were changed to commercial, a larger retailer such as
a Best Buy or Fry's Electronics could be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Burrow said about four acres closest to the freeway exit would be
the site of the proposed hotel.</TE>

interested in the location.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Chelsea's deal included providing $3 million in
bonds to help extend Camarillo Center Drive to connect with Las Posas
and for improvements to Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to have that road built so we can avoid some of the
traffic congestion we now experience at peak times, like the
Christmas shopping season," said Davis, the assistant city manager.</TE>
<TE>   With 120 stores in two sections, Camarillo Premium Outlet has
generated about $6.5 million in sales tax proceeds for the city since
it opened. Chelsea has said the discount center draws about 10
million shoppers a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic is definitely a concern to the residents and the business
people in town," said Tom Kelley, president of the Camarillo Chamber
of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   While the chamber supports Chelsea bringing additional retailers
to town, Kelley admitted that a few small merchants were hurt when
the outlet center first opened in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "But, on the whole, it's considered to be a positive because it
brings so many people to town," he said.</TE>

<HD>Grunion Take Patience and Flashlights</HD>
<DH>Watching for the silvery fish to teem ashore and spawn is a
nocturnal rite on Southland beaches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The line of people surges forward and then recoils just like the
waves rolling onto Cabrillo Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "Stay back," comes an order delivered by bullhorn. About 600
people crowding the shoreline edge back a few paces. "Turn off that
flashlight." A light goes out. "Try to remain quiet. We don't want to
spook the fish."</LD>
<LD>   Self-control doesn't come easily to the excited throng--half of
them children--hoping to catch a glimpse of one of Mother Nature's
most unusual shows: fish that ride the surf onto the beach, bury
their eggs in the sand and then catch a wave back into the ocean.</LD>
<TE>   It's 10 on a Saturday night and the audience is eager for the main
event to begin. They have, after all, spent hours at Los Angeles'
Cabrillo Marine Aquarium learning about the small silvery fish called
grunion and their unique spawning habits.</TE>
<TE>   They watched an old Technicolor film that showed the grunion's
nocturnal dance, the females burrowing into the sand tail-first, the
males crowding around them eager to do their part.</TE>
<TE>   They practiced the grunion dance, wriggling their bodies like the
fish.</TE>
<TE>   They tried their hand at hatching grunion eggs. Each was handed a
baby-food jar with a pinch of sand laden with grunion eggs and some
seawater.</TE>
<TE>   Then, they were told to vigorously swirl the water in the jars to
mimic ocean turbulence. That action coaxes baby grunion to burst from
their eggs. In a blink, each egg was transformed from a diminutive
pair of eyes inside a clear, round sac into tiny free-swimming fish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like magic," said Brian Navarro, 9, of Redondo Beach,
holding the jar to the light. "But one can't get out." He frowned.
"Now it did," he said, brightening.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd sat politely through a brief lecture on the grunion, a
fish found only in Southern California and northern Baja.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to convince you that these rascals really exist,"
aquarium staff member George Van Doren said in an auditorium
squirming with children and their parents. "A lot of people say they
have been grunion hunting for years and never seen them."</TE>
<TE>   Mating schedules are as imprinted in grunion as dates are on a
calendar, so much so that grunion runs can be predicted up to a year
in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Grunion spawn from early March through early September, but only
on the third or fourth night after the highest tides that are brought
on by the full or new moon. More precisely, grunion tend to fling
themselves on the beach one to three hours after high tide.</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of their ingenious adaptation. Waves tend to erode
sand from the beach as the tide rises and then deposit sand as the
tide falls. So the grunion eggs, which the female buries two to three
inches into the sand, get covered with a fresh layer of sand until
the next high tide--about 10 days later--when the eggs are ready to
hatch and the newborns are ready to swim for their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Marine biologists don't really know if grunion populations are
healthy or declining.</TE>
<TE>   They are aware, however, that grunion have largely disappeared
from some beaches in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties that
are raked regularly by tractors to remove trash and smelly seaweed.
What's amazing about grunion is that they continue to exist at all
along one of the most heavily populated shorelines in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Some biologists believe grunion are a cautious lot. They first
send a male scout or two onto the beach to check things out before
coming ashore en masse. If the scout doesn't come back, they wait or
move to another beach. Others think this is bunk.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, pinpointing precisely when the grunion will run is
less than an exact science.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing to bring to a grunion hunt is patience,"
said Larry Fukuhara, the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium's director of
public programs. He should know. He's been leading grunion tours for
16 years.</TE>
<TE>   For the first aquarium grunion program last month, 800 people
showed up, but not a single grunion. On this night, 600 people have
bundled themselves against the damp chill and headed out to the beach
to witness a run. Some brought buckets to collect grunion for a fish
fry back home. Most are out there just to watch.</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen night heron patrol the beach, the beat of the wings
giving away their location on a night when moonlight is shrouded by
coastal fog. The presence of the heron is a good sign, aquarium staff
members say. The birds would not be here if the fish weren't ready to
run.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of feral cats hang back in the shadows, hoping to make a
quick meal of the 5- to 6-inch grunion flopping on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes turn into hours as the energy drains from the once-excited
crowd. Most people sit down. Some lie down. Others begin to drift
away.</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight, Fukuhara makes the call. Everyone can turn on
their flashlight and take a look, before the aquarium staff usher all
of the people from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   A powerful beam of light sweeps across the water revealing an
ocean churning with grunion--a dozen yards offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Fukuhara is flummoxed. "I don't know what happened," he says. He's
proud of his percentages. His groups see grunion more than 90% of the
time. "I seldom miss. I've missed twice in a row."</TE>
<TE>   The next night, a Sunday, only a couple of dozen people show up at
Cabrillo Beach. There's no aquarium-led tour. No bonfires. No
boisterous, flashlight waving crowd. But the shore is teeming with
grunion.</TE>
<TE>   With each wave, the wet sand is carpeted with a squirming mass of
silvery fish. A few people around frolic among the fish until a city
Recreation and Parks ranger brusquely interrupts the fun. Everyone
must leave immediately. The beach is closed.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to come the second night," said Rene Kilpatrick of Harbor
City, packing up to leave with her son Travis. "There's hardly
anybody here. Just us and the grunion."</TE>
<TE>   For future run dates and grunion facts, go to "the Amazing
Grunion" on Fish and Game's Web site, www.dfg.ca.gov, or call the
Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, (310) 548-7562.</TE>

<HD>Albert Mangones, 85; His Bronze Sculpture Became Haitian
Symbol</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Mangones, 85, a leading Haitian architect whose monumental
sculpture "The Unknown Fugitive Slave" became a symbol of Haiti, died
of pernicious anemia Thursday at his family home in Martissant.</LD>
<LD>   Mangones designed the bronze in 1968. The sculpture, which stands
in the central plaza in front of the National Palace, depicts a
runaway slave holding a conch shell to his lips--a reminder of the
call to rebellion against slave-holding France in 1791. The rebellion
led to Haitian independence in 1804.</LD>
<LD>   In 1989, the United Nations chose Mangones' sculpture for a series
of stamps illustrating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</LD>
<TE>   Mangones studied architecture in Belgium and at Cornell
University. In the 1940s, he co-founded the Center of Arts, which
promoted the early work of primitive painters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, he served as director-general of the seaside boulevard
project in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. A model for similar
seaside projects throughout the Caribbean, the boulevard features
promenades, pavilions and colorfully lighted musical fountains.</TE>
<TE>   He devoted the final years of his career to restoring the Citadel,
the stone-and-brick fortress built on a remote northern mountainside
by Haiti's King Henri Christophe in the early 1800s.</TE>

<LD>Doris Goodday Hoffmann, 94, an Alzheimer's patient whose descent into
dementia was chronicled in her daughter's Oscar-nominated film, died
Tuesday of complications related to the disease at a nursing home in
Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman's daughter, filmmaker Deborah Hoffmann, spent many years
filming her mother. The 1994 film "Complaints of a Dutiful Daughter"
won more than 30 international awards, including a Peabody and an
Emmy, and it has helped doctors, patients and family members cope
with the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffmann was born in San Francisco and earned a bachelor's degree
from UC Berkeley in 1930. She later earned a master's degree in
social work from Columbia University. She was married to Banesh
Hoffmann, a colleague and biographer of Albert Einstein. In 1986, she
moved back to California to be near her children after her husband's
death in New York.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher Price, 34, the popular anchor of the irreverent BBC
entertainment news program "Liquid News," died Monday of an apparent
accidental overdose of painkillers in his London home.</LD>
<LD>   Price, who described himself as "a fat, bald homosexual--not ideal
television material at all," was a rising BBC star who was scheduled
to become host of a new prime-time "Weakest Link"-style quiz show.</LD>
<LD>   As anchor of "Liquid News," which covers film, music, TV and the
arts, he was known for blending his solid journalism background with
an acerbic and witty style of commentary. He usually referred to
Madonna, for example, as a "42-year-old mother of two."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Norfolk in 1967, Price majored in Italian at Reading
University. He joined the BBC as a trainee radio reporter in 1991. He
joined Radio 5 Live, then moved to BBB News 24 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He created his own program in May, signing a $363,000, two-year
contract for "Liquid News" that put him on par with the network's
highest-paid anchors.</TE>

<HD>3 Injured as Small Plane Crash-Lands in Fullerton</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Pilot ditches Cessna on an empty high school
baseball field after engine seizes during commute from Corona to
Hawthorne.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries around dawn Friday
when the single-engine plane in which they were commuting from Corona
to Hawthorne crash-landed on a Fullerton high school baseball field.</LD>
<LD>   The incident capped a week of commuting problems across Southern
California that ranged from the tragic to the merely annoying.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, two people were killed and 159 treated for injuries
when a freight train collided head-on with a Metrolink commuter train
in Placentia. And rains Wednesday and Friday contributed to some 950
freeway accidents in Los Angeles and Orange counties, including one
of three fatal wrecks reported in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   The storms snarled traffic around Southern California, extending
many motorists' already-long drives to and from work.</TE>
<TE>   It was to avoid such traffic problems that Dale Ploung began
commuting from his Corona home to his job in Hawthorne by air.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ploung, 53, and passenger David Cymbor, 52, both of
Corona, suffered minor injuries when Ploung ditched his plane on a
baseball field behind Fullerton's Troy High School after reporting
engine failure, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Another passenger, Donna Scharf, 46, of Murietta, was hospitalized
at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton with a broken left arm.</TE>
<TE>   The trio have been commuting by plane for several years from
Corona to Hawthorne, where they worked at Boeing and Raytheon.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes before 6 a.m. Friday, they were flying above
Placentia when the engine over-revved, began to vibrate and then
locked up, Ploung said.</TE>
<TE>   Ploung realized he couldn't make it to Fullerton Municipal Airport
and searched for a place to land, ruling out Cal State Fullerton and
nearby streets jammed with morning commuters.</TE>
<TE>   So he steered the single-engine Cessna Cardinal, then gliding
about 85 mph at an altitude of 1,800 feet, toward the vacant baseball
diamond at Troy High School.</TE>
<TE>   Ploung said he aimed at a 10-foot fence to keep the plane from
smashing into the yards of neighboring homes. When the plane hit the
fence, it flipped over and slid 75 feet before coming to a rest
upside down.</TE>
<TE>   "What a way to start the day," Ploung said, his voice trembling
and blood streaming down his face less than an hour after the crash.
"My major concern was these homes, so I flew it into the fence."</TE>
<TE>   Ploung said he has commuted by air for 20 years, and Friday was
the first time he's had to crash-land.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible that a passenger is hurt," he said. "I always
thought I could do better than that."</TE>
<TE>   But Fullerton Municipal Airport Manager Rod Propst praised Ploung
for his quick thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been much worse," said Propst, who lives nearby and
spotted Ploung's plane while watering his yard. "He made a conscious
decision and was in control of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred before classes began at Troy High and caused
no disruptions. The field is used by the school's varsity baseball
team, but it was scheduled to play at Sunny Hills High School on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash landing was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Ploung said the engine appeared to lose oil pressure before it
seized up.</TE>

classes.</CP>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill to Set Maintenance Standards for Private
Power Plants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Friday that rolls back one aspect of
electricity deregulation by requiring the state to set and enforce
maintenance standards for privately owned power plants.</LD>
<LD>   Davis said the new law will allow the California Public Utilities
Commission to make sure that when power plants are shut down suddenly
it is to correct mechanical problems or ensure safety, and not to
create scarcity and drive up prices.</LD>
<LD>   "Statistics show that the average monthly power plant outages in
2001 were double what they were in 2000 and nearly triple that of
1999," the governor said in a written release.</LD>
<TE>   Utilities panel President Loretta Lynch lobbied for the bill,
saying that it would help prevent "gaming" of the power market that
California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. As part of that
plan, regulated utilities auctioned off many of their gas-fired power
plants to private companies over which the state has had, until now,
little authority.</TE>
<TE>   Power plant owners opposed the bill, SB 39XX by Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco). They argued that their plants suffered a
rash of mechanical failures after running unusually hard to supply
power in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities panel inspectors have visited private power plants
hundreds of times since January 2001. But some energy companies
resisted inspection, insisting that their power plants were exempt
from state regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The new law requires the utilities panel and the California
Independent System Operator, which manages much of the state's
transmission system, to form a committee to write standards for
operating and maintaining power plants. It allows the utilities panel
to order repairs or improvements. It exempts nuclear power plants and
hundreds of small power plants known as "qualifying facilities."</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Energy of Houston, which owns five Southern California
power plants, sued the state earlier this month after the utilities
panel repeatedly refused to disclose the records of more than 100
visits by inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "If state officials want to allege that generators have taken down
their power plants deliberately," said spokesman Richard Wheatley,
"then justification for those comments ought to be contained in that
data.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has a right to know what those ... inspectors found,
not only at our plants but other companies' plants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities panel spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said the commission
will make the inspection results public in June. It's taken more than
a year, she said, because the panel had to sue generators twice to
get operation and maintenance records.</TE>

<HD>Metrolink Cites Improvements in On-Time Record of Riverside
Line</HD>
<DH>Transit: Commuter rail system's board praises upgrades by
freight hauler Union Pacific, which oversees the track-sharing setup.
Upkeep still at issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute over delays on track connecting Riverside and Los Angeles
appeared to calm on Friday when Metrolink officials said they are
pleased with Union Pacific changes that have improved on-time
performance for the commuter train.</LD>
<LD>   Discussion of the issue at Metrolink's monthly board meeting,
occurring against the backdrop of Tuesday's fatal crash in Orange
County, underscored the sometimes contentious business relationships
that play out on Southern California railways.</LD>
<LD>   In the Los Angeles area, as in most of the nation, freight and
passenger lines share track. As the volume of freight trains has
increased over recent years, the tracks at times resemble clogged
freeways. That's led to heightened concerns over safety and to
problems with reliability.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the fact that Tuesday's deadly crash occurred on track
controlled by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, it is the Riverside
line--owned and dispatched by Union Pacific and with a history of
delays--that has long caused Metrolink the most concern.</TE>
<TE>   The issue peaked this year when Metrolink Chief Executive David
Solow accused Union Pacific of ignoring the decade-old contract under
which Metrolink paid $71 million for the right to share track on the
56-mile-long Riverside line. The contract requires Union Pacific to
ensure on-time performance of Metrolink trains.</TE>
<TE>   Solow contended that Union Pacific so poorly oversaw the line
that, by October, the commuter trains ran on time only 74% of the
time. That rate was by far the worst on Metrolink's 416-mile network,
which stretches from Ventura to Riverside to San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   Solow, notifying the freight line that the dispute may need to be
solved by an outside mediator as stipulated by the contract, also
criticized Union Pacific for poor upkeep of equipment on the line,
including the signaling system.</TE>
<TE>   But at Friday's board meeting, Solow said Union Pacific's record
has vastly improved. Metrolink trains on the Riverside line are now
close to meeting the goal of running on time 95% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, things are working very well right now," said
Solow. "We're hopeful they will remain straightened out."</TE>
<TE>   Union Pacific has made several recent changes on the route,
including using more experienced dispatchers and changing the freight
traffic patterns to decrease competition for rail space.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a much better review process in place," said Greg
Workman, general superintendent for Union Pacific's Los Angeles rail
lines. "We are focused on solving the problem, and we think we have a
long-term fix in place."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Riverside line Metrolink rider Ron Shirley disputed the notion
that service had vastly improved.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, but it's just not true that they have gotten much
better," said Shirley, a human relations specialist who
commutes--along with an average of 4,500 others each weekday--between
Riverside and Los Angeles. "It's still very sporadic.</TE>
<TE>   "There are good days," Shirley said, "but in all honesty, there
are too many days when we have 20- and 30-minute delays."</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink officials said they remain concerned about the upkeep of
equipment, including signaling systems, though they said the problems
did not affect safety.</TE>
<TE>   Workman said Friday that he was unaware of any equipment problems
and disagreed with Metrolink's assertions.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A light rain fell throughout most of Ventura County on Friday but
officials said the much-needed sprinkling would have no effect on
this year's fire season and provide little relief for vegetation and
stagnant water supplies.</LD>
<LD>   By late afternoon, between a trace and one-fifth of an inch had
fallen on most northern and western communities, but Thousand Oaks
and Simi Valley remained dry.</LD>
<LD>   More light rain was forecast through the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "It appears we still get rain in April," said Stuart Seto, a
specialist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. "It helps
because we haven't had any in a while. But mostly what it's going to
do is wet the grass."</TE>
<TE>   Seto said residents can expect drizzle or light rain early today
and tonight, and again Sunday morning. Total rainfall amounts were
not expected to exceed one-tenth of an inch.</TE>
<TE>   Daytime skies were forecast as mostly cloudy this weekend with
high temperatures today in the mid-60s and lows in the low-50s.
Forecasters say brisk winds also could move through the region today.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday is expected to be slightly cooler.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast wasn't the best of news for Jim Sligh, a spokesman
for the normally well-attended Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament, the
102nd edition of which started Friday and runs until Sunday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was raining all morning and we spent hours getting the courts
dry," Sligh said Friday, following a six-hour rain delay at Libbey
Park's 10 cement courts.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 0.05 of an inch fell, but it was enough to flood the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   When play resumed about 2 p.m., entrants were told to play matches
of no more than eight games rather than the standard best-of-three
sets.</TE>
<TE>   The stands were about half full Friday afternoon, and event
organizers were hoping for bigger crowds today and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Holder with the Ventura County Flood Control District said
trace amounts of rain have fallen a couple of times in the past few
weeks but the last really significant local downpour occurred in
February.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still running about 50% of normal for rainfall in the
county," Holder said.</TE>
<TE>   This season's rainfall total in Ventura County is 6.78 inches,
compared with nearly 24 inches at this time in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Luna, a spokesman with the Ventura County Fire Department,
said the light rain would not decrease the danger for the current
fire season, which started earlier this month..</TE>
<TE>   "This weather is nice but we would need a substantial amount of
rain to make a difference, to lessen the fire danger," Luna said.</TE>

statewide vote in November on a $13.05-billion school construction
bond measure, followed by a second, $12.3-billion bond measure on the
2004 primary election ballot.</LD>
<LD>   If voters approve the measures, the state would sell $21.4 billion
in bonds to finance construction at new and existing elementary,
middle and high school campuses, plus $4 billion for state
universities and colleges. The bond measure includes $400 million for
charter schools and $651 million in bonds that don't require voter
approval.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Trinity River will soon be rushing again, when Bureau of
Reclamation workers release more water from Lewiston Dam on Sunday.
The releases are to comply with a judge's order for 40% of the water
to stay in the river, compared with 30% last year. Years of water
diversion to Central Valley farms and utilities have diminished the
Trinity.</LD>
<LD>   The higher, faster flows caused by the releases could be bad for
trout fishing because the fish can get disoriented and swim into
areas they are not used to. But the releases will make it easier for
salmon to spawn and for juvenile salmon to make it to the ocean.</LD>

<LD>Nearly three dozen elementary schools in Los Angeles County have been
designated California Distinguished Schools. The Newhall district,
with five winners, has the most of any district in the county.</LD>
<LD>   The 247 schools selected throughout the state include 34 in Los
Angeles County, 36 in Orange County and eight in Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   Criteria for the award, which honors elementary and secondary
schools in alternate years, include test scores, curriculum, use of
technology and parent involvement.</LD>
<TE>   Technology in the Newhall School District has transformed book
reports from drab packets of paper to animated PowerPoint
presentations, and parents can take classes to learn English and
parenting skills.</TE>
<TE>   With five of the district's seven schools designated as
Distinguished Schools, Newhall's Supt. Marc Winger was proud and
promised to maintain the efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't change what we do every day, because it's that which
got us the awards in the first place," Winger said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of Los Angeles Unified's more than 420 elementary schools
won the honor this year. That school, 156th Street Elementary in
Gardena, emphasizes arts and citizenship in addition to the core
curriculum, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're educating students so they can be happy and successful
later in life, not just to improve test scores," said school
Principal Esther Kim. "We're an inner-city school in an area that's
not very affluent, but we try to be balanced in every aspect."</TE>
<TE>   The Distinguished Schools program was established in 1985 to
designate schools as models of achievement.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 schools throughout the state applied for the honor
this year.</TE>
<TE>   By district, the 2002 winners in Los Angeles County are:</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra City Elementary: Fremont, Martha Baldwin and Ynez;
Castaic Union Elementary: Castaic; Charter Oak Unified: Washington;
Claremont Unified: Chaparral and Mountain View; Covina-Valley
Unified: Valencia; East Whittier City Elementary: Orchard Dale; El
Segundo Unified: Center Street; Glendale Unified: John Marshall, Mark
Keppel and Richardson D. White; Hawthorne Elementary: Zela Davis; Las
Virgenes Unified: Lupin Hill; Long Beach Unified: Elizabeth Hudson

<HD>Simpson Seeks to Overturn Judgment</HD>
<DH>Courts: He alleges the $33.5-million damage award in 1994
slayings of his wife and her friend constitutes 'cruel and unusual
punishment.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Contending that his constitutional rights were violated, O.J. Simpson
filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Friday to overturn a
$33.5-million civil judgment against him for the slayings of his
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman.</LD>
<LD>   Simpson said the damage award constitutes "cruel and unusual
punishment" by a state court jury that was "inflamed by emotion and
denied access to exculpatory or mitigating evidence."</LD>
<LD>   The former professional football star, who now lives in Florida,
was acquitted of murder charges in connection with the June 12, 1994,
stabbing deaths at Nicole Brown Simpson's home in Brentwood.</LD>
<TE>   But Simpson was subsequently found liable for damages in a civil
action brought by the victims' families in Santa Monica Superior
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, represented by attorney Douglas E. McCann, said in
Friday's lawsuit that he was turning to the federal court for relief
because he had exhausted all of his appeals in the California courts.</TE>
<TE>   He complained that during the civil trial he was denied access to
telephone company records of a call between his ex-wife and her
mother shortly before the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson has contended the records would prove that Nicole Brown
Simpson was talking to her mother about 11 p.m., the same time he was
being driven to Los Angeles International Airport to catch a flight
to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel M. Petrocelli, who represented the Goldman family in the
civil suit, could not be reached for comment Friday. But he has
maintained that Nicole Brown Simpson spoke to her mother "well before
10 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   While there was testimony at Simpson's criminal and civil trials
about the call, the phone company records were never introduced as
evidence. Simpson faulted his criminal and civil defense lawyers for
not demanding the original records.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he filed suit in federal court to obtain the
records but was rebuffed. The telephone company refused to release
them without a court order or consent from Nicole Brown Simpson's
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson also challenged the claim that a shoe print found at the
murder site must have come from Bruno Magli shoes, like the pair he
owned. He said the mold used to make soles for Bruno Magli shoes was
also used by 20 other shoe manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to complaining that his civil rights were violated,
Simpson said the civil jury verdict has caused him to "suffer
relentless ridicule."</TE>

<HD>State Bill Targets Slumlords</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Proposal would force apartment owners to live
in their buildings to ensure safety codes are met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community leaders and Devonshire Division police officers have tried
for years to control a problematic apartment complex in a
crime-ridden North Hills neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   They closed off access from busy Nordhoff Street, held block
parties to promote peace and increased police patrols to deter
criminal activity. On Friday, lawmakers announced a new approach to
dealing with troubled buildings: legislation that would force
apartment owners to live in their complexes to ensure that safety
measures are implemented.</LD>
<LD>   ''It is time that building owners take responsibility for cleaning
up nuisance properties that serve as a haven for illegal activity,
and bring long-overdue safety to our communities,'' said City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo at a news conference in front of the deteriorating
six-unit apartment complex in the 9000 block of Columbus Avenue.
''This complex is the perfect example of what we are up against.''</LD>
<TE>   If passed, the bill, introduced by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood), could affect thousands of complexes in Los Angeles and
throughout the state, Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, Koretz and Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla stood in front of the North Hills apartment complex, where
from August 1999 to February 2001 police reported 21 drug-related
arrests, several shootings and a homicide, according to Gretchen
Smith, a deputy city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Smith worked with Tim Kirkpatrick, a Los Angeles Police Department
narcotics investigator, for more than two years to get an injunction
against the owner of the complex in an attempt to curtail alleged
drug activity and other crimes there.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkpatrick said drug sales have taken place inside the laundry
room, in the parking lot and in front of the building. Some dealers
were tenants, or knew people who lived in the complex.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction asked for more lighting, surveillance cameras and a
working security gate, as well as better tenant screening. However,
the owner sold the property before the injunction was secured and
left the place a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed legislation would make it more difficult to transfer
ownership of a property to avoid making changes and would require
owners to ''witness firsthand the problems in their apartments,''
Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We'll put them in the laundry room if we have to,'' joked the
city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Garcia, a tenant in the North Hills building, said she
pays a steep rent--$550 a month for a one-bedroom unit--in a complex
she describes as ''falling apart.''</TE>
<TE>   ''The gangs and drugs are bad,'' said Garcia, a 24-year-old mother
of three who shares the apartment with her 27-year-old brother, ''but
I have problems inside also that need to be fixed.''</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said her kitchen is infested with cockroaches, the bathroom
and kitchen walls are crumbling and the carpet looks as if it has not
been cleaned in years. In the hallway, she pointed to an area where a
smoke alarm should be.</TE>
<TE>   ''The owner is never here, so I can't get anyone to help me,'' she
said as her daughters Rachel and Valerie played in the living room
near a broken air conditioner and exposed electrical outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the complex, the yellow paint is peeling in areas, while
some walls are patched to cover bullet holes or painted over to hide
gang graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the building's sale in September, 50 people were
living in its six units, said Daron Campbell, managing partner for
Apartment Sales Group Inc., a Sherman Oaks real estate firm.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said the problems his company inherited when it purchased
the property will be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   ''This new law will help,'' said Campbell. ''I like the concept.
It will be an incentive for property owners to get their places
fixed. When I'm done with the work here, I want this place to be a
place that I am willing to live in.''</TE>

<DH>Education: Children learn from pros that writing well can
help them in any vocation.</DH>

<LD>What can someone with directing credits on HBO's raunchy "Sex and the
City" series possibly teach a bunch of grade-school students?
Writing, of course, say organizers of a South Bay writers workshop
for children.</LD>
<LD>   At Alta Vista Elementary School in Redondo Beach, Matthew Harrison
and about 30 other guest speakers stressed that good writing is
fundamental in all lines of work.</LD>
<LD>   "Writing is the foundation for which so many things can happen in
your life, and it's not something that just grown-ups do," said
Harrison, who has also directed other television shows and feature
films such as "Spare Me" and "Kicked in the Head." "Writing,
directing--they're almost the same. They really go hand in hand."</LD>
<TE>   The writers conference was an all-day event with speakers
including newspaper columnists, cartoonists and authors. Organizers
say it was an opportunity for the 300 children to gain
self-confidence about their own abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the big writers teaching the little writers," said volunteer
Candace Greene. "We're getting some kids who are extremely shy to
start writing."</TE>
<TE>   The third- through fifth-graders attended sessions about
description, plot development and other ingredients of storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters at Harrison's workshop got a kick out of his
directorial debut, a 30-year-old, two-minute film titled "Mission
Impossible," in which Harrison's brother battled secret agents.</TE>
<TE>   Across campus, R.A. Forster, who mostly writes legal thrillers and
mysteries, taught her boisterous class how to revive a boring
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the class thought of adjectives to describe Jennifer, a
character they created. They waved their arms frantically, eager to
add their ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Once they had enough adjectives, Forster asked them to write a
story ending.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't forget to write with description," she said. "Tell me if
she turned cold with fear, if she fell into a hole. Don't forget to
use those adjectives and adverbs."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mike Wellman, a local comic-book creator: "Every story has to
have a conflict. Anything you apply to any sort of writing, you can
apply to comics."</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-grader Tyler Ceja won the afternoon's award for best comic
for his superheroes, Spike and Electric.</TE>
<TE>   "Electric wants Spike's superpowers," said Tyler, who wants to be
either a writer or an archeologist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to write," Tyler said. "I get to create these really
exciting stories."</TE>

<HD>New Owners Continue Story for 2 Longtime Bookstores</HD>

<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're turning a new page on an old rivalry between competing
used-book stores in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-one-year-old Gene de Chene is quitting his 34-year-old book
business May 1. Five days later and five blocks away, Ken Hyre, 78,
is leaving the bookshop he opened 43 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But both men are selling their stores and shelves crammed with
thousands of titles to people who first wandered in for different
reasons and became proprietors purely by accident.</LD>
<TE>   It's a lucky turn of events, say book lovers. Not only is it
keeping a friendly competition going, but it is also keeping the
used-book business alive in a part of town that once was Los Angeles'
most thriving literary center.</TE>
<TE>   Hyre is selling his shop to an artist who first came in to sell
his own book collection in preparation for a move out of the country.
De Chene is selling his to an actress who first stepped into his
store at the invitation of a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Both booksellers have carefully prepared their shops' new owners
for the idiosyncrasies both of book lovers and of the out-of-print
volumes that customers covet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a great believer in fate," said Brian Paeper, who is taking
over Hyre's West Los Angeles Book Center at 1650 S. Sawtelle Blvd.
"I've never been in business before. But I realize the value of this
store. I realize its importance to its customers."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Scully, who is acquiring Gene de Chene Booksellers at
11556 Santa Monica Blvd., said she has continuity in mind too. "I'm
keeping the store's name. I'm not going to change things. I want to
continue what he has done."</TE>
<TE>   That's good news for Westside book lovers who have worried that
the shops might disappear when their owners retired.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was getting older. I'm very glad," said Jim Rippner, a
50-year-old wine salesman who first began shopping for comic books in
Hyre's shop when he was 8. "There are so few independent bookstores
left. That store is sort of a landmark as far as I'm concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Hyre had been in data processing when he opened his shop in 1959
with a small collection of used books he had scrounged up at rummage
sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more of a reader than a collector," he said. "So I'm very
happy the business is going to continue. Most times shops like this
just fold when the owner retires. I would have sold the books and
shelving and rented the building out if Brian hadn't come along."</TE>
<TE>   Paeper, 38, of West Hollywood was an artist planning to relocate
to Berlin when he stopped in Hyre's shop three years ago to sell
books. He and Hyre were chatting about the effect of the Internet on
the book business when Paeper suggested that a Web site might help
sell books on Southern California subjects to out-of-towners.</TE>
<TE>   Hyre asked if Paeper could help him set up such a site, and Paeper
agreed to delay his departure for Germany. Soon, though, Hyre was
teaching him about the used-book business. Later, when Hyre talked of
retiring, he offered to sell his 40,000 volumes to Paeper and help
him with the transition. The artist decided to take the plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Scully, 34, of West Los Angeles says her initial association with
De Chene also came by chance. She was an unhappy television and
commercial actress eight years ago when a friend who was working at
the time in De Chene's shop offered to help her find a new job.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime bookstore clerk Adrienne Eisen was planning to quit the
bookstore so she could write a novel. She volunteered to secretly
teach Scully the book trade. "She basically trained me behind Gene's
back, so that when she told Gene she was leaving, there was somebody
ready to take her place," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt comfortable working here immediately. I've never wanted to
leave," Scully said of the storefront crammed with 35,000 titles.</TE>
<TE>   Scully feared the shop would close if De Chene retired without a
buyer. And if it was sold to an outsider, "I was afraid they'd change
it--I didn't want to see this store changed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, De Chene talked of Scully eventually taking over
the store. But Scully waved him off until earlier this year, when it
came time for De Chene to renew his lease. "He told me to sign it
because he wasn't going to," she said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   De Chene started his bookstore after being laid off as a bank
escrow officer. Ironically, he was browsing in Hyre's shop in early
1968 when he decided that he, too, wanted to sell used books. He
started out with 400 books acquired "from a guy who had planned to
start his own used-book store but never did," De Chene said.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the sales of the two shops are being kept private. But
both buyers credit the retiring owners with making their acquisitions
possible. "Gene made it easy for me to buy," Scully said. "Ken made
it possible for me to be able to do it," Paeper said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the two shops have been friendly competitors,
often referring customers searching for specific books to the rival
store. In the early days, Hyre even helped De Chene with questions
about book prices.</TE>
<TE>   These days the shops are the closest general-interest independent
bookstores to Westwood, which was considered the center of
bookselling in Los Angeles until rocketing rents began driving
independent bookstores out of business in the mid-1970s. Westwood
Village alone had 10 bookstores at its peak, according to Steve Sann,
a Westwood real estate consultant.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, at least, Westwood will once again be the center of
attention for many book lovers. The annual Los Angeles Times Festival
of Books will be held today and Sunday at the UCLA campus.</TE>

<HD>Victor Weisskopf, 93; Nuclear Physicist on Manhattan
Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Victor F. Weisskopf, a nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan
Project and then spent much of the rest of his life warning against
nuclear weapons, has died. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Weisskopf, professor emeritus of physics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, died Sunday night at his home in Newton,
Mass. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   A philosopher, gifted writer and international statesman of
science, Weisskopf was well-regarded for his work in three fields of
theoretical physics: quantum electrodynamics, nuclear physics and
particle physics.</LD>
<TE>   "[He] was a giant of 20th century physics, a great spokesman for
peace, for the welfare of humanity and the beauty of physics," said
Robert L. Jaffe, director of the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics.</TE>
<TE>   "He had an incredible knack for explaining physics in a simple
way," said Roberto D. Peccei, a physicist and vice chancellor of
UCLA. "He worked to advance the field of nuclear physics as much as
the original pioneers."</TE>
<TE>   A student of Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr and other great names
in quantum mechanics, Weisskopf believed that he came out of the
"golden age" of physics.</TE>
<TE>   "We touched the nerve of the universe," he once told an
interviewer. "It was a great revolution that allowed us for the first
time in history to get at the root of the matter--why are leaves
green, why are metals hard, why are the mountains so high and not
higher--all those natural questions of our immediate environment got
an answer."</TE>
<TE>   Weisskopf was born in Vienna and studied at the University of
Vienna before earning his doctor of philosophy degree in physics at
the University of Gottingen in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   He did postdoctoral work with Heisenberg, the Nobel laureate and
author of the "uncertainty principle," at the University of Leipzig.
He later went to the University of Copenhagen on a Rockefeller
Fellowship and served as a research associate. His mentor there was
Bohr, another Nobel laureate and the father of quantum mechanics.
From 1934 to 1937, he was a research associate at the Institute of
Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Weisskopf's early work centered on the field of quantum
electrodynamics. In 1931, he and another physicist, Eugene P. Wigner,
collaborated on an investigation of the process of light emission by
atomic electrons.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Weisskopf began a series of pioneering studies
on the electromagnetic self-energy of the electron. Working as an
assistant to Wolfgang Pauli at the Zurich Institute, he studied the
energy levels of atoms, especially in relation to Pauli's exclusion
principle. According to that principle, two electrons instead of one
could occupy each energy level, provided they differed by a property
called "spin."</TE>
<TE>   A paper published by Weisskopf and Pauli in 1934 presented the
first consistent quantum theory of charged particles without spin,
known as bosons.</TE>
<TE>   With the rise of Nazism in Europe, Weisskopf left for America in
1937 and found work as an assistant professor of physics at the
University of Rochester.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, he and another physicist, Leo Szilard, called for
voluntary secrecy about new research on nuclear issues to keep the
material away from Nazi scientists, who were then believed to be
developing a bomb. Weisskopf's and Szilard's move was somewhat
startling at a time when it was accepted that a university's main
function was the dissemination of knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, a year after Weisskopf became a naturalized American
citizen, he moved to Los Alamos, N.M., to join the Manhattan Project
as group leader in a section engaged in the theoretical design of the
atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   In a lecture at MIT some years ago, Weisskopf noted that the
nuclear bomb was "the first serious encounter of physicists with the
problems of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   He also recalled his conflicting feelings about working on the
Manhattan Project, noting that although he thought the project was
probably an abuse of science for mass destruction, the alternative
was Hitler getting the bomb first and dominating the world.</TE>
<TE>   Weisskopf was among the small group of project members who
witnessed the first atomic blast in the New Mexican desert on July
16, 1945. Despite his ambivalence over the project, he later said he
and his colleagues had a "certain amount of pride" in their
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Weisskopf said he thought the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima in August 1945 was necessary to make a statement to Japan
about the serious nature of Allied resolve. He did, however, believe
the second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days after the Hiroshima
blast was unnecessary. He would later call it "a crime."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Weisskopf took a job at MIT, and would never again
work on nuclear arms projects.</TE>
<TE>   He helped found the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and became
an internationally recognized advocate for arms control. He wrote
extensively against the dangers of nuclear arms and offered support
to groups opposing nuclear weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   Weisskopf taught at MIT from 1946 to 1961, and during that time
co-wrote with John M. Blatt the textbook "Theoretical Nuclear
Research," one of the most widely used texts on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Weisskopf took a leave of absence and accepted the post
as director-general of the European Center for Nuclear Research in
Geneva, which housed the world's second-most-powerful large particle
accelerator or "atom smasher."</TE>
<TE>   The mission of the center, known as CERN, was to acquire knowledge
about the atom and apply such information to peaceful uses. Viewed as
a master at handling the scientific and political implications of the
center's work, Weisskopf stayed for a second two-year term.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to MIT in 1965, and held a variety of teaching and
administrative posts, including head of the physics department.
Weisskopf retired in 1974 after 28 years at the school, but remained
a senior lecturer in physics until the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Pope Paul VI named Weisskopf to the Pontifical Academy of
Sciences. Several years later, Weisskopf led a team of scientists who
conferred with President Reagan on the dangers of nuclear
proliferation.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Federation of
American Scientists, Weisskopf was president of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences from 1976 to 1979.</TE>
<TE>   His international awards included the Enrico Fermi Award from the
U.S. Department of Energy, the Max Planck Medal from the German
Physical Society, the Wolf Prize in Physics from Israel, the National
Medal of Science in the United States and the J. Robert Oppenheimer
Medal.</TE>
<TE>   A thoughtful writer, Weisskopf's books include "The Privilege of
Being a Physicist," a collection of essays, and "The Joys of
Insight," a personal memoir.</TE>
<TE>   "Important parts of the human experience cannot be reasonably
evaluated within the scientific system," he once wrote. "There cannot
be an all-encompassing scientific definition of good and evil, of
compassion, of rapture, of tragedy or humor, of hate, love, or faith,
of dignity and humiliation, or of concepts like the quality of life
or happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Weisskopf is survived by his second wife, Duscha Schmid; a son; a
daughter; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Navy Had Warnings on Jet Maintenance</HD>
<DH>Safety: Two workers at Point Mugu quit last year, citing
problems in the QF-4 program. A week ago, two airmen died in an air
show crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jet that crashed at the Point Mugu Air Show last weekend was in a
maintenance program that two former Navy aircraft specialists warned
officials last summer was plagued with problems and jeopardized the
squadron of aging fighter planes.</LD>
<LD>   Darrell Ellington, a mechanic on the QF-4 Phantoms, and Ken
Okesson, a quality assurance specialist, said they quit their jobs
last year because of persistent management and maintenance problems
associated with the Point Mugu Naval Air Station's QF-4 jet program.
They said they made their concerns known to officials at the Ventura
County base in resignation letters and exit interviews.</LD>
<LD>   So concerned was he about problems at the base, Ellington said
this week, that when Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, the pilot killed in
last Saturday's air show crash, asked him why he was quitting, the
mechanic responded bluntly.</LD>
<TE>   "I told him they were going to crash an airplane and kill
someone," said Ellington, who now lives in Oregon and continues to
serve in the Air National Guard. "Or at least they were going to get
someone hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Ellington and Okesson's letters and verbal warnings echoed the
concerns of a Navy inspector who two years earlier issued a highly
critical report of Point Mugu's civilian-operated QF-4 maintenance
program and warned of potential safety hazards. The report was part
of a routine annual inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Navy spokeswoman Mary Ann Freeman said Friday that employee
resignation letters expressing concerns about safety or workplace
issues "are always taken seriously. However, in this case there were
no specific allegations cited upon which to act."</TE>
<TE>   Confidential exit interviews were conducted with Ellington and
Okesson, Freeman said. And Capt. Mike Rabens was briefed on their
letters when he took over as commander of the Naval Test Wing Pacific
last summer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, all concerns outlined in the inspector's 1999 report
were addressed at the time and a follow-up investigation indicated
that improvements were made, said Doris G. Lance, also a Navy
spokeswoman. Squadrons are required to correct problems within 30
days or to submit plans that may require more time.</TE>
<TE>   The QF-4 jet that crashed at the air show was just delivered to
Point Mugu in February from the Naval Aviation Depot in Cherry Point,
N.C., Lance said. The cause of the jet's crash has not been
determined.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is currently conducting a full investigation of the QF-4
mishap at Point Mugu," Lance said. "In the past 20 years, this is the
only QF-4 flight mishap the Weapons Test Squadron has ever
experienced, with over 118,000 accident-free flight hours logged."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who has worked closely
with base officials on a number of projects and issues, said he was
unaware of employees' concerns involving the QF-4 program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disturbing that these things are coming forward because we
have a very good dialogue with the guys on the flight line," said
Gallegly, who was at the air show and witnessed the crash. "You can
be assured we will be very aggressive in trying to get some answers
to these allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Corps Capt. Andrew Muhs, 31,
who lived on the naval air base, were killed when their two-seat
Vietnam-era jet wobbled out of control and slammed into a marshy
field west of the runway during Point Mugu's 39th annual air show.
Norman was the pilot and Muhs the navigator.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 25,000 spectators witnessed the fiery crash, which occurred
as the jet banked to the right after completing a maneuver about 500
feet above the runway. Another QF-4 and two F-14 Tomcats were also in
the diamond formation. No one on the ground was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw white smoke and flames shooting from one
of the jet's engines moments before it plunged 500 feet to the ground
and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the crash investigation have said that nothing
has been ruled out as a possible cause, including mechanical
malfunction, faulty maintenance or even the possibility that birds
were sucked into one or both of the jet's engines.</TE>
<TE>   More Than 15 Years' Experience With Jet</TE>
<TE>   Ellington and Okesson were assigned to the Ventura County base's
Naval Weapons Test Squadron, which includes a fleet of more than 20
QF-4 fighter jets used in a missile test program.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington spent more than a decade working on the jet, which is
part of an early generation of military attack aircraft. Okesson
worked the last five years as a quality assurance specialist for the
QF-4.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, Okesson spent nearly two decades working on the jet
while in the Navy and as a civilian contractor. At that time, the jet
was known as an F-4. The Q designation refers to aircraft that have
been modified to serve as a target for military training purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington resigned in July, Okesson in August.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews this week, each said that the working environment
inside the QF-4 hangar had grown increasingly tense in recent years
as supervisors, faced with federally mandated staff reductions, grew
more demanding as the work force shrank.</TE>
<TE>   Younger and less experienced flight crews were assigned to work on
the vintage jets, adding to concerns among veteran mechanics, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People were being pressured into cutting corners," Okesson said.
"I think it's wrong to have the F-4s doing half the things they are
doing.... The morale goes downhill when management tries to force you
to do things that are dangerous. People can't keep their minds on
their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   A month before he left his post, Okesson said, he argued with
supervisors who wanted a QF-4 in the air despite warnings that the
jet wasn't ready to fly. When Okesson refused to sign off on the
flight, the supervisors relented. Only after a second round of safety
checks were completed would Okesson sign paperwork stating the jet
was airworthy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation letter, Okesson described supervision at the
hangar as "threat management."</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I hope the situation doesn't get so bad that someone
gets hurt," Okesson wrote in his Aug. 2 letter. "But, from where I
sit, I think it may get worse before it gets better and I don't want
to be around to see it."</TE>
<TE>   Okesson and Ellington's complaints came two years after a Navy
inspector found numerous problems with the QF-4 program. The
inspector's report was released two weeks after an accident on San
Nicholas Island involving a $1.3-million QF-4 jet that nearly killed
a civilian mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   That accident occurred the day before the start of the 1999 Point
Mugu Air Show when the aircraft rolled off the runway and tumbled
down a steep embankment. The plane was destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation of the accident showed that a base employee
failed to follow ground procedures and "corrective actions were
implemented to prevent a similar incident from occurring," Freeman
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Navy inspector's evaluation of the QF-4's quality
assurance program cited major problems with auditing procedures,
maintenance record-keeping and overall management.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to get a straight answer from the military and civilians
alike on who does what and who is responsible for specific personnel
or tasks is impossible because no one really knows their own chain of
command," Lt. Cmdr. Gary Green wrote in a May 7, 1999, report
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to say that maintenance is "beginning to demonstrate
tendencies of straying from the straight and narrow paths required
... to ensure safe and efficient aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   "If these practices are not corrected now," Green wrote, "they
will have a devastating impact on the safety of air crew and aircraft
worthiness in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Green was emphatic about poor record-keeping in the QF-4s
maintenance division at the time. "The neglect of this area over the
past months has resulted in a combination of discrepancies that if
not corrected could lead to possible loss of life, equipment and
weapon systems."</TE>
<TE>   Personnel Cutbacks Create Upheaval</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an October 1999 memo from Navy Capt. Alex B. Hnarakis
acknowledged that ongoing staff reductions and the transfer of some
of the QF-4 squadron's most skilled workers "have caused great
upheaval among our personnel," noting that behavior of some workers
"bordered on insubordination."</TE>
<TE>   "Despite this detrimental environment, QF-4s have continued to
provide outstanding support of critical Navy programs," Hnarakis
stated in his memo. "However, this support has not been achieved
without conflict or strife."</TE>
<TE>   Finding jet mechanics familiar with the QF-4 has grown
increasingly difficult because of job cuts, officials said. The plane
was first rolled off the McDonnell Douglas production line in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Others familiar with the Point Mugu base's training program,
however, said new mechanics can easily learn the plane's systems
through a 90-day course and a rigorous oral examination by a review
board.</TE>
<TE>   But flight line workers in the QF-4 hangar said more needs to be
done to improve working conditions at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Many connected with the jet program were saddened by the crash
April 20 but not necessarily surprised, said one civilian employee
who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are hurt and angry and now they want out because
it finally happened," said the worker. "We said it was going to
happen and it did in front of God and everyone."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Friday accused a Simi Valley woman of stealing
$132,000 from her husband a year before she and her teenage daughter
allegedly tried to kill him with a baseball bat.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Shannon Childs, 37, was charged with felony grand theft.
She and her daughter, Jennifer Lee Childs, 19, already are facing
charges of attempted murder and aggravated arson in connection with a
March 25 attack on Larry Childs.</LD>
<LD>   According to court documents, Eileen Childs, who claims to suffer
from lupus, had a life insurance policy allowing a $132,000
"pre-death benefit" for her husband. She is accused of forging his
endorsement on a check made out to him for that sum by her insurer.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors asked that the source of any bail money put up by
Childs be investigated by the court. She and her daughter are being
held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail each.</TE>

<LD>When I was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, I crossed
into dangerous territory that the insurance companies call
"liability." Although the science may exist that could give us back
our health, the insurance companies may not pay for it and the cost
to individuals is prohibitive.</LD>
<LD>   The labyrinth of issues created by drug companies, the government
(Medicare) and private insurance companies that physicians and their
patients must navigate is complicated at every turn. Sometimes there
really is no way out. It is especially maddening in a country where
the best available health care should be a right.</LD>
<LD>   You and your physician know what ails you and how to fix it. But
your insurance company has to agree to pay for it. Either that or you
decide that you can pay the bills.</LD>
<TE>   For those of us with private insurance the danger is having our
premiums raised when the bills get too high or having the insurance
canceled. For those on Medicare, the situation is a lot worse.</TE>
<TE>   Your life has just been reduced to the cost of premiums divided by
the cost of your treatment and multiplied by whatever factor the
insurance company uses for its profit margin so it can stay in
business for everyone else. It's a mean equation.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not make this a blame game. For the sake of discussion,
let's say that the insurance companies are right. They really cannot
afford to cover the expensive drugs and procedures that our
pharmaceutical companies and equipment manufacturers are providing.</TE>
<TE>   The question then becomes one of priorities and who has the right
to set them. Pharmaceutical companies produce drugs based not only on
societal need but on whether that need can be translated into enough
sales to turn a profit to pay for the next best thing coming through
the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Science and technology are evolving at such an accelerated pace
that the structure for getting their miracles to patients who need
them is outdated. We seem to have gotten ahead of ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   I take Gleevec, a new cancer drug that molecularly targets the
protein that feeds cancer cells, thereby killing them and with few
side effects. Approved by the FDA last May, it is viewed as a drug
that can manage this disease for most people and may cure some
patients. My insurance covers this prescription and the co-payment is
only $10. The cost is $4,800 per month. Were I on Medicare or my
insurance did not cover it, I could not afford Gleevec. Not taking it
could easily cost my life.</TE>
<TE>   Two measures pending in Congress would expand Medicare coverage to
all oral cancer medications. There will be more molecularly targeted
drugs that could be lifesavers for people with various types of
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Are pharmaceutical priorities skewed to profits more than to
patient needs? How about the politics of Medicare? Who benefits when
older patients do not get the care they need and deserve but cannot
afford? It is frightening to think that a 56-year-old woman with
private insurance can have Gleevec but a 65-year-old retired woman
with a fixed income who is on Medicare cannot.</TE>
<TE>   We are real people with real ailments that have real, available
remedies. There should be a way to get them from that brilliant team
of researchers in the lab to us at the drugstore counter without
breaking anyone's bank.</TE>

<HD>Leave God Out of This Patriot's (Ball) Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH R. TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>Keith Taylor is a retired Navy officer living in Chula
Vista. E-mail: krtaylorxyz@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I resent the singing of "God Bless America" at the ballgame. That
isn't an easy admission because baseball, God and patriotism are so
intertwined that they are often considered one.</LD>
<LD>   I am patriotic and have the credentials to support that claim. I
served my country in uniform for nearly 23 years. I gladly accepted
hardship and danger as a part of my job. The Navy thought enough of
me to make me one of the younger chief petty officers of my time, and
to trust me with some of its most closely held secrets. It later put
a little gold on my sleeves and a few shiny medals on my chest.</LD>
<LD>   I do all the other things too. I vote in every election and donate
time, money and effort to help candidates and causes of my choice. I
worked the polls in about 15 elections and often donated the meager
stipend to charity.</LD>
<TE>   That brings me to "God Bless America." My resentment of it has
nothing to do with patriotism. It has an awful lot to do with God,
and public prayers given to him. "God Bless America" is definitely a
prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we can simply say it doesn't hurt, and that's true. A mere
song can't hurt; at least not much. Neither could the posting of the
Ten Commandments in schools. Neither could opening a school session
with a prayer invoked over the loudspeaker. Nor could the inscription
"In God we trust" on our currency really hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The constitutions of Arkansas, Maryland, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee forbid any
nonbeliever from holding office of any sort, but I don't live in any
of those states. So why should I worry about it?</TE>
<TE>   None of those things matter much taken separately, but
collectively they deliver a message.</TE>
<TE>   It hurts to see a national newspaper run a piece claiming that
Sept. 11 had a silver lining because it brings us closer to God. The
writer also said that there were no atheists in the World Trade
Center. I flinch when I hear not only buffoons such as Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell, but the likes of TV host Ben Stein blame atheists
for the attack on the World Trade Center. How about when a search for
a cure for many of our dread diseases is stymied by a ridiculous
belief that stem cell research is somehow counter to God's will?</TE>
<TE>   Does it matter to anybody that our foreign policy is, in a large
part, dictated by religious beliefs? Do you imagine it stung a bit
back in 1987 when then-Vice President George Bush stated that
atheists could not be patriotic nor could they be citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The list is endless. Criticize any one of those things and soon
you'll hear "this is a Christian nation." For proof you'll hear about
the coins, the song, the Pledge of Allegiance ("under God"), and all
the rest of the trappings of religion. Every single one will be
trotted out to prove that, despite what the Constitution says, "this
is a Christian nation."</TE>
<TE>   You know what hurts most of all? The fact that if the members of
any religion were treated as we atheists are, Congress, the media,
even leaders of other religions would defend their rights.</TE>
<TE>   So, no, I will not sing "God Bless America. I'm not so stupid as
to sit down during the playing of it, and incur the wrath of those
who believe something special will happen because they sing a prayer.
I'll simply leave before they start playing it.</TE>
<TE>   But I am indeed offended by it.</TE>

<LD>Rooster tails of sawdust will fly and a thumb or two will no doubt
turn painfully purple as more than 200 saw- and hammer-wielding
mothers, fathers and kids swarm over a lot in San Pedro this morning
to pay back a debt.</LD>
<LD>   Toberman Settlement House, one of Los Angeles' oldest and quietest
private social service agencies, wants to replace its worn-out
buildings in San Pedro with four new structures. It's starting today
by constructing a swing set and jungle gym with a hand from those
whom Toberman has already helped. The agency, which serves more than
14,000 poor residents each year, will also need help from wealthy
donors. But to get the rebuilding campaign rolling, families whose
lives it has steadied will spend the weekend building a new
playground.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 100 years ago, Los Angeles Mayor James Toberman and his
wife, Emma, founded the settlement house in memory of their son, who
died at 29. The mission opened in 1903 in Echo Park, offering health
care, delinquency prevention programs and a residence for single
women. It moved to San Pedro's Barton Hill neighborhood in 1937, but
its goal remained the same: to help local residents "grow toward
moral, spiritual and economic independence."</LD>
<TE>   Run by the United Methodist Church, Toberman is a splendid example
of how faith-based initiatives should work. Toberman stretches its
$2-million budget far, providing emergency food and clothing to 1,000
families each month and training more than 300 former welfare
recipients for jobs in construction and other trades. Kids who have
had trouble with the law get help dealing with their problems; most
have not been rearrested. Street counselors help keep the peace among
harbor area gangs. After-school volunteers help more than 100 kids a
day with homework or let them blow off steam on the soccer field,
teach them to make lanyards or take them to Dodger games. Add to this
a summer day camp, a preschool, psychological counseling, parenting
help and a senior citizens club.</TE>
<TE>   Toberman's Methodist affiliation gives it moral grounding, but it
is not a religious straitjacket. No one has to pray in order to get
food or shoot hoops, and there is no religious focus to the agency's
programs. Toberman's executive director is Jewish and its clientele
largely Roman Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's guiding principle is that families in need of help
should get it. Some 200 parents and kids whom Toberman counselors
have helped say they will show up early this morning to prepare the
playground for a new generation of needy families. What a nice way to
say thank you.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Rescuer's Tale: Fight, Then Flight," April 22: Bobby Green is a
hero. Although outraged by a social injustice, he acted with personal
grace and justice. He is also a pointed example that the concept of
identifying and categorizing people by the color of their skin makes
as much sense as the measuring of people by the color of their hair.
The people of this world are not divided by race, they are divided by
values representing the decent and the indecent. Green is just
another color that makes up the rainbow of the decent.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Chacon</LD>
<LD>   Tustin</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every once in a while, among the daily dose of betrayals, lies,
murders and inhumanity that is the daily newspaper, a morsel of hope
for the future of humanity appears. Monday's Column One was just that
morsel. Green said, "To me, what [Damien Williams] did was wrong.
Just as what is right is right, what is wrong is wrong." And, "I
saved another man's life because to me, he was another human being
who needed my help."</TE>
<TE>   Green makes his views known about the events that preceded the
1992 riots, and he states clearly that much injustice occurred. He
described himself as very angry and frustrated about those
injustices. Yet when he saw a fellow human being beaten for the color
of his skin and watched that beating continue past the point of
consciousness, Green's beliefs in right and wrong superseded any
other beliefs or loyalties. He acted upon the simple concept of right
and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Until we as people act upon the belief that "right is right and
wrong is wrong," our differences will only further divide us. It is
clear to me that I cannot change the world. What I can do is
influence my little part of it. What I can do is raise my children so
as not to assign labels to groups based upon skin color, political
party, gender, sexual orientation or other differences but instead
judge people as individuals. And, like Green, I can refuse to put my
group's interests above those of the common good.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Erkel</TE>
<TE>   Victorville</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green is a true hero and role model for all of us. Forget sports
figures or entertainment figures; Green is a man who should be held
up to our children, in all communities and from all backgrounds.
Hollywood is missing the boat in terms of a good story depicting
Green and the others who assisted him in the rescue of Reginald
Denny. They exemplify the values that we as Americans should cherish.</TE>

<LD>We have just been through one of the dirtiest primary campaigns in
history, and just a little over 30% of our voters took the time to
cast their votes. Millions of dollars were spent on smear tactics. A
lot of this money could have been used to build schools and develop
education programs to help our unemployed find jobs that pay a living
wage. It could have been used to provide decent health care for our
people. However, the Nov. 4 election will provide the people of
California an opportunity to reject the big-money candidates and vote
for candidates interested in making life better for the people rather
than focusing on raising money for future campaigns and themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Miguel Camejo and Donna Warren head up the Green Party's
ticket in this upcoming election and will focus on bringing health
care to all Californians, supporting a living wage, protecting
labor's rights and spearheading an education system designed to
enable our people to lead independent and rewarding lives.</LD>

<LD>It seems as if Los Angeles could be the first major city in America
to be dismantled by apathy. A small coterie of essentially unknown
Valley individuals, with God knows what real motivations (my guess is
that it's a West Valley tax cut scheme), have plotted--and made
alarming progress--to rip the city of Los Angeles in half. And nobody
save The Times is talking about it or seems to care (editorial, April
20).</LD>
<LD>   Imagine if a small group of eastern Queens residents decided that
they wanted to break the borough away from New York City. Or some
South Side Chicago group wanted to split from the city. It's not
difficult to imagine the uproar from proud New Yorkers or Chicagoans;
they would run them out of town on a rail. Here in Los Angeles, not
only is this ridiculous notion not met with outrage, it's taken
seriously and may appear on a ballot.</LD>
<LD>   If the residents of L.A. harbor so much apathy and disdain for
their city that they do vote to break it up, if they want to take the
destructive step of creating a new city (one that is built out,
complete and will not change one iota) instead of focusing their
energies on improving the one that exists, then they'll get what they
deserve. And one of the truly remarkable cities in the world will be
the victim.</LD>

<TE>   Will I be better off if the Valley and/or Hollywood secede from
Los Angeles? My answer is no. I would lose my ability to make
reservations on many of the present L.A. city Recreation and Parks
Department golf courses and the ability to take advantage of the L.A.
resident senior golf discount. Also, the time to receive reserved
books from the L.A. Public Library would be increased, since fewer
library branches would be a source for these items.</TE>

<TE>   The San Fernando Valley cannot afford to go independent. That
means we will be burdened with increased taxes, yet another layer of
bureaucracy, more office seekers and the same old creaky services. Oh
yes, and alimony to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession has been a fantasy for as long as I can remember.
The reason it has stayed a pipe dream is that it makes no sense and
offers no benefits. Instead, why not make the Valley a
semi-autonomous division of the city? It would have a vice mayor, and
Valley members of the L.A. City Council could act independently on
Valley matters.</TE>

<LD>Re "4,000 Homes, No Schools in Sight," April 22: How distressing to
see that developers in Orange County have constructed 4,000 homes
without the required needs to serve those homes--like schools. This
reminds us of the Newhall Ranch developers trying to build a
mega-city without sufficient water to serve that development.</LD>
<LD>   It is also distressing to wonder what kind of school crisis will
occur in the neighborhoods surrounding the problematic proposed Playa
Vista development at the Ballona Wetlands, where already more than
3,000 residential units have been approved by the city with no school
site available. The only school site planned for the entire
13,000-unit residential development has now been nixed by the LAUSD
because of methane contamination far exceeding that of the Belmont
site.</LD>
<LD>   Just as in Orange County, Mello-Roos bonds have been approved by
the city of Los Angeles, yet infrastructure that is supposed to be
financed by those bonds goes wanting. Perhaps the state controller
should investigate the actual payouts of those bonds to see if they
didn't all go to pay high-priced lawyers, consultants and lobbyists
who work to convince officials that building in a high-risk
liquefaction zone oozing with explosive gases is safe.</LD>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be smarter for local officials to stop approving these
speculative developments unless and until all of the required
infrastructure (including schools, water, power, transportation) is
properly and soundly accounted for? The addiction that cities and
counties have to more and more development obviously keeps them from
thinking straight.</TE>

<LD>On April 16, I saw a young man attempt to steal mail out of a locked
mailbox in my townhouse complex. I reported this to the local
postman, who refused to get involved but did tell me to call the post
office. When I called the post office I was told to call the postal
inspector's office. When I tried that, I was given the name of the
inspector for the particular area--who was not in at 2:30 p.m. I left
a detailed voicemail message with a return phone number.</LD>
<LD>   Guess what? No one called me back. I was a percipient witness to a
federal criminal act; I spoke directly with the young man who had his
entire arm in the locked mailbox; I wrote down the young man's
license number and was ready, willing and able to pursue the matter,
but there was no one who would accept responsibility for receiving
the report. I don't think anyone would argue that the fabric of our
society has degenerated over the years. Is it any wonder that this
degeneration has occurred when a citizen attempts to report a federal
offense to the authorities and no one listens?</LD>

<LD>If we are old enough, we can remember the service stations where one
pulled in and got the tank filled, the oil, water and tires checked
and the windshield washed while we used the restroom. All this for
the price of the gasoline, like 25 cents a gallon. Now we get to do
all that for ourselves in many stations, except use the restroom,
especially in northern Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   An available restroom, the last vestige of oil-company courtesy,
is fading away. Now we keep our money in our pocket until we find
that the station we are patronizing will meet our need for relief. We
would be pleased--and hurried on our way--if gas station proprietors
were required to post a sign, as visible as the per-gallon price,
reading "Customer restrooms not available" at stations that do not
have this amenity. Or maybe, on a positive note, the station would
want to put out a sign, "Restrooms for customers."</LD>
<LD>   "Clean" is probably too much to expect.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Palestinian Side Must Be Told," Commentary, April 23: Robert
Scheer's parents must sleep well at night knowing they brought up a
son who is so full of self-hate that he brings it on his own people.
At a time when many Europeans are anti-Semitic (not anti-Israel),
Scheer proudly bolsters their hatred with his claim that American
Jews are in denial about "the brutality of Israel's recent actions"
and, therefore, "damn those who report the truth."</LD>
<LD>   To what truth is Scheer referring? Israel is at war with people
(housed in cities populated by civilians) who are trying to destroy
civilized life in the only nation Jews have ever known and must have
to survive. All wars are brutal. Ariel Sharon pleaded with and then
warned Yasser Arafat of the consequences of the continual suicide
bombings that were killing innocent Israeli citizens. Arafat refused
to listen. Oh, yes, there was a Palestinian side to this story.
Unfortunately, the sounds of the bombs on the streets of Israel and
the wailing of its mourners drowned it out. To do honest reporting,
one must never forget when looking at a crumbled Palestinian village
or a dead Palestinian that this "brutality" will end, and the hope is
that the terrorism inflicted on Israel will end with it. Once that
happens, perhaps a Palestinian side can be told.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you, Robert Scheer, for your commentary. Being neither a Jew
nor an Arab, I'm heartbroken by the one-sided coverage of the
conflict in the Middle East. Arabs may not be as media-savvy in
constructing compelling sound bites that resonate with American
sensibilities, and they certainly do not have editorial allies as
predisposed to their position, but that doesn't make the Palestinian
cause any less real, justified or deserving of our understanding.
Untangling media bias regarding the Middle East will be as difficult
as formulating a land-sharing plan in the West Bank or putting to
rest generations of violence, but it's just as necessary for a
lasting peace.</TE>
<TE>   The American media's pro-Israeli stance accurately echoes the
economic bias of the U.S. government in granting Israel billions in
foreign aid each year and a relative pittance for Arabs of the
region. Scheer is right, but the American media must do more than
simply report the Palestinian angle. Otherwise, a few touching
stories of injustice to Palestinians will become only tragic
patronization in a conflict in which the U.S. has already chosen its
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Linder</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic that on the same day that Scheer vigorously defends
his right as an American Jew to criticize Israel, you report (Page
A5) that "masked gunmen pulled three Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israel out of a taxi and shot them as a large
crowd watched." The right of dissent is an essential Jewish tradition
and Scheer has plenty of company: Noam Chomsky, Peace Now, etc.
Instead of defending the already-vibrant Jewish right of dissent, may
I suggest that Scheer seek out peaceful Arab dissenters. Like Anwar
Sadat, they are usually snuffed out.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Barak</TE>
<TE>   Pomona</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How ironic that Scheer writes an entire piece around the notion
that there is no media bias against Israel and that equal coverage is
given to both sides in the Mideast. He has already written multiple
columns dedicated to his harsh condemnation of Israel. There are two
aspects of biased journalism: how one writes an article and what one
chooses to write the article about. If fewer people like Scheer were
given the spotlight--where they dedicate their energy to condemning
the only non-Arab country in the region--then maybe we'd be closer to
honest reporting.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At first, I thought Scheer's column would be another instance of
Israel- or Jew-bashing, but I was pleasantly surprised at his
even-handedness. Scheer is Jewish and has taken a position that many,
but not all, Jews will criticize, and he's not the only Jewish writer
to speak out in this manner. On the flip side, I'm still waiting for
a similar column to appear from an Arab or Muslim writer.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Daitch</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Scheer for still speaking out against the injustice he
sees in the Middle East and in the majority of the reporting on the
war there. Although I see the mood in the U.S. shifting sharply
toward the Israeli side, there are signs of hope for improving the
living conditions of Palestinians. Just like a country hit by a
natural disasters, the Palestinians will need a lot of assistance
after their man-made disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Columns like Scheer's remind people of the effect Israel's "war on
terror" has had on the people whose neighborhoods the IDF turned into
war zones.</TE>
<TE>   If The Times manages to make just a few people think that there
may be another side to the story, I think the subscriptions you lost
due to your "pro-Palestinian" coverage are a small price to pay.</TE>

<HD>French Immigrants and Le Pen's Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a closer look, the Jean-Marie Le Pen ascendancy in the first
round of the French presidential elections may not really be much of
a surprise (April 22). His anti-immigrant positions are resonating in
a country where the following fact exists: With a population that is
roughly 10% non-native Muslim, the French are reproducing at the rate
of roughly 1.4 births per woman while the mostly North African
immigrant population is reproducing at roughly four times that.
People are beginning to fear that if this trend continues, in the
next 25 to 50 years France will simply cease to remain part of
Western civilization. The French fear, maybe not incorrectly so, that
rather than assimilating, the new masses will assert a cultural
hegemony.</LD>
<LD>   Similar low birthrates for Western Europeans exist throughout the
Continent. In fact, they are the lowest in the world and nowhere near
the 2.1 births per woman needed to replenish extant native
populations. As we make our way deeper into the 21st century, Europe
will be faced with the possibility of slowly ceding its identity to
the East.</LD>
<LD>   For better or worse, Jean-Marie Le Pen is not an anomaly, he is a
harbinger.</LD>

<TE>   How curious: When far-rightists surge in popularity in America,
the dynamic is called a return to "family values" and "morality."
When far-rightists surge in popularity in Europe, the political
dynamic is called a rise in fascism. Is a double standard at work
here?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Ugly Currents in Europe," editorial, April 23: The attempts to
paint the success of Le Pen in France as a threat to democracy are
disingenuous at best, rank hypocrisy at worst.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, I don't remember the citizens of the United States voting
on immigration (we tried it here in California once and The Times
didn't particularly care for the result)--which is precisely the
point. The hysteria concerning Le Pen stems not from the fact that he
may curtail the people's will but rather because they might actually
have a chance to exercise it.</TE>
<TE>   To whom does being against immigration, multiculturalism and the
European Union constitute fascism? Only to the elite who pursue the
raw power of a supranational government answerable to none but
themselves. To this end they seek, through mass immigration, the end
of national unity. This is why they are so apoplectic concerning the
rise of the right in Europe and the United States. This is why
rightists are all tarred so viciously with the accusations of being
the next Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   A brief history lesson. Nazi is short for National Socialist; its
flag was red. Socialist governments killed at least 50 million of
their own people in the past century. With the socialists running
Europe, we're supposed to fear the right? With such concern for
democracy, I'll be breathlessly awaiting your calls for a national
referendum on immigration in this country.</TE>

<LD>Re "Was Fatal Encounter Murder or Justifiable Homicide?" April 22:
When police officers pump a zillion bullets into an elderly homeless
woman, a mentally impaired home dweller, a Halloween party guest or a
startled woman who had fallen asleep on the side of the road, murder
charges are never filed. "The officers were reasonably in fear of
their lives" is the official statement.</LD>
<LD>   If Travarla Atwell Saffore--who killed a man who had not only
chased him through the streets for 20 minutes but was found with a
screwdriver in his pocket--were a police officer, instead of the
district attorney's office filing murder charges it would be giving
the official statement.</LD>

<LD>Your story about Thor Heyerdahl's passing omits one important
Hollywood connection (April 19). After his sensational trip by raft
from Peru to Tahiti and the publication of his bestseller book
"Kon-Tiki," Thor courted my father, producer Sol Lesser (and vice
versa), about making a movie based on his adventure. My father
succeeded in working Heyerdahl's and Olle Nordemar's 30-minute
documentary (16mm black-and-white amateur footage) into an
international smash feature, released in 1950 by RKO.</LD>
<LD>   At Academy Awards time the next spring, their joint film won an

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Flaherty is correct that reparations lawsuits against private
companies are another example of the out-of-control justice system
("Reparations Issue Is a Smoke Screen and a Shakedown," Commentary,
April 22). The civil judicial system has become a de facto lottery.</LD>
<LD>   Many unethical attorneys file meritless lawsuits in the hope the
other side will settle rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars
to defend themselves. While we often read about such suits against
large corporations, the "lawsuit industry" is hard at work legally
extorting private citizens as well.</LD>
<LD>   Most individuals are unaware that they can be bankrupted by
defending against a frivolous and meritless lawsuit as easily as they
can lose everything from a medical calamity. Until legislators and
judges rein in the unethical attorneys who file such lawsuits we are
all potential victims of this type of shakedown.</LD>
<TE>   David Whitehead</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty's remarks are representative of those of a (I'll go out
on a limb here) white conservative male who fears for his very
existence. While reparations needn't take the form of Deadria
Farmer-Paellmann's choice--that of lawsuits against every company
remotely affiliated with slavery--there needs nonetheless to be an
effective program designed to give black Americans equal access to
things that really matter (education, loans, home and business
ownership, political power, etc.), not just lip service. We can no
longer deny the truth and responsibility and the onus of reversing a
250-plus-year trend.</TE>
<TE>   Generation after generation has added insult to injury by claiming
"I didn't own any slaves," thus leaving none culpable for the state
of black America today. It's long past time that the federal
government issue a public apology for allowing slavery to flourish
and for the years since, with its help, that have been less than kind
to black Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Until we as a nation begin healing the psychic scarring and social
inequities that are slavery's insidious legacy, I'm afraid Flaherty
ain't seen nothin' yet.</TE>

<TE>   Hopefully, the defendant firms sued in the Brooklyn, N.Y., federal
lawsuit alleging they profited from slavery will not be intimidated
into settling. Unlike Japanese Americans and Jews who received
reparations for personal wrongs experienced during World War II, no
African American living today personally experienced slavery.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans such as Shelby Steele and Juan Williams have
spoken out against this attempt to promote a sense of victimization.
Recent immigrants from such areas as Mexico, Central America and
Southeast Asia come to this country, often from less-than-desirable
circumstances, and prosper. But they don't have self-promoters
preaching a racist, self-defeating philosophy of victimology to them.</TE>

<TE>   Flaherty's first sentence was, "Imagine getting sued for what your
great-great grandfather did--legally--a century and a half ago." It
seems that most white Americans are vehemently against reparations of
any sort. If America had truly recognized our emancipation, say, a
century and a half ago, we would have a national holiday
commemorating the freeing of the slaves, say, like the Fourth of
July.</TE>
<TE>   Most black American taxpayers realize that no check will ever be
in the mail for slavery reparations, let alone for the 100 years
after--the black codes, the Jim Crow years, lynchings, burnings,
castrations, segregation, degradation, stealing of property,
oppression, poverty, redlining, profiling and discrimination. Will it
take another 300 years before we realize we're all in this together?</TE>

<HD>Food Stamp Errors Cost State Dearly</HD>
<DH>Sanctions: The federal government likely will fine California at
least $46 million because of rampant problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Friday scolded California for operating
the most error-plagued food stamp program in the nation and disclosed
that the state faces a likely penalty of tens of millions of dollars, the
largest such sanction imposed in the history of the program.</LD>
<LD>   The California problems, centered in Los Angeles County, stood out
even among big urban states with large populations of immigrants and the
poor. The state's rate of incorrect food stamp allocations was twice the
U.S. average and contrasted with a trend of improvement in states
including New York, Texas and Illinois.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something I'm very, very, very concerned about," Eric Bost, the
U.S. Agriculture Department's undersecretary for nutrition programs, said
in an interview. He added that he has made five visits to California to
help fix the problem. "At some point in time, I've got to say, 'OK guys,
I've met you more than halfway--it's time for you to start to produce.' I
believe I'm at that point."</LD>
<TE>   According to federal data released Friday, California awarded the
wrong amount of food stamps in 17.4% of its cases last year. An estimated
124,520 households received overpayments for food stamps, with 68,486
getting less than they were eligible for.</TE>
<TE>   The errors were blamed mostly on a new computer system that has proved
troublesome in Los Angeles County and the state's demanding paperwork
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Agriculture, relying on a formula, assessed the
state a $115.8-million "liability" for the problems and soon will begin
negotiating repayment from California for a substantial part of that
money as a sanction.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Bost said the state will end up paying "more than
40%" of its liability to Washington. That would come to more than $46
million, an unprecedented sanction in the food stamp program, which dates
to the 1960s. State officials will be required to spend much of the
remainder on improving management of the food aid.</TE>
<TE>   California officials were chagrined Friday at the size of the
sanction, urging the federal government to give them more time to work
out the difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "Just looking at the gross figure, the magnitude of these sanctions
[is] much too large by any standard," said Glen Rosselli, undersecretary
of the California Health and Human Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "California simply has to hope--L.A. County has to hope--that the feds
do the right thing now and do not pull money out of the program in lean
times when there's almost a nationwide consensus that the system doesn't
work."</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for food stamps, the gross monthly income for most families
must be 130% or less of the federal poverty guideline, or about $1,533
per month for a family of three.</TE>
<TE>   California, which provides more than 1.7 million residents with food
stamp benefits averaging $75 every month, has long struggled to improve
the quality of its program.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that the state's filing system is too strict,
requiring recipients to submit monthly income reports that flood county
offices with paperwork and increase the chances of mistakes. Most states
require recipients to fill out applications quarterly, or even less
often.</TE>
<TE>   Still, error rates have declined in such counties as San Francisco,
Santa Clara, Alameda and Riverside, noted Bruce Wagstaff, deputy director
of the California Department of Social Services' welfare-to-work
division. By all accounts, the problems are centered in Los Angeles
County, where a new computer system that was supposed to improve matters
has instead created bureaucratic headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also say the system is bug-ridden and overly complex. The
county and the state say workers had not been sufficiently trained to use
the system, which helps determine food stamp allocations for 40% of
California recipients. In 1998, the county's error rate was 15%. As late
as December 2001, Wagstaff said, it was 21%.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the federal government has typically allowed states to
plow money into their own programs rather than sending fines to
Washington. But a high-level budget official in the Bush administration
sent a strong signal Friday that the White House approves of a hefty fine
for California.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Everson, controller of the Office of Management and Budget,
described California's continuing problems as "unconscionable,"
considering that other large states with diverse populations have been
improving their food stamp efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the enforcement of the statutory sanctions by the
Agriculture Department and believe that over time this will lead to
better management of the food stamp program in California and elsewhere,"
Everson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been struggling with our error rate for some time," said Eileen
Kelly, an official of the Los Angeles Department of Public and Social
Services. She said that, after last year's dismal performance, the county
beefed up its audit staff to examine 3,500 cases each month rather than
the federally required 50. Kelly said the county also began a review of
all 300,000 cases and that unofficial results are showing some progress.</TE>
<TE>   It is frustrating for the department, she said, "to be talking about
what our error rate was in September when we've made substantial
improvement" since then.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles also hopes that the federal government will acknowledge
local efforts and agree to a reinvestment program rather than a fine. The
state passes fines on to counties consistent with their contribution to
the state's overall error rate.</TE>
<TE>   With a $100-million shortfall projected next year for CALWorks,
California's welfare-to-work plan, the Los Angeles welfare department is
in no condition to redirect tens of millions of county dollars to patch
the holes in the food stamp program that such fines would create. "If we
have to pay a food stamp fine," Kelly said, "we would have to have cuts
across the board in all programs."</TE>
<TE>   Food stamp advocates expressed concern that a focus on California's
stubborn error rates could divert attention from the goal of ensuring
that qualified, needy individuals receive food stamps. By some surveys,
the state's food stamp program reaches only about half or even less of
those qualified.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping that the county can make it easier to get food stamps
and reduce the error rate at the same time," said Matthew Sharp, director
of the Los Angeles office of the nonprofit California Food Policy
Advocates. "The focus on reducing the error rate should not be a singular
focus."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor also fear that California officials may reduce
the number of food stamp recipients as one way to reduce the number of
errors in serving them.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the 8.66% error rate for the 2001 fiscal year was the
lowest ever recorded, Agriculture officials said Friday. Among large
states, Texas had an error rate of 3.7%, New York had 8.6%, Illinois had
8.2% and Florida had 9.8%.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to California, Michigan stood out as a troubled program,
with an error rate of 13.9%. Agriculture officials assessed a liability
of $13.9 million, some of which will come in the form of a fine.</TE>
<TE>   California last year had the nation's second-worst performance, with
an error rate of 14%, leading to a potential $47.4-million fine, which
officials later reduced to $11.8 million and have not yet collected,
pending improvements in the program. But on Friday, they suggested that
the state would soon be treated less patiently.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about hungry people getting food on the table--that's
the issue for me very clearly," said Bost, who formerly ran Texas'
program. But he added that as California ultimately straightens out its
program, part of that correction will also involve cutting back benefits
for those who have been awarded above the legal amount.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Economy Surges 5.8% in First Quarter</HD>
<DH>Indicators: The country shows resilience, but the outlook is
clouded by a drop in consumer confidence and weakness in business
investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy snapped back from recession and the Sept. 11
terror attacks to grow at a 5.8% annual rate during the first three
months of 2002, its fastest in two years.</LD>
<LD>   But separately, a widely followed consumer confidence measure slipped
to a three-month low, suggesting that consumption--and with it further
growth--may slow from its early-year pop.</LD>
<LD>   The gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and
services, expanded at a faster-than-expected pace during January through
March as die-hard consumers boosted purchases of clothes, furniture and
services such as medical care, and shellshocked businesses improved their
inventories.</LD>
<TE>   The new growth numbers, issued Friday by the Commerce Department,
raised anew the question of whether the economy was ever in recession.
And they represented a tribute to the nation's economic resourcefulness
in rebounding so quickly from the September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But they failed to answer the big question of the moment: Is business
finally taking the load off consumers, whose spending has kept the
economy afloat in the last year, and resuming the kind of fast-paced
investment that fueled much of the late-1990s boom?</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't know whether the baton has been passed from consumers
to business," said Diane C. Swonk, chief economist of Bank One Corp. in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The new statistics show that business investment in the crucial
equipment and software sectors was essentially flat during the latest
quarter, an improvement over the 5.3% decline of the previous quarter but
hardly evidence of a new rush to invest.</TE>
<TE>   The new growth figures did little to buoy investors, who sent stocks
sharply lower Friday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. stocks turned in their worst weekly performance since September.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 124.34 points, or 1.2%, on Friday
to 9,910.72, its first close below the 10,000 mark in two months. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index tumbled 49.81 points, or 2.9%, to
1,663.89.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the value of U.S. stocks slipped $491 billion, the
largest decline since trading resumed in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks were hurt in part by concern that the economic recovery isn't
translating into a fast profit turnaround for many companies, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also fretted over a new University of Michigan report that
consumer confidence fell in April, largely on worries about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the attendant surge in gasoline prices.
The index slipped to 93 from 95.7 in March, its lowest level since
January.</TE>
<TE>   Last quarter's 5.8% growth rate followed a 1.7% expansion during the
previous quarter and extended an economic performance that has left
economists and policymakers puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   There were signs of economic weakness as early as the spring of 2000,
when the stock market began its long dive, and the nation's employment
started sliding more than a year ago. But the economy has actually
contracted for only a single quarter, from July through September, and it
shrank only at a modest 1.3% pace. Recessions are traditionally thought
to be at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   Although virtually every other recession since World War II has
started with consumers pulling back and businesses responding by cutting
production, this time the opposite occurred. Consumers have continued to
buy while businesses, overextended with investments and facing new
competition, contracted abruptly in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts complained that Friday's numbers were particularly hard to
interpret because Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of
semiconductors, has stopped telling the government about its orders,
inventories and shipments, making it harder to estimate economic trends.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's decision means the new investment data are "corrupt," Swonk
said. "It's hard to know what to make of corrupt data." Intel said it is
no longer providing information because it thinks the statistics the
government generates from them are meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Pessimists acknowledged surprise at Friday's robust growth numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely were firmer than we'd expected," said William Dudley,
chief U.S. economist with Goldman Sachs in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But even optimists such as Swonk said the latest snapshot of the
economy does not provide a clear picture of what's to come.</TE>
<TE>   "They show the economic rocket has taken off," Swonk said. But "they
don't show whether the booster jets needed to keep it going have kicked
in."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest contributor to last quarter's growth was business
inventory improvement. Although corporate America continued shrinking its
backup supply of goods, it did so at a much slower pace, which amounts to
a production increase over the previous quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Private business inventories fell by $36.2 billion in the first
quarter, compared with $119.3 billion in the fourth quarter and $61.9
billion in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. The change
accounted for 3.1 percentage points of the 5.8% growth rate.</TE>
<TE>   Continued consumption by average Americans was the next biggest
contributor. But in contrast to the fourth quarter, when people were
buying big-ticket items such as cars, last quarter's spending focused on
less expensive items such as clothes, shoes and food, government figures
show.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush used the occasion of Friday's GDP report to tout
further tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The president called the 5.8% figure "a very encouraging sign," but
added: "I am not content. We've got to do more." The "more" that's
needed, according to Bush, is to make the administration's 10-year,
$1.3-trillion tax cut permanent. "Tax relief is an incredibly important
part of this recovery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush dismissed reports that tax revenue is running far below
expectations, threatening to double the size of this year's budget
deficit. He said that as a candidate he warned of deficits if the country
faced war, recession or national emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, we got all three," he said. "And we're recovering from
all three."</TE>

<HD>How to Keep 'Em Down On the Farm: Subsidies</HD>
<DH>Congress: In tribute to agriculture lobby's clout, bill bumps
funding 70%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>At a time when Congress is stalemated on a spate of issues, one
measure is an eye-catching exception: a major rewrite of federal farm
policy.</LD>
<LD>   While most other major legislation seems doomed to election-year
oblivion, congressional negotiators put the finishing touches Friday on a
bill that would increase agriculture subsidies a staggering 70% over the
next decade.</LD>
<LD>   It's a glaring reflection of the political geography of this year's
battle for control of Congress: Many of the most competitive races are
being waged in the Farm Belt, and the two major parties are in a bidding
war to woo those pivotal voters.</LD>
<TE>   The bill also is a tribute to the continuing political clout of the
farm lobby, even though less than 2% of Americans live on farms. And it
provides an object lesson in how hard it is to uproot government
entitlements and challenge established interests in Congress. The final
version backs away from a Senate-approved plan to revamp farm subsidies
by slapping a $275,000 cap on those payments and steering more money into
land conservation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The measure marks a retreat from a free-market initiative approved in
1996, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. The Freedom to
Farm Act promised to wean farmers of their dependence on government
subsidies and expose them to the risks and rewards of the free market.</TE>
<TE>   But ever since that law was enacted, the farm economy has struggled
and Congress has approved one bailout after another. The new bill
restores the kind of federal financial support that conservatives had
tried to shred.</TE>
<TE>   "The safety net that was taken away by Freedom to Farm has been
replaced," Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), head of the chamber's agriculture
committee, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>Farm Belt Problems Are Nonpartisan</TE>
<TE>   The result has broad implications for the 98% of Americans who don't
live on farms. Most obviously, a big increase in federal spending for
farm subsidies could drain resources for other programs, such as health
and education, especially at a time when the federal budget deficit is
burgeoning.</TE>
<TE>   As a political matter, farm policy decisions could prove key in what
happens to the Democrats' one-seat majority in the Senate. The bill is
laced with crucial provisions for incumbent Democrats facing tough
reelection fights in Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   And Republicans have Farm Belt worries of their own: A vulnerable GOP
senator is up for reelection in Arkansas. And to retain their narrow
House majority, the party is fighting to hold on to several seats in
pivotal rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate passed different versions of the bill months ago,
and a congressional conference committee struggled for weeks to resolve
differences between the bills.</TE>
<TE>   While some financial details remained to be worked out, negotiators
said Friday that the compromise measure would fit in a budget framework
that allotted about $171 billion over 10 years for farm programs.
Compared with current funding for the programs, that would be an increase
of $73.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the new money would boost subsidies for growers of
corn, wheat and other basic commodities. Negotiators dropped the Senate
proposal to cap subsidies at $275,000 a year per farm couple, an effort
to target the assistance to small and mid-size farms. The compromise sets
a $360,000 cap but includes a loophole to let some farmers get more.</TE>
<TE>   The bill provides $17 billion more for land conservation programs, an
increase of almost 80% over the 10 years. It also funds nutrition
programs and includes a provision backed by President Bush to restore
food stamp eligibility to legal immigrants who have been in the country
at least five years. Such immigrants were denied benefits under a 1996
welfare reform law.</TE>
<TE>   California cotton and rice growers stand to benefit from increased
commodity subsidies. The fruit and vegetable growers that dominate the
state's farm economy do not, because federal programs do not subsidize
such products. Other provisions in the bill important to the state
include increased funding for developing foreign markets for U.S.-grown
food and for agriculture research.</TE>
<TE>Political Soft Spot for Farm Families</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the Bush administration, Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman praised several elements of the compromise bill, including its
increased emphasis on conservation. But she withheld final judgment of
the bill until administration officials had more thoroughly reviewed its
contents--and especially its cost.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise is expected to clear the House and Senate in the next
week or so. Its passage will be a rare accomplishment in the closely
divided Congress. While other measures continue to falter, the farm bill
benefited from strong bipartisan support that stems from several factors,
especially in a hard-fought election year.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers are a vocal and engaged political constituency. They are well
versed on the programs that benefit them. And politicians tend to have a
sympathetic view of the family farm as a pillar of American values.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a sentimental value here that is quite substantial," said
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), who fought unsuccessfully to reform and
rein in the cost of the farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   The politics of farm policy tends to split on regional rather than
party lines. That made for some tough choices for Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who tried to juggle the competing interests of his
party's most vulnerable incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the subsidy cap was supported by Midwesterners such as
Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who is campaigning as a friend of the
family farmer, and Harkin. Both face tough reelection fights.</TE>
<TE>   But the cap was political poison for other vulnerable Democrats from
states where large agricultural interests tend to dominate, such as Jean
Carnahan of Missouri and Max Cleland of Georgia. They lobbied Daschle to
eliminate or water down the cap--the position that largely prevailed in
the final compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, that also was good news for the GOP's most vulnerable
incumbent from a rural state, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Harkin won an important prize: a $2-billion conservation program that
he wrote. Final action on the overall farm bill also is important to
Harkin because Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa, who is vying for the GOP Senate
nomination, has been criticizing him for the delays in moving the bill.</TE>
<TE>   New subsidies for peanut growers were a key issue for Cleland and his
leading GOP opponent, Rep. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. Both pushed for
the subsidies; their fight will be over who gets the most credit for the
aid.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home for Daschle were provisions that are of interest to his
home-state colleague, Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson, one of the GOP's
leading targets in November.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's priority was an amendment to help small livestock producers
by curbing ownership of the animals by meatpackers. The amendment was
dropped from the final bill. But Johnson's campaign is trying to turn
that loss to their advantage by blaming it on his GOP opponent, Rep. John
R. Thune, who supported the provision but was unable to include it in the
House version of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "If John Thune had done his job and gotten the provision in the House
bill, it would be law today," Johnson campaign spokesman Dan Pfeiffer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also kept an eye out for the interests of a senator who is not
up for reelection: Sen. James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent whose
defection from the GOP last year gave Democrats their Senate majority.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle fought for an expanded dairy program that is important to
Jeffords' dairy-dependent state. Jeffords spokesman Eric Smulson said the
senator was pleased: "Moo! Moo! Certainly we support it."</TE>

<HD>German Teen Kills 17, Self in Shooting Spree at School</HD>

<DL>ERFURT, Germany
</DL>
<LD>A 19-year-old angered by his expulsion burst into a secondary
school Friday carrying a pump-action shotgun and a revolver and shot to
death 15 adults and two students before killing himself.</LD>
<LD>   The attack evoked the nightmarish images of the Columbine High School
shootings in Colorado three years ago. Tearful parents ran toward the
Johann Gutenberg secondary school in search of their children, and
paramedics crouched along sidewalks and cobblestone streets to tend to
the wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The killing spree, at least the fourth homicidal attack at a German
school in less than three years, sent shock waves across a nation that
has long considered itself far less vulnerable to the violence that has
afflicted U.S. campuses.</LD>
<TE>   The shootings, which left 14 school employees, a policewoman, two
girls and the gunman dead and at least six wounded, also sparked public
soul-searching about what compels a distressed youth to turn violent and
what society might do to prevent such disturbing events.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said he and his fellow citizens were
"stunned and horrified" and urged Germans to examine the social as well
as political failures that might have contributed to the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are questions we have to answer here as a whole society," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Otto Schily termed it "a macabre coincidence" that
the shootings came on a day the government managed to push through a bill
in Parliament that would impose tighter controls on gun ownership and
harsher penalties for illegal possession.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow students described the gunman, whose identity was being
withheld Friday to protect his family's privacy, as upset by his
expulsion early this year and the refusal of school administrators to let
him take exams required for university entrance. But Isabell Hartung, who
described herself as an acquaintance, told the N-TV news channel by
telephone that she couldn't imagine he would react so violently.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a snap decision," she said. "I can't believe he could
have planned this act or thought about it for any length of time."</TE>
<TE>   However, some students at the school for fifth- through 12th-graders,
told reporters that the gunman had been threatening revenge over his
expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring guns, even amid stringent German licensing and controls, is
little problem, several young people here said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get them quite easily. Just go to any big city or, even
better, to the Czech Republic or Poland," said Stefan Burgmann, 18, who
attends a nearby school.</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, the masked gunman clad in black shot two
school employees in the building foyer and then prowled the corridors,
occasionally opening a classroom door and firing at the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Police who stormed the school after he barricaded himself in a
classroom described the scene as the most gruesome they had witnessed.
There was "blood everywhere, bodies in the hallways, in the classrooms,
in the bathrooms," Erfurt Police Chief Rainer Grube told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "The perpetrator was a former pupil at the school who had been
expelled. We can give no more details at the moment," Grube said.</TE>
<TE>   "He took his own life, apparently when he saw that there was no way
out for him," Grube said, quoting police commandos who stormed the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Some students who managed to escape the building after the first shots
were fired told police that they saw two gunmen. But authorities later
discounted the involvement of another person.</TE>
<TE>   The deadly drama began shortly after 11 a.m., when a janitor at the
school called police after hearing the first shots. After a 42-year-old
policewoman who was among the first officers at the scene was killed, the
commando unit was sent in to conduct a room-to-room search for the youth.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman is believed to have shot himself early in the search.
However, students and teachers on the upper floors--apparently fearful of
encountering him if they tried to leave--were trapped in their classrooms
for hours before police made their way though the massive five-story
building. The last 180 of nearly 700 in the building were evacuated six
hours after the shootout began.</TE>
<TE>   At one fourth-floor window, a clearly frightened young woman was
filmed by television cameras as she posted a piece of paper with the word
Hilfe--help in German--during the tense standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether this was a lone act or there were accomplices cannot be said
at this hour. I'm against making any kind of speculation," said Bernhard
Vogel, governor of Thuringia state, where Erfurt is the capital. "The
reality is that, after something so uniquely terrible, there are no quick
answers. What is clear is that in this hour of need, what is required is
solidarity. People must stand together and work through their outrage
over such a contemptible act."</TE>
<TE>   The gunman appeared to have singled out teachers in his rampage, but
the circumstances of the slaying of the two students were unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll matched that of the March 1996 killings in the Scottish
town of Dunblane, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed before
the perpetrator took his own life. In April 1999, 15 died at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., including the two teenage gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, police in Erfurt had removed the barricades that kept
onlookers and neighbors at a safe distance from the scene and residents
began bringing candles and flowers to place before the stately 1908
building. The school is named for the inventor of the printing press.</TE>
<TE>   At 9 p.m., church bells were rung throughout the city in memory of the
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Attention quickly turned to the survivors of a horror most German
youths know only from media accounts. Schroeder, in his comments to
reporters outside the Berlin chancellery, said his sympathies went out
not just to the victims' families but also to the police and teachers
"whose difficult work must go on and will certainly be harder because of
this."</TE>
<TE>   Schily urged Germans to reflect on the "alarming growth of aggressive
behavior" in schools and the underlying causes of the tragedy, especially
"how the virtual world might have influenced this event." He was
referring to Internet sites and video games that allow students to commit
simulated beatings, torture and killings.</TE>
<TE>   In Cologne, the head of the Society for Human Protection, which treats
victims of psychological trauma, warned that the images of the attack
will "torment the subconscious for months."</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest danger in the emotional aftermath is that children may
develop feelings of guilt," psychiatrist Christian Luedke told the German
Press Agency. "They might come to believe they bear some responsibility
for what the one who ran amok has done."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's attack occurred as legislators were debating a bill to
strengthen already strict laws on gun ownership. Although 10 million
weapons are registered in this country, authorities estimate that there
are twice as many illegal guns, most smuggled in from Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is not with legally obtained firearms but with illegal
weapons," Schily said. "It is an open question whether something like
this would have been preventable under the new law."</TE>
<TE>   Germans seeking to buy a hunting rifle must undergo extensive
background checks lasting up to a year. Collectors and target-shooting
enthusiasts must join a sports club to obtain a license for their
weapons. Handguns are largely prohibited except to members of the armed
forces and police.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed by Parliament after the legislators debated, unaware
of the school shooting, will require licensing of air pistols as well. It
also imposes stiffer penalties for those found to possess guns for which
they have no permits.</TE>
<TE>   At least three other homicidal acts have been committed in German
schools in recent years. In February, a 22-year-old man angry over being
laid off killed his trade-school principal and two former bosses in the
Munich suburb of Freising in Bavaria state. A March 2000 incident, also
in Bavaria, left a 16-year-old gunman in a coma after he killed a teacher
and then shot himself. In the eastern city of Meissen, a 15-year-old
student stabbed his teacher to death in November 1999 to collect on
fellow students' bets that he wouldn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   Erfurt, a university city of 200,000, was once home to theologian
Martin Luther, who lived here from 1501 to 1511.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Prison an Emblem of Shriveled Hope</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Camp that held Palestinians in the first intifada has
reopened, reviving a painful past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israelis knew it as Ketziot. Palestinians called it Ansar 3. Both
believed that the sprawling prison camp in the Negev desert was a painful
piece of their shared past that they had left behind forever.</LD>
<LD>   But in the midst of Operation Defensive Shield, Israel's massive
military sweep through the West Bank, the Israeli army announced that it
had reopened Ketziot, closed six years ago as Israel and the Palestinians
began implementing the 1993 Oslo peace accords.</LD>
<LD>   For many on both sides of this increasingly bloody and bitter
conflict, there is no more powerful symbol of the death of hope here than
the rebirth of Ketziot.</LD>
<TE>   Opened in 1988, Ketziot grew to be the single largest detention center
for Palestinians arrested during their first revolt against Israel's
military rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Thousands of Palestinians
were held in the camp's tents at any one time. Many of them were
academics, professionals, poets and political activists who were never
charged with crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Ketziot became the subject of countless Palestinian poems, novels,
plays and other writings. The camp's vast size, its remoteness and the
harsh conditions there made it a potent symbol for Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   They named it Ansar 3 after the prison camp that Israel opened during
its 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Nearly 10,000 Palestinian, Lebanese and
other prisoners were housed in the original Ansar, named for the Lebanese
village it was built near. Ansar 2 was a prison Israel established in the
Gaza Strip. But it was Ansar 3 that captured the imagination of
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "And Ansar will sing its intifada/To the intifada beyond/And the
horizon still faces them/And the songs of praise to the martyrs/Pouring
sunlight into the chest/And my heart, oh Ansar/My heart is not consoled,"
ends the poem "Exodus to Ansar 3," written by Al Mutawakil Taha, a
Palestinian poet who served 18 months in Ketziot in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Men on both sides who lived through Ketziot's first incarnation, and
who still remember the heroes' welcomes the last prisoners released from
the camp received when they were bused back to their communities in Gaza
and the West Bank, have expressed dismay that it is once again housing
Palestinian prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like we are on a roller coaster that is taking us back to
times we all wanted to leave behind and we don't have control over the
direction we're heading," said Ron Krumer, who in the 1980s served in the
Israeli military bureaucracy that ran civil affairs in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Ansar 3 was established to break Palestinian morale and to stop the
first intifada, and it was a failure," said Nabhan Khreisheh, a
Palestinian imprisoned in Ketziot for six months in 1988 on unspecified
charges. "Now they want to try again to break our morale, to punish
Palestinians who are politically active.</TE>
<TE>   "In reopening Ansar, they are saying to the Palestinians, 'Look where
your leadership has brought you.' But I do not think it will work this
time either," Khreisheh said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army denies that it had any political motivation for
reopening the prison. For the army, the move was purely practical. With
the collapse of the peace process and the outbreak of the current
intifada in September 2000, arrests of Palestinian militants surged.
Detention centers to house Palestinian prisoners were overcrowded even
before the latest military offensive.</TE>
<TE>   One week after Operation Defensive Shield began in late March, the
army started transferring Palestinian prisoners from Ofer prison, in the
West Bank, to Ketziot, about 30 miles southwest of the desert city of
Beersheba, not far from the border with Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4,000 Palestinians have been arrested since March 29,
according to an army spokesman. Of those, 1,700 were still being held at
the beginning of this week. Among the detainees are 385 Palestinians who
are being administratively detained--held without being charged--for six
months. The army says the number of administrative detainees is higher
than it has been since the first intifada, which lasted from 1987 until
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners began arriving at Ketziot on April 10. Human rights
organizations believe that about 300 Palestinians are now being held
there. Echoing complaints about the U.S. detention of Al Qaeda and Afghan
fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, several rights groups
have charged that the transfer of West Bank Palestinians to a prison
inside Israel violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits
holding prisoners in a country other than their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We have complained to the attorney general, and if we don't like his
answer to our complaints, we will go to the High Court of Justice," said
Hannah Friedman, executive director of the Israeli Public Committee
Against Torture in Israel. Friedman said prisoners complain that they do
not have enough blankets and that they are sleeping on thin pads on the
ground. Food, she said, is inadequate, and water is scarce.</TE>
<TE>   But an army spokesman dismissed reports of poor conditions at the
prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is being done according to international law," said Capt.
Jacob Dalal. The army refused a request from The Times to tour the camp.</TE>
<TE>   After his release from Ketziot in 1989, Taha, the Palestinian poet,
told an Israeli interviewer that many of his fellow prisoners had been
radicalized by their experiences in the camp. But he said he had come out
convinced that coexistence was the only option.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled an incident in which an Israeli contractor who had arrived
to build a fence in the camp happened to bring his children with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all small and cute," Taha said. "All of a sudden, all the
prisoners in Ward 5 came out of their tents and stood by the fence just
to watch the kids." The men, he said, saw in the faces of the Israeli
children the faces of their own children, from whom they had been
separated for months.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional encounter, Taha said, "was a moment of light for me. I
wrote a poem to the Israelis which says that we love your children and we
yearn for them to go hand in hand with our children to the springs of
peace and love."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview this week, Taha, who runs a poetry workshop
in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said he still believes that his vision
of coexistence is realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Until now, I believe it," he said. "But how can I persuade my child
to love the Israeli child when my children saw soldiers enter my
neighbor's house and destroy it?"</TE>

<PH>LEGACY OF THE RIOTS: 1992-2002</PH>
<KH>COLUMN ONE</KH>
<HD>We Can't All Get Along Yet</HD>
<DH>There are definite signs of progress in mending the black-Korean
divide exposed by burning shops, but tensions remain between the two very
different cultures.</DH>
<SE>One in a series about the 1992 riots.
</SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The progress in black-Korean relations since the 1992 riots is
measured by the friendship that Kapson Lee and Arlene Whitfield are
cultivating. It's measured by the fact that the Rev. Antony Beckham, a
black man, pastors a church of Koreans. It's measured by the way young
Koreans and blacks hobnob at a Chinatown hip-hop nightclub.</LD>
<LD>   The progress--or lack of it--is also measured by the way some young
black residents near a Korean-owned grocery store in South-Central Los
Angeles refuse to shop there: They are convinced the owner disrespects
them. He is scared, afraid one misspoken word will create an incident.</LD>
<LD>   The gulf between these two cultures was made all too evident by the
riots, when 2,200 Korean-owned businesses suffered about $400 million in
damage. As the rest of Los Angeles would learn during the aftermath, the
tension had been building.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Rodney King beating, a Korean American grocer,
whose store had been the target of gangs for months, fatally shot a black
girl after an altercation. The grocer was convicted of voluntary
manslaughter but was sentenced only to probation. Five months later, when
the riots broke out, Korean-owned businesses came under siege. One of the
riots' most indelible images was a picture of Korean men, armed with
rifles, standing on the roofs of their businesses, substituting for the
police who had retreated.</TE>
<TE>   Low-income blacks, as they had for years, complained that Korean
merchants in their neighborhoods treated them with contempt and
suspicion. The merchants complained that crime had hardened them. The
truth was, and remains, more complex. Language, culture and mutual
ignorance conspire against both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the riots, blacks and Koreans have organized countless
sensitivity sessions, prayer meetings and trips to Korea. The differences
from 1992, along with examples of a frustrating inertia, are subtle but
telling.</TE>
<TE>   Start with a market on South Main Street in a black-Latino
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   All day long, the customers come, children clutching coins for candy,
young mothers with toddlers in tow, middle-aged men buying a six-pack of
beer and cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "Papa, I owe you $26. I'll pay on Friday," a middle-aged African
American customer with slightly graying hair tells the Korean owner.</TE>
<TE>   "You always pay," the owner responds with a smile, as he puts his
customer's purchases inside a black plastic bag, handing it through an
opening in a bullet-proof partition.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, who asked that his name not be used, conducts most of his
business standing behind the transparent shield, topped by an iron grill.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be joyful," he says, "to have a thankful heart." But like
many of the two dozen Korean American store owners in South-Central a
Times reporter visited, he is drained. Most customers are easy to serve,
he says, but a few "troublemakers" haunt him. Two days ago, a 12- or
13-year-old boy wanted to buy cigarettes with food stamps, he says. "When
I wouldn't, he toppled the shelves. . . . When I went after him, he hit
me." He shows bruises on his lips and inside his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the market on another day, a black girl, 15-year-old Latasha
Johnson, is about to buy ice cream but says that on principle she will
not shop at this store. "Everybody here doesn't like that man and now we
leave him alone," she said of the owner. The problem, she says, is that
his fear of black customers leads him to behave insultingly.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why people threaten him, because of the way he treats them,"
Johnson says.</TE>
<TE>   In the four blocks north of the store, not one of the dozen or so
young people stopped at random--all but one black, the other Latino--had
a nice word to say about the owner. They complained of rudeness and
unfair suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   There is little tension here because those who feel uncomfortable
simply shop at another market run by a Latino couple a few blocks away.
And few of the owner's critics seemed to know he is Korean; they
frequently referred to him as everything but.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean that Chinese man? He is not nice," said another teenager. "I
haven't gone in there since I was in middle school."</TE>
<TE>Many Korean Shop Owners More Sensitive</TE>
<TE>   Many of the estimated 1,100 Korean American market owners in Los
Angeles County, staggered by the passion of the riots, have become more
sensitive about dealing with their customers, especially African
Americans. A Times reporter who has informally tracked this dynamic for
years found more outward gestures of respect and friendship. Some give
gifts to their customers at Christmas, attend funerals, contribute to
scholarships for black students or join block clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the influx of Latinos to South-Central and the departure
of tens of thousands of blacks to the Inland Empire and other outlying
suburbs has changed the demographic mix. South-Central was only 36.6%
black in 2000 compared to 48% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But deep down, the fundamental differences between Korean shopkeepers
and black customers make their encounters a precarious equation of mutual
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   The two cultures rarely live together. For example, in the 10 Los
Angeles County census tracts with the heaviest black populations, largely
in South-Central, Koreans make up an average of 6%. In the 10 tracts with
the heaviest Korean populations, largely in several Mid-City
neighborhoods, blacks make up an average of less than half a percent.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the Korean American shopkeepers' customers are poor and
have marginal education, 80% of the merchants are college graduates,
their economic advancement stymied by the language barrier. They come
from a hierarchal Confucian culture, in which sizing up people by their
age, education and social standing is second nature; egalitarianism is an
alien concept. From the African American point of view, the idea of a
neighborhood business that has no community commitment is just as alien.</TE>
<TE>   In Korean-owned store after store in South-Central, stress is written
on the faces of merchants. They're fearful of unintentionally insulting a
black customer. Koreans generally don't engage in small talk with people
they don't know well, while many blacks were raised in a gregarious
tradition in which full-blown conversations break out among strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "I do business here believing that all of our days are in God's
hands," said Sunae Lee, who with her husband owns Century Liquors at
Western Avenue and 39th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, an artist by training, says that after 17 years in the business,
her Korean sensibilities have dulled. The other day she shocked herself
when a smart-alecky customer asked for "an extra, extra wide condom." She
told him with a smile: "Use your sandwich bag." She could hardly believe
those words tumbled out of her Korean mouth, trained not to discuss sex
outside the home.</TE>
<TE>   She says she feels sympathy for the despair and violence some of her
customers live with. "Lately, I've been thinking," she says. "If I win
the Lotto, I'd like to send all those kids to college."</TE>
<TE>Leveling Class Barriers Two Friends at a Time</TE>
<TE>   The story of Kapson Lee and Arlene Whitfield, which is taking place in
the more comfortable setting of Park La Brea near the Fairfax district,
is an example of what happens when some class barriers are leveled.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who came to Los Angeles from Seoul three decades ago and has
spent most of that time working as an editor in Koreatown, yearned to
break out of her immigrant subculture. A moment during the second day of
the riots made her want to know an African American.</TE>
<TE>   She and her co-workers stood outside the old Korea Times building on
Vermont Avenue near 1st Street as thick black and red smoke belched out
of Korean-owned businesses. A young black man in a red sports car
approached them. Lee said he slowed, rolled down the passenger-side
window, clenched his fist and yelled toward the Koreans: "We're going to
kill you! We're going to kill you all!"</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield, a refined African American teacher from New York, had
taught music and English as a second language to many Korean students
during her 20 years on the East and West coasts.</TE>
<TE>   She had her own unpleasant encounters tucked away: In New York, a
Korean green grocer accused her of not paying for her purchases, when in
fact she had. The first time it happened, Whitfield explained to the
female proprietor that she was mistaken. The owner apologized. But when
the grocer accused her of not paying a second time, Whitfield stopped
patronizing the store.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Whitfield moved to Los Angeles and settled at Park La
Brea, which has a substantial Korean population. She kept running into
Lee, a woman with a soft voice and shy smile, inside the women's dressing
room at the pool where she swam almost every day.</TE>
<TE>   One morning, when Lee dropped the cap to her lotion, Whitfield quickly
picked it up and handed it to her.</TE>
<TE>   "That made an impression on me," recalled Lee. Salutations led to
swimming in the same lane to small talk afterward while dressing, and the
two women are becoming fast friends.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, they're learning about each others' roots.</TE>
<TE>   On one recent morning, as they lingered over oatmeal with raisins at
Dupars Restaurant in Farmers Market, Whitfield asked Lee about the
division of the Korean peninsula. She listened sympathetically as Lee
explained the role of the United States and Soviet Union in the partition
that has kept 11 million Koreans separated from their relatives for more
than half a century.</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield told Lee why African Americans sometimes resent new
immigrants, and Lee listened with compassion.</TE>
<TE>   "We [African Americans] have a wonderful history. We have helped build
this country," she said. Yet "any ethnic group can come into the country
and think of us as underdog."</TE>
<TE>   It is unacceptable that people who don't know history and the black
contribution to the building of America come here and start looking down
on African Americans, Whitfield said. "What we're saying is, 'Have more
compassion, and don't judge.' " Lee nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when Lee mispronounces such words as Jacuzzi--a
tongue-twister for many Koreans--Whitfield gently corrects her. She
listens patiently when Lee speaks slowly to gather her thoughts into
English, all the while maintaining eye contact.</TE>
<TE>   "I so appreciate that," Lee says.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when they're swimming in the same lane, they stop to give
one another a hug.</TE>
<TE>   Lee says her outgoing African American friend, much to her delight, is
helping her overcome some of her Korean inhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The friendship "was completely spontaneous," Whitfield said. Adds Lee:
"I can't think of anywhere else in the world where this could happen."</TE>
<TE>An Oasis of Diversity in a Nondescript Church</TE>
<TE>   Nor, most likely, could the Bethesda Church on the edge of
South-Central have evolved anywhere else in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The nondenominational church is housed in a two-story garment
warehouse building on Washington Boulevard near Central Avenue. It looks
like just another graffiti-scrawled structure in a desolate stretch.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sundays, the Rev. Antony Beckham--an African American who came
back to Los Angeles from the Midwest after the riots, determined to mend
the tensions in minority communities--ministers to his flock of 40,
virtually all of them Korean.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham, 45, is an integrationist--his wife, Wendy, is
fourth-generation Japanese American. He prefers to look for commonalities
between blacks and Koreans: high proportions of Christians, a heritage of
oppression and a tradition of matriarchy. "These are connecting points,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham grew up in a black neighborhood in Ohio and attended an
African American church. He was the only African American kid at his
Jewish elementary day school and then attended a Catholic high school.
After graduating, he attended Morehouse College, a historically black
college in Atlanta that is also the alma mater of Martin Luther King and
other notable black men.</TE>
<TE>   He came west and was a youth pastor in Pasadena from 1982 to 1988. He
moved back to Ohio and was living in Cincinnati, working in marketing at
United Parcel Service and teaching, when he watched Los Angeles burn in
1992--and decided he could be a healing force.</TE>
<TE>   He first worked at a Latino church in East L.A. Then in 1995 he was
invited to speak on spiritual formation to a Korean American gathering.
That led to an invitation to visit South Korea, where he met Korean
pastors and Christian publishing company executives who were interested
in establishing a multiethnic congregation at All Nations Church in Los
Angeles' Koreatown. The idea was to have one church with three languages:
Korean, English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   By early 1996, Beckham was hired to handle the English language
ministry at All Nations. In 1999 he started Bethesda with a handful of
first-generation Korean American families.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no blacks or Latinos have joined the congregation, but Beckham
is hopeful. "It's a matter of learning how to work the energy that is
there."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Kang, 42, who got acquainted with Beckham at All Nations, recently
began attending Bethesda even though he'd moved to Irvine. He said he
sought Beckham out early this year when he felt "heavy-hearted" with
burdens.</TE>
<TE>   "I see Pastor Tony as a doctor and we as nurses helping him heal"
hurting people, said another member of the congregation, Kasey Choi, a
social worker in her early 30s who used to be an atheist. "I feel such
joy when I'm here. I can hardly contain myself."</TE>
<TE>   Because of Beckham's rhythmical and vivid style, Bethseda feels like a
black church attended by Koreans as much as a Korean church pastored by a
black man. Beckham pantomimes Elijah lying down upon a dead child,
praying the boy back to life, and tells his listeners that in order to
resurrect dead parts of their lives--relationships with other people,
their relationship with God--they must grasp them with equal vigor and
faith.</TE>
<TE>   By black church standards, where services are highly interactive, it
is a tough crowd. No cries of "Amen!" punctuate the service to let the
minister know if his preaching is hitting home. Koreans consider such
interruptions disrespectful, so Beckham's voice rings alone from start to
finish.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they know each other well, pastor and flock. Beckham was leading
the congregation in Easter Sunday spirituals when he realized that
members were clapping with joy and abandon--but not to the beat.</TE>
<TE>   He shook his head and gently pointed out that there was an
unacceptable "diversity" of rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I need everybody to do this with me," he said, and started to
clap slowly. The congregation clapped too, and when everyone was marking
time correctly, he smiled: "See? It's really not that hard."</TE>
<TE>Experts Would Prefer to Look Beyond Race</TE>
<TE>   Experts from both groups are weary of the emphasis on race. They plead
for a more sophisticated analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't developed a manner to actually talk about and work through
problems of race, class and gender," says Brenda Stevenson, a black UCLA
history professor who has written an upcoming book on the case of Latasha
Harlins, the South-Central teenager fatally shot by a Korean grocer in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   Like the King beating, the Harlins killing was caught on videotape. It
shows the girl, 15, and the grocer, Soon Ja Du, arguing over a bottle of
orange juice that Du thinks the girl has stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Harlins, much taller and heftier than Du, hits her first, knocking the
Korean woman to the ground. Du struggles to get up. She fumbles for a
gun, aims at Harlins as she leaves and shoots her in the back.</TE>
<TE>   The pair became symbols of two peoples in conflict, symbols far more
crude than the nuanced differences that should have governed the ensuing
debate, Stevenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward T. Chang, a professor at UC Riverside who specializes in
African American and Korean relations, says the lack of more government
attention to improving the inner city's economy makes progress in race
relations impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put race relations on the back burner and buried it. Underlying
socioeconomic factors that ignited the riots haven't changed at all,"
said Chang, the author of two books on the riots and ethnicity. Korean
merchants "lost their faith in the American system."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the children of the riots may have an easier time.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles High School is three-quarters Latino, 14% black, 8% Asian.
Like high schools everywhere, students mostly hang out with their own
kind at lunch.</TE>
<TE>   But a contrasting dynamic operates in smaller group settings when
students work on shared projects.</TE>
<TE>   On the school's prize-winning academic decathlon team, two Koreans and
a black have become such close friends that they hope they will be able
to attend Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, together come September.</TE>
<TE>   On or off campus, Saladin Thomas, who is black, William Kim and Paul
Jung, both American-born Koreans, have some memory of the riots. Jung,
who was 8, went along with his mother to join the historic march of
30,000 Korean Americans to Ardmore Park. Kim was shaken by the looting of
his friend's parents' shop in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   They were too young to understand the meaning of the disturbances or
much-publicized frictions, and they say it has not colored them.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Kim said they don't have to talk to understand what the
other is thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they could be sitting far away from each other in the
classroom, but with the roll of their eyes or other facial expression,
they communicate.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we walk around mouthing things--just like stupid teenage
humor--we both know what it means," said Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at Paul or Will as Korean Americans," he added. "I see
them as Will and Paul."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Kim and Jung view Thomas as a gifted musician and teammate
whose company they enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "What might have happened in the past is past; you work with what you
have now," said Kim.</TE>
<TE>Pop Culture's Fusion Dissolves Differences</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop is purely a black invention, but young Korean Americans, who
must navigate the challenges of living on the margins of two cultures,
are claiming it too.</TE>
<TE>   Two Fridays a month, the usually staid Grand Star restaurant on
Broadway in Chinatown transforms into the Firecracker, a popular
underground hangout for the hip-hop crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Pop culture seems to exert no racial or ethnic boundaries. Hair
coloring, makeup and attire enhance this fusion of visual-aural culture
that blurs racial distinctions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an expression I associate with growing up in a low-income
household in Koreatown," says Robin Lee, UC Berkeley music major, and a
popular deejay for hip-hop groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Hip-hop and spoken word [performance] go across cultures," says Eddie
Kim, an aspiring "spoken word" artist who recently performed in Beverly
Hills with five blacks to an all-black audience.</TE>
<TE>   Asians, blacks, white and Latinos in their 20s and early 30s, in all
manner of attire, pack into the dark and cramped old two-story building,
where the atmosphere is lively, the music deafening and the drinks
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The Firecracker doesn't advertise, but word of mouth is enough to lure
people there.</TE>
<TE>   There is already a line when the doors open at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   A young Asian male checks IDs at the front door and collects a $10
entrance fee, while a young black man at the side door inspects stamped
hands of those who use that door to go in and out.</TE>
<TE>   With three musical venues, operating simultaneously, the Firecracker
gets cracking closer to midnight.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard, it's a mix of rap, punk, spoken word and other art
forms that deejays create by mixing--playing two identical songs backward
or in different beats, in effect creating a new music.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, it's jazz, provided by a three-man band of two blacks and
an Asian, playing even an old tune like "Pennies from Heaven"--seemingly
out of place here. It evokes another time, when Chinatown attracted a
different crowd, when young Asians had black hair, when restaurants and
shops remained open until midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, it's hip-hop, pulsating beats, raunchy lyrics and all.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Robin Lee, whose family's liquor store was next door to the
epicenter of the 1992 riots, about hip-hop's appeal for Korean Americans
and he tells you that in this world, hyphenated Americans do not exist.</TE>
<TE>   "Hip-hop," he says, "is an American thing."</TE>

<HD>Manson Follower to Get Hearing on Bid to Be Freed</HD>
<DH>Court: Leslie Van Houten hopes to convince a judge that she is
rehabilitated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>They were bone-chilling crimes, sensational murders that spread
fear through Los Angeles and turned their mastermind into a criminal
antihero familiar to the world.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Manson and four of his followers were convicted in the 1969
killings and have been in prison ever since. But now one of them has
persuaded a judge to hear her claim that she is rehabilitated and
deserves to be freed.</LD>
<LD>   San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Bob N. Krug has scheduled
the hearing for Leslie Van Houten next month and ordered her to appear in
court. The ruling has buoyed supporters who have long fought for Van
Houten's freedom and had thought her request might be denied outright.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad to see the court system seems to have the courage to look
beyond" the Manson label, said Van Houten's attorney, Christie Webb.
"She's an individual entitled to consideration outside of the mythology
that has grown up around this case."</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers for the state--along with relatives of the victims and Los
Angeles County prosecutors--continue to oppose Van Houten's parole. The
Manson crimes were so heinous, they say, that they warrant her continued
custody.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten was convicted of murder in the Aug. 10, 1969, stabbings of
Leno and Rosemary LaBianca at their Los Feliz home. The murders came a
day after other members of the Manson "family" killed pregnant actress
Sharon Tate and four friends at Tate's rented home in Benedict Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The murders--accented with messages scrawled on walls with the
victims' blood--captured national attention and ultimately made Manson, a
lifelong con who orchestrated the killings, California's most notorious
criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten, the youngest of Manson's followers, has long been viewed
as the least culpable of the group. A devoted band of supporters argue
that she was a misguided teenager when she joined Manson's commune, and
that she was brainwashed by him and on LSD the night of the murders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Van Houten's backers presented the parole board with 900
signatures urging her release. Three years later, she appeared on the
cusp of winning parole when the chairman of her hearing panel told her
she was "much closer than she might realize" to going home.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, she has been back to the parole board and
rejected seven more times, with the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office and relatives of the LaBiancas repeatedly opposing her
release.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten is now 52, with long graying hair. Recently, she embarked
on a route that has proven promising for other, less famous
prisoners--filing a legal challenge that claims the parole board has
unlawfully denied her freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In court documents, Van Houten's attorneys say she should be freed
because she has been declared no longer dangerous by a prison
psychiatrist, has displayed exemplary behavior during three decades of
incarceration and has met other requirements set by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The "one apparently insurmountable obstacle" blocking her parole, her
lawyers argue, is "that she was part of the Manson 'Family.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focus a "myopic concentration on the crime," the attorneys
urge, the parole board should consider, "Who is Leslie Van Houten today?"
She is, they contend, "completely rehabilitated, a shining example of the
best results possible in our correctional system."</TE>
<TE>   In opposing Van Houten's petition, the state attorney general argues
that the parole board fulfilled its legal obligation to give her case
"due consideration" before rejecting parole at her last hearing, in June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, the board concluded that Van Houten would pose "an
unreasonable risk of danger to society" if released and called her
offense "especially cruel and callous." Members added that Van Houten
"needs additional time to gain . . . further insight into her involvement
in this crime."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Deputy Atty. Gen. Heather Bushman said the board
weighed many factors in finding her unsuitable for parole but that the
decision rested mostly on "the gravity of the offense." In court papers,
Bushman also said the board's discretion over parole is "great, absolute
and almost unlimited."</TE>
<TE>   A former homecoming princess from Monrovia, Van Houten for years
declined to speak about her experiences as one of "Manson's girls." But
last year, criminologist Karlene Faith published a book based on private
letters from Van Houten, "The Long Prison Journey."</TE>
<TE>   That account says Van Houten met Manson when she was 19 and became
swept up in the bizarre cult he controlled through drug use,
manipulation, sexual abuse and isolation from the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   In the tumultuous days of the 1960s, Van Houten had left home to "seek
some enlightenment like so many other young people during that time,"
attorney Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   But Manson's group, which settled on the Spahn Movie Ranch above
Chatsworth, was a warped version of other communes preaching free love
and acceptance. The murderous rampage that took the life of Tate--a
rising movie star and the wife of director Roman Polanski--and four
others was apparently part of a bizarre plan to trigger a race war known
as Helter Skelter, a name taken from a Beatles song.</TE>
<TE>Three Trials for Role in LaBianca Killings</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten was not present at the Tate murders. But Manson did bring
her along the following night to the home of the LaBiancas, owners of a
grocery store chain, picked at random.</TE>
<TE>   While Charles (Tex) Watson stabbed Leno LaBianca, Van Houten and
Patricia Krenwinkel held Rosemary LaBianca in another room, placing a
pillowcase over her head. Watson then stabbed Rosemary LaBianca with a
bayonet, and gave Van Houten a knife and ordered her to "do something,"
court documents show. Van Houten testified that she stabbed the victim 14
to 16 times in the back, but believed she was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten went through three trials for her role in the LaBianca
killings. The first led to her conviction and a death sentence, but was
overturned on appeal because her lawyer disappeared before the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The second trial ended with a hung jury, and the third led to her
murder conviction and sentence of seven years to life with the
possibility of parole. She is housed at the California Institution for
Women in Chino.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's lawyers portray her record behind bars as that of a model
prisoner, noting that she has obtained a bachelor's degree, tutored other
inmates, made quilts for homeless women and served as a leader in
anti-drug programs and other self-help groups.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever her accomplishments, the judge's ruling on her petition is
more likely to turn on his interpretation of law and regulations
governing how the parole board decides whom to release.</TE>
<TE>   If Krug rules in Van Houten's favor, the parole board would hold
another hearing, evaluating her case under guidelines set by the court.</TE>
<TE>Manson Denied Parole for the 10th Time</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's lawyers say the board should follow language in the penal
code stating that it "shall" grant parole unless public safety demands a
more lengthy term. According to that logic, since Van Houten was judged
no longer dangerous by a prison psychiatrist, she should be freed
regardless of her past.</TE>
<TE>   But the attorney general says the gravity of the crime can overshadow
other factors suggesting someone is ready for release--so long as those
other factors are examined by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Manson, now 67, was denied parole for the 10th time Wednesday at
Corcoran State Prison. He declined his first chance in five years to
address the board, saying he did not want to be manacled for the
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials said Manson has accumulated numerous disciplinary
citations in recent years for offenses ranging from setting his mattress
on fire to spitting on guards.</TE>
<TE>   Also convicted in the slayings were Krenwinkel, Watson and Susan
Atkins. All were initially sentenced to death, but had their sentences
commuted to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole when the
state Supreme Court abolished the death penalty. They remain in prison.</TE>

<HD>Economic Rut in Argentina Grows Deeper</HD>
<DH>Crisis: The president's political foothold appears to be teetering
after he is forced to backtrack on his plan to rescue the financial
system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>The president threatened to resign, but his aides said later that
he wasn't serious. The economy minister, however, did resign, not long
after a group of angry bank depositors shut down Congress and torpedoed
his plan to rescue Argentina's ailing economy.</LD>
<LD>   Exhausted and out of cash because of a five-day banking freeze,
Argentines on Friday reached the end of what was perhaps the worst week
in this nation's economic and political crisis since days of rioting and
looting drove President Fernando de la Rua from power in December.</LD>
<LD>   Now it is new President Eduardo Duhalde who is teetering on the brink
after being forced to backtrack on key elements of his economic plan.</LD>
<TE>   To prevent the collapse of the nation's banking system and to secure
bailout funding from the International Monetary Fund, Duhalde had
pressured Congress to pass legislation that would have taken millions of
dollars in Argentines' deposits and converted them into 10-year
government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If Congress doesn't approve these measures, then they will have to
appoint another president," Duhalde said Monday. Congress elected Duhalde
president in January, the fourth successor to De la Rua.</TE>
<TE>   Congress rejected Duhalde's plan Tuesday--but he remains president.
Now the former governor of Buenos Aires province is facing increasing
questions about his ability to govern and keep the banking system
solvent.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a president who has a presidential sash, we have governors
and legislators, but there is no more political power in this country,"
said Cristina Kichner, a senator from Santa Cruz province. "Our society
is no longer willing to accept what their leaders order."</TE>
<TE>   Since taking power, Duhalde has faced a series of challenges as he
tries to lead Argentina out of a four-year recession. First, he has
wrestled with provincial governors and Congress to implement the economic
and legal reforms demanded by the IMF as a condition for further
loans--including sharp reductions in provincial budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Second, he has struggled to keep the nation's banking system alive as
untold numbers of Argentines withdraw their savings and use them to buy
dollars, which they keep in their homes, or spirit away to foreign bank
accounts. And he has labored in vain to protect the Argentine peso, which
is now worth about a third of its December value.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde had kept in place banking restrictions first implemented by De
la Rua last year that froze most savings accounts. But the Supreme Court
overturned those restrictions this year, allowing depositors to file suit
in local courts to free up their savings. Millions of pesos began to leak
out of the banking system every day.</TE>
<TE>   In an emergency decree April 19, the government announced that it
would shut down banks and foreign exchange houses this week. Argentines'
only access to their bank accounts was via ATMs, but most of those had
run out of cash by the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Sanchez, a 28-year-old gas station employee, found himself in
a predicament shared by many here: down to his last 20 pesos (about $7)
and unable to get his money out of the bank.</TE>
<TE>   "They say they refilled the automated tellers, but it isn't true," he
said. "I eat what I can get here [at the station] because there's nothing
left in my refrigerator."</TE>
<TE>   Silvana Oliver, a 56-year-old businesswoman, spent Monday and Tuesday
in the banking district, wandering from branch to branch in search of
cash for her business. All she found was bankers who gave her dirty
looks.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't deposit money, I can't transfer money, I can't pay salaries,
but I can't fire anyone either," Oliver said. "People only believe in the
dollar. Everything else is painted paper."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the week, the Buenos Aires daily Pagina 12 summed up the
impact of the banking freeze on the city's economy: "empty businesses,
movie theaters without audiences, bars that wait in vain for the regulars
to arrive . . . taxis without passengers and traffic in downtown Buenos
Aires as light as during the summer holidays."</TE>
<TE>   Congress, meanwhile, debated a measure that would allow the banks to
reopen--the legislation that would convert most savings into government
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, as debate on the proposed bill was scheduled, about
2,000 protesters surrounded Congress to prevent the legislators from
entering the building. The legislators quickly got the message: Once they
managed to get inside Congress on Tuesday afternoon, the
bonds-for-deposits plan was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat led Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov to resign--he had
spent months traveling between Washington and Buenos Aires to work out
the details of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   According to published reports here, the president then briefly
considered a "Plan B" backed by hard-liners in his Peronist
party--breaking with the IMF, defaulting on the rest of Argentina's
foreign debt and battening down the hatches against the wave of social
disorder that would surely follow the collapse of the nation's banking
system.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a game for cowards," one of Duhalde's advisors told the
daily La Nacion.</TE>
<TE>   But by Wednesday, Duhalde had once again promised that Argentina would
fulfill its "international obligations," including payment on its massive
foreign debt. On Thursday, Congress passed a measure that would allow
people to withdraw their savings--but only if an appeals court ruled in
the depositors' favor. That move was expected to slow down the flight of
money from the banking system, if only temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   And on Friday, after much hesitation, the government announced that
Roberto Lavagna--Argentina's ambassador to the European Union--was to
become the nation's new economy minister.</TE>
<TE>   Lavagna's first mission: to find a way to please the IMF, and a
restless populace worn down and demoralized by an economic crisis that
shows no signs of abating.</TE>

<HD>Singapore, Taiwan Clash on Jet Crash</HD>
<DH>Asia: Reports by airline and airport involved in the 2000 disaster
seem in ways mirror images.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>Investigators from Taiwan and Singapore issued different findings
Friday about what probably caused the crash of a Los Angeles-bound jumbo
jet in Taipei nearly 18 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council listed pilot error and poor weather
conditions as the main probable causes of the crash of the Singapore
Airlines 747-400 on Oct. 31, 2000, while Singapore's Transport Ministry
cited substandard airport equipment as a key factor in the disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The crash, which killed 83 people and injured more the 90, occurred
when the jet hit construction equipment as it tried to take off from a
closed runway shortly before midnight in poor visibility.</LD>
<TE>   In some ways, the reports appeared to be mirror images.</TE>
<TE>   The Taiwanese findings, for example, acknowledge that runway and
taxiway lighting at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport was less than
ideal on the night of the accident but do not list them among the
probable causes. Instead, they are labeled simply "risks."</TE>
<TE>   The report paints a picture of pilots ignoring crucial ground warnings
as the experienced crew became increasingly distracted by an oncoming
typhoon and rushed to take off before weather conditions deteriorated
further.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly some mistakes at the airport itself, but they
didn't lead to the crash," said Kay Yong, managing director of the
Aviation Safety Council. "The flight crew did not use all the resources
available to them."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the report released in Singapore later in the day
acknowledges that the pilots made mistakes but states that the primary
fault was "a failure of the aviation system, rather than a failure of a
person or people."</TE>
<TE>   "The Singapore team believes that the major deficiencies at [the
airport] played a critical role in the accident," the country's Ministry
of Transport concluded.</TE>
<TE>   It cited a litany of shortcomings, including broken taxiway lights,
insufficient taxiway center line striping, poorly located signs to guide
pilots to correct runways, and the absence of closure markings at the
head of the closed runway that the pilots mistakenly used as they
attempted to take off.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the discrepancies in the findings, Yong said of the
Singaporeans, "They are certainly entitled to present their point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   Whether negligence rested with the pilots, airport authorities or
both, it is clear from the transcript of the cockpit voice recording that
neither pilot had an inkling of danger until the plane slammed into
equipment parked partway down the closed runway, which was under
reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the two reports, each clearly emphasizing its own
government's interests, will almost certainly become fodder for lawyers
in lawsuits launched on behalf of victims and their survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the crash, Singapore Airlines offered $400,000 to the
families of each of those who died, but it is unclear how many have
accepted the sum.</TE>
<TE>   The plane's chief pilot and two first officers all survived the crash
and remain employed by the airline, but they have not flown since the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The crash marked the first major disaster in nearly three decades of
long-haul flying for Singapore Airlines, which has one of the youngest
fleets of aircraft in the industry. A 737 operated by a Singapore
Airlines subsidiary, SilkAir, crashed in 1997 after going into a nose
dive over Indonesia, killing all 104 people aboard.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Firm Must Pay War Laborers</HD>
<DH>Asia: In the first such ruling in the nation, Mitsui Mining is
ordered to give $85,000 to each of 15 Chinese forced to work for it in
WWII.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>A Japanese court ordered Mitsui Mining Co. on Friday to pay about
$85,000 to each of 15 Chinese forced to work for the company in Japan
during World War II, the first wartime-related judgment here against a
private firm.</LD>
<LD>   "This is unprecedented, a real step forward," said Masamichi Mori, an
attorney representing Chinese plaintiffs in another case. "Japan has
finally opened the door a crack toward accepting its responsibility."</LD>
<LD>   The 15 plaintiffs, who are in their 70s and 80s, demanded recognition
and money from the government and the company for forcing or duping them
into working in Japan in 1943 and 1944.</LD>
<TE>   Japanese legal experts said the decision should encourage plaintiffs
in dozens of other wartime compensation cases filed in Japan. Those
seeking recourse against Japanese companies in U.S. courts also are
likely to review the decision closely for any crossover impact.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese government estimates that about 40,000 people from
elsewhere in Asia were forced to work in wartime Japan's mines and
factories for little or no pay as the country sought to maintain its war
machine. Some observers say the real number is far higher.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately after Friday's decision was handed down in the city
of Fukuoka, Mitsui Mining spokesman Minoru Sasaki said the company had
filed an appeal and hopes to see the decision quickly reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely regrettable that our stance was not recognized," he
said. "We'll try and make our position clear before the appeal tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   Mitsui Mining shouldn't have to bear the financial responsibility, he
added. "Basically, it's a matter of government policy."</TE>
<TE>   The government, however, has so far denied responsibility for forcing
people from other Asian nations to work in dangerous wartime industries
or to serve as prostitutes for Imperial Army troops. It has argued that
any obligation it might have had was absolved under the 1951 San
Francisco Peace Treaty, which officially ended the war between the United
States and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, however, Japanese judges have chipped away at
the nation's official wall of denial. Even though the conservative
judiciary hasn't felt comfortable ruling against the government, it has
edged closer to blaming companies that collaborated closely with the
Imperial Army and compensating the suffering of individual Asian
plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   Another key step in this evolution occurred in late 2000 when
construction firm Kajima Corp. agreed to voluntarily set up a
$4.6-million fund for 986 Chinese forced laborers it used in Hanaoka
during the war, ending a five-year court battle.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting this delicate balancing act over how to ascribe blame, the
judge in Fukuoka on Friday rejected the plaintiffs' demand for state
compensation even as he referenced the close history of
corporate-government links.</TE>
<TE>   "The forced labor was planned and carried out jointly by Mitsui Mining
and the state," presiding Judge Motoaki Kimura said in handing down the
verdict, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cite several reasons for Japan's recent softening after
decades of denial and delay. "It's partly a timing issue," said Akira
Fujimoto, associate professor of law at Kwassui Women's College. "Most of
the plaintiffs are now really old and only have a little time left before
they die. In the next few years, we're going to see many more of these
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, the pride of the Japanese legal profession also is at
stake, some attorneys say. As the U.S., Switzerland and Germany have come
under growing pressure to admit and make amends for their wartime
legacies, the Japanese judiciary has become more concerned that it is
bucking the global trend.</TE>
<TE>   "They're worried about Japan being too out of step with the rest of
the world," attorney Mori said. "Thus, judges don't want to go against
the government outright, but they also feel great sympathy toward the
plaintiffs in their courtrooms."</TE>
<TE>   Japan also seems to be lumbering toward a rough compensation standard
for the thousands of Asians it exploited during the war years.</TE>
<TE>   In another watershed case last year, a court awarded the survivors of
the late Liu Lianren, a Chinese former slave laborer, more than $160,000
for his pain, suffering and repeated attempts to escape from wartime
labor on Japan's Hokkaido island. That amount represents a probable
ceiling, attorneys said, and Friday's $85,000 a probable floor. Most
future settlements, they predicted, will fall between the two.</TE>
<TE>   For some, however, the money is secondary.</TE>
<TE>   "All we really want is an apology from Japan, which rarely admits it's
wrong," said Cong Zhi Liang, a 29-year-old alternative medicine
practitioner living in Japan, speaking for Chinese living here. "That
said, this Fukuoka ruling is a step forward."</TE>

<HD>2 North Koreans Seek Asylum at U.S. Embassy in Beijing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Two North Korean defectors jumped the wall of the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing on Friday and appealed for asylum in South Korea, the first time
North Koreans have sought refuge inside the American compound, U.S.
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, described as brothers and laborers in their 20s, spent the
day holed up in the compound as U.S. and Chinese officials negotiated an
agreement allowing them to leave rather than be returned to North Korea.
A U.S. official in Seoul said the defectors left the embassy this morning
for Singapore and were expected to fly Sunday to South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   "They were accepted for resettlement," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said in Washington. "We appreciate the Chinese
government's constructive response."</LD>
<TE>   Another American official said it was the first time that North
Koreans had sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy but that it was not
unexpected given the recent surge in defections in the Chinese capital.
He requested anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The defections came on the eve of a visit to the United States by Hu
Jintao, China's vice president and the man expected to become president
when Jiang Zemin steps down next year.</TE>
<TE>   Hu is expected to arrive in Hawaii today and then fly to New York. On
Tuesday and Wednesday, he is scheduled to be in Washington, where he will
meet with President Bush and other top administration officials. He then
will spend two days in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, political activists said other defections are underway at
embassies in Beijing and elsewhere in Asia to bring attention to the
plight of North Korean refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a huge operation underway. It is all a bit secret, but I can
tell you that defectors are going to Cambodia, Vietnam, Mongolia," said
Norbert Vollertsen, a German physician and activist who has been helping
North Koreans defect. He said that Christian missionaries and refugee
advocates were providing logistical support and funds but that some of
the defectors were acting on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of North Koreans have sought refuge in European embassies here
in the last several weeks. The defections create a dilemma for China
because a treaty with its Communist ally stipulates that all North
Koreans who flee across the border will be returned.</TE>
<TE>   To save face, China has made the defectors leave for other countries,
from which many then fly to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In the most publicized incident, 25 North Koreans stormed into the
Spanish Embassy last month and asked for asylum. The next day, they were
flown to the Philippines and on to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a North Korean managed to get inside the German Embassy,
where he asked for asylum and help in getting to South Korea. One report
said he hopped the wall. Philippine officials said today that they had
agreed to allow him to pass through Manila on his way to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, thousands of North Koreans have sneaked across the
Chinese border to escape political repression, famine and economic
devastation. Hundreds of thousands are believed to be living in China.
Some have been caught and sent back to North Korea and have reportedly
ended up in labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese are still taking a tough line with [those] they catch,
but if [the defectors] get into embassies, they tend to let them go," a
senior U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   After the defections to the U.S. Embassy, China's public security
bureau tightened measures at the mission. The compound includes the
residence of Ambassador Clark Randt and a building housing cultural
attaches and other officials.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Are Urged to Embrace Austerity as Price of Conflict</HD>
<DH>Mideast: 'Wars cost money,' says finance minister, who calls for
less spending and higher taxes. Cabinet will take up proposals Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Although the complete human toll is still unknown, the latest
Middle East crisis looks set to hit Israelis squarely in their
pocketbooks.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-month-old conflict, which has already devastated the much
smaller Palestinian economy, is now propelling Israel toward financial
instability, the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said this week
as it introduced a package of emergency austerity measures.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials have blamed the nation's economic ills, including a
budget deficit of about $2.7 billion, primarily on the latest violence,
but other analysts say the conflict is only partly to blame. Several say
the government's budget, passed two months late in February, was bloated
from the start.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "wars cost money and a lot of it," Finance Minister
Silvan Shalom said as he urged Israelis to tighten their belts and
support the government's proposals for spending cuts, tax hikes and
salary freezes. Speaking with Israel Radio, Shalom said the nation needs
to embark on an economic "Defensive Shield" program, akin to the army's
just-completed West Bank offensive of the same name.</TE>
<TE>   The finance minister said the months-long conflict with the
Palestinians is exacting a price well beyond the cost of the army's
military operations and is hurting foreign investment, tourism and many
other sectors of Israel's economy. The government, he said, expects
"everyone to understand the importance of this hour and chip in."</TE>
<TE>Plans Add to Worries of Many</TE>
<TE>   Yet at Jerusalem's popular Caffit restaurant, co-owner Irit Altaratz
said the proposals only increased her worries about Israel's
deteriorating economic and security situation.</TE>
<TE>   Since a recent failed suicide bombing at her restaurant, Altaratz
said, she has been forced to take a number of expensive precautions, from
hiring a full-time security guard to installing window bars, surveillance
cameras and shatterproof glass.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, she and other local restaurant owners decided to charge
each customer an extra shekel, about 20 cents, to help offset the
measures. And with few Israelis dining out these days, the government's
proposals, which include a reduction in insurance benefits to employers,
will make a tough business climate even tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "As a business owner and a private citizen, it's really very
worrying," Altaratz said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic plan is expected to be taken up by the Israeli Cabinet on
Sunday. If approved, it will be sent to parliament. But anxiety over the
proposals already has sent the Israeli currency plummeting to new lows
against the dollar and has prompted widespread criticism from business
and labor leaders, as well as politicians both within and outside the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Many said the program is unlikely to pass, at least in its current
form. A poll in Thursday's Yediot Aharonot newspaper showed that 58% of
the public opposed it, as did a majority of lawmakers, including
prominent members of Sharon's own Likud Party.</TE>
<TE>Incursion Has Cost Hundreds of Millions</TE>
<TE>   But a few Israelis said the government had little choice but to make
the recommendations, given the size of the deficit, the ongoing recession
and the likelihood of continuing conflict with the Palestinians. In the
last month alone, since it launched the West Bank offensive after a wave
of devastating suicide bombings in Israel, the army has spent more than
$200 million in incursion-related costs, an army spokeswoman said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Eitan Robbe, the Finance Ministry's customs director, defended the
plan as fair, saying it divided the new tax burden and spending cuts
proportionately among various groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very difficult plan, but it is very fair," Robbe told Israel
Radio.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's most sweeping--and controversial--elements include calls
for an across-the-board wage freeze in both the public and private
sectors, cuts in unemployment and government child support payments, and
budget reductions of 4% for all government ministries. Salaries for
Cabinet ministers and legislators would be cut 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Peretz, who heads the giant Histadrut labor federation, said the
proposals amounted to a "declaration of war" on Israel's workers. Peretz,
who also leads a small political party that left the government in
February, threatened a general strike if the austerity program,
particularly the public-sector wage freeze, is approved.</TE>
<TE>   Histadrut spokesman Avinoam Magen said the federation could not
support measures that he said would hurt Israel's poor and working
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We also cannot agree that the same lower middle class that fights now
on the front lines will also be those getting hurt on the home front,"
Magen said.</TE>
<TE>   Other constituencies that could be hurt by some of the proposals,
including Israel's Arab citizens and ultra-Orthodox Jews, have also
protested. The two groups, whose members often have large families and
are less likely than other Israelis to serve in the military, would be
most affected by plans to reduce the national child allowance. (The
government proposed smaller reductions for families in which one or both
parents have served in the military.)</TE>
<TE>   Jafar Farah, director of the Mossawa Center, an advocacy group for
Israeli Arabs, called the government's proposals both shortsighted and
racist.</TE>
<TE>   "This would only produce more and more anger and extremism" among
Israel's Arabs, Farah said. "Is that what this government wants from the
Arab minority?"</TE>
<TE>   Several Cabinet ministers, including Education Minister Limor Livnat
and Transportation Minister Ephraim Sneh, criticized the proposals for
cutting too deeply into their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders also announced their opposition to much of the plan,
saying the proposed tax hikes would increase unemployment, slow the
weakened economy still further and drive off remaining foreign
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Shostak, managing director of the Federation of Israeli
Chambers of Commerce, applauded Shalom's plan to cut spending but said
the federation strongly opposes any tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli market already has huge taxes," Shostak said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for new taxes on capital gains from stock sales and on
interest earned on savings accounts. Two relatively minor tax increases,
on cigarettes and gasoline and diesel fuel, took effect this week but
without any significant immediate controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Ministry officials said it is imperative that the plan be
passed as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot afford to have any more delays," said Ohad Marani, the
ministry's director general. "We need to adjust the budget right now or
face a much bigger budget deficit."</TE>

<HD>U.N. Delays Fact-Finding Mission to West Bank Camp</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In a reversal, Annan agrees to one-day postponement so
Israeli Cabinet can discuss the matter when it convenes after the Jewish
Sabbath.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Israel and the United Nations averted a confrontation Friday as
Secretary-General Kofi Annan agreed to delay a fact-finding mission to
the West Bank until after the Israeli Cabinet meets Sunday to discuss the
inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   Senior U.N. officials had said early Friday that the mission would
depart as planned to the region today, despite an Israeli demand that the
world body postpone the inquiry, ordered by the Security Council, into
Israel's recent three-week occupation of the Jenin refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   But after two days of what they termed "cordial and constructive"
talks with Israeli representatives here, U.N. officials agreed to put the
mission on hold another day, until after the Jewish Sabbath, when the
Cabinet will reconvene.</LD>
<TE>   Access to the camp requires Israeli cooperation, U.N. officials
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   After the talks, Annan's top aides told Security Council members that
it appeared the dispute was largely resolved--sentiments also expressed
privately by some Israeli officials here, diplomats said, despite the
seemingly unyielding stance of their government.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. fact-finding team's personnel and investigation priorities
"cannot be reconciled with the mandate in the Security Council
resolution," Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office declared in a
statement in Jerusalem earlier Friday. "For the purpose of these
clarifications, Israel requests that the arrival of the commission be
delayed."</TE>
<TE>   Israel wanted military experts added to the mission's leadership
troika. The three people named Monday by Annan are a former Finnish
president, a past chief of the International Committee of the Red Cross
and a former chief of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. Israel fears
that they will concentrate on investigating human rights abuses to the
exclusion of considering Israeli security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. officials said that although Annan had agreed to name
additional military advisors to the team, he would not add or remove
mission leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli delegation "has been ordered to insist on the points," the
early statement from Sharon's office said. But Israel failed to secure
U.S. backing for its position, Western diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell discussed the impasse with Sharon
by phone Friday and reiterated the Bush administration's position that it
was up to Annan to select and supervise investigative team members, U.S.
diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those urging Powell to call Sharon, diplomatic sources said,
were members of the Israeli delegation here. Israeli diplomats were
anxious to avoid a confrontation with the Security Council, which, with
U.S. support and Israeli Foreign Ministry approval, authorized Annan to
dispatch the team a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Those decisions are to be made by the secretary-general," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters in Washington after
Powell's call. "We look forward to Israel and the United Nations working
this out as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials continued to express concerns about the mandate of
the fact-finding team.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that what happened is interpreted in a just and
accurate way," Danny Ayalon, Sharon's foreign policy advisor, said in
Jerusalem late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli diplomats and defense officials meeting here also were
seeking assurances that statements to U.N. investigators would not be
admissible in any war crimes trials. Israel is less concerned about a
possible inquiry at the U.N., where it would enjoy some U.S. protection,
than prosecution in another nation.</TE>
<TE>   Kieran Prendergast, the U.N. undersecretary-general for political
affairs, pledged to the Israelis that there would be "no legal
ramifications" for anyone cooperating with the inquiry, Western diplomats
here said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Israel wants the investigation to be confined to events
in the Jenin camp and to include its use as a base for Palestinian
suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have claimed that hundreds of civilians were killed
during Israel's battle for control of the camp, the scene of the fiercest
fighting during the army's recent West Bank offensive. Israel denies
that, saying that almost all those killed were armed militia members.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli forces reentered the West Bank city of Kalkilya and
nearby villages Friday, defying fresh calls by President Bush for Israel
to complete its withdrawal from Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   Kalkilya Hospital director Arwa Shanti said tanks and troops entered
the city about 3 a.m., searching house to house and engaging in
firefights with Palestinian gunmen before withdrawing late in the day.</TE>
<TE>   One man, identified by Israel as the local leader of a radical
Palestinian faction, was killed in the raid, the most extensive incursion
into Palestinian territory since the army ended its large-scale offensive
early this week. Sixteen others were arrested, an army spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bush's statements, repeated Friday, that Israel quit the
Palestinian areas, Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said
such operations would continue whenever the army had information about
the location of suspected militants.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, meanwhile, negotiations continued over the fate of more
than 140 Palestinians and 80 priests, monks and nuns who have been
trapped inside the Church of the Nativity for more than three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials gave permission to Salah Tamari, the Palestinians'
lead negotiator, to travel to Ramallah today to meet with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and review the tense situation at the
site traditionally held to be Jesus' birthplace.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says that 20 to 30 Palestinians in the church are terrorists
and insists they be tried in Israeli courts or sent into exile. The
Palestinians have said the men should be sent to the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Four unarmed Palestinian men, including one police officer, left the
site Friday and were being questioned, according to military sources.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Israeli snipers fired on two Palestinians who were
spotted with guns inside the church compound. The Palestinians, who did
not fire their weapons, were wounded and later evacuated. They were being
treated at an Israeli hospital, military sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli snipers have been under standing orders to shoot at anyone
seen carrying a weapon at the church, a compound of several churches and
monasteries shared by different Christian denominations. The Israeli army
"fired direct and accurate fire and wounded them both," a military source
said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Says America Won't Let Israel Be 'Crushed'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>One day after Saudi Arabia's crown prince prodded President Bush to
do more to restrain the Israeli military, the American leader Friday
stressed his commitment to the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not allow Israel to be crushed," Bush said.</LD>
<LD>   But even as he emphasized his intention to stand by the longtime U.S.
ally, he repeated his demand that Israel withdraw its troops from
Palestinian territory it has occupied during its recent incursion into
the West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been some progress, but it's now time to quit it
altogether," he said. "It's time to end this."</TE>
<TE>   And White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the Saudis had
presented an eight-point plan for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, some of which the United States has long accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Early this month, Bush demanded that Israel withdraw "without delay."
That did not occur. Israel eventually pulled its forces back from some
sites, including the city of Nablus and the refugee camp in Jenin. But
new maneuvers have been reported, and sieges continue at Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah and the
Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's remarks Friday reflected a delicate balancing act in dealing
with a Middle East crisis he originally sought to stay out of. While Arab
countries have called for his administration to get tougher with the
Israelis, some Democrats and conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill
have pressed for stronger declarations of U.S. support for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the White House persuaded House Republican leaders to put
aside plans for a vote next week on a resolution expressing U.S.
solidarity with Israel and sharply criticizing Arafat as fomenting
violence against Israeli civilians. The resolution also endorses an
unspecified amount of additional U.S. aid for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke briefly Friday with reporters at his ranch, where he had
conferred with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah for several hours the day
before. Bush said he and the prince, who has been Saudi Arabia's de facto
leader since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, "had a good discussion
about the obligations of the Arab nations" in ending the deadly conflict
between the Palestinians and the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting, the Saudi delegation presented a paper listing
eight points for resolving the crisis, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis called for:</TE>
<TE>   * Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory.</TE>
<TE>   * An end to the Ramallah siege.</TE>
<TE>   * Creation of a multinational peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   * Reconstruction of Palestinian areas that have recently been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   * A renunciation of violence.</TE>
<TE>   * Renewed efforts to bring both sides into longer-range political
talks.</TE>
<TE>   * An end to Israeli settlement activity in occupied territory.</TE>
<TE>   * A new emphasis on implementing U.N. Resolution 242, a key Middle
East measure.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his Friday comments, sought to emphasize the efforts he had
made with Abdullah to defend Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the crown prince that we've got a unique relationship with
Israel," he said, adding that the U.S. defense of Israel is "one thing
the world can count on."</TE>
<TE>   "That's an important statement to make," he said. "It's a part of our
foreign policy, it has been a part of our foreign policy, it will
continue to be a part of our foreign policy--the Saudis understand that."</TE>
<TE>   The ranch meeting reflected a new readiness by Saudi Arabia to join
the U.S. effort to broker an end to the standoffs in Ramallah and
Bethlehem and to renew the long-term peace process, U.S. officials said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah injected himself into the peace process last month, offering
Israel full recognition by Arab nations in exchange for withdrawal from
territories it occupied during the 1967 Middle East War. The Saudis
promoted the plan at a meeting of Arab leaders in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah and his delegation are remaining in the U.S. for several days
while Saudi and U.S. officials continue to exchange ideas on ending the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis are particularly concerned about finding a nonviolent
solution to the standoffs in Ramallah and Bethlehem and to Arafat's
confinement.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, lawmakers generally have supported Bush as he moves
more aggressively into Middle East diplomacy, but increasingly they are
weighing in with their own views.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, House Republican leaders scheduled a vote, to take place
Tuesday, on the pro-Israel resolution sponsored by Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas). They did so despite warnings by Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell that the measure could complicate efforts to reach out to
moderate Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution appeared likely to win wide support. But the vote was
postponed after the White House intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are also pressing Bush to speak out against anti-Semitism in
European and Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   A letter signed by 99 senators and made public Friday urged the
president "to make every effort possible to raise, at the highest level,
our concerns about anti-Semitic acts in Europe and anti-Semitic
portrayals in the Arab media."</TE>
<TE>   The only senator who did not sign the letter was Jesse Helms (R-N.
C.), who this week underwent heart surgery.</TE>

<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>After a lull of nearly two weeks, Hezbollah guerrillas attacked
Israeli positions in a disputed enclave on Lebanon's southern border
Friday, wounding three Israeli soldiers and triggering Israeli
retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   The guerrillas fired rockets and machine guns at Israeli hilltop posts
in the Shabaa Farms area, Lebanese security officials said on condition
of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   They said Israeli artillery gunners shelled suspected guerrilla
hide-outs on the outskirts of the villages of Kfar Chouba and Halta,
about a mile from Shabaa Farms.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement issued in Beirut, Hezbollah said its guerrillas scored
"direct hits" in the afternoon attack. In Jerusalem, the Israeli army
confirmed the attack, saying three soldiers suffered light to moderate
wounds and a fourth was "lightly injured due to smoke inhalation."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange broke a calm that had prevailed on the border since April
13. There were almost daily shootouts across the frontier after the start
of Israel's military offensive in the West Bank on March 29, but they
ceased after visits to Lebanon and Syria by the foreign minister of Iran,
Kamal Kharrazi, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Israel captured the Shabaa Farms area when its forces swept across
Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East War, and it left troops
there when it withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A Lebanese military court has sentenced to death in absentia three
former militiamen convicted of collaborating with Israel during its
occupation of southern Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Hassan Sheeth, Robin Abboud and Habib Awada received the death penalty
for serving in Israel's proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, the court
announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The now-defunct militia helped Israel patrol the southern Lebanese
border zone during its 18-year occupation, which ended in May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The three men are believed to be among the hundreds of SLA officers
who fled with their families to Israel and other countries after Israel
pulled out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Eight other men were convicted on the same charges. Three of them were
sentenced in absentia to life in prison, and five others, who were
present, to prison terms ranging from two months to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Since June 2000, the military court, whose verdicts cannot be
appealed, has sentenced more than 3,000 people to prison terms of up to
25 years for collaboration with Israel. During the same time, about 70
former militiamen have been sentenced to death in absentia for killing or
conspiring to kill Lebanese guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Since the militia collapsed, more than 2,200 former fighters have
surrendered or been captured.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a Lebanese man who served a nine-year prison sentence in
Israel for cooperating with anti-Israeli guerrillas was released.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud Hamad Hammoud, a former employee at the Italian Embassy in
Beirut, was arrested by SLA militiamen in 1993 and convicted by an
Israeli court of cooperating with Hezbollah guerrillas.</TE>

<HD>Tape Said to Show Body of Chechen Rebel Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian state security service made public Friday a videotape
of a corpse to back up its assertions that a prominent Islamic guerrilla
leader had been killed last month in Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   The tape, shown by the state-controlled ORT and RTR networks, showed
the body of a long-haired, bushy-bearded, Arab-looking man closely
resembling previously published photographs of Khattab, the
Jordanian-born guerrilla leader. The body was shown lying on the ground
outdoors and, later, in a dimly lit interior, accompanied and being
prayed over by comrades.</LD>
<LD>   The corpse was dressed in camouflage trousers and a black T-shirt. A
black ski cap was on its head and a white ribbon under its chin to close
its jaw. There were no obvious wounds on the body.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks like it is truly Khattab," said Anatoly S. Kulikov, a former
Russian interior minister who dealt with the Chechen commander in the
mid-1990s after the first separatist war in Chechnya. He said on the NTV
network that the corpse appeared to have a maimed hand, like that of
Khattab, who goes by one name.</TE>
<TE>   "I am convinced of this more than I doubt it," Kulikov said.</TE>
<TE>   Khattab was considered one of the three top Chechen guerrilla leaders
and allegedly was the link between the rebels and the terrorist network
of Osama bin Laden. His apparent death was being hailed in Moscow as a
major victory for Russia in its current war against Chechen separatists,
which began in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Two other well-known Chechen leaders, Shamil Basayev and former
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, remain at large, but Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin has vowed to bring all Chechen "bandits" to justice.</TE>
<TE>   The tape that was broadcast Friday appeared to have been made by the
dead man's comrades. There was no immediate explanation for how it came
into the possession of the Federal Security Service, the main successor
agency to the KGB. And it is not clear that the Russian authorities know
the location now of the body.</TE>
<TE>   According to RTR, Khattab was killed March 19 or 20 in an operation by
special forces that had been a year in the planning. The station said he
had not died in battle, but it offered no further explanation.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Putin said he needed more evidence before he would
conclude that Khattab was dead. Other observers also raised questions
about reports of the guerrilla leader's death. The Russian president made
no immediate comment Friday after the broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Various military commanders, however, voiced elation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the beginning," said Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of
the Russian troops in the North Caucasus. "No matter how long it takes
us, such odious figures as Khattab, Basayev, Maskhadov . . . and the like
will be destroyed unless they decide to surrender themselves."</TE>

<HD>A Long War Lies Ahead, Rumsfeld Tells Troops</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
</DL>
<LD>In a pep talk Friday to U.S. troops in this Central Asian outpost,
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged them to prepare for a long war
against the "evil of mass murderers"--and not only in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "To the extent that they have safe havens, sanctuaries where they can
go, then the effort we've put into Afghanistan will be for nothing," he
told about 400 troops assembled under a tent.</LD>
<LD>   "You stand against an evil--an evil of mass murderers," he said to
rousing cheers. "It's an evil that can't be appeased, it can't be
ignored, and it certainly cannot be allowed to prevail."</LD>
<TE>   About 1,000 U.S. troops are based in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, for
fighter, cargo and air refueling missions over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's four-nation Central Asian tour is taking him next to
Afghanistan for meetings with interim government officials and visits to
U.S. and allied troops.</TE>
<TE>   Citing security concerns, officials barred reporters accompanying
Rumsfeld from disclosing in advance which parts of Afghanistan he would
visit.</TE>
<TE>   In a question-and-answer session with U.S. and allied troops, one
airman asked, "When we get our hands on Mr. Bin Laden, are we going to
negotiate with him or annihilate him?"</TE>
<TE>   Grinning amid hoots and hollers from his audience, Rumsfeld replied,
"In truth, it's kind of his choice."</TE>
<TE>   "We're hunting him down," he said. "We're tracking him down. He's
hiding. We haven't heard hide nor hair of him for about, oh, since
December, in terms of anything hard." Rumsfeld said that even with Bin
Laden still at large, "he is probably not very effective now in running
the Al Qaeda organization."</TE>

<HD>Koizumi Defends His First Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi marked one year in office
Friday with a spirited defense of his record, telling a skeptical nation
that his policies are fixing the economy after more than a decade of
stagnation.</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi became prime minister after winning widespread public support
by vowing to do away with politics as usual and revive the world's
second-largest economy. For months he was seen as a refreshing force, and
his public approval ratings exceeded 70% in media polls.</LD>
<LD>   But those ratings have recently fallen below 50% in some surveys,
driven down by bickering among Cabinet ministers and a spate of
corruption scandals that led to the resignations of two high-profile
lawmakers from Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</LD>
<TE>   In a nationally televised news conference Friday, Koizumi punctuated
his claim that reforms are working with a piece of good news announced by
the government earlier in the day: Unemployment was down to 5.2% in
March, its third straight decline and the lowest figure in seven months.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year unemployment hit 5.5%, and some said it would rise to 10%,"
Koizumi said. The 5.5% figure, recorded in December, was the highest
since the government began keeping track in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi mocked critics who have repeatedly forecast economic collapse
for Japan during his tenure. He also said he has tamed opposition within
his party to his reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "I've carried out reforms in one year that until now couldn't have
been accepted by the LDP," he said, citing the Cabinet's approval Friday
of three bills that would privatize the country's postal system, long one
of his pet projects.</TE>

<HD>Big HIV Problem Hits Small S.D. College Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A South Dakota college basketball player who tested positive for
HIV was arrested this week in a case that has led health officials to two
other new infections and what they are calling "a web of sexual contacts"
that numbers in the hundreds.</LD>
<LD>   The cases--and the great number of people believed exposed--have
rocked a state that last year reported only 22 new HIV cases.</LD>
<LD>   Nikko Briteramos, an 18-year-old freshman at tiny SiTanka Huron
University, was charged Tuesday with knowingly having unprotected sex
since learning of his HIV status last month. His infection was detected
through routine surveillance when he gave blood during a school drive.</LD>
<TE>   "After that individual knew that he was HIV positive . . . he was
discovered having unprotected sex with a partner who did not know," Gov.
William Janklow said Friday at a news conference. "That, my friends, is
no different from pointing a gun at someone and pulling the trigger."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 center arrived in Huron in August from Chicago. Already,
two individuals known to have had contact with him have tested positive
for the virus. Scores more who tested negative initially have been told
they must be retested over the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos is the first person to be charged under a two-year-old
state law that makes it a felony to intentionally expose someone to HIV.
He was charged with five felony counts, which prosecutors said are
related to a single partner. If convicted, he faces up to 75 years in
prison and $75,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the positive test result in late March, public health
officials interviewed Briteramos and began contacting the list of recent
sexual contacts he provided them.</TE>
<TE>   Janklow said Friday that one woman provided names of 70 people who
need to be informed of the problem. The numbers involved have shocked
people in Huron, where the 100-year-old school is a major employer. The
tribal university has an enrollment of about 600 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what's really surprising people are the numbers," said John
Deniger, who owns an auto dealership and sits on the university's
foundation board. "One individual supposedly had 70 contacts. I don't
think it's normal for anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Deniger said the community of 13,000 has pulled together in recent
days, with educational meetings at the high school as well as on the
university campus.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials said the cases have been "eye-opening" for
people in a state where there has been little fear of contracting
HIV/AIDS. "Now we are getting a lot of people off the street who have
heard the risk factors and are scared and want to be tested," said state
Secretary of Health Doneen Hollingsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Hollingsworth said the state this year has reports of nine new HIV
infections, making this cluster in one location particularly alarming.
She said it will be months before they know how many infections can be
traced to Briteramos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, public health officials have had to contact other state
health departments for help in tracking down individuals who had contact
with any of the three new cases. Hollingsworth said that, while officials
believe most of the people were exposed through sex, they cannot rule out
shared needles during drug use.</TE>
<TE>   South Dakota has consistently ranked second lowest in HIV infection
rates. Janklow said Friday that the episode has been sobering for
residents in a state known for wide-open spaces and quiet living.</TE>

<HD>New Director for Livermore Is Put on Hold</HD>
<DH>Search: Questions are raised because UC's choice headed Wen Ho
Lee's division at the Los Alamos laboratory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The University of California abruptly canceled plans Friday to name
a new director for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory amid questions
about his role in supervising Wen Ho Lee, once suspected of spying for
China at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   University regents had scheduled a vote to confirm Ray Juzaitis, a
senior administrator at Los Alamos. But sources said the vote was delayed
after questions were raised by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, who must
be consulted on the selection.</LD>
<LD>   The job is one of the most sensitive in the national security
bureaucracy. Livermore, near San Francisco, and Los Alamos, in New
Mexico, are among the nation's nuclear weapon laboratories, responsible
for designing and safeguarding the country's nuclear stockpile.</LD>
<TE>   Juzaitis was director from 1993 to 1998 of the so-called X Division at
Los Alamos, where Lee also worked, a University of California source
said. But a university search committee decided that Juzaitis had little
role in the Lee affair and selected him from among 40 candidates for the
Livermore job.</TE>
<TE>   The search committee was told that Lee was one of 300 employees of the
division and that several layers of supervisors separated him from
Juzaitis, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee was also told that Juzaitis was a "minor player" in the
Lee matter and cooperated fully with federal investigators, the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like other people who talked about the nomination, he would not allow
his name to be printed because personnel matters are considered
confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Juzaitis could not be reached for comment. Mark Holscher, a lawyer for
Lee, said of Juzaitis: "I am not aware of any allegations that he did not
act entirely properly. . . . We raised no allegations that he had acted
improperly."</TE>
<TE>   Lee, a Taiwanese-born scientist and naturalized U.S. citizen, was
fired from his job at Los Alamos in 1999 amid allegations of spying for
China. He was held in solitary confinement for 275 days but never charged
with espionage. He pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling restricted
data and was sentenced to time served. Lee later said he was singled out
because of his Chinese heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The Livermore and Los Alamos labs are run by the University of
California on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. Livermore's
director is selected by the UC president, with the concurrence of the
regents.</TE>
<TE>   One university source said UC officials presented Juzaitis' name on
Monday to Abraham, the Energy secretary, and that Abraham approved the
choice. But Abraham was not told that Juzaitis had held a supervisory job
in Lee's division, this person said. By Friday, the Energy Department was
asking questions that the university thought it had to address before
holding a confirmation vote.</TE>
<TE>   It is now unclear that Juzaitis will remain the university's
selection. Michael Reese, a university spokesman, said the candidate,
whom he would not identify by name, "is a fine and accomplished scientist
and a deserving candidate, but there were a number of other extremely
strong candidates as well."</TE>
<TE>   At the Department of Energy, spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto said: "As I
understand it, we are talking about candidates, more than one. The
selection process is not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Livermore director manages a budget of $1.52 billion and 8,000
employees. The lab, 40 miles east of San Francisco, is primarily devoted
to ensuring the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Among other
things, it develops computerized and other tests of the reliability of
nuclear weapons, a key mission after the government declared a moratorium
on nuclear weapon tests in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Juzaitis earned a doctorate in nuclear engineering at the University
of Virginia. According to a biography issued by the Los Alamos lab, he
led the X Division during its transition from a nuclear testing unit to
one devoted to maintaining the nuclear stockpile.</TE>
<TE>   The biography said Juzaitis had broad weapon design expertise and
experience in computational physics and nuclear testing. He is associate
lab director for weapon physics.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo), whose district includes the
Livermore lab, said it was appropriate that the vote on Juzaitis was
delayed. "The new director will play a vital role in the future direction
of the lab, and it is important that everyone's questions are answered
before a final decision is rendered."</TE>

<LD>A day after undergoing an operation to replace a worn-out pig valve
installed in his heart 10 years ago, Sen. Jesse Helms was awake and
responding to family members.</LD>
<LD>   Helms, 80, remained in an intensive care unit but was allowed
visitors. Officials at Inova Fairfax Hospital deferred all questions
about his condition to Helms' office.</LD>
<LD>   The North Carolina Republican has said he will retire in January after
30 years in the Senate. Helms has had several health problems in recent
years, including knee replacement surgery and prostate cancer, and he
often travels around the Capitol on a motorized scooter.</LD>

<LD>A man was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for
allegedly smuggling opium-soaked tablecloths into the country from
Thailand, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael S. James of Minneapolis was arrested April 18 with 90 of the
tablecloths sealed in plastic bags in his luggage, according to court
records and investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The opium was bound for the Minneapolis area, where it would have been
processed to produce more than 9 pounds of heroin worth about $5 million,
police said.</LD>
<TE>   Two other men, Vong Her of St. Paul, Minn.; and Fai Yang of Eau
Claire, Wis.; were arrested after meeting James at the airport. They
allegedly paid James and gave him a free plane ticket to fly overseas and

<HD>Harris Has Right Makeup for Politics</HD>
<DH>Congress: The Florida Republican, admired and reviled for her role
in the 2000 election, seeks a seat in the House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARASOTA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>To Democrats across America, she was for a few tumultuous weeks the
most reviled woman in politics. But that is neither here nor now. Wearing
a brown dress long enough to conceal the knees she'd scraped in a bicycle
fall, she thrusts her hand over the bar top to greet a voter. "Call me
Katherine," she insists.</LD>
<LD>   Katherine Harris, the Republican who certified George W. Bush's
disputed presidential victory in Florida, now wants to go to Washington
herself as a House member representing this mostly white, mostly
well-to-do strip of Florida's Gulf Coast. To millions of Americans
watching as the White House runoff drama unfolded, Harris appeared
scandalously partisan--even wicked. But among Republicans, who
predominate here in Florida's 13th Congressional District, she is a hero.</LD>
<LD>   "She stood her ground, and I admired her for that," Lee Kelso, a
72-year-old retiree, said while enjoying some strawberries and clotted
cream during high tea at the Ritz-Carlton hotel here. "She has the
courage of her convictions. She seems to be a fine person."</LD>
<TE>   One recent evening, Harris campaigned before the cops and retirees of
the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 3. Her 15-minute speech got her a
standing ovation and a blue warmup jacket from the lodge president. "To
me, she is absolutely down-home Florida," said Officer 1st Class Doug
Peters of the Sarasota Marine Patrol. "My wife is going to be happy I got
to meet Katherine Harris and thank her for upholding Florida law."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, the multimillionaire granddaughter of one of Florida's most
influential citrus and cattle magnates, isn't the only polarizing figure
seeking office this year in the Sunshine State: There's former Atty. Gen.
Janet Reno, the favored candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial primary
and--depending on one's political affiliation--either an esteemed or a
loathed member of the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Both contests should keep Florida in the national political spotlight
until November, when analysts likely will scrutinize election day results
for clues to the next presidential race. Just as in 2000, Florida widely
is considered a must-win for the White House contenders in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   As Florida's secretary of state, Harris oversaw the ballot recount
that awarded the state's electoral votes--and the White House--to Bush.
(She also happened to be co-chairwoman of Bush's Florida campaign. And
Gov. Jeb Bush happens to be the president's brother.)</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to see her in custody," said Cosmo Hansen, 67, a store clerk
on Sarasota's Main Street. "I think the woman is evil incarnate. She
stole the election."</TE>
<TE>   During the recount process, Harris says she received 750,000 e-mails
that ran the gamut from death threats to love letters. While admirers
sent bouquets, her makeup became the butt of jokes on late-night
television. One Democratic operative likened her to Cruella De Vil, the
garishly made-up Walt Disney villain who wanted to skin Dalmatian puppies
to make a coat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a partisan Democrat, she is the she-devil," said Richard
Scher, professor of political science at the University of Florida in
Gainesville. "When you cross the street and ask the same question, they
see her as Mary, Queen of Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say they believe Harris' name on the ballot will galvanize
those Floridians, including blacks and Jewish retirees, who think she
disenfranchised them a year and a half ago. "We have candidates lining up
down there for a chance to take on Ms. Harris," reported Ryan Banfill,
communications director for the Florida Democratic Party in Tallahassee.
To date, there are three: a teacher, a lawyer and a former TV reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who faces a pair of little-known GOP challengers in the Sept.
10 primary, says she fully expects to come under fire from Democrats
nationwide. But in campaign appearances throughout the district, the
woman who also served four years as a state senator talks more like a
humble novice than a nationally known politician.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting all over again," Harris told the police lodge
membership. "When I'm walking from door to door, I'm just Katherine."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Harris attempted to get her party's blessing for a U.S.
Senate nomination but was passed over. Some GOP leaders have been unable
to conceal their distaste for what they see as her showboating and raw
ambition. State Senate President John McKay told one newspaper columnist
last year: "There are probably people who could better represent the
area." According to the Bradenton Herald, McKay's hometown paper, some
area Republicans tried to persuade five-term GOP incumbent Rep. Dan
Miller not to retire so as not to provide an opening for Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a showoff, Harris said, she was a legislative workhorse
during her 1994-98 tenure in the Florida Senate. "I'll work very hard,
I'll come home and listen, and I'll take that voice to Washington," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Harris has raised more than $1.7 million for her race, a sum
that reflects the gratitude of Republicans across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old says her main campaign issues will be ensuring
national security, fighting crime, improving Social Security, creating
more high-paying jobs, bettering schools and safeguarding the
environment. But if people want to grill her on her actions as Florida's
chief election official, she's happy to discuss that too.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I followed the letter of the law, before God, before my
friends, before my family," Harris said in an interview. "And so I sleep
very well. I have a clear conscience. The rule of law prevailed."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at a felt-topped poker table in a back room that also housed
the police lodge bar, Harris was engaging and informal.</TE>
<TE>   When she needs a break from the grind of politics, Harris said, she
sometimes bicycles with her husband--thus the bandaged knees. "I'm a
tomboy," she said. And of the attention paid to her appearance during the
2000 campaign, Harris laughingly denied ever having owned blue eye shadow
and offered that Florida's male politicians and the TV reporters sent to
cover the 2000 recount wore more makeup than she did.</TE>
<TE>   Harris has taken heat for other actions as secretary of state,
including her frequent foreign trips to pitch Florida business and
investment opportunities. The taxpayers, Harris asserted, have gotten
more than their money's worth, as Florida's international trade has more
than doubled in the last decade to $74 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Scher believes that Harris harbors ambitions to run for governor in
four years, a claim that she denies.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very shrewd," the professor said. "Often people can't get past
the mascara and think there is not much more there. But she is an iron
lady. You can't push Harris around."</TE>
<TE>   Sarasota County Commissioner Paul H. Mercier, a fellow Republican and
friend, says: "You don't have to like Katherine Harris, but you've got to
respect her. . . . What's that saying? A diamond is only a piece of coal
that's done good under pressure. That's Katherine."</TE>

<HD>Priest Tried to Blackmail Cardinal, Files Show</HD>
<DH>Church: Newly released documents detail an accused pedophile's
threatening letter to Law's predecessor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>The latest round of documents released by the Roman Catholic
archdiocese here shows that an accused pedophile priest shipped from
Boston to California once tried to blackmail a cardinal.</LD>
<LD>   More than 800 pages of records turned over late Thursday to attorney
Roderick MacLeish Jr. also reveal that Father Paul Shanley sought
treatment for venereal disease in several cities. The onetime "street
priest"--recognizable in Boston during the 1970s with his long hair, blue
jeans and motorcycle--also boasted in the documents of teaching young
people how to properly "shoot up" drugs.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the writings of a perverted monster who was sent out into
the field, unsupervised, to be with children," said MacLeish, who is
representing the family of 24-year-old Greg Ford in a civil case against
Shanley. Ford claims he was abused by Shanley for six years, beginning
when Ford was 6 and a student in religious education classes taught by
Shanley.</LD>
<TE>   The newest information shows that Shanley chafed when the late
Cardinal Humberto Medeiros tried to remove him from his high-profile
Boston street ministry. In a letter, Shanley threatened to go to the
media with allegations of homosexuality in the archdiocesan seminary.</TE>
<TE>   "Were I to release this to the press, you would have to fire another
half-dozen of your top priests since what they are saying is far more
shocking than my poor offerings," Shanley wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Medeiros replied: "I reject completely your accusation that I am
inflicting punishment on homosexuals and their families."</TE>
<TE>   He continued: "I shall pass over in amazed but laughable silence the
threats you invoke against me concerning further public pronouncements."</TE>
<TE>   Medeiros died in 1983 and was replaced by Cardinal Bernard Law. The
1,600-plus pages of documents about Shanley show the archdiocese knew of
complaints about him dating from at least 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials here approved Shanley's transfer in 1991 to San
Bernardino. With another priest from Boston as his partner, Shanley also
owned and operated a Palm Springs inn that was popular with a gay
clientele. The 71-year-old Shanley--who left the San Bernardino church in
the 1990s--recently was fired from his volunteer post with the San Diego
Police Department. His whereabouts are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The newest deluge of incriminating material comes 17 days after a
court-ordered deadline to furnish all records pertaining to Shanley's
long relationship with the Boston Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   A first set of documents made public this month established that
church officials here were aware of sexual abuse allegations against
Shanley and knew he was present at a meeting of an organization that
became the North American Man-Boy Love Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Those records, also numbering more than 800 pages, showed that the
Boston Archdiocese recommended Shanley to St. Ann's parish in San
Bernardino as a priest "in good standing," despite a long history of
complaints about him.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations from the first batch of Shanley documents prompted Law
to make a secret visit to the Vatican two weeks ago to discuss the
possibility of resigning with Pope John Paul II. The pope refused to let
Law step down.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, rumors of Law's possible departure dogged last week's
Vatican meeting of U.S. cardinals. A spokeswoman for the Boston
Archdiocese spent much of Friday fielding calls about a report in that
day's Boston Herald that Law will be assigned to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Archdiocese also denied reports that the new batch of
Shanley documents was held back until the Vatican meeting ended, to avoid
further embarrassment. Father Christopher Coyne, speaking for the
archdiocese, said the records simply were "overlooked" by officials in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish, however, remained skeptical. "We have absolutely zero
confidence that we have all the records that are responsive to the court
order," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In rambling diary entries found in the newly released documents,
Shanley describes signing up at the local venereal disease clinic
whenever he moved to a new city, "for help with my VD." Another entry
reads: "My God, I've even taught kids how to shoot up properly! How to
double-sterilize your works; how to avoid a hot shot. Not very pretty.
But, you see, they die."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese last week lost a court battle to block MacLeish from
deposing Law. The cardinal is scheduled for deposition June 5.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, another priest in the Boston archdiocese, Mgsr. Francis
Ryan, resigned after child abuse allegations.</TE>

<LD>Under intense public pressure to act decisively against abusive
priests, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua joined Roman Catholic leaders Friday
who want a "one-strike-and-you're-out" policy.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. cardinals returned from this week's Vatican summit on the
clerical sex-abuse crisis struggling to build consensus for a tough
approach among the nation's bishops.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, they seemed closer. In addition to Bevilacqua, Archbishop
Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee and Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul and
Minneapolis added their support.</LD>
<TE>   No single cardinal or bishop can enact a national policy, since each
diocese is autonomous. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, at its
meeting in June, is expected to vote on whether to approve a national
policy that will be binding on every diocese.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Charlton Heston said Friday he is ready to run for an unprecedented
fifth term as president of the National Rifle Assn.</LD>
<LD>   After addressing members at the 131st annual meeting here, Heston 78,
said he has been encouraged by their continued support for his
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as I don't screw it up completely, I suppose I'll keep coming
back," Heston said.</LD>
<TE>   NRA members elect a national board of directors today. The more than
70 board directors vote Monday on a president.</TE>
<TE>   The current board of directors requested unanimously that Heston, who
was first elected to head the 4.2-million-member gun rights group in
1998, run for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said he did not foresee any
challengers to Heston.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board of directors supports him unanimously, why would anyone
else run?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the opening of the meeting at the Reno-Sparks Convention
Center, Heston helped lead the gathering of 2,500 in a tribute to heroes
and survivors of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Some members voiced concerns about the future of the NRA after Heston
steps down.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlton Heston is well known and credible, but he's getting older,"
said J. Reed of Roseville, Calif. "It'll be a problem down the road when
he retires. In California, they listen to movie stars, and I wish someone
like Tom Selleck would replace him."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rep. Bob Stump, the Arizona Republican who chairs the House Armed
Services Committee, said Friday he has "serious health problems" and
won't seek a 14th term this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Stump released a statement announcing his decision. He did not
elaborate on the nature of the illness and has told his staff nothing
further about his condition, said his chief of staff, Lisa Atkins.</LD>
<LD>   "Recently, I learned that I have some serious health problems and have
been undergoing tests," Stump said. "For that reason, I have decided not
to seek reelection and will return to farming at the end of this term."</LD>
<TE>   Stump, 75, was elected to the House as a Democrat in 1976. He changed
parties in 1981 after voting for President Reagan's tax cuts and has been
reelected 10 times since by comfortable margins.</TE>
<TE>   A consistent supporter of increased military and veterans' spending,
he took over the Armed Services chairmanship last year and has used his
position to push for President Bush's missile defense plan, a pay raise
for military personnel and $2 billion in additional military
construction.</TE>
<TE>   In three terms as chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, he
pressed for health benefits and college assistance for veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Stump has only a skeleton staff, no press secretary and sometimes
answers his own office phone.</TE>
<TE>   "He always shunned the limelight, but got the job done," said Sen. Jon
Kyl (R-Ariz.). "As Bob returns full time to Arizona, he will leave a
lasting impression in Washington as an effective legislator and a
distinguished public servant."</TE>
<TE>   Stump angered immigrant groups with legislation to make English the
official language for government business and to change laws so children
born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents would not be U.S. citizens.
Neither bill became law.</TE>
<TE>   He also sponsored legislation and was a leading advocate for the
construction of a World War II memorial on the National Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Stump is the 18th Republican and 27th House member to announce
retirement. Republicans hold a 222-211 advantage in the House, and GOP
leaders are confident they can retain Stump's seat in the
Republican-leaning district in northwestern Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins announced Friday that she would run for her boss' seat, and
Stump endorsed her. Two Democrats have announced, and others from both
parties are expected to enter the race.</TE>
<TE>   Stump also served multiple terms in the Arizona House of
Representatives and the state Senate.</TE>

<HD>Medgar Evers' Widow Donates Documents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.
</DL>
<LD>Showing how much times have changed, the widow of slain civil
rights leader Medgar Evers donated his papers to the state of
Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where they belong," Myrlie Evers-Williams told a racially
mixed crowd Thursday as she gave Evers' letters, speeches and notes, as
well as her own papers and photos, to the state Department of Archives
and History. In all, she gave 55 boxes of materials that will become
available to researchers next year.</LD>
<LD>   Evers, field secretary for the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, was shot in the back June 12, 1963, while standing in the
driveway of his Jackson home with an armful of "Jim Crow Must Go"
T-shirts.</LD>
<TE>   Evers-Williams, who left Mississippi with the couple's three children
after her husband died, was national NAACP chairwoman from 1995 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband always believed his home state could rise above
its racial division. Mississippi has embraced change in the last four
decades and still has more progress to make, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state archive houses the papers of Confederate President Jefferson
Davis, but until now it has had no papers from national civil rights
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Evers' killer, Byron De La Beckwith, was freed after two all-white
juries failed to convict him in the 1960s. Then in the early 1990s,
documents of a state spy agency, the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission,
revealed that agents worked to get Beckwith acquitted. He was indicted
again and convicted in 1994. Beckwith was serving a life term when he
died in prison last year.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. William Winter, a longtime member of the Archives and
History Board of Trustees, said Medgar Evers "gave his life in his quest
to free us all--black and white folks alike--from the bondage of racial
segregation and discrimination. He was a true hero."</TE>

<HD>Seafaring Dog Rescued From Tanker</HD>
<DH>Salvage: Burned-out ship had been adrift since its crew was picked
up April 2. Sailors on a tug sent to move the vessel lured the
mixed-breed with food.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>A dog stranded for 24 days aboard an abandoned fuel tanker in the
Pacific Ocean was rescued Friday by the crew of a tugboat, a Coast Guard
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The crew found the dog on deck and put her inside a portable kennel,
Chief Petty Officer Tyler Johnson said.</LD>
<LD>   "The crew had food for her and she came right up," said Capt. Gilbert
J. Kanazawa, commander of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in
Honolulu. "They didn't have to do much to get her."</LD>
<TE>   The 2-year-old mixed-breed white terrier appears to be in good
condition and is eating and drinking, he said. The dog had lived on the
tanker with the crew since she was a puppy.</TE>
<TE>   The burned-out tanker had been drifting about in the Pacific, hundreds
of miles southwest of Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, it was within 100 miles of Johnston Atoll, in U.S.
territorial waters.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard sent the salvage tugboat to prepare to move the tanker
away from the island, concerned that it would break apart and spill its
60,000 gallons of diesel fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the dog would be moved to the tugboat after the crew
completes rigging operations aboard the tanker Insiko 1907.</TE>
<TE>   The dog, named Forgea, had not been seen since Monday, when she
scampered below deck to evade fishermen from Honolulu trying to coax her
off the ship.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier $48,000 rescue attempt was abandoned after authorities said
they believed the tanker had sunk with Forgea aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian Humane Society said that attempt was covered by donations
and funds from the national society.</TE>
<TE>   "We are thrilled," said Pamela Burns, executive director of the humane
society. "This is the perfect ending to a wonderful story."</TE>
<TE>   The dog had been alone on the 256-foot tanker since April 2, when the
cruise ship Norwegian Star rescued the captain and 10 crew members.</TE>
<TE>   An engine room fire aboard the Indonesian tanker March 13 killed one
crew member and knocked out power and communications aboard the ship,
which serviced fishing boats with fuel and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard is considering towing the tanker to deep water and
sinking it at a depth of about three miles, said Lt. DesaRae Atnip,
public affairs officer. At that depth, the diesel fuel would dissipate
before reaching the surface, she said.</TE>

<HD>A Barbecue for Bush's Benefactors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>In the political equivalent of bringing flowers to a generous
friend after spending, oh, say $185 million of the friend's money,
President Bush thanked the biggest contributors to his presidential
campaign Friday.</LD>
<LD>   And he didn't ask them for a cent.</LD>
<LD>   In jeans, brown cowboy boots and a tan jacket with his name--and the
job title earned with those contributions--stitched on the front, Bush
greeted more than 200 of the Republican Party's most generous
contributors, known as the Regents.</LD>
<TE>   The Regents each contributed at least $250,000 over the last two
years--and, presumably, can be counted upon to keep giving if Bush seeks
reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Among the guests reportedly at the event were Fort Worth financier Lee
Brown, oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens and Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks. The
White House did not allow the media to attend and would not provide a
guest list.</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon--barbecued brisket, sausage, cole slaw, potato salad and
pies--was held at a neighbor's home, Stan and Kathy Hickey's Broken Spoke
Ranch, about 3 1/2 miles away from Bush's ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called the party a "friend-raiser." In the political world, the
more common term is "donor maintenance," as politicians make sure their
most generous backers know they are appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nice, casual setting to say hello to people, and I'm looking
forward to it," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   But a "friend-raiser?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a kind of a cute way of saying I'm going to go over and see
people and thank them for being a part of my campaign," he said before
the party. "And they actually get to do this for free."</TE>
<TE>   That's a change for Bush, who rejected taxpayer funding of his
presidential campaign and went on to raise $185 million for the 2000
race. This year, he is attending fund-raising parties for other
candidates and the Republican Party at a pace of about $1 million a week.
He is planning to attend two Monday--one in Los Angeles--and another in
San Jose on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush's motorcade arrived Friday, he was greeted by two cowboys on
horseback. One carried an American flag, the other the flag of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   His trip was barely 10 minutes, but the journey was longer for others.
They arrived from the airport in Waco, about 30 miles away, in a fleet of
small buses. Many had flown in aboard private jets.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the president is attending the Houston wedding of his former
personal aide at the White House, Logan Walters.</TE>
<TE>   "Interestingly enough, Logan is marrying the niece of Don Evans'
wife," Bush said. Evans, the Commerce secretary, is a boyhood friend of
the president.</TE>
<TE>   As he sought to walk reporters through the West Texas genealogy, he
added: "Logan's bride's father was the Boy Scout in my Cub Scout den.
Now, you can chew on that for the rest of the day."</TE>

<HD>7.2 Quake Hits Guam; 5 Injured, but No Major Damage Reported</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HAGATNA, Guam
</DL>
<LD>A strong earthquake rocked Guam early today, knocking out
electricity across the island and sending five residents to a hospital
with cuts and bruises.</LD>
<LD>   The earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.2 and was centered 30
miles southwest of Hagatna, the island capital, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. It hit at 2:06 a.m. (9:06 a.m. PDT Friday) at a depth
of 47 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Guam Memorial Hospital reported minor damage to its building, and the
quake shook loose water lines at the Guam International Airport,
including one over the security screening area, delaying departure of
some flights. The quake struck during a peak morning hour for
international stopover flights.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities began a visual assessment of damage at sunrise, according
to the Civil Defense office. Preliminary checks of roads and bridges
found no serious damage, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Quigley, 23, was dancing at a nightclub when the temblor hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It started shaking and I just thought people were really dancing wild
and getting into it," he said. "But as it started shaking more and more,
I was like--hold on--this ain't no bass, this is an earthquake."</TE>

<HD>2 Key House Republicans Back Guns in Cockpits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A campaign by airline pilots to carry guns in cockpits has gained
the support of two key House Republicans despite the opposition of Bush
administration officials.</LD>
<LD>   House aviation subcommittee chairman John L. Mica of Florida and House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Don Young of Alaska
are scheduled to introduce legislation Tuesday to allow trained pilots to
carry guns.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of us feel pretty strongly on the issue of allowing pilots and
crews that are at risk to defend themselves," Mica said. "We don't know
what the next attack might look like."</LD>
<TE>   Mica's subcommittee has scheduled a hearing Thursday, when pilots plan
to submit petitions with thousands of signatures to the White House.
Through Friday, according to their Internet site, they had obtained
34,146 signatures.</TE>
<TE>   The airline security law passed last fall allows the government to
decide whether pilots should carry guns.</TE>
<TE>   Two top administration officials, Transportation Secretary Norman Y.
Mineta and Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, oppose arming pilots.
Mineta has said that newly reinforced cockpit doors prevent terrorists
from commandeering airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta's personal views aside, Transportation Department officials
have yet to decide whether to arm pilots, spokesman Chet Lunner said. He
said he expects a decision shortly.</TE>
<TE>   Responded Mica: "We may have a difference of opinion. If the majority
of folks in Congress agree with us, we'll change the law."</TE>
<TE>   An airline consumer group formed by Ralph Nader has endorsed arming
pilots. Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project, said the fortified cockpit doors are not strong enough to deter
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it is unlikely a terrorist group could overpower a
flight crew armed with guns and axes, and there is ammunition that would
not penetrate the skin of an airplane, Hudson said.</TE>
<TE>   Airline pilots have pushed for the right to carry arms since shortly
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Earlier this month, officials of
five pilot unions sent a letter to Bush asking him to arm pilots who
volunteer to carry the guns and go through background checks and
training.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Line Pilots Assn., the largest pilot union, is asking its
roughly 62,000 members to urge their employers to support guns in the
cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines Capt. Denis Breslin said other post-Sept. 11
security actions--reinforcing cockpit doors, inspecting all bags for
explosives, improving passenger screening at checkpoints--aren't enough.</TE>

<HD>Father's Death Turns Exec to Life in Show Biz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little more than a year ago, Lisa Richard was cruising along,
happily leading a double life as a corporate vice president by day
and a singer-actress and recording artist the rest of the time.</LD>
<LD>   "But life," she says, "has a very interesting way of throwing you
curveballs."</LD>
<LD>   It was more like a sucker-punch. Her father, Charles, a
perennially healthy dairy farmer she describes as "a bull of a man,
bigger than life," became sick with cancer, deteriorated rapidly, and
died in April 2001 at age 66.</LD>
<TE>   Richard left her job at Toshiba in Irvine to care for him back in
her hometown of Herkimer, N.Y. After he died, she came home to Laguna
Beach, but couldn't go on as before. "I was so broken up, I went
through several months of not wanting to do anything."</TE>
<TE>   But Richard had a prior engagement to fill: before her father fell
ill, she had agreed to sing in the Pageant of the Masters in Laguna.
Starting with rehearsals in June, and on through the summer, she was
occupied every night, singing a couple of old Edith Piaf numbers to
go with a living montage of French Impressionist paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "It really pulled me out of being miserable," Richard says. "I
started to live the life of a performer. It brought me back from the
land of the dead, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in this MBA holder's life, she decided that
there would be no business but show business. She dived into roles in
musicals and performed guest duets at concerts by her friend,
Broadway star Susan Egan. Recently, Richard officially turned pro--at
age 41--by joining the union, Actors' Equity. Her first Equity job
was a Southern California tour of the Rodgers and Hart revue,
"Beguiled Again."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday she opens as Corine, a saucy, comical and sexy
maidservant in the musical "Triumph of Love" at International City
Theatre in Long Beach. She also has a new CD, "Virgin Tracks," her
second release for LML Music, a Los Angeles label that specializes in
cabaret- and theater-based singers.</TE>
<TE>   The album (available through her Web site, www.lisarichard.com)
shows Richard's varied interests. It has some big Broadway-style
ballads with full orchestra. But there are also some pop songs,
including a number with Latin salsa rhythms and a dreamy
Caribbean-flavored tune. "Don't You Be Shakin' Your Faith in Me"
finds Richard and Egan dueting like soul-sisters on an upbeat R&amp;B
number about enduring friendship. Richard varies her approach from
song to song, sometimes laying on the big Broadway crescendos, but
often taking a more nuanced tone.</TE>
<TE>   The songs, by an assortment of composers including John Bucchino
and Stephen Schwartz, never had been recorded before; Richard's
concept was to sing only previously unheard material.</TE>
<TE>   Egan's performance on Richard's album returns a favor. Last
summer, Richard took a four-day break from the Pageant of the Masters
to join her friend at Abbey Road Studio in London, where Egan
recorded her first solo CD, "So Far ..." It includes their duet on "I
Know Him So Well" from "Chess" (music by Benny Andersson and Bjorn
Ulvaeus of the group ABBA, lyrics by Tim Rice).</TE>
<TE>   Richard says she doesn't regret waiting until midlife to become
single-minded about show business. "I know there are people who say
if you're 41 and just starting to do it, it can't work. Well, I've
gotten two [Equity] jobs already, and in my current job I get to be
sexy. How great is that, to be 41 and get to be sexy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Triumph of Love," Long Beach Performing Arts Center, 300 E. Ocean
Blvd. Previews Tuesday-Thursday, 8 p.m., opens Friday. Regular
performances, Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends May
26. $23-$35. (562) 436-4610.</TE>
<TE>   The Rude Guerrilla Theater Company's landlord troubles are over,
because leaders of the Santa Ana storefront troupe finally got to
meet their landlord.</TE>
<TE>   Due to rising rent, a lack of air-conditioning and cramped
quarters, the respected, risk-taking Rude Guerrilla had declared that
after this year it would abandon its home, the Empire Theater at 200
N. Broadway in the downtown Artist Village. Enter Al Shankle,
property owner and theater buff. Rude Guerrilla had dealt with a
building manager, but after that employee quit recently, Shankle
became more hands-on. Checking out the property last month on a visit
from his home in Genoa, Nev., Shankle ran into Rude Guerrilla
production director Don Hess, who politely detailed the space's
shortcomings. Shankle cut the theater a break on its rent, agreed to
help it install air-conditioning by the summer, and approved
remodeling that will expand the Empire's seating capacity from 50 to
60. Now he hopes to sign Rude Guerrilla to a five-to 10-year lease.</TE>
<TE>   Shankle and his wife then attended the current show, Yasmina
Reza's "Art," and loved it. The landlord became a patron, sending in
"a little contribution because I think they're doing good work."</TE>
<TE>   With the improvements and rent break, Shankle said, "I hope that
will set the stage [for great things], and some of the actors will
make it all the way to Broadway." He meant the other Broadway.</TE>
