<LD>Blah, blah, blah Lucques ("Still Ahead of the Rest," by S. Irene
Virbila, Restaurants, May 19). Blah, blah, blah Campanile. Does Virbila
really think that L.A. diners are oblivious to her transparent and
redundant promotion of her pet places? It reminds me of a high school
yearbook, where only the rich and popular friends of the editor wind up
on the pages.</LD>

<LD>What a nice piece of work your Home and Garden Issue was (May 19).
They say "a rich man has a psychiatrist and a poor man has his garden,"
and I believe it. Two things: In the skin cancer-conscious Coachella
Valley, I would cover a pool with a tent rather than have a tent at the
side. And if I were invited to spend the night at the place with the
outside mattress that was found on a curb in Venice, I would politely
decline.</LD>

<LD>I have a daughter who's 29. she has just moved to Los Angeles,
hoping to find a job and establish herself as a fine artist. She needs an
apartment and a car. I'm trying to do my fatherly duty and help.</LD>
<LD>   I have a daughter who's 26. She lives in New York, works part time as
a nanny and aspires to make a living eventually at what she's trained
for: singing opera. She recently realized she's neither immortal nor
immune to physical catastrophe, and so is trying to get health insurance.
I'm helping.</LD>
<LD>   These two have amassed a lot of debt getting through graduate school.
I hope at some point to be able to help in that regard, too.</LD>
<TE>   I also have a third daughter. This one may or may not be artistically
inclined, although her voice has a thrilling timbre when loosed at full
volume in the middle of the night. Her I help by trailing behind her at
close quarters, lest she fall and bang her head on something hard. She's
just learned to walk, having turned 1 on May 1, the same day I turned 56.</TE>
<TE>   Fatherhood, it seems, never ends.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter No. 3 was, to put it calmly, a great surprise to her
dilapidating sire. She wasn't exactly figured on or psychologically
planned for. Yet, here she is, toddling the world on round little feet,
turning a hopeful face to whatever is new (which is practically
everything), falling every 10 or 12 steps on her cushiony behind.</TE>
<TE>   Fathering two generations was a little more reproduction than I'd
countenanced. Most of the superannuated men I know who undertake second
batches of children do so because they regret having been inattentive to
the first ones. I maintain this was not true of me.</TE>
<TE>   When I informed Daughters No. 1 and No. 2 about the pendency of No. 3,
they were amused by the prospect of watching me contend with a baby
half-sister of theirs. It would be like observing themselves being
reared, only with adult discernment-- "Aha! That's why I'm insecure about
public speaking."</TE>
<TE>   Having hoped for a few carefree years before true senescence set in, I
was a little unsettled by the prospect of daddying-up yet again.
Daughters No. 1 and No. 2 confronted my unease forthrightly. No. 1 urged
me to think of renewed child-raising as an opportunity to get "out of
myself." No. 2 assured me I could do a good job of it even with my eyes
closed, and reminded me the coming baby had as much right to good
fathering as she and her sister had.</TE>
<TE>   I was really quite moved by all this role-reversal. When No. 2 and I
were about to end our telephone call, I said, "I'm really grateful I have
you in my life."</TE>
<TE>   She replied, "What makes you think you won't feel the same way about
this little girl someday?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, paternally speaking, I know I'm not the man I used to be. My
patience with little people's noise and disruptiveness has gone as thin
as my hair. My desire to do as I please burns hotter. I do not take
gladly to synchronizing my rising and retiring with baby sleep schedules.
In all, I'm considerably more fatigable.</TE>
<TE>   I'm concerned, too, about the effect my geezerhood might have on
Daughter No. 3. Frightening visions of Indian Princess camping trips
aside, I worry that just as she rounds the home stretch into full
adolescence, my scoreboard clock will expire and the race, for me, will
be over. My father died at 74. I might never see No. 3 settled into full
adulthood (of course, the way No. 1 and No. 2 are going, I might not live
to see them in that state, either).</TE>
<TE>   When my mother, who's 88, first saw a photograph of me and No. 3, she
chuckled and said, "You look more like the grandpa." I suspect that's
much what I'm like, too, handing the baby off at the first whiff of a
malodorous diaper, making myself scarce at bath time and generally
shirking domestic tasks as I never permitted myself to do the first time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Daughter No. 3 is an opportunity for me to increase my
net volume of fatherly love. And properly constituted, a father's love
(like a mother's) is the purest distillate of the substance, because it
is the most selfless. It flows with such momentum, moreover, that it can
never be returned by his children, but only passed on by them to their
children. Coded with instruction and example, it's the emotional
equivalent of the DNA he's projected into the unknowable future.</TE>
<TE>   A man, after all, shouldn't choose insignificance lightly; plenty
enough of it typically is thrust upon him in the course of life. I've
never doubted that, vanished visions of a late middle-age idyll
notwithstanding, fatherhood is the most important role I'm likely ever to
play, so, why not return grandly to the stage when the applauding fates
are demanding an encore?</TE>

<LD>Five-time American Comedy Award nominee Kathy Buckley is having the
last laugh on life. The hearing-impaired comic entered a comedy contest
on a dare in 1988, and gained fresh material a couple of years later when
new technology markedly improved her hearing. In her 2001 book, "If You
Could Hear What I See," Buckley trains a survivor's humor on early
experiences, which included molestation, being mislabeled as retarded,
getting run over by a Jeep and cervical cancer. She travels as a comic
and motivational speaker, and her acting resume includes an award-winning
autobiographical play.</LD>
<LD>   Where do you get your comic timing?</LD>
<LD>   It's like a conversation [with the audience]. Except, when they
heckle, I [turn down the hearing aids]. There have been great strides in
hearing technology!</LD>
<TE>   As a young woman, you were declared dead after being run over at the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   First press I ever got: "Jeep Runs Over Area Woman While She Was
Sunbathing." The emergency technician kept apologizing after I woke up.
Talk about a wake-up call. The first 20 years of my life I spent being
what everyone wanted me to be. But when I "died," I found I was perfect
as I was.</TE>
<TE>   Where do you think your humor springs from?</TE>
<TE>   From what I see and feel. Once I understood my differences, I was able
to laugh at the stupidity of society. The greatest gift I've had was to
be able to allow myself to be me. Now I educate corporations and schools
how to integrate people with disabilities, how to mainstream them.</TE>
<TE>   The first chapter of your book is titled "I Can Hear the Laughter."</TE>
<TE>   The first night I used my [new] hearing aids was the first time I
could actually hear the audience. [Before], I would just play off the
vibrations and the faces. But that night it was like stereo. This one guy
kept snorting and it was noisy as hell!</TE>
<TE>   What's it like when life suddenly has a soundtrack?</TE>
<TE>   This is such an annoying, noisy world you guys live in! In the
elevator there's music, in the doctor's office there's music, in the
restaurant--what is it, you people don't wanna hear each other? I'm in
the gynecologist's office wondering if he'd like to add some candlelight,
too!</TE>
<TE>   You reveal so much about yourself in your book.</TE>
<TE>   I left out the mole between my toes. (Made you look!) I'm not
revealing me for me, I'm revealing me for you to be honest with yourself.
We all have the same dreams and desires, the same secrets. There are no
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Do bookstores carry you under "inspiration" as well as "humor?"</TE>
<TE>   You know where they had it? The "disability" section. I was really
hurt. I'm trying so hard to get the label off.</TE>
<TE>   Is it time for a film, or are you happy traveling?</TE>
<TE>   Every comic has airplane jokes! I went to Fiji for a wedding, and on
the way back, an 83-year-old gentleman is sitting next to me. I say, "Hi,
how're you doin'?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fine."</TE>
<TE>   That's all he says for 11 hours. We land in L.A., I look over and
[thank him].</TE>
<TE>   "What for?"</TE>
<TE>   I [answered], "We shared two meals, watched a movie, slept together.
You asked nothing of me." He says, "You're right. You're the best date I
ever had!" He was so cute. I couldn't shake him off my leg in baggage
claim.</TE>

<LD>About 5,000 "Star Trek" fans beamed into the Pasadena Conference
Center over three days this spring for the 10th annual Star Trek Grand
Slam. The massive convention of fans, celebrities and vendors is one of
the largest in the world, according to organizers from Creationent.com.
We probed the minds of some of the participants to see what planet
they're on.</LD>

pregnant and can multiply.</TE>
<TE>   Who is the sexiest "Trek" character?</TE>
<TE>   Bones [DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard H. McCoy]. There was something
so subtly sensuous about him. He had that gentility and charm.</TE>

<TE>   Spock. I actually read for Spock.</TE>
<TE>   If space was the final frontier, where's the next frontier?</TE>

<LD>Screenwriter and playwright Josefina Lopez-Deleage is bringing new
life to her old Boyle Heights neighborhood with the CASA 0101 Theater Art
Space on 1st Street. "I wanted to bring theater to the barrio," says
Lopez-Deleage, a native of Mexico who grew up in Boyle Heights. "People
want to see things happen in their neighborhood. We're so hungry for it
here."</LD>
<LD>   She is feeding that need with CASA 0101, which translates roughly into
"House of Technology" or, as Lopez-Deleage says with a smile, "a house of
brilliant ideas." With no budget and no staff, she has used the former
bridal shop since January for workshops, poetry, photo exhibits and
plays. Her enthusiasm for theater in Boyle Heights harks back to the day
when local artists would stage their own homemade extravaganzas. "I'd
love to have theater here every quarter," Lopez-Deleage says. Earlier
this year, she was amazed by the turnout for the opening of "Caja Negra
[Black Box]," an exhibit by a collective of 17 Latino photographers. "We
had over 500 people show up," she says.</LD>
<LD>   She is also developing a "Latina Digital Boot Camp" to teach
storytelling and filmmaking to local teenagers in the hope of generating
more Latino film projects in Hollywood. "There are plenty of Latino
actors and actresses but we need storytellers. If we don't have writers,
we can't make true progress."</LD>
<TE>   Lopez-Deleage knows about youthful aspirations. Fourteen years ago, at
the age of 19, she wrote the play "Real Women Have Curves." The comedy
tells the story of five full-figured Latinas working in a tiny Boyle
Heights sewing factory while dodging the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. A film version of the play took two awards at the Sundance Film
Festival. HBO will premiere the film in October.</TE>
<TE>   All the recognition has been a little overwhelming for Lopez-Deleage.
"I'm trying to get my excitement under control," she says. She attributes
her success to hard work and the encouragement of others. "When you [want
to] give up, there's too many people who believe in you and they won't
let you give up." Lopez-Deleage has a master's in fine arts in
screenwriting from UCLA and also wrote the play "Simply Maria or The
American Dream," which was produced for television.</TE>
<TE>   CASA 0101 lets Lopez-Deleage give back to her old neighborhood. She
defends Boyle Heights and regrets that it's only recognized when crimes
occur or used as the backdrop for films. "Most of the movies filmed here
are about gangs. They don't know the area. As a writer, I took so many
stories from this place, and I want to give them back."--</TE>

<LD>The first voice many Southern Californians hear on Sunday is Andrea
Leonard's. The host of 89.9 FM KCRW's "Morning Glory," from 5 to 7 a.m.,
delights adventurous gospel music lovers with an eclectic array of
spiritual music. "It's a looser interpretation of gospel, beyond the
traditional," she says. "It's anything with a religious theme, from jazz
to alternative rock." With contemporary gospel easy to find, Leonard, 35,
plays more off-the-beaten-track selections. "I spice it up, add some
surprise elements. I'll put Ralph Stanley next to Ata Damasco from Hawaii
next to 'Freedom Highway' by the Staple Singers."</LD>
<LD>   Leonard, who directs visitor services at the Getty Center during the
week and often introduces featured artists at "KCRW Presents" concerts in
venues ranging from the Greek Theater to the Knitting Factory, got hooked
on music beloved of America's working class in her hometown of Cleveland.
As a teenager, she hung out at her uncle's bar, where factory workers
gathered to hear blues. At Ohio's Case Western Reserve University,
Leonard hosted a blues show on the college radio station. When she moved
to Los Angeles in 1989, she began volunteering at KCRW, the National
Public Radio affiliated station in Santa Monica. Two years ago, she took
over "Morning Glory," which also airs around the world at www.kcrw.com.</LD>
<TE>   Leonard's mix-it-up programming style draws plenty of regulars; a
group of workers on the oil rig Platform Irene off the Santa Barbara
County coast often calls with requests, as do surfers on the way to catch
a wave and nurses headed home after the night shift. As one caller put
it: "Baby, you go all the way back. You don't sound old enough to know
these songs."</TE>

<DH>A Flag Collector's Annual July Spectacular</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEILAH BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a renewed sense of patriotism gripped America after Sept. 11,
Duarte resident Abe Ohanian had no trouble empathizing with those rushing
to the flag store--he's been doing the same thing for 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Each Fourth of July since 1972, the gregarious 73-year-old stockbroker
flies hundreds of flags on the grounds of his modest ranch-style
home--and not just the American variety. Ohanian's dazzling collection of
about 500 flags includes more than 100 American banners and more than 200
foreign flags along with state flags, military flags, Olympic flags and
other varieties.</LD>
<LD>   In sheer numbers, Ohanian's annual spectacular beats the daily display
at the United Nations in New York, which shows a mere 189 flags that
represent member nations. (Indeed, Ohanian has adopted the U.N.'s
alphabetical arrangement system.) His initial display in 1972 featured
flags of the Central African Republic, France, Italy, Thailand, the U.S.
and the African nation of Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), which Ohanian
ran along the sides of his house by attaching them to the roof.</LD>
<TE>   That first effort was a die-hard Democrat's response to a 1971 speech
by Richard M. Nixon. Ohanian remembers the then-president speaking of
flags "as if they belonged to the Republican Party." No, he thought,
"they belong to everybody. They belong to the people, not only to the
government."</TE>
<TE>   Ohanian, who dabbled in journalism as a teen and majored in history
and political science at Cal State L.A., has the collecting bug in a big
way. Flags are just one of his numerous collections, which number about
40,000 items in categories including political buttons, cameras, coins,
hats, magazines and the works of William Saroyan.</TE>
<TE>   By the early '90s, with a growing inventory of old and new flags
purchased at swap meets, estate sales and flag stores, Ohanian devised a
better showcase for his finds: He had about 300 holes dug on his roughly
one-acre property; each holds a 10-foot PVC pipe for a 3-by-5-foot flag.
Each July, the flags wave above his 29 fruit trees and weave around his
basketball court, pool and house, a Herculean effort requiring six hours
and three men. About 200 smaller flags attached to 18-inch wood sticks
are arranged on the lawn in rows to resemble a memorial ground for fallen
war heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Ohanian says that the most common flag motifs are the sickle, crescent
and cross. Older flags are made of cotton, newer ones of nylon. Value
varies widely, depending on size, condition, age and design. He estimates
that his largest pieces (American flags, one of which measures 6 feet by
10 feet) are worth upward of $500 each--but investment was never his main
concern. "I  just liked the colors."</TE>

<LD>For five weeks this spring, the world watched the standoff between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants--many of whom were wanted by
Israel for acts of terrorism--at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
A month into the siege, Carolyn Cole of The Times was taking photographs
outside the church when 10 aid workers sympathetic to the Palestinians
outraced soldiers to enter the structure. Cole went with them. She was
the only photographer to record the standoff from inside the church,
where she remained for nine days before the siege ended May 10. Some of
her photographs were smuggled out and published by The Times. Most of
them, however, were not available until she returned to California days
later. Writer Eric Pape interviewed many of the people in the pictures
and his text accompanies Cole's exclusive photographs.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: First light-- As the first light entered a window above the
altar of the 4th century church each morning, far left, Palestinians
sought the rituals of normal life, such as brewing hot tea. They used
camper stoves or candle wax burning in pots to heat water. Wires overhead
hold gilded lamps, which the Palestinians rigged to recharge their mobile
phones until electricity was cut off by the Israeli military. Those
inside used the phones to talk to family members, friends and
journalists. The church became quite chilly at night. In the foreground,
a man cocoons in blankets discovered in the Casanova Hotel, which is
linked to the church complex. Trips to the hotel were treacherous, as
they required passage through a courtyard under surveillance by Israeli
soldiers, an automated sniper crane and a reconnaissance blimp.</CP>

Thabet checks the serial number of an AK-47, above, before it is handed
over to U.S. authorities as part of the settlement. "We hope that it was
a good idea," Thabet said when reached by phone in late May. None had
been returned at that point, he said. Palestinian police have the right
to carry guns under the Oslo peace accords and the Israelis promised to
return all weapons that were officially registered, provided ballistics
tests did not link them to crimes. Thabet, 35, suffers from stomach
problems caused by losing 46 pounds during the siege. Between the weight
loss and the beard that he grew in the church, his 1-year-old daughter
didn't recognize him.</CP>

were originally from the Gaza Strip but had been in Bethlehem since 1999.
Under terms of the settlement, they were sent back to Gaza. Larry Hales,
a Colorado man who was among the 10 sympathizers who raced into the
church, said the experience was unforgettable. "The most striking thing
was walking around and seeing people's faces by candlelight or as they
fiddled with a candle," he recalled. "You could hear bats screeching and
see their shadows going in and out of the church--it was pretty eerie. It
is supposed to be a holy church, but it reminded me of an old Dracula
movie."</CP>

heavy wooden door was locked with steel bars and was rarely opened. It
simultaneously blocked those inside from freedom and protected them from
harm. Outside, Israeli soldiers trained their weapons on it.</CP>

leaves into his mouth. As food supplies ran out, men took to picking
greens in a rear courtyard and using them for food, either boiled with
salt and water into a soup, or fried in old oil, sometimes the same kind
used in lanterns. The taste was like a light pastry. After leaving the
church, Abed had the shrapnel removed by a doctor.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Blessing the Church--Father Vissarion, below, a Greek
Orthodox priest, carries the Holy Fire obtained from His Beatitude
Ireneos, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. He and Father
Parthenios, holding the incense burner, returned with the flame from an
excursion arranged by the Israeli government during the siege. On the
Orthodox Easter each year, the Holy Fire is distributed around the world
in accordance with Greek Orthodox Church traditions. Escorted by the
Israel Defense Forces, the two men left the church for the first time in
more than a month. "Streets had become dirt paths wherever the tanks had
gone over," Father Parthenios said. "It was like a ghost town because of
the curfew." The two priests returned with the flame seven hours later
and were met with applause from those grateful that spiritual traditions
had survived amid the terrors of warfare. "They blessed the church more
than just that one day," recalled Kristen Schurr, a Palestinian
sympathizer from New York City who was among the aid workers in the
church. She found the incense and chanting rituals comforting,
"especially the first couple of days when we were put in the
grotto--where Jesus was born--to sleep. It was a really beautiful and
surreal way to wake up." On a mattress on the right is Jihad Jaara, a
Palestinian police officer shot in the ankle at the start of the
standoff. Jaara is a member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Israel says
he was involved in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. Alongside
Jaara is Abdallah Dawood, the second-ranking member of Al Aqsa in
Bethlehem. Both men are now in exile. Of the war that surrounded him,
Father Parthenios said: "I could never imagine that war would break out
in the City of Peace, which gives a message that peace and love should
prevail on earth."</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Praying toward Mecca--The vision of Muslims praying within
the main sanctuary is one Father Parthenios will not forget. At 4:30
a.m., noon and 7:30 p.m., the call to worship came--a lone voice echoing
against the stones and pillars set in place 1,700 years ago. "In the
beginning, it was against our rules," Parthenios explained. But given the
circumstances, the church immediately relented. Even so, "I didn't get
used to it . . . I wouldn't want the basilica to have a mosque inside."
Facing Mecca instead of the altar, the Muslims were led by the man in the
foreground. Crouched in the rear is Allah Barakat, a Palestinian police
officer who suffered an assortment of back and nerve ailments from an
accident when he worked on Yasser Arafat's car security detail. Due to
his condition, Barakat, 28, sometimes prayed while sitting on a chair. He
is now in a Palestinian hospital as a result of a stomach ailment related
to the food shortage in the church.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Last to die--Friends comfort a dying Khalaf Najazeh, left,
who was shot by an automated Israeli sniper crane. Mohammed Thabet said
Najazeh, whose wife had recently delivered their 12th child, was shot as
he stood outside the church in a courtyard. Larry Hales said Najazeh had
gone to get water to clean his clothes, anticipating that negotiations
were about to end the standoff. A spokesman for the Israeli military said
Najazeh was holding a gun and preparing to fire. Palestinians and others
in the church say he was unarmed. The bullet pierced the lower left side
of Najazeh's body. Thabet said Najazeh recited prayers to forget the
pain. Then he asked "us to visit his family to tell them what happened
because he knew that he was dying." Israeli authorities agreed to take
Najazeh for treatment. He died in transit. Hales said he was forever
changed by the siege. "Seeing that man shot and seeing his life drift out
of him--these are things you don't want to see anywhere. But when you put
all that inside of a church, it amounts to hypocrisy and a tragedy. It is
supposedly the birthplace of the Christ figure, a place of peace, and
there was a battle being waged there."</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Most wanted--The man the Israelis most wanted was Ibrahim
Abeiyat, 29, right, who was exiled to Spain, where his movements are
restricted. Israel says that as leader of the Bethlehem branch of the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, he was involved in attacks that killed an Israeli
army officer, an Israeli civilian and Avi Boaz, a Brooklyn-born architect
with dual American-Israeli citizenship. During the siege, the Israeli
army brought Abeiyat's mother, Fatema, to the church three times. She
said she was told, "We need you as a dove of peace to speak with Ibrahim
to get him to give himself up, along with the rest of the group." She
said she replied, "If he would get good treatment from you, he would have
given himself up on the first day." She refused to call. After the
standoff ended, 13 Palestinians considered extremely dangerous by Israel
were sent into exile in Europe. Twenty-six others were sent to the Gaza
Strip. As the names of those to be sent away were read aloud, some men
wept. Then they groomed themselves with shampoo and soap pilfered from
the Casanova Hotel and ate a last meal together. The men being exiled
lined up near the door for their farewells, below. Their mood improved.
They had survived.</CP>

<DH>Rep. Barbara Lee Cast the Sole Vote Against Military Retaliation
for the Sept. 11 Terrorist Attacks. Think Her Career Is Over? You Don't
Know the East Bay.</DH>

<LD>Plumes of gray hair spill out from beneath the straw hat of a
rope-thin woman working in the garden at a small bungalow in the
flatlands of Berkeley. Early Neil Young blares from a boombox so loud
that she spies our small entourage only when we are already at her gate.
Her weathered face betrays displeasure at the intrusion, until she
notices her local congresswoman among our group. With a gardening
implement still in hand, she moves toward Barbara Lee. Apparently she has
something to say to the woman who, since Sept. 11, might just rank as the
single most vilified elected official in America.</LD>
<LD>   Three days after the terrorist attacks last September, Lee joined her
colleagues at the National Cathedral for a memorial service attended by
five U.S. presidents, past and present. The next order of business that
day was a congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to use
military force against the perpetrators of the attacks. The measure
passed 98-0 in the Senate and 420-1 in the House. Lee cast the sole vote
in opposition.</LD>
<TE>   Before that day, Lee had served California's 9th Congressional
District--an area that encompasses Berkeley, Oakland and its surrounding
suburbs--in relative anonymity, a diligent but introverted two-term
congresswoman toiling in the shadow of a beloved predecessor. That all
changed with a single vote. Across the country, radio talk-show hosts
rained invectives on Lee's head, rendering her a symbol of inappropriate
dissent at a time of unity and flag-waving national pride.</TE>
<TE>   David Horowitz, a former leftie-turned- conservative social critic,
accused her of being a "Communist" who "actively collaborated" with
America's enemies. She was dubbed a "traitor" and "un-American," and
described as "American hating" on the DumpBarbaraLee.com Web site
launched shortly after her vote. A former state legislator announced that
she would challenge Lee in the Democratic primary. As one top aide to Lee
tells it, even congressional colleagues who might have respected her
action were wishing her well in whatever life brought her after her
constituents booted her from office.</TE>
<TE>   But anyone assuming the worst doesn't know California's 9th District.
Two years ago, George W. Bush barely edged out Ralph Nader in the
presidential election, and Al Gore bested both men by more than a 6-to-1
margin. Lee, 55, is one of the more left-leaning members of the House of
Representatives, a dependable vote on a long list of issues--from the
environment to civil rights to civil liberties--dear to the average East
Bay resident.</TE>
<TE>   On the Saturday before the March primary, I joined Lee, who was
dressed casually in tennis shoes and stretch pants, as she walked a
precinct. To be sure, her campaign had sent her to walk friendly
precincts, but I was figuring that she'd be forced to defend her vote at
least occasionally in face-to-face encounters with constituents. She
never had a chance. Although she was met by indifference at a few doors,
Lee was frequently greeted as if she were a returning hero.</TE>
<TE>   The Neil Young-listening gardener, who had walked over to vigorously
shake Lee's hand and express admiration, was typical. The congresswoman,
who wore a jewel-encrusted American flag pinned to her jacket, heard
plenty of "thank yous" and lots of "good lucks" and even received a few
spontaneous hugs from appreciative constituents.</TE>
<TE>   If she had been running for reelection virtually anywhere else in
America, Barbara Lee would have been a certain loser. But the central
question in the Lee campaign in the days leading up to the primary was
whether she'd win with a small but comfortable majority or garner the
same 85% share of the vote she had received two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Any exploration of Lee's popularity among the people of San
Francisco's East Bay must begin on that fateful day in September, a
moment Lee recalls with an undercurrent of resentment. "There were many
members [of Congress] voicing many of the same concerns that I was
voicing that day," Lee says. "Calling for restraint. Calling for more
debate before rushing into anything. Not wanting to see any more innocent
lives lost. And not wanting to give such broad authority to the
president." Listening to the debate, it never dawned on her that she
might be the only member of the House to vote no.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues tried persuading her to change her mind before the voting
closed, but she refused. The devoutly religious Lee, a practicing Baptist
whose father had been a career Army man, believed she was right. She
received so many death threats in the days following her vote that the
Capitol police assigned around-the-clock plainclothes officers to guard
her.</TE>
<TE>   Her schedule was kept secret even from some members of her staff.
Lee's political brain trust tried to remain confident. The majority of
the 70,000 e-mails, faxes and phone calls her office received were from
outside the district, and not all of them were negative. But there was
creeping cause for concern. Man-on-the-street articles running in the
local newspapers suggested that there was a decidedly mixed reaction to
Lee's stance, and an October poll conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute
of Governmental Studies showed that only 53% of those polled said they
agreed with Lee's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Even staunch trade unionists expressed doubts about Lee, despite her
unwavering pro-labor record. Lee Halterman, Lee's campaign chairman, is a
political consultant who doesn't believe in canvassing voters, but he
made an exception that time. "For the first time ever in my
thirtysomething years of political life," Halterman says, "I actually did
a poll for my candidate."</TE>
<TE>   His fears were short-lived. About 2,000 people showed up for a pro-Lee
rally in downtown Oakland in mid-October, including actor Danny Glover
and author Alice Walker, and all around town bumper stickers and buttons
claiming "Congresswoman Barbara Lee speaks for me!" appeared. The same
poll that revealed mixed reactions to Lee's vote left no doubt that she
was still popular among voters. "We found that even people who disagreed
with her vote admired her for her courage," says Bruce Cain, a UC
Berkeley political science professor and the director of Berkeley's
Institute of Governmental Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Lee also received help from the unlikeliest of allies, Audie Bock, a
former member of the Green Party who had served a term in the California
Assembly. Initially, Bock had called Lee to congratulate her for taking
so courageous and principled a stance, but then a few weeks later
announced she would be seeking Lee's seat.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bock who had funded the now-defunct DumpBarbaraLee.com Web
site, a virulent piece of cyber-agitprop featuring an unflattering photo
of Lee set against an image of the damaged Twin Towers billowing smoke.
"Dump the American-hating Barbara Lee from Congress," read a banner
headline. For many of Bock's once-loyal supporters, the site represented
a dumbfounding reversal. Even Kevin Greene, an early key supporter of the
short-lived Bock campaign, admits that Bock "hammered on that one vote in
such a personal way that it created a backlash of sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   Bock abandoned her campaign just before the deadline for filing for
the primary, leaving Greene, a little-known party functionary, to run in
her stead. Any number of better-known local political figures, under
different circumstances, might have eagerly made a run for Congress. But
even if Lee were vulnerable, challenging her seemed a sure-fire way to
dash a promising East Bay political career. Says former Oakland Mayor
Elihu Harris, "If you had future political ambitions and you challenged
Barbara, the progressive constituency would've been lost to you forever.
I mean forever."</TE>
<TE>   In the looking-glass reality of East Bay politics, Lee's vote against
granting Bush carte blanche in the country's war on worldwide terrorism
has probably rendered her more popular rather than less, just as it has
helped her emerge from the long shadow of her former boss, Ron Dellums, a
pillar of leftist activism and hero to the Mother Jones set, who
represented the 9th Congressional District for nearly three decades. Lee
worked with Dellums for more than a decade, ultimately becoming his
chief-of-staff, before successfully running for the state Assembly in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   "She's no longer 'the congresswoman who succeeded Ron Dellums,' " says
Halterman, who also worked as a top Dellums aide. "She's now the
congresswoman, period." That sentiment is echoed by Harris. "People who
might've said Barbara is wishy-washy or whatever they felt, now all of a
sudden had a reason to vote for her."</TE>
<TE>   Lee won the March primary with 85% of the vote. She faces Republican
challenger Jerald Udinsky in November, but the consensus among local
political consultants is that Udinsky is such a long shot in the
overwhelmingly Democratic district that the national Republican Party
probably won't waste its time or money on the race.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbency no doubt played a role in Lee's primary victory. In short
order she had locked up the endorsement of every local Democratic club,
including the club Greene had chaired before running for Congress. Money
was another factor. "Protest is something respected here," says Larry
Tramutola, an East Bay-based political consultant who has worked for Lee.
"Her protest vote enhanced her ability to raise money nationally, but it
wouldn't hurt her electorally." Entertainers Bonnie Raitt, Ossie Davis
and Bill Cosby contributed to Lee's campaign, and Sean Penn was the
special guest at a small fund-raiser held the night before the primary.
Lee had raised $438,000 as of mid-February, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, and that figure doesn't include the money she raised
at a swank fund-raiser the weekend before the primary. In contrast,
Greene claims to have raised less than $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, factors such as money and the anonymity of her opponent
didn't matter as much as what UC Berkeley's Cain calls the "extremely
liberal nature" of the district. To make his point, Cain tells of a study
of voting patterns he conducted in 1996. Not a single precinct in
Berkeley or Oakland gave a Republican a majority vote that year. Cain,
who has been studying local electoral politics for 26 years, can't help
but confess his surprise at the results of both his Berkeley-Oakland
study and the final tally in Lee's primary run. "You could say," he says,
with a disbelieving laugh, "that Berkeley and Oakland are a universe unto
itself."</TE>

<HD>Driving Vince Donnelly</HD>
<DH>My Father Was Dying. He Knew. I Knew. But There Was Time Enough for
One Final Trip to a Distant and Difficult Past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE DONNELLY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The valet at the Pittsburgh airport rental-car office brings around
our white Lincoln Continental and Vince Donnelly raises his eyebrow slyly
and says to me, "If I'm going to go, I'm going to go in style."</LD>
<LD>   A bit of subversive humor from my dad that I well appreciate. It helps
alleviate the shock of how he looks. Prior to this trip, I hadn't seen my
dad since I spent Christmas in Vail, Colo., where he and my mother had
moved several years ago. What a difference five months can make.</LD>
<LD>   During the holidays, Vince didn't look so bad for a guy who recently
had had a third of his pancreas cut out. I even dared to hope he was on
the mend. Then, a couple of days after Christmas, he asked if I wanted to
drive his new Cadillac STS down to the Eagle diner where we'd find the
best milkshakes in the county. The weather was warm for the Colorado high
country, the sky a saturated blue. It was not a day for bad news, and my
dad tried to deliver it as gently as possible.</LD>
<TE>   "The horses are out of the barn, Joe," Vince said as we gained speed
and lost altitude cruising down the valley. "I don't think they're going
back in. I can feel it. It's running wild."</TE>
<TE>   My dad went on to explain that the cancer he'd been diagnosed with the
previous summer had metastasized despite the drastic operation. His
CA19-9 markers (cancer activity in the blood) were climbing the charts.
He rattled off the meager survival statistics, the chemo protocols and
the grim prognosis. I stared out the diner's windows and told him he was
going to be fine. There had to be some exception to these rules, and I
was sure my dad would be that. After all, he'd lived his life being the
exception. Growing up in a household weighed down by poverty, alcoholism
and old-world Catholicism, he still managed to get out, get educated and
become a successful business owner. He had survived colon cancer twice in
his early 50s, and several years ago he'd brushed off prostate cancer as
if it were the flu. I'd been conditioned to expect him to walk out of
life's burning buildings.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, my mind wandered back to Los Angeles, where my own
trajectory away from the past had run out of turf. Vince had visited me
there recently and appreciated all of the things that we residents take
for granted--the light, the architecture, the action, the intelligence.
We talked about spending more time together in L.A. I thought better
times had arrived for my dad and me. We had both survived near-death
encounters with booze and the things that drive men crazy. He was lucky
to walk away from a drunken head-on collision with a truck. I was lucky
to have called a friend instead of pulling the trigger of the gun in my
mouth. We'd both gotten sober since and had even become optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Now this: the two of us in the rain at Pittsburgh International
Airport, loading three bags into the white Lincoln--one for my clothes,
one for my dad's, and one for the syringes, saline solutions,
antiseptics, enzymes, anxiety reducers and chemo pills that have become
my dad's constant traveling companions. Pittsburgh, the town where I more
or less grew up and where my dad's working life finally paid off, is the
first stop on our trip--a journey that will retrace our steps to
Syracuse, N.Y., where my family started.</TE>
<TE>   As I navigate the rain and slippery roads toward the city, I wonder
what the hell we're doing. The figure in the passenger seat is a
hollowed-out version of my dad that is alien to me. His jokes help remind
me that it's still him and that he is still alive. The white Lincoln
radiates against the black skies and brown buildings of the city. I'm
glad my dad chose white. It's heavenly.</TE>
<TE>   just a year before, my dad could bench press 200 pounds, leg press 500
and swim, hike and ski laps around athletes half his age. At 68, Vince
Donnelly was in the middle of an astonishing physical renaissance when
the cancer in his pancreas erupted.</TE>
<TE>   His strength had helped him survive an operation at Johns Hopkins to
remove a large chunk of his pancreas. Soon after, though, tests showed
cancer in nearby lymph nodes. Opinions varied on whether my dad was
treatable. The operating surgeon suggested that he just go home and live
his life as best as possible, not concern himself with things such as
CA19-9 markers, CAT scans, chemotherapy and all of the other ways people
try to corner and kill the beast. It was the doctor's way of saying that
fighting probably was a waste of energy. But fighting is in my dad's
blood. I didn't expect him to stop now just because cancer was in there
too.</TE>
<TE>   The following spring, my dad's hopes for survival took a severe blow.
PET scans ordered by my father's oncologist in Vail showed cancer
spreading throughout his upper spine and sternum. The images also
indicated increased metastasis in his liver and near his kidney. The Vail
oncologist told him he could reasonably expect to live four more months.</TE>
<TE>   That's when my dad called and suggested this road trip through his
past. The impulse surprised me. Although the Irish are given to singing
weepy pub songs about heroic near-misses and might-have-beens, my dad was
never the sentimental type. Vince justified the trip by saying he had
business in Pittsburgh and wanted to "check out a few things relating to
family history" in Syracuse. His voice told me there was something more
to it, but I wasn't sure what. Maybe he needed to go back to own what he
did, to see how far he'd come before he died. Maybe he needed to know
he'd done enough, because even in these sober, looser, happier years of
late, my dad still at times felt as if he should have earned more, done
more, been more. That notion seemed preposterous to me, and my secret
fear always had been that I could never live up to his legacy, that the
deep ruts of his giant footsteps would swallow me.</TE>
<TE>   I agreed to drive him. Truthfully, though, I was nervous. I was 38,
sober and alive but still dogged by self-doubt and not sure what I was
doing with my life. Was I ready for this type of reckoning? God forgive
me for thinking it, but my dad, facing death, could at least go back to
where we came from as a conquering hero. What was I?</TE>
<TE>   I told my dad we should call the trip "The Farewell Tour." He laughed
and suggested we print T-shirts with a hot rod hearse on the front and
the names and dates of the tour stops on the back.</TE>
<TE>   a valet hails my dad like a close relative when we pull up to his
beloved Duquesne Club, where he stays when he's in Pittsburgh for
business. These places are the pinnacle of the social and business
hierarchy of last-century towns such as Pittsburgh. In the past I'd
looked down my nose at Duquesne Club anachronisms, such as having to wear
a coat and tie to dinner and the old, gold-framed artwork depicting fox
hunts, steel mills, coal barges and other bygone local customs. To me,
the club was the kind of place where the Addams Family would be happy to
room and board.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, I can't help but draw parallels between the club
and my father. The club is irrelevant and fading. My father is fading and
becoming irrelevant. Nature knows when you're dying and the world
politely moves on long before you're gone from it. Watching this happen
to my dad hurts. The club no longer amuses me. It makes me uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after arriving, Vince slips a previously undisclosed mission into
the agenda of meetings with lawyers, accountants and insurance people
(death actually requires more precise planning than life). My dad is fond
of an upbeat oncologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
If the four horsemen of the apocalypse appeared on the horizon, Michael
Wong would say they were dressed nicely. Vince is attracted to Dr. Wong's
positive outlook and wants him to provide a second opinion of the Vail
oncologist's disheartening interpretation of the PET scans. I know a
second opinion is ultimately meaningless, but I go along with the plan
until I, too, get caught up in my father's hope that the lesions are
actually arthritic football injuries that had been pestering him for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Wong meets us and tells Vince things that fall gently on his ears,
including that blood markers are often unreliable and PET scans are far
from the industry-standard imaging technique. Wong says he will compare
the CAT and PET scans and give us his assessment when we return from
Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting buoys my dad. We're back on the initiative! That evening,
we go down to the club's dim and mostly vacant dining room and order the
heart-lover's choice--pork loin and scalloped potatoes. Just to make sure
things don't get too healthy, my dad orders chocolate cake and vanilla
ice cream for dessert. Twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to keep my weight up," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, this cancer [stuff's] not all bad," I offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not all of it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the joke, it's clear to me that Vince really is desperate to
keep his weight up. I can see he is terrified and desperately scrapping
to hold on to whatever life remains. I can't stomach the fight anymore.
He's getting mauled. I don't want to see the champ getting pummeled while
everyone's heart breaks--as when Ali fought Larry Holmes. I just want him
to die gracefully. With his every forkful of cake and ice cream I want to
scream, "It's over! You're dying right here in front of me! Stop chasing
false hope! Stop nuking yourself with chemo! Give up!"</TE>
<TE>   I don't say a thing, because my dad wants to live and what can you say
to that?</TE>
<TE>   After his pancreas operation, I started hugging my dad--big,
uncomfortable, loving hugs. This hugging thing was new for him. All of
his life he could joke, he could pat a back, but he couldn't put his
affection into a messy embrace. I also began to stroke his hair, to hold
his face, to kiss him five times in a row. To his surprise, he liked it.
He started asking for it. This cancer had opened up a new world of
physical affection between us that didn't previously exist. I wondered
what might have been different if we'd lived our lives like this.</TE>
<TE>   Saying good night after dinner, Vince turns in his doorway and says,
"Joe, come in here and wrap me up in your big, strong arms. I'll never
forget how you held me in the hospital like I was a little baby." He
cries and cries as I hold on and hold back my own tears. He's just skin
and bones.</TE>
<TE>   it's hard to think of anything to look forward to in syracuse. i was
born there, but all I know of it are my dad's memories--of pulling my
grandfather out of bars when he'd gone missing for days, of fighting with
his father when he tried to "get at" my grandmother during a bad drunk.
One story still haunts--the time my grandfather lined up my dad and his
younger siblings with a shotgun and drunkenly threatened to blow their
heads off. Vince talked the gun out of his father's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Vince told these stories without bitterness. Things were just the way
they were. At least through Vince's stories my grandfather was a real
figure to me, not always horrifying, sometimes even funny and warm. I
knew my grandfather loved to fish and dance, was faster with a quip than
you were, that he worked hard and had a terrible chip on his shoulder. I
knew that my dad's ultimately sobering head-on collision was an eerie and
fortunate echo of an accident in which my intoxicated grandfather once
killed someone.</TE>
<TE>   I also knew that before he died my grandfather had sought and received
forgiveness from my dad, because, despite everything, Vince always hung
the moon for him. But I knew almost nothing about my grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   What little information I had painted a vague picture of a bent-knee
Catholic, praying for deliverance from poverty and regret, who lived on
the edge of severe depression. The nature of that depression was shrouded
in mystery. She kept my father at a chilly distance even though he was
often thrown into the role of protecting her against her drunken husband.
My dad could never quite explain this except to say, "She lived with a
lot of disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   We drive north from Pittsburgh in a barrage of cold rain relieved by
frequent stops for coffee, doughnuts and ice cream sandwiches. When we
finally skate into downtown Syracuse, the afternoon sun appears briefly
and barely. I ask my dad if he thinks it's somehow symbolic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably happy to see me return to the scene of my many crimes,"
Vince jokes.</TE>
<TE>   We park across the street from the little house on Teal Avenue where
Vince grew up. He stares at it and tells a story about the woman who
lived upstairs and sewed him a winter coat from the remnants of his
father's overcoat. Vince laughs about how bad it looked. I suggest that
he stand in front of the house for a photo. He does so without
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   During the next couple of days we drive by my father's old haunts,
rarely braving the miserable weather to get out of the Lincoln. Vince
provides a constant soundtrack about friends, family and history. We stop
at the grim tenement where I was born. My dad seems embarrassed. I ask
what the complex is called.</TE>
<TE>   "The slums," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse unfolds as a black-and-gray ghost town. I'd be surprised if
there's a less attractive place in America. We cover the same ground
again and again. It's clear that Vince is searching for something, some
place or meaning that is eluding us. I want to go home to Los Angeles,
return to the sun. This place spooks me, and I know it's because I can
still feel it in me, like the chilling memory of a close call.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually we turn onto a shoddy thoroughfare that lights a flame in
Vince's eyes. We park and walk. He's found the route along which he used
to escort his mother to work at Woolworth. The store is gone, but Vince
sees what he's been looking for. It's a small shop in a tidy Victorian
set back from the street. It sells tombstones and once had one for sale
with a lamb etched on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd walk by the monument place every day because she worked up here,
and we'd see that little lamb. How many times she must have looked at
that stone," Vince says, his eyes going past the shop. "It probably cost
fifty bucks. Fifty bucks to buy the stone with the lamb on it for the
baby she thought she had killed."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of the strange shop, Vince explains the terrible
nature of the baby's death, which he had only recently learned from his
sister. The baby was his older brother, "Baby Paul," who died just months
before Vince was born. Apparently his mother had given Paul a can of
talcum powder to play with that she thought was empty. Somehow the baby
got the top open and, his mother believed, some powder got in Paul's
lungs and killed him. She carried that secret guilt her whole life until
she told Vince's sister while on her deathbed.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother, you know, she had that tragedy with her first child. I
can't imagine what it was like. She loses a child in March and she has a
second one in August," Vince says. "How she could transfer any immediate
love and care to that second child was beyond me--that child being me."</TE>
<TE>   Only then do I realize what Vince has been looking for. It wasn't the
memories of his childhood, the ghost of his father or the sled he rode in
the winter. He was really looking for the tiny footprints of the older
brother he never knew--forever just "Baby Paul" to him, and forever more
an explanation for his mother's lost embrace.</TE>
<TE>   on the day before we leave syracuse, the sun shines. Vince and I go to
brunch at one of those old-style inns that are landmarks of the
aristocratic Village of Skaneateles on Skaneateles Lake, about 20 minutes
from Syracuse. The drive takes us past the cemetery where his parents and
ancestors are buried.</TE>
<TE>   The inn delivers mediocre food onto white tablecloths with an air of
old-world gentility. Vince says little at breakfast. Something's brewing.
Driving back, he suggests we stop and visit the cemetery, and I guess
this has been the reason for his silence. The closer we get to the
cemetery, the darker the skies grow, the stronger the wind howls. By the
time we reach the gates, it is lightning and hailing. It's as if the gods
have been warning us away for days and now are indignant at our
persistence. I agree with them. What does any of this matter anymore?</TE>
<TE>   I ask my dad if he thinks it's a coincidence that golf ball-size hail
is bombarding us as we approach his family grave site. "I doubt it," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The family plot is on a little knoll. I can barely make it out through
the rain-soaked windows. The stones are dark silhouettes lit by
lightning, as if from a horror movie. My dad rolls down his window and
looks out.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you about my mother wanting the stone with the lamb on it, but
she could never afford it. She felt bad about it. I don't know when I did
it--a number of years ago--I got a stone with a lamb on it that said
'Paul' and put it in the ground. A flat one with a lamb on it," Vince
says. "As soon as I pull away, we'll probably be the last family to ever
go look in on it."</TE>
<TE>   I realize he's right; I will probably never return here. I won't have
to, though, because my dad has taken me all the way in. There is nothing
left unsaid or undone between us. No ghosts to haunt my memories. I won't
come back, but I will carry all of this with me wherever I go, even back
to bright Los Angeles. It's part of who I am and who I always have
been--my father's son, and for that I am grateful.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Pittsburgh the news is bad. After reviewing the scans, Dr.
Wong confirms the dire forecast of my dad's oncologist in Vail. "At least
we know what we're up against," Vince says.</TE>
<TE>   My dad died six months later, surpassing expectations by eight weeks,
breaking everyone's heart in the process. I keep a vial with some of his
ashes at home. Now and then I look in the container and think about the
mystery of life, and how something so complex can come down to something
so simple.</TE>

<HD>A Myth Maker's Clarification</HD>
<DH>The Oft-Told Hollywood Story of Alexander Pantages' Scandalous 1929
Rape Case Had Everything--Sex, Celebrity, Money, Power, Political
Intrigue. Most of It Was Even True.</DH>

<LD>Do you not know how famous your mother became when she was young?"</LD>
<LD>   This was the second mysterious communication that Marcy Worthington
had received from Paul Dickman, an aspiring writer from Chicago. Dickman
had been puzzled when he couldn't find a death certificate for Eunice
Pringle, a figure in a book project he was researching. Worthington, a
48-year-old Southern California commercial photographer and instructor at
the San Diego Police Department academy, had been skeptical of Dickman's
earlier note. But this letter, dated Nov. 26, 2000, blew open a family
secret that Worthington had never known:</LD>
<LD>   When her good-humored, nearsighted mother--Eunice Pringle--was a
teenager, she had been at the center of a great American sex scandal.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew she'd danced in Los Angeles," Worthington says of her late
mother. "When I asked why she'd stopped, she always said, 'Dancing was
too corrupt.' "</TE>
<TE>   Worthington recalled that when she was 12 years old, her father, a
psychologist, told her in confidence that her mother had once been raped
by a producer, but he offered no details. Worthington decided then that
her father was only trying to discourage her own ambition to become a
singer.</TE>
<TE>   Dickman's second letter, however, explained more about Pringle, who
had been the most publicity-shy of their La Jolla and Point Loma social
set when Marcy Worthington was growing up. And then, in a phone call to
Dickman, Worthington learned her mother had been front-page news in 1929
for millions of Americans, a pretty young dancer whose rape charge would
bring down one of the most flamboyant impresarios in Hollywood, Alexander
Pantages. Dickman also told Pringle's stunned daughter that nearly all
accounts of her mother's experience got the most intriguing aspect of the
story wrong. One of those accounts, it turns out, was my own.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, Alexander Pantages--who got his start entertaining Alaskan
gold miners--was running a chain of vaudeville and movie palaces from
offices above his ornate theater at 7th and Hill streets in downtown Los
Angeles. On Aug. 9, Eunice Pringle, a 17-year-old performer from Garden
Grove, had her fourth appointment with Pantages. Pringle, a former USC
student, had been lobbying Pantages since May to book her one-act musical
sketch.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting didn't go well, and it ended with Pringle, her clothing in
disarray, running out of Pantages' office screaming, "The beast!" Pringle
told police that Pantages had raped her. Pantages denied it and said he
was being framed. He was arrested and bound over for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Public sentiment, and the press, strongly sided with Pringle, not the
wealthy Greek immigrant entrepreneur. Pringle was described in one
newspaper as "the sweetest 17 since Clara Bow." Pantages was a
less-attractive figure, growling out his denials in broken English at a
time when the public equated the entertainment industry with debauchery.</TE>
<TE>   The Pantages trial was daily front-page news. For her first round of
testimony, Pringle appeared in court in a conservative outfit, flat "Mary
Jane" shoes and with her hair tied back in a bow and ponytail. Jerry
Giesler, a member of Pantages' defense team, had the judge order Pringle
to appear for her second day as she had in Pantages' office--in makeup, a
red sleeveless dress and high heels. Giesler also tried to argue that
Pringle and the author of her sketch, an older man whom Giesler termed a
Russian playboy, were lovers and that Pringle wasn't the innocent she
pretended to be.</TE>
<TE>   The judge disallowed that argument, ruling that Pringle's character
didn't matter since Pantages could still be guilty of statutory rape
based solely on her age. Pantages was convicted and sentenced to 50 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the California Supreme Court granted Giesler's appeal
for a new trial based on his argument that the alleged rape victim's
moral and personal history was pertinent, even if she was underage.
Giesler also had disputed the prosecution's claim that the elderly,
slight Pantages could have forcibly held down and raped a young woman who
was so athletic that she could perform splits and back flips. Chief
Justice William Waste declared Pringle's testimony "improbable."</TE>
<TE>   At the second trial, Giesler was able to focus on Pringle's past,
portraying her as worldly and certainly no virgin. He told jurors that
she and her manager, the Russian, had threatened Pantages if he wouldn't
sign her act. Giesler also alluded to a larger conspiracy involving
"higher powers."</TE>
<TE>   Pantages was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   In most later stories about the case, those mysterious "higher powers"
were identified as former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Buron Fitts and
Joseph P. Kennedy--father of the future U.S. president and a Pantages
rival in the theater business. In those reports, Eunice Pringle died of a
suspicious illness shortly after the trial, in 1933; some suspected
poison. And in an alleged deathbed confession, Pringle was said to have
revealed that, with the connivance of Fitts, Kennedy had bribed her with
money and promised her a movie career if she would stage the rape.</TE>
<TE>   The deathbed confession seems to first appear in avant-garde filmmaker
Kenneth Anger's "Hollywood Babylon II" (Dutton, 1984). "Kennedy had hoped
to destroy Pantages," Anger wrote, "and in the process gobble up the
Pantages theater circuit." Anger described Pringle as a "shopworn angel."</TE>
<TE>   A convincingly detailed report along the same lines, "Showstopper,"
written by early-Hollywood film historian Andy Edmonds, appeared in Los
Angeles magazine in 1989. These accounts became important sources for
other writers.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He
Founded" (Warner, 1996), based in large part on the Anger and Edmonds
accounts, Ronald Kessler describes how Pringle "died of unknown causes.
The night she died, she was violently ill and red in color, a sign of
cyanide poisoning."</TE>
<TE>   In their book "Fallen Angels: Chronicles of L.A. Crime and Mystery"
(Facts on File, 1986), writers Marvin J. Wolf and Katherine Mader summed
up Pringle's supposed deathbed declaration with, "It had all been Joe
Kennedy's idea. He wanted to destroy Pantages . . . promising that when
he controlled the Pantages theaters, she would be his star performer."</TE>
<TE>   My own version, alas, in "For the People: Inside the Los Angeles
County District Attorney's Office 1850-2000" (Angel City Press, 2001),
depended largely upon all of the above sources, particularly the in-depth
Los Angeles magazine account. From that, in my retelling, Pringle
"reportedly" told her mother and a friend on her deathbed that she set up
Pantages for the promise of $10,000 and a movie part.</TE>
<TE>   I did have the good sense,</TE>
<TE>   or luck, to leave out the rumors of poisoning, since speculation based
on a suspiciously flushed face seemed a particularly thin reed.</TE>
<TE>   But we were all wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Marcy Worthington knew this as soon as she talked with Dickman, the
inquiring Chicago writer.  As proof, she dug up her mother's 1996 death
certificate--in the name of Eunice Irene Worthington, nee Pringle. It
described how she died of natural causes in a San Diego County hospital
at age 84. For Worthington, this turned the case on its head.</TE>
<TE>   As for us ink-stained wretches, we're willing to admit that no
deathbed confession took place. Still, it's possible that many other
elements of the story are true. Even if the "confession" story was a
fabricated incident--a counterattack by Pantages, for example-- the
Kennedy conspiracy story could still be true. And Pringle? She could have
just slipped away. In an era before information technology, it was easier
for even the notorious to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "I researched it carefully," Anger maintains, though the story "needs
to be corrected if [the death certificate] could be verified." Anger says
he's collected Hollywood tales since his student days at Beverly Hills
High School, where he compared notes with friends, many of whom were from
entertainment-world families. "We were all passionate about these old
stories," he recalls. "We were sort of a Hollywood scandal club."</TE>
<TE>   Anger says he doesn't remember where he heard of Pringle's deathbed
scene. In any case, he notes, "she may have confessed, but it wasn't on
the deathbed. It seemed more like a Joe Kennedy setup."</TE>
<TE>   Could the "deathbed confession" have been spun from the Pantages camp?
"There are a lot of myths and legends about shenanigans in this town,"
says Marvin Wolf. "I'm not terribly surprised to find out that this might
have happened. It's the sort of thing that a guy like Pantages would have
known to do. I mean, let's face it. He was no sweetheart."</TE>
<TE>   "I relied on previous material that I footnoted in my book," says
Kessler. "That far back, what else are you going to do?" He adds: "I'm
not terribly shocked when it comes to these old stories. It's easy for
them to get out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Marcy Worthington--on a mission to clear her mother's
name--has been sifting through boxes of her mother's letters, photographs
and documents and searching through newspaper archives. Her mother, says
Worthington, simply regained her private life by returning to school in
Garden Grove to learn to type, take shorthand and become an executive
secretary. She married, changed her first name to Toni and quietly kept
her old name out of the newspapers after moving to San Diego. But she
also had friends and went to the ballet and theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced she was raped," says Worthington. And far from being a
"shopworn angel," as Anger phrased it, her mother was valedictorian of
her high school class and a practicing Christian Scientist. The Russian
manager was never her lover. The tone of his numerous letters to Pringle
and other family members for many years afterward, says Worthington,
showed him to be no more than a friend and mentor. As to the famous red
dress, Worthington says, "it wasn't short, low-cut or tight, but it was
sleeveless."</TE>
<TE>   Worthington is attempting an even more difficult feat--to clear Joseph
Kennedy's reputation in the saga. She's convinced her mother was not
involved in a conspiracy with Kennedy and Fitts to attack Pantages even
though, after the scandal subsided, Kennedy bought several Pantages
properties at fire-sale prices. And, of course, Marcy Worthington is
currently writing a book and contemplating a screenplay to correct her
mother's story.</TE>

<HD>Family Heirlooms</HD>
<DH>A Hancock Park Gardener Grows Tomatoes From Seeds Passed Down Since
the 1800s</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Round, ripe and ruby-red, the 'Goosecreek' tomato rolls across
Jimmy Williams' palm like a family jewel--which, in a way, it is. His
great-great grandmother, a Caribbean slave, had its seeds in her pocket
when her ship docked in Goose Creek, S. Carolina, near Charleston. There,
in the early 1800s, she planted her smuggled tomatoes, saved more seeds
and saw that they were handed down to future generations. They reached
Williams during the 1960s via his grandmother Elouise, who taught him to
make germination trays from cast-off dresser drawers, dividing them into
small compartments and choosing the best seedlings to grow into plants.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years--moving from Long Island, where he grew up, to New York
City, where he designed sportswear, to L.A., where he married, had
children and got back to his gardening roots--Williams kept some
'Goosecreek' seeds, finally planting them behind the Hancock Park house
that he and his former wife, Annette Elmo, bought in 1989. Before long,
the thrill of working the earth, which he had discovered at age 9, seized
him again, and he was breaking up concrete, hauling horse manure and
building beds for tree-collard greens, Brussels sprouts and, of course,
tomatoes.</LD>
<TE>   And wouldn't you know, as he developed a compost tea to feed his
plants and expanded the mix of heirloom seeds he acquired from other
grower-collectors, that neighbors and friends were soon clamoring for his
exotic striped zucchini, rainbow peppers and Sequoia purple beans. One
New York friend, Sandy Head, suggested he start a business and offered to
help compile his catalog. In 1999, the first HayGround Organic Gardening
list appeared, offering mail-order seedlings of rare and heirloom
edibles.</TE>
<TE>   Why seedlings and not seeds, which are faster to produce and far
easier to ship?</TE>
<TE>   This question must have plagued Williams during his first two years,
when, desperate for germination space, he tended thousands of seedlings
on the roof of his garage. Even now, still using that roof, but with
commercial growers in Sun Valley and Camarillo to help fill orders, his
response is still the same: "The Number One garden failure is the failure
of seeds to sprout. And if you start with plants, you can cut growing
time by a month or more."</TE>
<TE>   To hear him talk, it's clear that Williams regards coaxing people to
raise food as part of his personal and professional mission. "Something
happens when you plant, tend, harvest and consume your own food," he
says. "Eighty years ago in this country, this was common. Seeds passed
from neighbor to neighbor. It's time we got back to that."</TE>
<TE>   Heirloom selections, those preserved for their superior taste, looks
and growing vigor, Williams says, often far outshine those sold in
stores, which are prized for shelf life and durability during shipping.
And, of course, heirlooms are charming novelties. As Williams put it,
"Why buy what you can grow?"</TE>
<TE>   His clients, who live all around the U.S. and range from patio
hobbyists to small farmers, agree. Since 1999, his sales have quadrupled,
and he has even begun designing gardens for those with limited time or
expertise to weave plants into landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   He tests what he sells and practices what he preaches in his own
garden, which is little more than a 20-by-20-foot arrangement of raised
beds stuffed to the gills with leafy wonders. Here tomatoes crawl up
wires against a sunny wall, zucchini snakes along the ground and
eggplants swell like balloons under the bleached gaze of Rufus, a
tattered scarecrow. "I'm constantly changing things," Williams says.
"Rotating crops, trying different selections, seeing what works."</TE>
<TE>   One winning combination is his "compost tea," garden waste steeped
with water in a bucket and then strained, the liquid sprayed on leaves to
boost growth and repel bugs. Also good is top-dressing the soil with
compost, which adds micronutrients and draws aerating, earth-enriching
worms. "In the tightest spaces, you can raise huge amounts of food, if
you do it right," Williams observes, adding that children (particularly
his own: Porter, 14, and Logan, 16) are well-disposed toward vegetables
grown in their own backyard.</TE>
<TE>   This includes the 'Goosecreek' tomato. Some day, Williams knows it
will be time to pass it on.</TE>

<DH>Fava Beans Can Be Difficult to Cook, but the Payoff Is Worth the
Effort</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYNN CARRENO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plastic bag of big, tough-skinned and--by all accounts--ugly
green pods sat on the kitchen counter for a week before I had the courage
to look at them, much less cook them. I'd bought the fava beans at the
Santa Monica farmers' market simply because they were there. I had
noticed chefs clamoring over them, and I wanted to see what the fuss was
about.</LD>
<LD>   Truthfully, I was afraid of the beans. I'd ventured cooking favas once
before. Two summers ago, I tossed some fava beans with quartered new
potatoes, roasted corn, bits of bacon and snips of chives and parsley in
what would have been a divine salad except for the fact that I didn't
know that--after spending the better part of a morning prying the
thumbnail-size beans from where they lie snugly inside their padded
pods--I was then supposed to relieve them of their thick white outer
skins. In essence, leaving the outer skin on a fava bean (unless it's a
very sweet, young thing) is tantamount to leaving the peel on an orange.
Not going to kill you--but doesn't exactly enhance the experience of
eating an orange.</LD>
<TE>   Fava beans, also called broad beans (which you find dried and in bags
in this country), are pretty rare in Southern California. However, in
certain parts of the world such as the Mediterranean, they're fairly
common. Even so, I'm not the only one who's had a hard time facing favas.
In fact, fava beans have a long history of dread--or, rather, of being
dreaded. The ancient Egyptians regarded fava beans as unclean. Followers
of Pythagoras were forbidden to eat them. According to the Greek writer
Herodotus, priests refused to look at them. And all over Europe beans are
associated with the dead and are served at funerals.</TE>
<TE>   And so I pressed on. But by the time I had the courage to make
something of my fava beans, those first pods had lost their vigor. So I
chucked those, headed back to the market, bought another bag and, before
I had time to think about what I was or wasn't going to do with them, put
a pot of water on the stove to boil. After blanching batch after batch of
the legumes until they were bright and tender, I found that under their
tough exterior, favas weren't as strange or as hard to get to know as I'd
imagined. They're the same size as lima beans, with the texture and
flavor of green peas, though not as sweet.</TE>
<TE>   And it turns out that they're very versatile. You can throw them in
just about any dish, within reason. I particularly like their earthy
flavor combined with fresh mint and green onions. I used them in a
risotto, made a simple salad of fava beans with prosciutto and mint and
finally tried them once again--despite my initial failure--in a potato
salad, which was quite good.</TE>
<TE>   I see why chefs like fava beans so much. But I see why it's mostly
chefs (with their army of prep cooks) who cook with them; the labor
involved can be prohibitive. Which isn't to say they aren't worth the
time. I suppose it's a matter of taste.</TE>
<TE>Risotto with Fava Beans</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4-6 as a main course</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from "The Food of Campanile,"</TE>
<TE>   by Mark Peel, Nancy Silverton and Ian Smith  (Villard Books, 1997)</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds fresh shelled fava beans</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 medium Maui or other sweet onion, peeled and finely diced</TE>
<TE>   1 pound (about 2 cups) arborio rice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   Kosher salt</TE>
<TE>   1 large garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   6 1/4 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock, simmering</TE>
<TE>   1/2 stick unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</TE>
<TE>   In a large stockpot, bring 2 quarts of water with 2 tablespoons kosher
salt to a boil. Blanch the fava beans in a stainless steel mesh strainer
in the boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove the strainer from the
stock-pot and plunge it into a bowl filled with ice water for about 30
seconds. Allow strainer to drain. Using your fingers, remove the peel of
the fava beans by pinching off the end opposite the growing tip and
squeezing the bean out of the skin.</TE>
<TE>   Saute the diced onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until translucent
but still crunchy, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining olive oil and warm
it over medium heat. Add the rice, stirring with a wooden spoon to coat
the rice with the oil. Cook the rice, stirring continuously for about 5
minutes. When the rice turns opaque, reduce the heat to medium low and
add the white wine and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring slowly but
constantly, until the wine is almost absorbed and the risotto appears
creamy. Stir in the garlic and 1 cup of the simmering stock and cook
until the stock is almost absorbed. Continue to add the stock, 1/2 cup at
a time, stirring continuously, until 1 1/4 cups stock remain. Dump in the
fava beans and pour in 3/4 cup more stock and stir until that has been
absorbed. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the remaining stock.
The rice should be firm but not hard. Add the butter and
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and stir, off the heat, for about a minute
longer before serving.</TE>

<HD>A Different Take</HD>
<DH>The Fourth Remake of a Handsome Santa Monica Space Could Be the One
With Staying Power</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The space at 1413 5th Street is one of the best-looking in all of
Santa Monica, or the whole L.A. area for that matter, yet no restaurant
has been able to make a go of it for long.</LD>
<LD>   Did anybody ever try good food?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, John Sedlar--twice. The provocative chef spent extravagantly to
create the innovative, upscale Bikini, only to close as a result of
setbacks from the Northridge earthquake in 1994. He came back with the
more moderately priced Abiquiu. It only lasted a year or so, but I'm
still dreaming about his sweet corn souffle. Brilliant chef, impractical
businessman.</LD>
<TE>   Entrepreneur Will Karges then put his stamp on the site, envisioning
the Rat Pack revisited. Steaks and martinis and limos full of babes drew
an aggressive young crowd, but the constant backbeat of live music on the
rooftop patio riled the neighbors. Rix, too, did not last. Once the buzz
wore off, the trend-seekers sped on to the next new thing.</TE>
<TE>   Now Jeff Peterson, who also owns Geoffrey's in Malibu, has given the
handsome space a slightly new look. At the new all-American Union
Restaurant and Bar, the tall, double-story windows are framed by formal
pleated drapes, and a new water feature, a steel sculpture, hovers
overhead, water coursing down the sides of its metal wings. It's
interesting to note that Union's remodeling cost was just slightly more
than the Derek Orr water sculpture originally installed for Bikini.
Sedlar had built a second full kitchen on the second floor to serve
diners there, but Peterson has removed some of the upstairs tables and
created a lounge area to make the restaurant more intimate.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly five months the restaurant has been open, life at the
upstairs bar, which opens out on the rooftop patio, has gradually picked
up. But manager Chuck Craig, former maitre d' at Spago, doesn't want to
emphasize the bar scene, which includes a mesmerizing aquarium populated
with junior jellyfish. The plan is to make Union known more as a
restaurant, and it has a supper club feel. Cool jazz recordings--Stan
Getz, Diana Krall, Shirley Horn and John Coltrane--play in the
background. Yet the noise level is low enough that diners can easily
converse.</TE>
<TE>   Union's chef is James Grey, one of the best cooks to go through the
revolving door of Les Deux Cafes in Hollywood. His instincts there were
in the right place--great ingredients, simple French cooking--but his
abilities didn't always equal his ambitions. Here he's cooking American
and, for the most part, doing a good job of it.</TE>
<TE>   As a starter, there's a delightful corn chowder that tastes of sweet
corn and Yukon gold potatoes, with an occasional nugget of littleneck
clam. A smooth butternut squash puree is more than just another innocuous
vegetable puree. A pretty butter lettuce salad is showered with shallots
and tarragon--and a sharp dose of red wine vinegar. Baby back ribs,
listed as an appetizer, are covered in a smoky, subtly hot sauce as thick
as chocolate. Santa Barbara mussels steamed with white wine and shallots
revel in a swirl of cream, though sometimes these local mollusks can have
a strong, funky flavor. Grey gives shrimp cocktail a Southwestern spin
with a cocktail sauce that includes lime, cilantro and avocado.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the highlights. An interesting-sounding blue cheese tart
with caramelized onions misses entirely in terms of texture and flavor. A
ruddy shrimp bisque, while technically difficult to make, tastes more of
roasted shrimp and tomatoes than shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   I'm pleased to see trout on the menu but wish it were served whole.
Dusted in cornmeal and sauteed in oil, the delicate freshwater fish is
crisp and golden, strewn with toasted hazelnuts. I like his moist
Atlantic blackened salmon on a bed of Southern-style greens, too. One
night a filet of rosy coral char is snuggled into a creamy brandade
surrounded by a fresh pea sauce dotted with fava beans and green peas the
size of freshwater pearls. It's the essence of spring.</TE>
<TE>   You can't go wrong with the rack of lamb, although medium rare seems
to mean rare in this kitchen. It's served with a plucky parsnip puree, a
fine gratin of potatoes and a honey lavender jus that tastes very little
of lavender. A remarkably thick grilled pork chop, a special, is cooked
to a juicy pink, but no Southerner will recognize the wrongheaded "dirty"
rice, which is more rice with a meat reduction and nubs of pork. Short
ribs, that newly popular item around town, are disappointing. Somehow all
the flavor has been leached out of the beef in the braising.</TE>
<TE>   As any Santa Monica chef worth his mettle, Grey shops the farmers
market there, bringing back fresh greens, root vegetables such as parsnip
or rutabaga, and the much- maligned Brussels sprouts, which he cooks with
applewood smoked bacon. Those short ribs, for example, are garnished not
only with baby carrots but also red and gold beets--and purple Peruvian
potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   One of Grey's projects at Union is an American farmstead cheese
course. He's smart about not offering too many choices, just half a dozen
favorites, which change according to season and availability. Right now,
they range from a soft-ripened sheep's milk cheese from Old Chatham
Sheepherding Co. in New York's Hudson Valley to a special dry Jack aged
for more than a year from Vella Farms in Sonoma. He lets the cheeses
quietly star, with the help of sweet little handmade crackers by pastry
chef Natasha MacAller. It's too bad the wine list isn't half as
interesting as the cheese selection.</TE>
<TE>   MacAller is doing some wonderful work in the upstairs kitchen. There's
an amazing butterscotch pudding with softly whipped unsweetened cream to
make the pudding taste all the richer. Here cake does a rare star turn on
the dessert menu. Her heavenly angel food cake is served simply with
whipped cream and a pool of black-purple berry coulis. Her brown butter
tart made with greengage plums is no slouch either, but the ice cream
sandwich of cherries layered with pound cake is a bit of a gooey mess.</TE>
<TE>   Union has a strategy: Move slowly, build up the kitchen and the staff
and concentrate on the dining before focusing on the crowds and the club
scene. It's not there yet, but with some nurturing, maybe this will be
the one to stay around awhile.</TE>

<HD>In Asia, Taking to the Road Means Taking Risks</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Anarchy rules the road in Far East, where
motorists take chances and, at times, pay the ultimate price as they
flaunt laws while zipping from Point A to Point B.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL LOVERING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Motorcycle taxi driver Prithan Vamy steers within inches of a bus'
huge wheels as he zips around the lumbering vehicle, cuts into
another lane ahead of a startled pickup driver and makes it through
the intersection as the light turns red.</LD>
<LD>   Motorcycles and the three-wheeled taxis known as tuk-tuks are fast
and cheap ways to get around on the traffic-clogged streets of
Bangkok and other Asian cities. Prithan asks for just 20 baht--45
cents--when he drops off his quivering passenger at the curb.</LD>
<LD>   Drivers must take risks to make money, says Prithan, 38. "A lot
have accidents and get hurt, but not me," he boasts.</LD>
<TE>   This cavalier attitude is common in a region that accounts for
nearly half the world's road deaths every year.</TE>
<TE>   From Bombay to Jakarta, traffic safety is ignored. Small children
ride precariously on motorbikes along with live chickens and
vegetables. Roads are dangerously shoddy. Passengers dangle from
packed buses that belch choking black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   In slums and rural areas, riders crowd onto open trucks that serve
as buses. A few weeks ago, a truck carrying a wedding party of 100
collided head-on with another truck in southeastern India, killing at
least 30 people, including the bride and groom. More than 60 people
were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of Asia has long lagged behind the industrialized
world in motorized transport, the numbers of cars, trucks, buses and
motorbikes on its roads have skyrocketed since the 1980s as part of
the dramatic rise in living standards and economic growth. But
transportation experts say driving skills and law enforcement trail
far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nearly 900,000 people killed in road accidents worldwide in
1999, 44% were in Asia and less than 14% were in industrialized
countries, according to research firm Global Road Safety Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "The scale of the problem is bad in Asia," David Silcock, head of
the Geneva-based company, said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "You will mostly find that it's human factor" to blame, he said,
citing careless driving and a lack of protective gear such as seat
belts and helmets.</TE>
<TE>   China has the world's highest overall road accident rate, despite
a relatively low ratio of motor vehicles, the World Bank says. About
83,500 people were killed in more than 400,000 accidents in 1999, a
7% increase in deaths and a 19% increase in accidents over 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing drivers weave across lanes, pass on the inside and drive
fender-to-fender at high speeds. On rural roads, bicyclists turn
without looking to check for approaching cars. Driver's licenses can
be bought illegally--skirting the need for a test--for about $250.</TE>
<TE>   In graft-ridden Indonesia, traffic police are derided as being
among its most corrupt officials. Licenses can be purchased for a
small bribe.</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam, traffic fatalities rose to a record 10,548 last year.
Two million new vehicles, most of them motorbikes, were registered in
2001, a 29% jump in a year, to give Vietnam more than 8 million
motorbikes and 550,000 cars, trucks and buses.</TE>
<TE>   Other countries with high fatality rates include India, where the
Asian Development Bank says 80,000 people died in car wrecks in
1999--even though the country has only 10 million cars for its 1
billion people.</TE>
<TE>   Until March, wearing seat belts was not compulsory in India's
capital, New Delhi. Now drivers of rundown taxis throw fake seat
belts over their shoulders to fool police.</TE>
<TE>   In wealthier parts of Asia such as Hong Kong, South Korea,
Singapore and Japan, fatalities are declining. Education, tough laws,
traffic safety campaigns and better roads have cut the risks despite
a high ratio of cars to people.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has nearly halved the number of auto accident deaths through
tough law enforcement and road improvements since the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, recently
proposed that drivers who cause fatal accidents never be allowed to
drive again.</TE>
<TE>   "To Malaysians, a car is a necessity, and if they know they will
lose their licenses ... they will be more careful," he said.</TE>

<HD>In Russian, It's Clear to a Hedgehog</HD>
<DH>Words: A translator's life can be a real challenge-- and
there's no word for that. But former Soviet leader Gorbachev's aide
explains 'going postal' and 'no-brainer.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARAH KARUSH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- As Mikhail S. Gorbachev's interpreter, Pavel Palazchenko
was the Soviet leader's trusty assistant in his campaign to end the
Cold War. Now he is fighting to rid the world of another wedge
dividing East from West: bad translation.</LD>
<LD>   In "My Unsystematic Dictionary," published in Moscow, Palazchenko
tackles the things they don't teach you in language class--such as
"to go postal" and "no-brainer."</LD>
<LD>   Covering Russian bureaucratese as well as American political
correctness, it's both a guide to good translation and a handbook for
cultural understanding.</LD>
<TE>   One side effect of the changes unleashed by Gorbachev is that, in
today's Russia, translations from and into English are everywhere,
from restaurant menus to Hollywood blockbusters. But often they do
more to confuse than to enlighten.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, a bad translation can really be a problem. It
sometimes really impedes understanding," Palazchenko said. "This has
become a mass profession ... so I think there is some cause for
alarm."</TE>
<TE>   The bald, mustachioed Palazchenko was a fixture at Gorbachev's
summit talks with President Reagan, and he stayed with Gorbachev even
after the Soviet reformer was shoved off the political scene. At 53,
he continues to interpret at Gorbachev's many international
appearances and also handles his media relations.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbachev, known as a big talker with a love for colorful phrases
and complex metaphors, is no easy ride for an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Palazchenko recalled how Gorbachev surprised him at the first
summit with Reagan in Geneva in 1985 by quoting extensively from the
Bible--highly unusual for the leader of a communist regime.
Palazchenko was ready. He had studied biblical phrases in depth years
before and was able to render perfectly the long passage from the
Book of Ecclesiastes that begins: "To every thing there is a season."</TE>
<TE>   But memorizing passages from the Bible is not enough to prepare
today's translators, and Palazchenko's book offers translations of
newer expressions and concepts.</TE>
<TE>   The book offers a comprehensive section on Russian slang,
including otstoi, a word teenagers use to mock anything
old-fashioned. Palazchenko translates it as "square," though today's
American kids might find that word otstoi.</TE>
<TE>   American slang entries include "no-brainer," which Palazchenko
translates as eto yozhu yasno--clear to a hedgehog.</TE>
<TE>   Palazchenko devotes a page-and-a-half to "challenge"--a word with
no direct equivalent in Russian. Possible substitutes include
"problem" or "a task requiring great effort," he suggests. He also
gives advice on the, er, challenge presented by new American
euphemisms, such as "physically challenged." It means "disabled," he
writes.</TE>
<TE>   Translating "going postal" depends on the context, Palazchenko
explains. It can mean a murderous rampage, or simply to be
extremely--but nonviolently--upset. The Russian term would be krysha
poyekhala--"losing your roof," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the entries in the Russian-English half of the dictionary
warn the translator of "false friends"--words that sound the same in
both languages but are different. For instance, the Russian adekvatny
sounds like "adequate" but means "appropriate" or "good." Anekdot is
not an anecdote, but a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the ultimate puzzle--the Russian expression "twice as
few." As Palazchenko points out, it simply means "half."</TE>

<HD>Filling Void in China's Financial News Reporting</HD>

<AU>ELAINE KURTENBACH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>For Hu Shuli, managing editor of China's first serious financial
magazine, good journalism all boils down to one thing: Who pays for
the taxis?</LD>
<LD>   Fed up with the penny-pinching that she says prevents most Chinese
journalists from doing their jobs well, Hu got backing from China's
nascent financial community for Caijing, the magazine she started up
four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now Hu is pioneering Western-style investigative reporting in a
country where all but a handful of media are owned and run by the
state, where reporters routinely get cash handouts at news
conferences and where "freedom of information" is virtually unknown.</LD>
<TE>   Caijing's incisive reports on false financial data and other
corporate misdeeds have made it a must-read for anyone in Chinese
business. Political exposes remain off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very muckraking. It's playing a role similar to that once
played by "60 Minutes" in the United States, forcing people to take
action," said Andrew Rothman, a Beijing-based China expert.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese companies are unused to such close scrutiny. One publicly
listed real estate conglomerate recently given an unflattering
analysis, Shenzhen Fountain Corp., is suing Caijing for about
$375,000 for "damaging its reputation." The suit does not question
the facts reported in the story.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, investing in the 1,200 or so companies listed on
China's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, was an
exercise of groping in the dark and gambling on guesswork.</TE>
<TE>   Financial figures and managerial decisions usually disclosed in
Western nations are kept secret. Though the government has increased
disclosure requirements, the information reported is often suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Hu saw a niche in that void.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized there was a big space in the business and finance area
and that people are interested in independent corporate news," she
said at the magazine's Beijing headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year star reporter and editor who started out covering
corruption scandals for the major Chinese newspaper Workers' Daily,
Hu launched Caijing in April 1998 with support from the China Stock
Exchange Executive Council, a government-backed institute that
promotes China's financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   From an unknown monthly with a staff of six, Caijing -- which
translates into English as Business and Finance Review -- has grown
into a glossy biweekly with a staff of more than 50 and an estimated
circulation of 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Its reports have set off scandals over false accounting and poor
corporate governance and have led regulators to crack down on
investment trusts caught manipulating the market.</TE>
<TE>   "They have scoops. It's really professional journalism," said Li
Xiguang, a journalism professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the meager budgets at China's newspapers, Hu went to
her first meeting with the Stock Exchange Executive Council armed
with a wish list -- a healthy editorial budget.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled out a sheet of paper and said, 'This is the money I
want," ' Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   That was a result of her experiences on newspapers where, she
said, the first thing a Chinese reporter often asks when given an
assignment is: Who will pay for the taxis? They can't count on being
reimbursed by their editors, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was humiliating," Hu said. "We felt we lacked the money to
take a taxi, to stay in a good hotel, to use the phone. Everything. I
just want to be a professional journalist with my own self-respect."</TE>
<TE>   Hu said her bosses at the council were more familiar with Western
media than with Chinese journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't even know," she said, "[that] local reporters take
home 'red envelopes" '--cash payments, usually 200 to 400 yuan
[$24-$48] slipped inside handouts at corporate news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the norm in a political culture that treats media as
Communist Party propaganda tools, Caijing enjoys editorial
independence.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have objected to Caijing's coverage only once, Hu says.
That was an early 1998 story about a company that went broke and was
resurrected as a listing vehicle for a government-backed project in
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators "at that time were not as open as they are now," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Li, the journalism professor at Tsinghua University, praises
Caijing for its success. But he laments its limited influence, given
that it reaches only an elite readership of investors and financial
executives and must steer clear of politics -- the topic favored by
Chinese readers.</TE>
<TE>   "Caijing is a good beginning for change ... but press reform needs
to reach the mainstream media, and that includes political decision
making," Li said.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Battles a Tide of Foreign Prostitutes</HD>
<DH>Europe: Government tries to crack down on so-called
'Natashas,' or immigrants in the sex trade. It may get harder to
become a citizen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SELCAN HACAOGLU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>ANKARA, Turkey -- Olga, a slim 24-year-old Russian blond, never met
her Turkish husband. A Russian prostitution ring arranged the
marriage through bribery to provide her with instant Turkish
citizenship--a shield against deportation if she is ever caught.</LD>
<LD>   Prostitution has become more visible in Turkey since the collapse
of the Soviet Union led to an influx of tens of thousands of women
working for sex gangs. There are so many Slavic women working as
prostitutes that Turks have taken to calling any foreign prostitute
"Natasha."</LD>
<LD>   The government, which is trying to crack down, characterizes
prostitutes as disease spreaders and spies. Islamic clerics curse
them as "evil foreigners."</LD>
<TE>   Prostitution is legal here only at government-controlled brothels
housing Turkish women, and foreigners are subject to deportation if
caught.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't deport me. I am a Turkish citizen," Olga said at a
nightclub full of young women from former Soviet states.</TE>
<TE>   Olga said she married and divorced her Turkish husband without
seeing him. She did not know how much he was paid. "I never wondered
about who he was," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some prostitutes have married poor Turks who were paid as much as
$3,000, authorities say. Newspapers have reported cases of Turks with
mental illness being used as marriage partners without their
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its crackdown, the government wants to make it harder
to become a citizen. Legislation before parliament would require
married couples to live together for three years and to undergo a
security investigation before citizenship could be granted.</TE>
<TE>   The government's campaign began after an intelligence report,
titled "Natasha Activities," warned that some foreign prostitutes
might be engaged in acts of espionage.</TE>
<TE>   The report said some foreign prostitutes are hired by government
officials and could be spying on military plans and weapons
contracts, according to Turkey's Sabah newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The women are interrogated, sometimes for days, by their country's
intelligence service when they return home, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been no reported cases of espionage involving
foreign prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, police have intensified raids on seedy hotels around the
country, deporting hundreds of women. Police closed three hotels in
the eastern city of Kars for 80 days for allowing prostitutes to
solicit customers.</TE>
<TE>   A United States human rights report for 2001 said many women come
to Turkey expecting to work as models, waitresses or dancers but find
themselves forced into prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls from Romanian orphanages have been kidnapped and
trafficked," the report said. "Women who attempt to escape their
trafficking often were beaten, raped or killed."</TE>
<TE>   Women are also trafficked through Turkey to other countries in
Europe, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The skin trade is visible in most major Turkish cities, where
prostitutes perform their trade in cheap hotels like those in
Istanbul's commercial Laleli district or on the outskirts of the
Mediterranean resort town of Antalya.</TE>
<TE>   But some "Natashas" are visible poolside at five-star hotels and
at expensive sports clubs, where most male customers are businessmen,
government officials and diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   Olga, who said she is an economics student in Moscow, sports a
quality black blazer and a golden blouse, matching her hair. She
wears almost no makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "My family thinks I'm working here as a tourist guide," she said
in fluent Turkish. "Occasionally, I fly home to make them happy with
gifts."</TE>
<TE>   Olga said she came voluntarily after learning how much she could
make as a prostitute. The $150 she earns nightly is more than
Turkey's monthly minimum wage of 165 million Turkish lira, or about
$120.</TE>
<TE>   She sometimes goes to other Turkish cities "for friends," who she
said include Turkish businessmen, some Israelis and American
servicemen at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, they have to pay my travel expenses too," she said,
waving away a cloud of cigarette smoke.</TE>

<HD>Refugees, and Their Hosts, Grow Restless</HD>
<DH>Africa: Warring factions make home unlivable for displaced
Somalis. But camps in Kenya, often short on supplies, offer an
uncomfortable alternative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM MALITI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DADAAB, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Abshira Aden is fed up with not being able to go where she wants,
when she wants. She's sick of having to wait in line twice a month
for food that always runs short. And she's tired of doing nothing for
most of the day.</LD>
<LD>   She can't wait to leave behind her 11-year life as a refugee in
flat, sun-baked northeastern Kenya and return home to a peaceful
Somalia, only 45 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Aden was among the tens of thousands of people who fled to Kenya
in 1991 when rival Somali factions overthrew the government of
President Mohamed Siad Barre, then turned on each other. Somalia is
still without a stable government, and many areas remain unsafe.</LD>
<TE>   Across Africa, there are an estimated 13.1 million refugees and
people displaced within their own countries by long-standing
conflicts like the one in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person eats but has nothing to do, there is no difference
between him or her and an animal," said Aden, the women's leader at
the Dagahaley refugee camp, about 310 miles northeast of the Kenyan
capital, Nairobi. "If the situation improved back home, we would
return without waiting to be repatriated by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees."</TE>
<TE>   The head of Dagahaley camp, Hassan Dagane, would like to see an
international military force tame Somalia's warring factions and
establish a nationwide government. That would be far cheaper, he
argues, than what it costs to maintain the camps for Somali refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Dagahaley is one of three camps in the Dadaab sector, where
temperatures easily reach 100 degrees and it rarely rains. The
conglomerations of hovels made of sticks and plastic sheeting sprawl
over 19 square miles and house about 135,300 refugees, who also
include Sudanese, Ethiopians and some Ugandans.</TE>
<TE>   Years of caring for African refugees have strained the budgets of
the U.N. refugee agency and other humanitarian groups as well as the
hospitality of host countries.</TE>
<TE>   Rations given out by the World Food Program have been reduced, and
each month, individuals receive enough food for only about 20 days.</TE>
<TE>   Camp residents receive corn, wheat flour, beans, vegetable oil,
salt and a corn soya flour. But aid workers note that corn, known as
maize in this part of the world, isn't even part of Somalis' usual
diet.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that maize doesn't constitute the traditional diet
of the Somalis," said Aisha Daisy Buruku, head of the U.N. refugee
operation in the Dadaab area. "We are also aware that the food
basket, even in terms of quantity, has not been what it is supposed
to be."</TE>
<TE>   Buruku blamed a falloff in help from wealthy nations.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, Emmanuel Nyabera, said
its operating budget for Kenya dropped from $23.4 million in 1999 to
$15 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Among industrial nations, only Japan has boosted its contribution
to U.N. refugee activities in sub-Saharan Africa, said Noriko Takada,
spokeswoman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry. And that rose just
from $39.2 million in 1999 to $44.4 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other major donors have cut back but won't say why. Some people
speculate that donations have been hurt by allegations that local
staff at refugee camps in Guinea and Sierra Leone in West Africa
routinely demand sex for food.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenya camps also draw numerous complaints from government
officials.</TE>
<TE>   President Daniel Arap Moi contends the camps at Dadaab and Kakuma,
where an additional 95,000 refugees live, provide cover for bandits
and arms smugglers from Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials say the refugees damage the environment, mainly by
chopping down trees for firewood.</TE>
<TE>   To address that problem, and reduce the need for women and girls
from the camps to gather firewood in an area rife with banditry, the
German Development Cooperation agency buys firewood from local
Kenyans and gives it to the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees are also causing strains in neighboring Tanzania, which
is host to more than 500,000 Rwandan, Burundian and Congolese
refugees in U.N. camps and 470,000 more living in villages.</TE>

<HD>New, Lifelike Breast Prosthesis Makes Lives Whole
AgainEXP--GiftofLove</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BAILEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GEORGETOWN, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Terry Ferguson often wept as he watched his wife cope with the loss
of a breast to cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Frances Ferguson put on a brave face, as he knew she would, but
inside she was changing. She was not the same happy-go-lucky woman he
knew and loved before her left breast was removed to save her life in
October 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Little things seemed to upset her the most, like finding clothes
that would look right on her imbalanced chest when she wanted to work
out or dress up for a night on the town.</LD>
<TE>   His weathered face still reddens when he recalls the anger and
disgust that swept over him as he walked into a prosthetic shop with
her in an attempt to restore some of her pride.</TE>
<TE>   "It was appalling, really," said Ferguson, a Georgetown
orthodontist. "The prosthetics were like cold sacks of silicone that
you just plop into a hole. They were about the most depressing things
you'd ever see.</TE>
<TE>   "That very moment, I decided I was going to go home and reinvent
the wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Terry Ferguson wept again. This time, however,
the tears were prompted by joy as he saw his wife's vitality return
in an instant after presenting her with a new, custom-fit prosthetic
breast.</TE>
<TE>   "Life changed for me from the minute I put it on," said Frances
Ferguson, 48. "I cried as I stood there and looked at myself in the
mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked so real that I called my daughter to come down and see
it. I was wearing a sheer bra, and when she first came into the room
she couldn't tell which was which from about 10 feet away. Then we
both stood there crying together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Ferguson's gift of love--now called the Radiant Image custom
breast prosthesis--gave renewed hope and vigor to a woman he'd adored
for nearly 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, his wife was insisting that he share the gift with the other
1.4 million American women who wear breast forms.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even thought about marketing it," he said. "All I wanted
to do was create something that would bring my wife back to me and
give her the confidence to start living her life again.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wasn't more than a few days before she told me that I had
the ability to change the lives of women who had been feeling like
she had and make them feel whole again."</TE>
<TE>   The custom prosthesis is an idea that is long overdue, said Dr.
Patrick McGrath, director of the University of Kentucky's
Comprehensive Breast Care Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of been a neglected area for years," said McGrath, who
saw the prosthesis during a presentation on the product. "It's
dramatically different. The concept is so simple and makes so much
sense."</TE>
<TE>   The prosthesis is custom built--molded from an impression of a
remaining breast if there is one--and fit to each woman's particular
specifications, including size, shape and color of the remaining
breast.</TE>
<TE>   It is made of a unique patent-pending silicone foam core which
Ferguson perfected after many years spent creating retainers and
other oral appliances for his patients. It is light and cool, yet
waterproof and can be worn while exercising, swimming or sitting in a
hot tub.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part was developing a core material that would
literally simulate breast tissue weight-wise," he said. "Once I was
able to do that, the aesthetic part really just fell into place."</TE>
<TE>   It can be held firm against the chest with or without adhesive and
worn with or without a bra. Frances Ferguson has worn it with
everything from a bathing suit to a formal, strapless dress.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really no situation where I'm not comfortable wearing
it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosthesis is available only through VDK Turning Point in
Lexington but soon will be available in prosthetics shops in Kentucky
and Tennessee and, eventually, nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had about 30 women wear the prosthesis and have gotten
hundreds of calls through word of mouth alone," said Lois Ferguson,
chief marketing officer for Radiant Image.</TE>
<TE>   "A typical breast prosthesis costs between $350 and $500, while
the other custom prosthesis on the market runs about $3,800," she
said. "This one costs between $950 and $1,100, depending on the
size."</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Greer says that's a small price to pay for the way it makes
cancer survivors feel. As director of chaplains at Lexington's
Central Baptist Hospital, Greer counsels women struggling with the
effects of breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   She's also a four-year cancer survivor who lost both her breasts
to mastectomy in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been an extremely confident and positive person, so
wearing the heavy old prosthesis was no big deal to me," said Greer,
who met the Fergusons while Frances was undergoing her surgery. "I
was just so happy to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Ferguson asked if she would allow him to make her a pair to
wear for several days and then let him know what, if any, changes the
design needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honestly, I thought to myself, 'Is this guy crazy?' But I
figured I owed it to my patients to find out about any kind of new
product they might be interested in," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw them for the first time, I was absolutely speechless.
You just can't believe what you are seeing. And then seeing them on
my body ... it's a joy you just can't explain."</TE>
<TE>   Greer said the prosthesis allows a woman to feel normal again.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds funny to say this out loud, but I never dreamed I'd
ever have a nipple again," she said with a laugh. "I mean, your arm
brushes up against your chest and there it is--like it was never
gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd ever feel comfortable going into Victoria's
Secret or Dillards again to look for and try on bras. After a
mastectomy, you feel like a patient, not a woman. Now, bra shopping
is something I look forward to more than just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   That, Terry Ferguson says, makes him feel almost as proud as
seeing his wife thrive as she did before the cancer changed both of
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew in my heart there had to be something better out
there for Frances," he said.</TE>

<HD>Wrongly Convicted and Unevenly Repaid</HD>
<DH>Justice: DNA tests have freed some men, but remuneration
usually depends on where they live, when they are released and how
skilled their lawyers are.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After A.B. Butler Jr. was cleared of rape and freed from prison two
years ago, the state of Texas granted him a pardon and gave him a
check for its mistake. The value of 16 years behind bars: About $4.60
a day.</LD>
<LD>   The check totaled $27,854 for more than a third of his life
wasted, while his parents died and his marriage collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   "It should have been more and it could have been more," sighs
Butler, a 47-year-old construction worker. "But I just look at it as
a blessing that I'm free."</LD>
<TE>   Although Butler's attitude is accepting, his case and a growing
number like it raise a question: When innocent prisoners are freed
after "paying a debt to society" that was never owed, does society
have a debt to them in return?</TE>
<TE>   What these men have found is varying and sometimes inconsistent
state standards for paying--and, often, not paying--for the
life-changing mistake of putting the wrong person in prison.</TE>
<TE>   An Associated Press review of 110 men whose convictions were
overturned by DNA testing shows that where they live, when they were
freed and even how skilled their lawyers are greatly influence
whether they get compensated and, if so, by how much.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no fairness," declares Randy Schaffer, a Houston lawyer
who has represented three freed Texas men. "Society has not decided
it owes any obligation to those that it sweeps from its midst
wrongly."</TE>
<TE>   Only 15 states, along with the District of Columbia and the
federal government, have specific laws to compensate the wrongly
convicted, according to a review conducted last year by Pace
University associate law professor Adele Bernhard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the common person's issue," she says. "We don't think
it's going to happen to us or anybody we know."</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press found 43 of the 110 men have received
compensation, ranging from Ben Salazar's $25,000 in Texas to an
extraordinary $36 million civil settlement shared by four Illinois
men locked up for a total of 65 years.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen men collected $1 million or more, from civil suits, state
claims or both.</TE>
<TE>   Although money will never make up for the lost pieces of these
men's lives, for some compensation isn't just a question of fairness,
but a matter of survival.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Bloodsworth was branded a child killer and languished in a
Maryland prison for nearly a decade. For two years he was on death
row.</TE>
<TE>   He says the state robbed him of the chance to build his business
as a fisherman. Now 41, the ex-Marine has health problems but no
health insurance--and fears he could lose his boat.</TE>
<TE>   Bloodsworth seethes when he compares his compensation to that of a
woman awarded far more after she burned herself with spilled coffee
at a fast-food restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "The state was ready to kill me," he says, his voice rising, "and
I got $300,000."</TE>
<TE>   Bloodsworth collected $30,000 for each year he was locked up. But
he spent more than half of it the day he received his check, paying
off loans and legal fees and reimbursing his father, who dug into his
savings for the drawn-out battle to free his son.</TE>
<TE>   Bloodsworth ran out of money quickly and for a short time was
homeless, sleeping in his truck and at a restaurant where he found
work. He says he wasted some of his compensation, opening his wallet
too often for newfound friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I wanted some social acceptance," he says. "I wanted to
feel good again."</TE>
<TE>   David Shawn Pope knows that feeling. After spending 15 years in a
Texas prison for a rape he didn't commit, he indulged in his own
spending spree with the first part of $385,000 he'll collect.</TE>
<TE>   A $50,000 Ford Mustang Cobra. Furniture. A stylish wardrobe.
Modeling, acting, bartending classes. "To be honest with you, when I
got out, I was pretty lonely," he says. "Spending money can be an
addiction. It makes you feel better."</TE>
<TE>   Pope, now 40, has scaled back since his release last year, but
still has a swank, $2,300-a-month apartment in the Marina district of
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Other tenants in my building say, 'Hello, how are you?' It's like
they're saying, 'You must be well off, you're one of us.' But I'm
really not."</TE>
<TE>   Pope benefited from a Texas law passed last year that boosted
compensation to $25,000 for each year of wrongful incarceration, up
to $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Texas paid a maximum of $50,000--though almost no one
received much more than $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Because Butler's compensation came under the old law, he received
less than one-tenth of what Pope collected, even though he served
more time.</TE>
<TE>   As DNA continues to free inmates, more states are considering
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Oklahoma House and Senate passed a bill to provide as
much as $200,000 to wrongly convicted people. Last year, Gov. Frank
Keating vetoed a compensation measure, saying it was too broad. He
has not yet decided whether he will sign the new legislation, an aide
says.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to find any official opposed to the principle of
compensating those wrongly imprisoned. The difficulty is in the
details. Lawmakers in some states have expressed concern about
straining already tight budgets with compensation payments or
awarding money in cases where there was no official negligence.</TE>
<TE>   In states that do pay the wrongly convicted, there often are
strings attached: filing deadlines; pledges the exonerated will not
file suit; and frequently, a requirement that the governor issue a
pardon.</TE>
<TE>   Most states also have a money cap, which Schaffer, the Houston
lawyer, argues is shamefully low, considering the agony endured.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take into account the fact that you were locked in a
cell, the fact you might have been physically or sexually abused,
kept away from your family and friends, living in hell," he says,
"and that you came out with a scarlet letter on your forehead."</TE>
<TE>   State claims, where available, are the most common form of
compensation. In at least five cases, men who had been freed
collected money from states with special legislation, sometimes
called "moral obligation" bills, written to help a specific person.</TE>
<TE>   Others have pursued civil lawsuits--although cases against law
enforcement or governments are very difficult to win.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have absolute immunity for anything done at trial.
Police have qualified immunity, though not when it can be proven they
deliberately did something wrong, such as conceal exculpatory
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare case, a wrongful conviction led to criminal charges
against seven law enforcement officials in DuPage County, Ill. They
were accused of fabricating evidence and lying to frame Rolando Cruz
for the murder of a 10-year-old girl. All were acquitted in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   However, the following year, the county paid Cruz and two other
men $3.5 million to settle civil suits against the sheriff and some
deputies, saying it was cheaper than going to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, four wrongly convicted men--the so-called Ford Heights
Four--received $36 million from Cook County, Ill. They claimed
sheriff's police hid evidence that would have helped the defense
while ignoring leads pointing to the real killers in a double murder.</TE>
<TE>   About 14 lawyers, including Gerry Spence, were marshaled, and a
claustrophobic, true-to-scale prison cell was built to wheel into the
courtroom as an exhibit. The county settled.</TE>
<TE>   But few wrongly convicted men can hire a Gerry Spence.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Hicks, released in 1996, sued his trial lawyer for failing
to seek the right type of DNA testing in his rape trial.</TE>
<TE>   A Wisconsin jury awarded him $2.6 million. But an appeals court
overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial in which Hicks will
have to prove his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no amount of money that can change those five years,"
Hicks says. "But it makes you wonder what is the value of human life.
Can you take someone's rights and liberties and, at the end of the
day, do nothing?"</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, a 39-year-old father of two, still remembers a painful day
after his release when he came to pick up his daughter at school--and
she ran. It was "the worst thing that ever happened to me in my
life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He and his family now live in Texas. Once his court fight is
resolved, he can seek money from Wisconsin. The annual compensation:
a maximum $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   David Shepard had no grounds to sue after being cleared of rape in
New Jersey in 1995--no ineffective lawyer, no prosecutorial
misconduct, no forensic errors, just a victim who had mistakenly
identified him.</TE>
<TE>   So his attorney, Paul Casteleiro, lobbied lawmakers, who passed a
bill for the wrongly imprisoned that provides compensation based on
the length of time behind bars or previous salary. It was a partial
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It should have been enough to give my family a place to stay," he
says. "They should have given me a job that I could grow into and
keep. Some family counseling. They did none of that..... It was just
something to ease their conscience."</TE>

<DH>Tragedy: Jason Schechterle dreaded becoming a burn victim,
and that's exactly what happened to him. Now he and his family must
learn to cope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Second in a weekly series</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   PHOENIX -- It was after sunrise when the three surgeons emerged
from the operating room in the Arizona Burn Center. Even they were
horrified at what they had left behind.</LD>
<TE>   "Monstrous," one muttered as the operation concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The man on the table had been stripped of his entire face. Gone
were the eyelids, the eyebrows, most of the nose and ears. He had no
cheeks or forehead, no skin whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   He looked like an anatomical model, dissected to muscle. And even
some of that was gone.</TE>
<TE>   It took four hours to excise the skin and other dead tissue from
Phoenix police officer Jason Schechterle's face, head and neck after
the fiery car accident that left him with fourth-degree burns.
Afterward, Drs. Daniel Caruso, Kevin Foster and Clifford Smith
stapled cadaver skin over his face to temporarily protect the wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it through," Caruso told Suzie Schechterle. "We never
lost him."</TE>
<TE>   When Suzie went in to see her husband, still deeply sedated, his
head was the size of a watermelon and covered in bloodstained
bandages. Only his lips were visible. They were swollen, but they
were his lips. Though burned, they were still perfect, she thought.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled back the sheet to see his feet. The fire had spared
them. Bending down, she kissed each toe as tears spilled down her
cheeks. "I love you so much," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't promise that everything would be OK. That, she just
didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   When Suzie was only 8, her father had died of a lung aneurysm.
She'd spent the rest of her life searching for the stability she had
lost as a child. She couldn't bear thinking that the same fate might
befall her own kids.</TE>
<TE>   She needed to talk with them about Jason.</TE>
<TE>   Zane, only 2, wouldn't understand. For now, Daddy was at work.</TE>
<TE>   Kiley, Jason's 7-year-old stepdaughter, would see through any
lies. On that first afternoon home, Suzie called her into the kitchen
and knelt down on the floor, looking into her daughter's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Jason had been horribly burned, she explained. He didn't have ears
or a nose. His hair was gone. As her daughter sobbed, Suzie told her
that God might take Jason, and that might be better. Either way,
whether he lived or died, they would make it, Suzie vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Without a word, Kiley crawled into her mother's lap. In the middle
of the kitchen floor, they clung to each other and cried.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Suzie curled up on the couch, clutching one of Jason's
police shirts. It hadn't been washed, and smelled of him. The wedding
album lay in her lap.</TE>
<TE>   "How am I going to do this?" she kept asking herself, before
finally drifting to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Morning brought no clearer idea what the future might hold--and
yet she reminded herself that she had survived plenty: her father's
death, a difficult childhood, a divorce. She would survive this too.</TE>
<TE>   Running away was simply not an option. Her children needed her.
Jason needed her.</TE>
<TE>   And no matter what, she still needed him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the first few days after the March 2001 accident, Jason
returned to the operating room four times as doctors removed more
dead skin from his head, arms, legs and hands.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie took leave from the dentist's office where she worked as an
assistant and set up a schedule of care for the kids. She found a
therapist for Kiley, and one for herself. She spent her days at the
burn unit.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the first week, surgeons replaced the cadaver skin
on Jason's face with a material made from shark cartilage and bovine
collagen. At three weeks, with Jason still unconscious, doctors
stapled sections of skin from his back, buttocks and legs over the
artificial dermis on his face, head and neck.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment was moving along as planned, but in the second month,
Jason's hands began to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The first two fingers and thumb of his left hand were burned to
the bone and had to be amputated. On both hands, the burns had
exposed tendons, which, if left uncovered, would dry up and die.</TE>
<TE>   Worried they might lose both hands altogether, the doctors had to
find a way to make new tissue grow over the exposed tendons. They
made two incisions, one on each side of Jason's abdomen. Into these
kangaroo pouches, they inserted his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, they pulled Jason's hands out and grafted skin on the
tissue now covering the tendons.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Jason remained in a chemical coma--doped up on
pain and anti-anxiety medication. Because his eyelids were burned
off, doctors sewed his eyes shut to protect the corneas.</TE>
<TE>   For Suzie, the routine of skin grafting and surgery became normal.
She had come to accept that their lives would never be the same, that
this was their life now. But there were still so many questions:
Would Jason be able to see and hear? Had his injuries or the drugs
impaired his mind?</TE>
<TE>   Those answers would have to wait until Jason woke up, but there
was one question she could answer for herself, one demon she had to
confront.</TE>
<TE>   What did her husband look like?</TE>
<TE>   "Can I see him?" she asked Caruso and Foster one day, about a
month after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Only the medical team had seen Jason without his bandages.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if that's the best idea," Foster replied.</TE>
<TE>   But Suzie wouldn't budge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to expect, and it scares me," she told the
doctors. "Not knowing what Jason will look like is probably harder
than to see him and get it over with."</TE>
<TE>   At Room 7 of the burn unit, with Foster on one side and Caruso on
the other, Suzie pushed through the door. "There's a chair," Foster
murmured, in case she felt faint.</TE>
<TE>   Jason lay on the bed--naked but for a sheet across his waist.</TE>
<TE>   Even from the doorway, Suzie felt she'd been punched in the gut.
She simply could not comprehend how much of the man she had married
four years earlier was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The soft cheeks, creased with two perfect dimples when he smiled,
were replaced with skin stapled together like a quilt. The patches
were an odd shade of magenta, snaked with veins.</TE>
<TE>   The slender nose was little more than a hump with two holes in it.</TE>
<TE>   The ears looked like charred wood in a fireplace, ready to crumble
at the slightest touch.</TE>
<TE>   He looks nothing like my husband, she thought. But this was still
Jason, and she had to reconcile what he had become on the outside
with who he was on the inside. Seeing him, she could begin.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie pulled a footstool to the bed for a closer look. Soon, she
was pointing at Jason and peppering the doctors with questions.</TE>
<TE>   The weight had been lifted. He looks like hell, Suzie thought, but
she could deal with it; she could learn to look beyond the burns.</TE>
<TE>   She only prayed that Jason could too, when he finally awoke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He heard the machines first. Then he smelled that unmistakable
antiseptic odor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a hospital," Jason thought. "Why can't I see?"</TE>
<TE>   He coughed, and heard a voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here," his wife said. "You were in an accident."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't feel any pain. It couldn't be that big a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "When?" he asked, his throat raspy.</TE>
<TE>   "March 26th," Suzie replied, and it struck him that she didn't say
last night or yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   "What's today?"</TE>
<TE>   Suzie hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," she said, "today's June 12th."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie gently told him the story. You were hit by a cab, she said.
It wasn't your fault. Your eyes are sewn shut; that's why you can't
see. Jason asked what bones were broken. How could she tell him it
wasn't that simple?</TE>
<TE>   "Your car caught on fire."</TE>
<TE>   It was the thing he dreaded most. He could take being shot or
stabbed, but not burned, not maimed.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, when an Arizona trooper burned to death in his
patrol car, Jason had told a friend, "If that ever happened to me, I
wouldn't want to live." Shoot me, he'd said. Put me out of my misery.</TE>
<TE>   When Suzie asked now if he wanted to know his injuries, Jason
simply said no.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason put his energy into getting out of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   His days were filled with physical therapy and visits from family
and friends.</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't the Jason everyone remembered. His partner and best
friend, Bryan Chapman, visited every day. He'd tell what was
happening at the precinct, talk about current events. But they were
one-way conversations. Bryan would run out of things to say.</TE>
<TE>   Late at night, alone in his room, Jason cried. The hardest part
was not seeing his kids. Kiley had come to the hospital a few times,
but they thought Zane wasn't ready yet. With his eyes sewn shut,
Jason couldn't even see pictures of them. Suzie brought tapes from
home so he could hear their voices.</TE>
<TE>   He felt so removed from his old life, and learning about his
injuries made it worse.</TE>
<TE>   Do I have a nose? he asked one day.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, the doctors told him.</TE>
<TE>   Ears?</TE>
<TE>   Gone.</TE>
<TE>   Hair?</TE>
<TE>   Gone.</TE>
<TE>   Each answer seemed to subtract from his identity.</TE>
<TE>   When Jason learned that three fingers had been amputated, he was
devastated. Who was he now?</TE>
<TE>   He tried to picture what he looked like, but he couldn't fathom
what fourth-degree burns would leave behind. He was scared to death
that it--no, he--would be socially unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "How ugly am I?" he asked Suzie.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not," she tried to assure him. "To me, you're not ugly.
You're just different, that's all."</TE>
<TE>   But in the back halls of the hospital, people talked. Jason and
Suzie had been like Ken and Barbie. She was young and attractive. And
he, well ....</TE>
<TE>   With all that had happened, would she stay or go? Some even made
bets.</TE>
<TE>   But appearance is not identity, Suzie kept saying.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the looks of the man I married," she told Jason. "I
just want the man."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four months after the accident, Jason was transferred from the
burn center to a rehabilitation unit. As he learned to use what was
left of his body, doctors projected a release date: Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Jason was thrilled and terrified.</TE>
<TE>   He had had 19 surgeries and awaited more. He had gone from a
fearless 190-pound cop to a fragile 132-pound invalid who couldn't
feed himself. And his physical appearance could be worse than his
physical limitations. He could be a freak, but Jason still didn't
know. His eyes remained sealed.</TE>
<TE>   He pestered Suzie with questions: How would he get around the
house? Should they put up railings so he could guide himself? Would
he be too big a burden for her? Would the kids adapt?</TE>
<TE>   When Suzie finally brought Zane to visit his father at the rehab
center, the boy ran from him.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's my daddy?" he screamed.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days before his release, Jason suffered his biggest setback.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting for the first time with the hand specialist, he was told
he would need at least six operations to regain any function. Worse,
the doctor wanted to amputate what remained of the left index finger
to give Jason a new thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Jason couldn't believe it. Remove another piece of him? He started
crying and couldn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   As he sat in the doctor's office, his head hung low, Jason
suddenly realized what his tears had done: Some scabs over his left
eye had washed away, and the sutures were separating.</TE>
<TE>   The opening was no bigger than a pinhole--but Jason could see.</TE>
<TE>   All the questions, the fears, the reality of what had happened--he
was about to confront it all. He was about to see for himself what
the fire had left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: The spirit to survive.</TE>

<LD>His father taught him simple things, such as the joy of slipping into
the kitchen to make waffles at dawn while the rest of the house
slept, or the thrill of cutting school to head to the speedway or
catch a baseball game--just the two of them.</LD>
<LD>   From his father he inherited a love of tennis, the outdoors,
books--especially the most important book, the Bible.</LD>
<LD>   And from his father, an Army chaplain, he inherited a legacy.</LD>
<TE>   You are the son and grandson of a minister, Allan Streett would
tell his son. You are from a line of men who strived to make the
world a better place. That is your legacy too, as a Streett, as a
minister's son.</TE>
<TE>   On the frigid winter night in 1978 when the father he adored was
gunned down before his eyes, Tim Streett was left alone with that
legacy. He was 15 years old.</TE>
<TE>   They buried his dad with military honors in Arlington National
Cemetery. In a daze, the son listened to the eulogies and the prayers
and the 21-gun salute.</TE>
<TE>   And he wondered: How could he make the world a better place when
the man who had made it so good was gone?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It had been a hard winter: one blizzard rolling into the next.
Father and son had gotten used to shoveling snow morning and night in
their driveway in the pretty Oak Lawn suburb of Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   They would talk as they shoveled, about sports and school and
maybe about the sermon that Allan Streett had delivered that Sunday.
The message of the Bible always sprinkled his conversations, as it
shaped his life.</TE>
<TE>   Tim doesn't remember what they were talking about that night, but
he remembers the sound--the single terrifying shot ringing through
the night, his father, head bloodied, falling backward in the snow,
the gunman turning on the son.</TE>
<TE>   Tim was sure he was going to die. But the gunman just grabbed the
boy's wallet and ran to a waiting car.</TE>
<TE>   Tim dropped to his knees beside his father's limp body. He cradled
his father's head, heard the gurgling sound, knew nothing would ever
be the same.</TE>
<TE>   He raced screaming into the house.</TE>
<TE>   As the father died in the hospital that night, the son sat in the
police station being grilled about what he had seen. A few days later
he picked the killer out of a lineup.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, he took the witness stand. He felt numb as he
told his story--about his hero, a man who had devoted his life to
God, his family, his country.</TE>
<TE>   He was the best dad in the world, the son told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   The shooter was sentenced to death. His accomplice, the man who
drove the getaway car, got 90 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For years, Streett says, he didn't feel the bitterness of his
sisters, or the anger of his mother. For years, he didn't feel
anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   But his personality changed on the night his childhood ended.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in his life, he didn't feel safe. His mother
sent him to live with friends in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., after police
warned of threats on her son's life.</TE>
<TE>   Far from home, Streett felt lonely and unsure, always watchful,
always scared--especially if he saw a gang of youths, especially if
they were black.</TE>
<TE>   Streett knew what his father would have said. He could almost hear
his father's voice, soft as always, but tinged with disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   There is no place for prejudice in this world, his father would
have said. There is no place for an unforgiving heart. You must find
a way to love and forgive.</TE>
<TE>   But how could a son forgive his father's killers? It was hard
enough not to hate them.</TE>
<TE>   Streett, once so happy-go-lucky and sure, became withdrawn. He
didn't talk to his friends about his father's death. He stopped
talking to God.</TE>
<TE>   At Purdue University, he lost himself in a haze of drink and
drugs. After graduating with a degree in sociology, he drifted,
working as a waiter, winding up as manager of a restaurant in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   He was driving down a Texas highway when he heard the song:</TE>
<TE>   "It's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull, and carved a
six-inch valley through the middle of my soul."</TE>
<TE>   The lyrics were Bruce Springsteen's, but the ache described
Streett's heart.</TE>
<TE>   The memories flooded back, followed by tears. Before it was over,
Streett knew exactly what he would do.</TE>
<TE>   He would become a minister like his father. He would return to
Indianapolis and live among the poor. He would minister to young
people with few hopes and few prospects and no fathers of their own.
He would fight to keep them from becoming the kind of youths who had
killed his dad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once he made the decision, Streett became his old purposeful self.
He enrolled in the Gordon-Conwell seminary in Boston. He started
reading everything he could about the urban poor, about racial
prejudice, about programs to combat it. He learned to preach.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in years," he says, "I was in the right
place."</TE>
<TE>   Streett met and quickly married Stacy Hocker, a woman who shared
his convictions. After interning at a Chicago church for a few years,
he made his way back to Indianapolis, to the sprawling East 91st
Street Christian Church in the city's northern suburbs. There,
Streett was given a special ministry--the urban poor.</TE>
<TE>   His first action was to move, with his wife, into a small house in
the heart of one of the poorest neighborhoods in town--a move that
stunned local black ministers, skeptical at first about this tall
serious white man in their midst. It didn't take long before they
were won over by Streett's commitment, and by his story.</TE>
<TE>   Streett won over business leaders too, persuading one to transform
a huge vacant warehouse into an urban sports center. Jehovah Jireh
Sports it is called--meaning God Provides.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim Streett came here with a mission," said Paul Canada, the
charismatic young black minister who runs Jehovah Jireh Sports, which
has proved so successful that it is planning an expansion. "And I
think that mission started on the day his father died."</TE>
<TE>   But, for all Streett's faith and vision, memories still haunted
the minister's son.</TE>
<TE>   He was preaching about forgiveness and racial
reconciliation--thoughtful, scholarly interpretations of the Bible's
message.</TE>
<TE>   Love your enemies.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been easier if his father's killers had shown
remorse. But the man who pulled the trigger was still on death row,
defiantly proclaiming his innocence, his constant appeals cruel
reminders of all that Streett had lost.</TE>
<TE>   Streett knew what his father would have done. Streett could still
picture him, thin and tired, in Army fatigues, returning home on
crutches after Vietnam. And he could picture him a few months later,
opening his home to a family of Vietnamese refugees.</TE>
<TE>   True forgiveness, his father would have said, is from the heart.
It doesn't demand anything in return.</TE>
<TE>   Streett wrestled with his heart, his memories, his faith.</TE>
<TE>   And one night, nearly two decades after his father's murder, he
sat down and wrote two of the most difficult letters of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the son of Chaplain Allan Streett, the man who was killed in
the robbery of Jan. 16, 1978," he began.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to describe his life, his mission, his belief in
forgiveness. But Streett didn't truly believe in the power of his
words until after he mailed the letters.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgive you for the death of my father."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In prison, Don Cox had never forgotten the night he drove the
getaway car for the robbery that turned into murder. And he had never
forgotten the boy whose testimony had put him away for life.</TE>
<TE>   Young and poor and bored, Cox had fallen in with a gang of youths
who had spent the night drinking and looking for trouble. They'd rob
a few people, have a few laughs, spend their takings on booze and
drugs. Murder wasn't on their minds, nor hatred in their hearts.
Ninety years. The brash young man with the handsome smile couldn't
believe the sentence. He'd never been in serious trouble before,
never meant to hurt anyone, hadn't held the gun.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sorry for Tim, losing his dad," said Cox, now 44. "But by
sending me to prison for nearly my whole life--it meant my two young
sons lost their father too."</TE>
<TE>   For the first few years in prison, Cox was always picking fights,
always in trouble. He didn't care if he lived or died.</TE>
<TE>   Then a few old-timers took him under their wing. You're smart,
they said. Get an education. Get some sense. Don't wind up like us,
nothing to show for our lives but cynicism and idleness and an
endless cycle of violence and crime.</TE>
<TE>   Cox earned his GED, then a bachelor's degree in history. He
learned several trades. He started going to services organized by a
Christian ministry whose volunteers came to prison once a week.</TE>
<TE>   And he found something he had never felt before, a sense of
belonging to a world beyond prison, a world that cared for him as a
person as well as for his soul.</TE>
<TE>   When the letter from Streett arrived out of the blue, Cox wept.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a miracle," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Cox wrote back immediately, begging Streett to visit.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, in the waiting room of Pendleton maximum security
prison, the two men embraced. It was 19 years since they had last
faced each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry for everything that happened," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgive you," Streett replied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Daniels, the man convicted of the killing, is on death
row, still appealing his sentence. He never answered Streett's
letter, although Streett hasn't given up hope that someday he might.</TE>
<TE>   Streett has a warm and easy friendship with Cox: The men joke like
they are relatives, seeing each other for special family occasions,
bonded to each other for life.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting Cox in prison, Streett wrote to the judge, he met
with the former prosecutor, he testified at a sentencing-reduction
hearing on Cox's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   When Cox's sentence was reduced and he was released from prison in
2001, Streett did more than rejoice with him. He helped him find a
job as a car mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   And when Cox gets married next October, to a woman he met at
church, the guest of honor at his wedding will be Streett.</TE>
<TE>   Streett now has a son of his own, a precocious 3-year-old named
Gabriel. Already he is teaching the child to make waffles for the
family at breakfast. Someday he will teach his son tennis.</TE>
<TE>   And someday, when Gabriel is old enough, Streett will talk to him
about the life and death of the grandfather he never knew. And he
will tell Gabriel of his legacy, as the son and grandson and
great-grandson of a minister.</TE>
<TE>   You are from a line of men who strived to make the world a better
place, the father will tell the son. That is your legacy too, as a
Streett, as a minister's son.</TE>

<HD>Curiosity Sparks New History of Illinois Mounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F.N. D'ALESSIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>While she was teaching, architectural historian Sally A. Kitt
Chappell specialized in modern buildings and city planning, but in
retirement she has turned her eyes to some of Illinois' oldest
architecture--the Cahokia Mounds.</LD>
<LD>   The shift of focus happened accidentally.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after she retired from DePaul University in 1994, Chappell
and her husband, Walter Kitt, were driving to St. Louis for a blues
festival. Early in the afternoon, they passed a sign for the Cahokia
Mounds State Historic Site.</LD>
<TE>   " 'Let's take a look,' I said, and Walter agreed," Chappell
recalled in a recent interview. "We looked around, and I was hooked.
I just knew something wonderful had happened at that site. We spent
four hours there that afternoon and then returned the next day."</TE>
<TE>   On that first visit, Chappell learned facts and theories about the
mound complex and the Mississippian Indians who built it around the
year 1000. She learned that the central Monks Mound was the largest
pre-Columbian structure north of Mexico and the largest all-earthen
pyramid in the New World. She learned of the Woodhenge, the solar
calendar of wooden posts unearthed by the site's archeologists, and
of the evidence of human sacrifice those researchers found in some of
the smaller mounds.</TE>
<TE>   The fascination lasted.</TE>
<TE>   Chappell found herself returning repeatedly to the mounds over a
five-year period. She stood on Monks Mound to watch an eclipse of the
moon and the streaming tail of the Hale-Bopp Comet. She stood at the
reconstructed Woodhenge on equinoxes and solstices to watch the
rising sun align with the wooden poles.</TE>
<TE>   Chappell also began educating herself in archeology, anthropology
and geology, fields that had little to do with her academic
specialty.</TE>
<TE>   The result of Chappell's near-obsession is "Cahokia: Mirror of the
Cosmos," published this spring by the University of Chicago Press.</TE>
<TE>   With the aid of site archeologists William R. Iseminger and John
E. Kelly, Chappell forces that created the "American Bottom," the
fertile alluvial plain where the ancestors of the Mississippians
settled. She tells of how their hunter-gatherer lifestyle gradually
evolved into an agricultural civilization based on corn.</TE>
<TE>   Such a civilization required an organized society and a division
of labor. Chappell recounts what researchers have learned of the
Mississippian culture. She presents many photographs of the
sculpture, tools and ceramics produced by its artisans, as well as
archeologists' hypotheses on its social structure and religious
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Chappell uses her own expertise in architecture and
city planning to examine the mounds themselves--their structure and
purpose. She estimates that the 100-foot-tall Monk's Mound required
more than 16.6 million 55-pound baskets of clay and packed earth.</TE>
<TE>   That giant mound, surrounded by four great plazas, was the
centerpiece of the six-square-mile Mississippian city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's estimated that about the year 1050, Cahokia may have been a
bigger city than London was at that time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1400 the site was abandoned. It remained uninhabited until
Illini Indians moved into the area about 1650.</TE>
<TE>   While most archeological books on Cahokia end with the
abandonment, Chappell's account takes the site's history up to the
present day.</TE>
<TE>   Cahokia was designated as a World Heritage Site by a United
Nations agency in 1982, one of only eight cultural sites in the
United States so honored. But before that honor, the mound complex
was subjected to various indignities, including the building of tract
homes, an X-rated drive-in movie theater, and even a poorly conceived
airport built on marshland.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back at the five years she spent on the book, Chappell,
72, called it "a break with my past and a surrender to my curiosity.
But it's your curiosity, after all, that feeds your energy."</TE>

<HD>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</HD>
<DH>TALES OF TERROR!, By Fred von Bernewitz and Grant Geissman,
Fantagraphics: 296 pp., $24.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BRESNICK</AU>
<BD>Adam Bresnick writes for several publications,
including the (London) Times Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Gaines is not a household name in the United States, but as
the publisher of the subversively furshlugginer Mad magazine (that's
a Mad-ism for something you wouldn't repeat in front of your mother),
he arguably did as much as anyone to fashion the tone of post-World
War II American popular culture. Collapsing highbrow and lowbrow with
reckless glee, Mad's "humor in a jugular vein" left no sacred cow
unmilked, no bit of pop-culture flotsam unmocked. Brilliantly
irreverent, Mad provided the matrix for the best in American satire,
from the National Lampoon to "Saturday Night Live" to Comedy
Central's "The Daily Show."</LD>
<LD>   Though Mad famously ruffled the stuffed shirts of the early 1950s,
it was Gaines' more sensational magazine series such as Tales From
the Crypt, Weird Science and The Vault of Horror that proved so
abrasive to good taste that, in April of 1954, the U.S. Senate
Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency convened a special
hearing to examine the ostensibly deleterious effects of comics on
the youth of America.</LD>
<TE>   Gaines' gutsy testimony before the subcommittee is the highlight
of "Tales of Terror!", a marvelous scrapbook that provides a
comprehensive checklist of the publisher's--EC Comics--titles, as
well as a variety of interviews with and insiders' accounts of the
principal artists and writers in the EC stable, among them Harvey
Kurtzman, Will Elder and Al Feldstein.</TE>
<TE>   The volume contains vivid photographic reproductions of every EC
cover from Picture Stories From the Bible (1942-46) to Psychoanalysis
(1955). In addition, it offers a highly eccentric grab bag of
writings by members of the EC stable, among the most memorable of
which is Gaines' "Narrative Illustration," a thumbnail history of the
genre beginning with Sumerian pictographs and ending with modern
pulps.</TE>
<TE>   During the Senate subcommittee hearing, Sen. Estes Kefauver
attacked Gaines like a dutiful bulldog: "Here is your May 22 issue
[of Crime SuspenStories]. This seems to be a man with a bloody ax
holding a woman's head up which has been severed from her body. Do
you think that is in good taste?" Gaines was unflappable: "Yes sir, I
do, for the cover of a horror comic. A cover in bad taste, for
example, might be defined as [depicting] the head a little higher so
that the neck could be seen dripping blood from it and moving the
body over a little further so that the neck of the body could be seen
to be bloody."</TE>
<TE>   One cannot but applaud the cheeky Gaines for his public commitment
to the necessary pleasures of representation, both satirical and
cathartic, in a culture that even 50 years later continues to harbor
deep puritanical ambivalences about the libidinal excitements of the
work of art.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the subcommittee's campaign against EC and concomitant
articles in Time and Newsweek resulted in the promulgation of the
notorious Comics Code, causing so many financial pains for Gaines
that he soon had to shut down most of his titles. This is, of course,
the real tale of terror, and one that is told with sadness and brio
in this volume, which celebrates the staggering invention of Gaines'
remarkable comics enterprise.</TE>

<HD>The Scene of the Crime</HD>
<DH>VIETNAM, NOW: A Reporter Returns, By David Lamb,
PublicAffairs: 276 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL BRIGHTMAN</AU>
<BD>Carol Brightman is the author of "Writing Dangerously:
Mary McCarthy and Her World." She was the founder and editor of
Viet-Report and has returned to Vietnam several times to gather oral
histories on the wars in Indochina.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Times have changed since 1997, when the young bartender at the Polite
Pub told David Lamb that "Hanoi is like being in the center of the
universe." That was at the start of the former wartime reporter's
four-year stint as the Los Angeles Times' Vietnam correspondent;
before the Asian financial crisis, the Mekong Delta floods and
Hanoi's foot-dragging over free-market reforms took their toll. The
city's streets were alive with the roar of new Honda scooters and the
sounds of saws, welding torches, jackhammers--and everywhere the
eager faces of Americans, bringing tidings of release from the long
postwar penury.</LD>
<LD>   In 1994 President Clinton lifted the U.S. trade embargo. In a
process that had started the year before, mail and telephone links
were restored; the U.S. veto of Vietnam's membership in the U.N. was
withdrawn; and credits and loans from the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank were unblocked. Still unfulfilled, however, was
President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's 1973 pledge
to send Vietnam $3.3 billion in reconstruction aid.</LD>
<TE>   Soon the scarred battlefield was a new frontier for American
investors who hoped to cash in on the takeoff of another Asian tiger.
This chain of events was impossible to anticipate, except perhaps by
Hanoi's officials: When Saigon fell in 1975, Lamb reports, they
replaced all the embassy flags but ours with the flag of a unified
Vietnam. "We do not want to humiliate the Americans," one said. "They
will come back." Hanoi, like Ho Chi Minh, has always taken a long
view of relations with Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam, of course, is far from the center of things today.
Terrorism has replaced communism as a mutable conspiracy and
Washington seems to be gearing up for another open-ended crusade.
U.S. capital does not roam the Third World in search of cheap buyouts
of state industries as it did a few years ago (though the search for
cheap labor never ends). But Vietnam's fortunes have begun to elicit
a different kind of attention than they did in boom times.</TE>
<TE>   Hanoi's reluctant capitalists have won the grudging respect of
international lenders who, according to Lamb, have come to see in the
government's stubborn resistance to privatization something like the
vigilance and patience that served the country well during centuries
of conflict with powerful invaders. In addition to the $3 billion in
development aid the World Bank put together each year he was there,
the pot was "sweetened ... with millions more in incentives if
Vietnam took certain steps toward achieving a free-market economy."
Hanoi refused the bait; the extra reforms were not adopted; and the
country, though prospering--today Vietnam has the fastest-growing
economy in the region--has suffered none of the political, financial
and social chaos of Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't pressure these guys," the World Bank's Albert Steer
tells Lamb. "They do things their own way, at their own pace. If they
thought we were interfering, I have no doubt they'd say, 'Thanks for
your help in the past and now it's time for you to go home.' " They
have their priorities, and high-speed Internet access, broad-band
radio and more hotels are not high on the list. Political stability,
education, better roads and more plentiful rice harvests are.</TE>
<TE>   "Vietnam, Now" offers a tantalizing glimpse of this new kind of
relationship between East and West. But the book's freshest voices
are those of the Vietnamese, north and south, who testify to the
evolution of a war-ravaged backwater into a fast-growing nation with
a fierce sense of destiny. The voices include veterans from the Ho
Chi Minh Trail and their sons who travel it as engineers; the former
Time journalist in Saigon who secretly worked for the Vietcong; a
retired North Vietnamese Army colonel who fought the French,
Americans and Khmer Rouge; an ex-supreme court justice from the south
who was sent to a re-education camp in 1975; the wartime radio
propagandist Hanoi Hannah; Amerasians in the Philippines; and Viet
Kieu--Overseas Vietnamese ("strong in grey matter and deep in the
pockets" according to one Hanoi bureaucrat) going home to seek their
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   The Westernized David Thai left Vietnam in 1972, grew up in Orange
County, went to the University of Washington and then, briefly in
1995, to the University of Hanoi. He returned a few years later with
$700 and big plans; but "[o]nce you think you're Mr. Big," he says,
"the Vietnamese are going to take it out on you." He lost his money
but went on to found Hanoi's popular Au Lac Cafe (Lamb's outdoor
office), where he ran "smiling workshops" for employees and a school
to teach local kids math and English.</TE>
<TE>   Lamb, meanwhile, has fallen in love with a city "whose bombing I
had once cheered," and is driven by his wartime memories to seek
closure. This search is more problematic. "I more or less supported
the U.S. intervention," he writes, " ... because I thought that
whenever and wherever America went to war, the honorable thing was to
jump on the bandwagon." Antiwar activists, he maintains, were "smart
enough to duck the threat of death in combat," and (quoting Tom
Wolfe), " 'to shift the onus [of the war] onto those who fought.' "
Nor does he believe that America really lost the war; rather, "we
chose not to win ...."</TE>
<TE>   These are oddly unreflective views for a veteran war
correspondent, and they go hand in hand with a ritual anticommunism
that erupts at unlikely moments. Between a defense of Vietnam's human
rights record (better than China's and Singapore's, Lamb says) and an
account of its economic progress, he writes that "almost
everyone--except the Old Guard who was scared stiff of losing its
iron-tight grip on power--knew Vietnam was adrift, a communist state
floundering in a noncommunist world."</TE>
<TE>   You can't change the past--and indeed, behind the pro-Americanism
that Lamb finds nearly everywhere, there are surely old-timers in
Hanoi who will say (as one did to me in 1994), "I have forgiven but I
will never forget." What can change is one's understanding of the
past. And by and large Lamb's hasn't. He seeks "closure" but his
antipathies remain. Closure, that most American of cravings, becomes
a substitute for confronting history, a form of resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "The light of closure" arrives for Lamb with Clinton's visit to
Hanoi in October 2000. Clinton, he writes, symbolized "all that was
ironic and inexplicable about the war: The most prominent American to
dodge the jungles of Vietnam was the one who would make
reconciliation and closure a hallmark of his presidency." The United
States, however, was unlikely to abandon a corner of the Pacific
where traditionally its trading and military interests were robust.
And the real irony is that, in the 1990s, it was Hanoi's communists,
seeing a U.S. partnership as bringing new technology and offsetting
the great power interests of Japan and China, who worried more about
America's ability to pursue its strategic interests in Asia than
Washington did.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994 Trade Minister Le Van Triet told a Washington audience
that he hoped the U.S. "will be our big and lasting cooperative
partner in the socioeconomic rebirth of Vietnam." The fear that it
wouldn't was brought home to me during a visit to Vietnam in 1995,
when a scholar at Hanoi's Center for North American Studies asked if
it was true "that America's role is decreasing in Asia after the Cold
War?" If so, she wondered, how does the U.S. plan to "rebuild its
stature in Asia in the future?"</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, U.S. multinationals had made a tactical retreat, leaving
behind (for a while) empty offices, unfinished hotels and stockpiles
of shampoo and soap. In Hanoi, Clinton delivered an artful speech
that avoided great power hectoring about human rights and probably
helped turn relations around. He depicted the war as an intrusion on
a "common history," pointing to Thomas Jefferson's attempt to import
rice seeds from Vietnam 200 years ago and to how Jefferson's words
("All men are created equal ... ") "echoed in your own Declaration of
Independence" in 1945. He broke ranks from American officialdom by
referring to the "staggering sacrifices of the Vietnamese people on
both sides of that conflict--more than three million brave soldiers
and civilians." As for the 3 million U.S. soldiers who served in
Vietnam, along with journalists, embassy personnel and aid workers,
they are "forever connected to your country" through a "shared
suffering," which has, he said, created a "relationship unlike any
other."</TE>
<TE>   It was a remarkable piece of statecraft, which went on to credit
the handful of servicemen who took the first step toward
reconciliation in 1981. "We cannot change the past," Clinton
concluded, quoting then-U.S. ambassador and former POW Pete Peterson.
"What we can change is the future." Change is the pivotal word; but
if Lamb's ambivalence toward Hanoi's leadership reflects a wider
American view, and I think it does, change will come harder for us
than it has for Vietnam.</TE>

<DH>STATECRAFT: Strategies for a Changing World, By Margaret
Thatcher, HarperCollins: 512 pp., $34.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL EMMOTT</AU>
<BD>Bill Emmott is editor of The Economist. His new book,
"20:21 Vision: 20th-Century Lessons for the 21st Century," will be
published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux early next year.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Statecraft" is an odd book by an odd woman who was nevertheless one
of Britain's--and arguably the world's--greatest political leaders of
the last half of the 20th century. Many in Britain, though probably
fewer in the United States, would contest that claim to greatness.
But it is justified by the fact that in the 1980s she managed to
drive through radical changes in her country and inspire some radical
changes abroad, at a time of peace, when there was no crisis in
Britain or the wider world to help her along. To be a wartime leader
is not easy, but it comes naturally to many politicians. To be a
peacetime leader is far harder, especially in democracies.</LD>
<LD>   That helps explain why Margaret Thatcher has continued to command
a worldwide following and an audience for so long since her departure
from elected office in 1990. No other living British prime minister
has done so, and few American presidents have either. Yet she has
managed to publish two volumes of memoirs and, until the 76-year-old
recently retired from public life on the recommendation of her
doctors, was able to get not only fat fees for her lectures but also
plenty of ears eager to hear what she had to say. She has had little
influence in Britain as a whole in recent years but has retained a
heavy, if sometimes destructive, influence in her Conservative Party.</LD>
<TE>   What "Statecraft" makes plain, though, is that Thatcher continues
not just to command attention but also to crave it. When her party
ejected her from office in 1990, a famous photograph showed her
looking tearfully through the window of her limousine as she left the
prime minister's office at No. 10 Downing St. for the last time. She
did not want to leave and has not wanted to retire gracefully. She
thinks the world still has need of her advice.</TE>
<TE>   "Statecraft," her latest vehicle for this mission, is a misleading
title, as it implies some sort of disquisition on the art of
government or international relations, perhaps along the lines of
Henry Kissinger's magisterial "Diplomacy." A more accurate title
would have been "The State of the World and What Should Be Done About
It." The book is essentially an outline of world affairs today,
especially in terms of great-power politics and threats to security,
with policy recommendations for governments of all stripes.</TE>
<TE>   Two things make the book an odd read. One is that it is an often
uneasy blend of personal anecdote with broader, more objective
analysis. The anecdotes could have been rewarding if they had mainly
covered Thatcher's period in office. But because the book is about
contemporary affairs, they mainly cover her time as a former leader
rather than an actual one. The many quotes from her speeches around
the world during the 1990s, giving her brave words and reporting on
the rapturous applause, soon become tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   Most of her anecdotes tell you more about Thatcher than about
world affairs. The best example is her story of how, when Gen.
Augusto Pinochet was put under arrest in Britain at the behest of a
Spanish judge, she sent him a commemorative plate of Britain's
Elizabethan defeat of the Spanish armada. We have seen off the
Spanish before and will do so again, was the rather clunky message
she was sending her friend. To the reader, though, another message
comes through: that for all her talk of liberty and democracy,
Pinochet's support during Britain's war with Argentina over the
Falkland Islands in 1982 matters more to her than stories of his
brutality as Chile's dictator.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, for the most part, her broader analysis is good and makes
for salutary reading. She is a robust admirer of America and a robust
supporter of its interventionist military role as the world's
sheriff. Rightly, at least with hindsight, she argues that it should
have acted sooner and more decisively during the Balkan wars in the
1990s, and that it must be supported now in its fight not just
against Osama bin Laden but also against rogue states seeking to
develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction. As an old cold
warrior, she exhibits, not surprisingly, a continuing suspicion of
Russia and its motives, though she may nevertheless be out of date in
doing so. Her hardheaded and principled views on China are more
convincing, though the moral distinction between her support for
Pinochet and her dislike of his Chinese equivalents is hard to
discern.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case with the books of doers rather than writers,
there has been much speculation about who actually wrote
"Statecraft." The likeliest answer seems to be that, as an
experienced user of speech writers, Thatcher employed a team of
people to draft different sections of it, and then superimposed her
anecdotes and some more of her own views, for the style is disjointed
and quite variable.</TE>
<TE>   Another clue comes from the second odd feature of the book: that,
at the end of each section and often subsection, there is a list of
bullet points, in bold type, giving potted recommendations on each
topic. This may have been an editor's attempt to bring cohesion to a
rather rambling collection of thoughts, but it gives "Statecraft"
something of the flavor of a management book rather than of a learned
essay on current affairs.</TE>
<TE>   This is odd, but what makes Thatcher truly odd--and what in the
end makes "Statecraft" more damaging than beneficial to her
reputation--is that she continually shows herself to be not the
principled politician of conviction of long renown but actually a
prejudiced and rather vindictive person. She loves fighting old
battles, settling old scores. She also thinks that the only people in
the world who are worth listening to and trusting are the roughly 400
million residents of the English-speaking countries.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans, Asians, Latin Americans (except Pinochet) and Africans
simply don't have a chance in Thatcher's eyes. They do not trace back
their political and legal values to the Magna Carta. They are all, in
her eyes, collectivists rather than freedom-loving individuals. It is
all the more surprising therefore that having supported British
membership of the European Union during the 1970s and having helped
to deepen that market during her time as prime minister, she now
thinks Britain ought to leave that ghastly grouping, run as it is by
bureaucrats and foreigners. To be critical of European countries and
of the European institutions is fine: There is plenty to criticize
and to change. But in this book Thatcher goes beyond that, arguing in
essence that Europe is always to be distrusted because it is full of
Europeans and in her lifetime Europeans have always caused trouble.
It is time for her to retire, even if she cannot do so gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Statecraft'</TE>
<TE>   I only met General Pinochet after he had ceased to be President of
Chile. But I had indirect contact with him much earlier, at the time
of the Falklands War in 1982. At that time Chile provided vital
assistance to us without which, I am convinced, many more of our
servicemen would have lost their lives. ...</TE>
<TE>   I felt grateful to the Chilean President and to Chile, and this
influenced my later action when ex-President Pinochet found himself
in difficulties. But I was moved by more than sentiment. It is in a
country's interests to keep faith with its allies. States in this
sense are like people. If you have a reputation for exacting favors
and not returning them, the favors dry up. ... I was and am convinced
that General Pinochet by his actions turned Chile into the free and
prosperous country we see today.</TE>

<HD>Future Shock</HD>
<DH>THE SCAR,  By China Mieville, Ballantine: 800 pp., $18.95
paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any choice of artistic method involves trade-offs. China Mieville is
a fantasist. In his novel "Perdido Street Station," and now in its
sequel, "The Scar," he has imagined the city-state of New Crobuzon, a
not-quite Victorian London set in the world of Bas-Lag, a not-quite
Earth in which 19th century science coexists with sophisticated
magic, in which humans jostle not with other races but with other
intelligent species: eel-people, mosquito-people, cactus-people,
vampires.</LD>
<LD>   The protagonist of "The Scar" is a woman, Bellis Coldwine, who has
fled New Crobuzon for political reasons. She books passage on a ship
for a colony as distant as Australia is from England. The colony,
like Australia, is being settled by convicts, some of whom are packed
in the ship's hold. Many of the convicts have been "Remade" in
government factories: for greater utility, as with a woman named
Angevine, who was grafted onto a steam engine; or just for spite, as
with a man, Tanner Sack, who had octopus-like tentacles surgically
attached to his chest.</LD>
<TE>   Bas-Lag has more water than Earth, less land. Its periphery is
unmapped and full of monsters. Its ocean floor has sinkholes of
unplumbed depth. New Crobuzon is a mercantile and naval power, but it
is hardly comparable to the British Empire. Bellis' ship has just
left home waters when it is stormed by pirates, who take the
survivors to the floating outlaw city of Armada. The convicts,
granted freedom and equality, quickly transfer their loyalties. For
Bellis, it's not so simple.</TE>
<TE>   New Crobuzon has persecuted her, but it's still her home. Her
desire to communicate with that city, if not to return, grows more
acute when Silas Fennec, a shape-shifter and spy, confides details of
a plot by Arctic eel-people, the grindylow, to invade New Crobuzon.
The only chance to warn the city seems to be for Bellis, a linguist,
to be part of an Armadan expedition to the island of the
mosquito-people, where trading ships sometimes stop.</TE>
<TE>   But this means that Bellis will have to aid her captors. Their aim
is to contact a scholar among the mosquito-people who can help them
raise an avanc--a mile-long beast from an ocean sinkhole--and harness
it with giant chains to pull Armada. No longer dependent on currents,
winds and its own feeble tugboats, Armada will be able to strike
where it wishes and escape retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Surely Mieville is right to fantasize; he has a gift for it and a
polished style. Armada, a mile-square metropolis cobbled together
over the centuries from captured ships, constantly rotting,
constantly renewed, its districts ruled by everything from a bumbling
democracy to a vampire, Brucolac, who imposes a "goretax," is
stunningly detailed.</TE>
<TE>   And the story of "The Scar" is quite a yarn, full of naval
battles, tempests, dirigible flights and feats of sorcery. It's seen
mostly through Bellis, but also through Tanner, who undergoes more
surgery on Armada to become an amphibian; Shekel, a cabin boy who
becomes Angevine's lover and is taught by Bellis to read; the
mysterious Silas and fearsome undersea "hunters" whose identity is
revealed only at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Besides entertaining us with the new and the exotic, fantasies
such as "Star Wars" and "The Lord of the Rings" can offer moral
visions clearer than reality allows. They do so, in part, by obliging
us to view familiar things afresh. The suffering of Mieville's
convicts, for example, may be no worse than the Australian penal
regime described by Robert Hughes in "The Fatal Shore," but because
the surgery forced on Tanner and Angevine is a new kind of atrocity,
it recaptures our attention.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the trade-offs are inevitable. Imagining the world anew, as
Mieville does, requires copious description, and fantasy novels tend
to be long. Characterization is scant, even in the case of Mieville,
who is interested in his characters and tries to make of the austere,
often unfriendly Bellis an admirable truth-seeker. Our sense of
character is grounded in our own experience, in the real world; the
more a fantasy diverges from that, the simpler its characters have to
be.</TE>
<TE>   Mieville's characters are more complex than, say, George Lucas'
because "The Scar," sacrificing the mythic power of purer fantasy,
diverges less than it seems to. It's really a World War II or Cold
War thriller in disguise. We feel we know Bellis and Tanner, little
people manipulated by Armada's and New Crobuzon's sinister leaders,
peeling back layers of political intrigue and betrayal. They are
secondary to the action, as thriller characters always are, but
rooted in a familiar and credible world.</TE>

<DH>THE FORGETTING: Alzheimer's: Portrait of an Epidemic, By
David Shenk, Doubleday: 290 pp., $24.95 * LOSING MY MIND: An Intimate
Look at Life  With Alzheimer's, By Thomas DeBaggio, The Free Press:
208 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>Robert Lee Hotz is a science writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At age 76, Ralph Waldo Emerson, that serene titan of 19th century
American letters, was invited by a friend at the Harvard Divinity
School to lecture at his home. To the gathered admirers, Emerson
delivered an essay on memory he had written some 22 years before.</LD>
<LD>   "As gravity holds matter from flying into space, so memory gives
stability to knowledge," Emerson read aloud. "Memory performs the
impossible for man by the strength of his divine arms; holds together
past and present, beholding both, existing in both, abides in the
flowing, and gives continuity and dignity to human life. It holds us
to our family, to our friends. Hereby home is possible; hereby only a
new fact has value."</LD>
<LD>   How poignant then that, as Emerson spoke those words, his own
memory was failing. He could no longer recognize his own text. In his
dotage, he had lost his place in time and was no longer able to form
new memories or to retrieve the old. He was pinned to the moment,
like a place in the essay text that he marked with his moving finger
as he read. Almost certainly, Emerson had Alzheimer's disease, and it
robbed him of the asset he prized most: an organized mind.</LD>
<TE>   For David Shenk, Emerson's descent into oblivion perfectly
embodies the horror of a disease that destroys memory and
self-awareness. In "The Forgetting," Shenk has drawn together threads
of neurobiology, art history and psychology into a literary portrait
of Alzheimer's disease perfectly balanced between sorrow and wonder,
devastation and awe. "The Forgetting" is a remarkable addition to the
literature of the science of the mind.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease;
as many as 80 million worldwide are expected to be in its grips by
2050. For every one brain Alzheimer's infects, it also ravages
several other people: those who are driven into exhaustion,
depression and sometimes bankruptcy caring for people with the
disease. Given its ubiquity, Shenk relates, it is all the more
remarkable that it took so long to recognize that the
absent-mindedness of old age was often a disease. The first
acknowledged Alzheimer's patient was admitted to a hospital in
Frankfurt, Germany, in 1901. "I have lost myself,'' she complained.
The 51-year-old hausfrau was diagnosed by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, the
neuropathologist who eventually gave the condition its name.</TE>
<TE>   But not until the 1970s did Alzheimer's disease truly become part
of the medical lexicon as a progressive dementia that always begins
in the same place: a tiny part of the brain shaped like a cashew
called the hippocampus. This structure is crucial in the creation of
long-term memories. In Alzheimer's disease, the neural cells of the
cerebral cortex become choked with brown spherical plaques and
swollen with tangled filaments. The neurons die, and as the disease
spreads, it claims other mental faculties. An Alzheimer's patient
dies twice. He loses first his memory of life, then life itself. No
one knows its cause, an effective treatment or its cure.</TE>
<TE>   Every disease holds its particular terror. Alzheimer's is so
unsettling because it is aimed so pointedly at what makes us human.
In "Losing My Mind," Thomas DeBaggio vividly articulates the profound
shock and despair of one person in the early stages of Alzheimer's
disease. It is a story made all the more compelling because that
person is himself. He writes himself on to the page as he is
deconstructed by disease. "There are hints every day now that it will
not be long before I look but am not able to unscramble what I see,
seek the simple word but be unable to write it correctly on the page.
Am I anything without my memory and the simple skills of reading and
writing that I learned in childhood?" DeBaggio asks. "I will soon be
stripped of language and memory, existing in a shy and unsteady
forbearance of nature." There is illumination in the dying of his
light.</TE>
<TE>   These books haunt my memory. I carry them encoded in a lattice of
electrical potentials across interlaced neurons and synapses. My
memories link to other memories: to that of a lawyer I know whose
mother no longer can recognize him, to a woman I once met whose
husband is drained of the mind that animated their marriage, to a
psychologist I visited who studies the chemistry of these damaged
brains. These thoughts link in turn to a poem by Hart Crane, to a
melody I cannot place, and on through the corridors in the palace of
memory.</TE>
<TE>   So fickle are the ways of the brain, science now teaches us, that
much of what we remember most accurately may not be even true. How
much of us is a fiction? We trail a thread of recollection behind us
as we navigate life's labyrinth. When this tether breaks, we lose our
way in the world and in ourselves. "Forgetfulness is like a song /
That, freed from beat and measure, wanders," Crane wrote.</TE>
<TE>   As a journalist, I have made a life's study of research into the
human brain. I have seen the living tissues and the active neural
circuits laid bare before me in the operating room. After reading
these two books, I can think of no more compelling evidence than
Alzheimer's to argue that there is no immortal soul or self separate
from these synapses. Yet who among us can accept that our self is
solely the sum of these special cells? I think of DeBaggio one day
soon staring at his book and, like Emerson, not recognizing his own
hard-won words.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Forgetting'</TE>
<TE>   The first few slips get chalked up to anxiety or a lousy night's
sleep or a bad cold. But how to consider these incidents of
disorientation and confusion when they begin to occur with some
frequency? What begin as isolated incidents start to mount and soon
become impossible to ignore. In fact, they are not incidents;
collectively, they are signs of a degenerative condition. Your brain
is under attack. Months and years go by. Now you are losing your
balance. Now you can no longer make sense of an analog clock. Now you
cannot find the words to complain about your food. Now your handsome
young husband has disappeared and a strange elderly man has taken his
place. Why is someone taking your clothes off and pouring warm water
over you? How long have you been lying in this strange bed?</TE>

<DH>TRAINS OF THOUGHT: Memories of a Stateless Youth, By Victor
Brombert, W.W. Norton: 336 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Douglas Johnson is the author of "France and the
Dreyfus Affair" and other books and is emeritus professor of French
history at the University of London.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever Victor Brombert looks at Monet's painting of the
Saint-Lazare station in Paris, he sees himself climbing onto a train,
tennis racket in hand, elated by the prospect of a trip to the
seaside, the dreaded school examinations over. Years later, he stayed
awake all night on the sleeper between Pisa and Paris, perhaps to
perpetuate the child in him who did not want to miss one instant of
the joy of traveling.</LD>
<LD>   "At the beginning was the train," is how Brombert opens his
striking memoir, "Trains of Thought: Memories of a Stateless Youth."
From the outset, the reader learns that Brombert has always been on
one or another of them. He even wishes he had been born on one. His
memory leads continuously toward trains; he views his life as a
shuttle between past and present.</LD>
<TE>   He sees himself as a boy in Nice, running on the Promenade des
Anglais, pretending to be a locomotive, imitating its sounds, moving
his forearms to imitate the driving rods of the wheels. And then he
recalls that he was not at school that day because of the death of
his little sister. On another occasion, he remembers traveling with
his father when their train made a stopover in Cologne. In search of
a glass of beer, his father went to the station buffet, and Brombert
went with him. They suddenly felt uncomfortable as they became aware
of the hostile Germanic faces and uniforms that surrounded them. His
father downed his glass, and they hurried back to their train. It was
at this moment that he became aware of the oppressive atmosphere of
the early 1930s. As a child, he loved looking at old photographs of
World War I and envied the French soldiers, crowded into their
trains, enthusiastically waving their flags as they left for the
trenches. The Jewish child could not then know, nor could his
parents, who disapproved of such a young boy looking at the
photographs, that there would be other trains that would take people
to the terminal stations of Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   Proust, too, saw the idea of travel as a way to unlock memory, as
a voyage in reverse, going over the routes that have been covered
before. Like Proust, Brombert takes imaginary journeys. He watches a
train leave a station and reads the signs that spell out its
destinations. He tells us that, even now, as he is trying to sleep,
he hears a sinister locomotive whistle. This is the whistle that is
dimly heard through the Shanghai fog by the wounded prisoners in
Andre Malraux's novel "Man's Fate." They know that they are about to
be thrown alive into the boiler of the locomotive. Malraux's whistle
has a resonance for Brombert, as he reflects on all that has happened
and on all from which he has been spared.</TE>
<TE>   For salvation, too, came on trains: There was the night train from
Leipzig into Switzerland where Nazi agents were looking for Jews, and
the conductor played dumb as Brombert and his parents made their way
to France. Or there was the train that took him and his parents from
the Spanish frontier to Madrid on their way to America. His parents
had left Moscow after the revolution of 1917 and settled in Germany.
They left Germany when Hitler came to power in 1933 and settled in
Paris. In July 1941, they escaped from Vichy France to Spain, from
where a banana boat, overcrowded with refugees, took them to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Brombert was 9 when his family settled in Paris. His language
became French, although his parents and other relatives made sure
that he did not forget his Russian. His memoirs describing his life
in France tell the stories that one expects: days at the lycee, early
sentimental attachments, sexual initiations, literary appreciations,
the songs of Maurice Chevalier, Astaire and Rogers at the cinema. But
they also tell us much more.</TE>
<TE>   We get to discover Paris through the eyes of a boy. We ride
enthusiastically on the Metro and learn the names of stations that
are laden with history. There is Dupleix (the French colonial
administrator in India), there is the scientist Pasteur and the
historian Edgar Quinet.</TE>
<TE>   This is a beautifully written book. It has an elegance and is
never a mere recording of what happened in France between 1933 and
1941. The Brombert family was wealthy and somehow remained wealthy
even as the years darkened. As the war began, they left Paris for a
house in Deauville and a chateau in the neighboring Normandy
countryside. They had money with which to bribe officials so that
they could escape to America. They were also cultured and
interesting. Brombert's mother, a champion bridge player who relished
parallels between life and art, compared Mussolini's declaration of
war on a defeated France to the La Fontaine fable in which the donkey
appears at the last moment to insult and kick the dying lion. His
father, the tough businessman who loves Russian poetry and songs,
explains to his son, who insists that he is French and wants to stay
in France, how the complexities of life in Vichy France have to be
understood in terms of the upheavals of the Revolution and the
Terror.</TE>
<TE>   It is less in the tone of reminiscence and more in that of a
history that Brombert tells of June 8, 1944, two days after D-day,
when as a 21-year-old member of the U.S. Army intelligence team
assigned to an armored division, he landed on Omaha beach in
Normandy. Brombert took part in the battles of Saint-Lo and the
so-called "Falaise pocket," the fighting in the Hurtgen Forest, the
resistance to the German attack in Alsace. American losses were
enormous; whole units were decimated.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the experience is such that Brombert's memories
lack in continuity. But he tells his story neatly and directly. After
the devastation of the fighting, there were the horrors of
discovering the camps, the frustrations of trying to help the
refugees and the German people. As an intelligence officer, he tried
to find out everything that he could about the Nazis. Although he
didn't realize it at the time, as he took note of his discoveries, he
was embarking on the occupation that would win him fame as an
authority on French literature and as a distinguished university
professor.</TE>
<TE>   But first there had to be another beginning. In January 1946, the
ex-soldier was on the train from Boston to New York when it stopped
for a long time at New Haven, Conn. Brombert thought there was a
university there. He got off the train as it was about to pull out of
the station, became a student at Yale and stayed there for 25 years.
It was because he had gotten off the train on impulse. It was
something he had never done before.</TE>

<DH>SELECTED STORIES, By Robert Walser, Translated from the
German, by Christopher Middleton and others, Foreword by Susan
Sontag, New York Review Books: 198 pp., $12.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN KUNKEL</AU>
<BD>Benjamin Kunkel writes for several publications,
including the Nation and Dissent.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acritic once suggested that nothing revealed the melancholy character
of Robert Schumann's music better than his direction Im frolichen
Ton, in a cheerful tone. An explicit, deliberate joy is an anxious
one and this helps to explain why the stories and short novels of
Robert Walser, so abundant with declarations of pleasure and
happiness, give off such an air of fragility and sadness.</LD>
<LD>   The narrators of Walser's fiction all resemble one another and
resemble the Swiss writer himself. They are solitary, cheeky,
wide-eyed and, in two senses, rambling: they are given to long
digressions and to long walks through the countryside. They like
nothing more than to announce their joy in commonplace things. One
narrator is happy whenever he has the chance to bow: "I even bow
where it is not usual to do so, or when only toadies or imbeciles do,
so much in love am I with the procedure." Spaghetti is likewise
considered delectable: "How strange it seemed to him," another
narrator says of himself, "that he never tired of finding it tasty."
Even unhappiness is rescued for pleasure. In "Jakob von Gunten"
(1908), Walser's wonderful novel, Jakob says: "Of course, I like
sorrow very much as well, it's very valuable, very. It shapes one."</LD>
<TE>   It was a strange shape that Walser cut. Poor and alone,
unsuccessful, often exhilarated, living in bare rooms in German and
Swiss cities, taking his walks, writing and writing, making the
occasional joking proposal of marriage and working odd jobs, he seems
to have been a kind of truant schoolboy for most of his life. Born in
1878, the seventh of eight children, he left school at 14 and never
entirely settled down until he confined himself to a mental
institution at 51. "I was never really a child, and therefore
something in the nature of childhood will cling to me always, I'm
certain," his character Jakob says. (It's hard not to read Walser
autobiographically; he described the whole of his work as "a long,
plotless, realistic story" that "might be described as a variously
sliced-up or torn-apart book of myself.") Transferred involuntarily
to another mental institution in 1933, Walser remained there until he
died, out on a walk, on Christmas Day in 1956. His guardian had once
visited him in the asylum and asked whether Walser was still writing.
"I am not here to write," Walser replied, "but to be mad."</TE>
<TE>   Kafka loved to read Walser aloud to his friends, and the great
Austrian novelist Robert Musil, on first encountering Kafka,
characterized him as "a peculiar case of the Walser type." Yet Walser
is remote from these writers. His work has none of the heaviness or
darkness we associate with German-language writing, and none of
modernism's inclination to obscurity or monuments. Walser wrote
sketches, squibs, bagatelles, improvisations--and a few stories and
short novels. If, like many modern writers, he took humble daily life
for his subject, it was not with the aim of transfiguring it by
outrage or vision. "How nice it is," one story ends, "that spring
follows winter, every time!" Part of the mystery of Walser's art is
that these cheerful banalities and even tautologies--"Oh, how
beautiful beauty is, and how charming is charm!"--seem sharp and
bright, fragments of illumination. Sometimes he appears to be a holy
fool, and sometimes a writer mocking the very possibility of such a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   More of Walser's work is now obtainable in English. Two selections
of short pieces have been culled from the 10 collections Walser
published during his life and the four volumes of his uncollected
prose: New York Review Books has just reissued "Selected
Stories"--probably the book to start with--and a fine sampling called
"Masquerade and Other Stories" appeared in 1990. Walser also wrote
novels--as many as nine, he sometimes claimed. Only four have turned
up, including the two that have been translated into English: "Jakob
von Gunten" and "The Robber," the latter brought out only two years
ago in a resourceful translation by Susan Bernofsky. (Walser's
mixture of High German and Swiss German, his chirping colloquialisms
and unsteady tone, make him a trial for any translator, and in
"Selected Stories," Christopher Middleton has done particularly
graceful work.)</TE>
<TE>   These stories are arranged chronologically, and besides providing
the best introduction to Walser, they tell the story of his career.
We see that between 1907 and 1929 his prose retained all its
cleverness and agility while his narrators began more and more to
talk to themselves. As Musil's comparison indicates, Walser was at
one time relatively well-known, and the opening lines of "Helbling's
Story" (1914), are those of a writer sure of having an audience: "My
name is Helbling and I am telling my own story because it would
probably not be written down by anybody else.... I am an ordinary
person, almost exaggeratedly so. I am one of the multitude, and that
is what I find so strange." Like most Walser personae, Helbling is a
small person--in this case, a clerk--and almost impudent in his
modesty. As in "Jakob von Gunten," where the haughty narrator enrolls
himself in an academy for servants, his task is fitting the
dimensions of the spirit to the humble size of the life.</TE>
<TE>   But Walser himself very much wanted money and recognition, and was
tormented to receive less and less of each as time went on. He was
still able to publish his short pieces into the 1920s, but the editor
of the Berliner Tagblatt received threats of canceled subscriptions
"if the nonsense didn't stop." Walser's prose had become increasingly
disjunctive and unconcerned with plot, his lines beginning to
interrupt and interrogate themselves: "but what kind of
sentence-disfiguring improprieties are these!" Many of the later
stories are no longer even stories, veering off from one line to the
next in unanticipated directions. Their subject is freedom, and so is
their mode. In 1928, in an "Essay on Freedom," Walser wrote: "One
should always be bowing inwardly to the pure image of freedom; there
must be no pause in one's respect for freedom, a respect which seems
to bear a persistent relation to a kind of fear."</TE>
<TE>   The acme of Walser's freedom and solitude came in "The Robber,"
the novel he finished in 1925. He didn't expect to see it published:
Writing in a tiny hand, he squeezed the manuscript onto 24 small
sheets of paper. For many years scholars assumed the book had been
written in a system of private notation; it was not until the 1970s
that Walser's minuscule script was recognized as being German.</TE>
<TE>   But "The Robber" is not the production of a madman. The title
character himself is not even an outlaw. His worst larcenies are to
have "pilfered numerous landscape impressions" and "purloined
affections." He is truant from society's two main customs: romantic
love and gainful employment, and the novel's deliberate confusion
between the "I" of the narrator and the "he" of the Robber seems to
imply that he provides most of his own company. Yet the story
concludes with the Robber going public--mounting a church pulpit and
justifying his aimless life to a congregation of adoring women. The
narrator finally commends the Robber to all society, saying: "Were he
not a true Croesus of foolishness, he wouldn't be half of what he is.
We think of him both as universal nonchalance and the conscience of
all mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Here, near the end of the writer's career, is its essence. His is
a puppyish prose, squirming with delight in its own motions and,
puppyishly, his narrators want two things above all: to disobey and
to be loved. Walser refused to grow up--to get married, to get a job,
to settle down, to make sense, to be serious. Yet he wanted to be
rewarded for his refusal with money and esteem. Nothing in Walser is
so bitter as the fantasies, as when the narrator of the long story
"The Walk," one of the "Selected Stories," strolls into a bank and is
promptly given 1,000 francs. The banker explains that "some kind and
noble benefactresses, moved by the sublime thought that to dam up
man's grief is beautiful, and to allay his distress is good, had
conceived the idea that a poor and unsuccessful poet (for you are
this, are you not?) might require assistance."</TE>
<TE>   Mature people will object that stipends can't be paid to idlers,
and know that the advocates of universal joy typically spend their
lives alone or embattled. But Walser knew this too. The happiness he
and his narrators are constantly expressing is really a proposal, a
fond wish, a happiness--if only. Sometimes the tone tips into
outright mockery, fierce with disappointment. No one can be as glad
as these imaginary people insist on being, and there are innumerable
reasons why. Modern literature has given misery a lot of company, and
joy has been perhaps its biggest taboo. The greatness of Robert
Walser--a modest greatness, he would submit--has to do with ignoring
this ban. "Can he say that?" the reader wonders, and then: "Why can't
I?"</TE>

<HD>Mencken's World of Words</HD>
<DH>H.L. MENCKEN ON AMERICAN LITERATURE, By H.L. Mencken,
Edited by S.T. Joshi, Ohio University Press: 284 pp., $44.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD LEITHAUSER</AU>
<BD>Brad Leithauser is the author of numerous books,
including "Darlington's Fall: A Novel in Verse" and "The Odd Last
Thing She Did: Poems."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When moved to scorn--and he was often scornful--H. L. Mencken was
never at a loss for words. He lampooned "quacks" and "dolts" and
"clodpolls," "snuffling publishers" and "jitney messiahs." He railed
against the writers of "tosh" and "balderdash," "flubdub" and
"buncombe" and "brummagem." He took aim at "skullduggery" and
"numskullery" and "humbuggery." He tore into "piffle" and "blather."</LD>
<LD>   Even if you knew nothing of Mencken, coming to him by way of this
fresh new collection, "H.L. Mencken on American Literature," you
would hardly be surprised to learn that in mid-career he published an
enormous linguistic study, "The American Language," whose
ever-expanding revisions and compendious supplements preoccupied him
nearly to the end of his long life. (Mencken was born in 1880, in
Baltimore, and died there in 1956.)</LD>
<LD>   He was especially fond of "gingery" words--the pungency of slang,
the rankness of a homespun vulgarity. The language of vitriol--the
righteous indignation of the affronted literary critic--came to him
naturally.</LD>
<TE>   Mencken, with his love of the vernacular, spoke of giving a book a
"mauling" or a "slating." These days, we're more likely to call it a
"trashing." Either way, the critic who has a flair for deft
dismissals is in possession of a highly prized, but ultimately
trivial, talent. Certainly, we don't now read Mencken to see him send
smartly on its way some long-forgotten book by some long-forgotten
author. Droll though he could be, Mencken didn't have that gift, so
vividly possessed by a successor of his like Randall Jarrell, for
converting a straw book into a golden denunciation.</TE>
<TE>   No, Mencken's critical talent--which was considerable--lay in an
ability to address full-bloodedly, with very little posing or
throat-clearing, an impressive range of material, much of it
assembled in "H.L. Mencken on American Literature." He cultivated an
invitingly lucid manner that often supported complicated thought.</TE>
<TE>   Mencken had an unusual knack for holding in his head, in dynamic
equilibrium, wholly contrary notions. Though critics customarily make
a show of presenting balanced views--ever ready to leap forward,
ambidextrously, with one more "on the other hand"--Mencken's example
reminds us of how rare is a critical capacity for regarding virtues
and vices simultaneously, without allowing one to cancel out the
other.</TE>
<TE>   Have the stylistic shortcomings of Theodore Dreiser ever been
pointed out more tellingly than by Mencken, who wrote of him, "You
may say that he writes with a hand of five thumbs, and that he has no
more humor than a hangman, and that he loves assiduity so much that
he often forgets inspiration altogether"?</TE>
<TE>   Mencken later added: "I often wonder if he gets anything properly
describable as pleasure out of his writing--that is, out of the
actual act of composition." And yet he also called Dreiser's "Jenny
Gerhardt" the "best American novel I have ever read, with the
lonesome but Himalayan exception of 'Huckleberry Finn.' " When he
says of Dreiser, "He must do his work in his own manner, and his
oafish clumsiness and crudeness are just as much a part of it as his
amazing steadiness of vision, his easy management of gigantic
operations, his superb sense of character," it's clear that Mencken
has done far more than arrive at a critical apercu: He has grappled
in a large-souled way with a large-souled writer.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of sentences in Mencken's review of Dreiser's "A Hoosier
Holiday" illuminate the peculiar verve and brilliance of both men: "I
know of no book which better describes the American hinterland ....
It is, in more than one way, the heart of America, and yet it has
gone undescribed. Dreiser remedies that lack with all his
characteristic laboriousness and painstaking."</TE>
<TE>   Better than the other critics of his time, and better than most of
the novelists he examined, Mencken understood how much of the
authentic American experience was going unharvested in its
literature. As a critic who initially aspired to become a poet, and
later longed to be a novelist, before eventually surmising that his
creative talents were not up to either task, Mencken keenly perceived
the poignancy of opportunities untapped or squandered.</TE>
<TE>   Hence his almost feverish embrace of early Sinclair Lewis,
particularly "Main Street" and "Babbitt." In the former, Mencken
found "the typical story of the typical American family"; in the
latter, "the average American of the ruling minority." In both, he
detected a clearheaded dissection of an ascendant national
phenomenon, a rising middle class whose conformity and unreflective
boosterism located it somewhere between tragedy and farce. Mencken
reveled in the observant, faithful-to-life ironies of Lewis, all the
more so because here was a reality which, although ubiquitous, most
writers failed to see.</TE>
<TE>   Although S.T. Joshi, editor of "H.L. Mencken on American
Literature," does a fine job with annotation and explication, he
makes a mistake in emphasizing Mencken's critical clairvoyance. Joshi
concludes his introduction with the observation that Mencken "played
his part--and it was a significant part--in establishing the American
literary canon, and all that remained was to confirm his judgments.
In large part, posterity has done exactly that."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, if Mencken was clear-sighted in one eye, he was surely
purblind in the other. He was someone who valued James Branch Cabell
over Henry James; who believed that "The Great Gatsby" was "not to be
put on the same shelf" with "This Side of Paradise"; who remained
oblivious while modern American theater underwent its bloody and
glorious birth; who scarcely noticed the burgeoning of American
modernism and the greatest flowering of poetry our country had ever
known.</TE>
<TE>   Nor--I'm sorry to say--does a lot of Mencken's humor hold up. He
might well have been talking about himself when, speaking presciently
of Ring Lardner, he predicted that much of his humor would be
"puzzling and soporific" by 2000. Mencken adored Lardner ("no other
contemporary American, sober or gay, writes better"), yet adoration
did not blind him to the notion that even the punchiest humor has a
way of turning into--a fine phrase--"archaic jocosities."</TE>
<TE>   One of Mencken's many biographers noted that "it is often
difficult to read him without tears of laughter streaming down one's
face"--but this is a difficulty that I, making my way through various
stretches of Mencken over the years, have always managed to surmount.
Although Mencken on occasion could be wittily quotable (as in his
classic characterization of the American puritan as someone beset by
"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy"), he was
far too much of a phrase-mill (some 2 million words of collected
reviews) to play the epigrammatist for long.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations about Mencken--as his example so splendidly reminds
us--can and probably should coexist with an unbudgeable affection and
admiration. While I was reading "H.L. Mencken on American
Literature," there were certainly times, especially during his
spirited discussions of tertiary figures (Percival Pollard? Paul
Elmer More? Will Levington Comfort?), when my patience thinned. But
this same spiritedness was what inspired him to remark, wonderfully,
of Sherwood Anderson, that "the fatuous omniscience of the average
novelist is not in him." Or of Howells: "He is never content to let
well enough alone: he is always impatient to put in everything he can
think of, to gild his lily until it shines like a set of false
teeth." Or of himself, after reviewing at a frenetic pace year after
year: He was a man with a heart "as bulged and battered as a
gladiator's ear."</TE>
<TE>   Dynamo that he was, Mencken savored the vitality of seemingly
irreconcilable viewpoints. I'd like to think he would have
sympathized with both of the voices in my head as I made my way
through this book. The one voice said, "This is not one of those
American critics, like T.S. Eliot or Randall Jarrell, to whom I must
return again and again." The other voice said, "Even when he's at his
most wrongheaded, there's something enlivening and irresistible about
Mencken. Praise him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   H.L. Mencken on Reviewing</TE>
<TE>   As for me, my literary theory, like my politics, is based chiefly
upon one main idea, to wit, the idea of freedom. ... Here the astute
reader may file a caveat: if I am so hot for freedom, then why do I
belabor fellows whose sole crime, at bottom, is that they express
their honest ideas in a banal and oleaginous manner? The answer is
simple: it is not their sole crime. I do not belabor them for
expressing their own ideas; I belabor them for trying to prevent
other men expressing theirs--that is, for trying to set up standards
and taboos that hinder the free play of the creative impulse. This
effort seems to me to be intrinsically immoral, however exalted the
purpose behind it. The essence of sound art is freedom.</TE>

<HD>Floating on Faith</HD>
<DH>LIFE OF PI: A Novel, By Yann Martel, Harcourt: 336 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANCIE LIN</AU>
<BD>Francie Lin is the associate editor of The Threepenny
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yann Martel's novel "Life of Pi" is the literary version of a large,
friendly dog; hardly has it committed some mild offense than it
rebounds with such enthusiasm, impishness and charm that one promptly
forgives it. The book concerns the life of Piscine Molitor Patel
(self-christened Pi), an Indian boy growing up in Pondicherry in the
1970s. Pi's father is the director of the zoo at the Pondicherry
Botanical Garden, and the family lives within the idyllic, hothouse
peace of the zoo grounds until at last, in 1977, the political
situation in India forces them to sell off their animals and move to
Canada. On their way to Toronto, their ship--a Japanese cargo ship
carrying, among other things, a Bengal tiger from the Pondicherry
zoo--sinks, and all members of the Patel family, excluding Pi, are
lost at sea.</LD>
<TE>   A pocket summary of "Life of Pi" doesn't quite do the book
justice, however, because despite its constant episodes of tragedy
and suffering, the story is written with a lightness and humor that
gives it the quality of a fairy tale. Consider the landscape of Pi's
religious life, for instance, which Martel paints with the gently
exaggerated proportions of a fable: "There are three hills within
Munnar ... on each stood a Godhouse. The hill on the right ... had a
Hindu temple high on its side; the hill in the middle, further away,
held up a mosque; while the hill on the left was crowned with a
Christian church."</TE>
<TE>   Each mountain has its guru, and in time Pi conquers each, becoming
a practicing Catholic, Hindu and Muslim, fending off the disapproval
of his priest, his pandit and his imam through the sheer force of his
own faith. "Bapu Gandhi said, 'All religions are true.' I just want
to love God," he tells his mystified parents, and continues unshaken
in his prayers toward Mecca and his intention to be baptized in the
Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Martel's wit gets the better of him and turns his
prose merely annoying and coy ("Why, Islam is nothing but an easy
sort of exercise," Pi notes upon first seeing a Muslim at prayer.
"Hot-weather yoga for Bedouins. Asanas without sweat, heaven without
strain"), but these moments are few and far between. This is
especially true once Pi, along with the Bengal tiger, becomes
stranded at sea on a lifeboat, where both parties survive for 227
days.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Martel's remarkable gift for storytelling asserts
itself, and there one encounters page after page of images and
observations riveting in their precision and insight. On lightning:
"The water was shot through with what looked like white roots;
briefly, a great celestial tree stood in the ocean." On the killing
of a dorado: "[It] did a most extraordinary thing as it died: it
began to flash all kinds of colors in rapid succession. Blue, green,
red, gold and violet flickered and shimmered neon-like on its surface
as it struggled. I felt I was beating a rainbow to death." On time:
"I survived because I made a point of forgetting. My story started on
a calendar day ... and ended on a calendar day ... but in between
there was no calendar ... Time is an illusion that only makes us
pant. I survived because I forgot even the very notion of time."</TE>
<TE>   It is a testament to Martel's talent that his narrative never
drags despite the fact that the movement of time in "Life of Pi" is
almost undetectable. All incidents take place in a kind of vacuum,
and in the hands of a lesser craftsman, they would seem scattershot
and random. What draws us on is not plot in any chronological sense
but rather the profound, infectious sense of wonder that runs the
length of the book. "Life's" peculiar, slightly dreamlike cast
eventually carries the reader to the last of Pi's trials, a brief
sojourn on an island floating, apparently unmoored, in the middle of
the sea. In a few short pages, Martel sketches a cankered paradise
that, in its quiet horror, rivals the best of dystopian fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Equally haunting is the aftermath of Pi's ordeal, the surprise of
which shouldn't be ruined here. Suffice to say that the ending
contradicts the statement, made twice in the book's introduction,
that "Life of Pi" is "a story to make you believe in God." Like
Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful," it is instead a story to make
you believe in the soul-sustaining power of fiction and its human
creators, and in the original power of storytellers like Martel.</TE>

<LD>A PLACE TO LIVE : And Other Selected Essays of Natalia Ginzburg,
Edited and translated from the Italian, by Lynne Sharon Schwartz,
Seven Stories: 240 pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Natalia Ginzburg grew up in Italy in the 1920s and '30s. She was
the daughter of nonobservant Jews, living at a time of fascism,
internment and war. Lynne Sharon Schwartz has deftly organized the
essays in "A Place to Live," beginning with "Human Relations" and
ending with "Fantasy Life," so that the reader gradually comes to
know Ginzburg and is prepared to read the rest of her fine work.
"Human Relations" shows how childhood bewilderment at the rage and
mysterious behavior of adults becomes shame and "stone-eyed" denial.
Parenthood brings suffering, followed by exhaustion, followed by
stone-eyed children and ends in compassion. All of the essays are
infused with Ginzburg's signature melancholy, the sadness of her
generation, a "people who will never feel at ease," a people that
understands "the fragility of vases of flowers, paintings and white
walls."</LD>
<TE>   "We have no more tears," she writes. "What moved our parents has
no power to move us." In the essay "My Craft," she writes in awe that
writing feeds on what is terrible and also what is wonderful in us.
She warns that writing cannot console but admits that it has, at
times, saved her.</TE>

<TE>   SHOPPERS: Two Plays, by Denis Johnson, HarperCollins: 224 pp.,
$12.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Here we are again, wiggling under the absurd scrutiny of an
authoritatively inflated government, and literature is rising to the
occasion, using its first battalion: satire. And Denis Johnson, one
of our finest satirists, is waxing dangerous. On the surface, his
timing and humor and his ability to mix contemporary life with
universal conundrums are well established from "Jesus' Son" to
"Already Dead" to "The Name of the World." But underneath his fine
writing is the ghost of George Orwell, howling and weeping through
humor at the self-importance we arrogate to ourselves, the things we
are distracted by and the sugarcoated palliatives we suck on in place
of religion.</TE>
<TE>   In "Shoppers," Johnson sets two plays in the margins of the West:
Houston, Texas, and Ukiah, Calif. "Hellhound on My Trail" takes on
bureaucracy in America. Marigold is a young woman employed by the
Department of Agriculture in a jam factory. She is interrogated in a
waiting room by a female agent working for the Food and Drug
Administration for "allegedly" asking a co-worker to cover certain
parts of her anatomy with jam and lick them off. It's Kafka and Camus
but with Johnson's own sick 21st century twist. The second play,
"Shoppers Carried by Escalators Into the Flames," pokes fun at our
lack of spirituality. It takes place in a lower-middle-income
apartment in Ukiah. A grandmother offers sarcastic wisdom for her son
and grandson. The ever-present TV is a character in the play,
announcing early on that shopping malls are burning across the
country. When one of the characters tries to quiet it by slapping it,
the TV shouts, "Violence? You wanna threaten me with violence? I am
the everlasting God of violence, pal." The play heats up in a kind of
religious hysteria, with Grandma at one point exclaiming: "I have not
felt the touch of the sacred in my heart since we crossed that line
into California .... I've got to get out of here. I've got to go,
I've got ...." "The president has called for calm," the TV intones.
"He met this afternoon in the Oval Office with advisors from.... "</TE>
<TE>   Look for the plays off-Broadway this summer. And when Johnson says
it's time to leave the country, a few of us are gonna start packing.</TE>

<TE>   LETTERS TO A YOUNG NOVELIST, By Mario Vargas Llosa, Translated
from the Spanish, by Natasha Wimmer, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 136
pp., $17</TE>
<TE>   When novelist Mario Vargas Llosa was 14, he would write to authors
he admired, such as "Faulkner, Hemingway, Malraux, Dos Passos, Camus,
Sartre," all of whom were alive at the time. The source of literary
inspiration, he learned, is rebellion. By imagining lives and
inventing futures, a writer imagines a different world. Writing, he
warns, requires utter devotion and servitude. Vargas Llosa spends
much of "Letters to a Young Novelist" describing the cosmology of the
novel, which rests on the four pillars of narrator, space, time and
level of reality. He uses examples from Melville, Cervantes, Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, Jorge Luis Borges and others.</TE>
<TE>   "Letters to a Young Novelist" has less heart than its namesake
"Letter to a Young Poet," by Rainer Maria Rilke. It is made of
sterner stuff, perhaps, in the end, better-suited for a middle-aged
novelist who has already tried and maybe failed and is willing and
ready to try again. Let the young ones dream a bit longer.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Frederick Exley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF TURRENTINE</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is a senior editor with Hemispheres
magazine and has written for the New York Times Magazine and
Slate.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago this week, while eating breakfast in my cubicle at a
large publishing company in Manhattan, I opened the New York Times
and learned that Frederick Exley had died. The obituary reported that
on June 17, 1992, the 62-year-old author of the autobiographical
novel "A Fan's Notes" succumbed to a stroke that had befallen him a
week earlier at his home in upstate New York, though anyone familiar
with that book had to wonder if Exley had finally done himself in
with one too many weekends of the "foodless, nearly heroic drinking"
he so vividly recounted in its pages.</LD>
<LD>   I finished reading, then called my roommate, Randy, whose
initiation into the cult of Exley I had recently effected by loaning
him my dog-eared copy of "A Fan's Notes" as well as its two sequels,
"Pages From a Cold Island" and "Last Notes From Home." There would be
no road-trip pilgrimage from Brooklyn up to Alexandria Bay, as I had
been imagining. We had missed the chance to embarrass ourselves at
Exley's front door, bearing welcome if cliched propitiations (a
bottle of Smirnoff, a carton of cigarettes) and sheepishly requesting
autographs from--or better yet, an audience with--the man whose
elegantly constructed, hilariously filthy sentences we were given to
quoting aloud. Randy and I mourned that evening in a private ceremony
at a neighborhood bar.</LD>
<TE>   I had arrived in New York a year earlier and had immediately begun
looking for Exley in the watering holes he'd frequented during his
well-documented time in the city, saloons like P.J. Clarke's in
Midtown, Chumley's in the far West Village and especially a place
called the Lion's Head across from Sheridan Square Park. Though I was
fully aware that he didn't live in Manhattan anymore, and though I
was barely old enough to drink legally, I would often drift into the
Lion's Head after work, plant myself at a stool with something by
Nabokov or Edmund Wilson (two of Exley's favorites, I knew) and order
what I thought to be a suitably manly concoction in anticipation of
that moment when Fred would walk in the door and--spying me from the
corner of his eye between bawdy reminiscences with old
friends--intuitively size me up as the rightful heir to his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, I half-believed, would begin my literary apprenticeship,
which would later flower into a perdurable filial bond that would
have me spending long weekends upstate with the old man, bar-hopping
and girl-chasing and commiserating over the sorry state of
contemporary American letters. Out of gratitude as much as admiration
for my talents, Fred would read, edit and ultimately champion my
manuscript, ensuring that it got into "the right hands"--a gesture of
paternal faith signaling my formal acceptance into his inner circle,
like an invitation to join one's dad and his buddies on a
deer-hunting trip.</TE>
<TE>   My own father had died of cancer when I was 12. I discovered "A
Fan's Notes" five years later, as a high school junior, by which time
I had successfully amalgamated a number of figures from popular
culture--a rock star here, a movie star there--into a many-faced
surrogate, a portable imago who combined those attributes I thought
most worth emulating.</TE>
<TE>   I don't remember how I came across the book, but I do remember the
feeling I had as I made my way through it at the expense of a week's
worth of math, science and history homework. Until that point, I had
been fed a typical high-schooler's diet: "Beowulf," "Macbeth," "A
Tale of Two Cities," "The Red Badge of Courage," "A Separate Peace."
All of our assigned texts seemed either solemn studies of individual
heroism or portentous warnings against over- ambition and hubris. I
liked each of them, but none of their authors made me laugh, made me
wince, made me reread passages over and over out of sheer joy, as
Exley did.</TE>
<TE>   "A Fan's Notes," if you haven't yet cracked it (and if you
haven't, you should), reads like the autobiography of the world's
most erudite barfly: a football-loving, vodka-swilling, dirty-minded
lout who brought to discussions of Saul Bellow or Robert Penn Warren
the same scholarship and enthusiasm he brought to evaluations of
Frank Gifford and his beloved New York Giants. To a 17-year-old
aspiring writer in search of authorial models--and not finding one in
Stephen Crane--it was a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Though I didn't care about football, I fell in love with Exley's
inimitable and just-slightly-overripe prose style. Here was someone
describing the most lurid of circumstances in the most elevated,
"fancy-sounding" language I'd ever encountered. (Later I would read
Anthony Trollope and Henry James and discover where Exley had picked
it up.)</TE>
<TE>   I was fascinated by the weird marriage of sacred form and profane
subject, but what I liked even more was the casual blasphemy with
which this strange man challenged my teachers' definitions of heroism
and over-ambition. His father--whom, I noted with special interest,
died of cancer when Fred was only 16--had been a legendary sports
hero in Watertown, N.Y., the kind of guy who was spoken of in barber
shops many years after his death.</TE>
<TE>   Fred grew up acutely aware of his own heroic patrimony and equally
aware of his inability to live up to it. This tension made him hungry
for fame in a way that I had been taught was unseemly and unhealthy.
"Other men might inherit from their fathers a head for figures, a
gold pocket watch all encrusted with the oxidized green of age, or an
eternally astonished expression; from mine I acquired this need to
have my name whispered in reverential tones," he wrote. Reading "A
Fan's Notes," I first began to decode the faint Oedipal messages
submerged deep within the American Dream. It wasn't just about doing
well, having a good job, buying a house, raising kids. It was also
about doing better, demonstrably better, than your father had done.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 years after its original publication, "A Fan's Notes"
is still a wonder. Formally, it blurred the line between novel and
memoir and anticipated future meldings. As a picaresque, it was
filled with good-natured ribaldry and sly wit. But it's probably best
viewed as a darkly comic pathography exposing those noxious
byproducts of the American Dream: fear and trembling. Exley, a
brilliant and bitter loser, was driven mad not just by alcohol but by
the inescapable fear that he would never amount to anything, a fear
amplified by his adulation of Gifford and other gridiron legends.</TE>
<TE>   He was doomed, he believed, never to surpass his upstate
working-class roots, doomed to live a life of passive hero-worship
from the bleachers of football games, doomed to be remembered by the
Watertown locals as his father's son and nothing more. At his lowest
point--and his life as chronicled in "A Fan's Notes" often seems like
a dazzling string of low points--a drunken Exley lashes out at a
mixed-race gay couple in Greenwich Village, exercising the coward's
prerogative of singling out members of the most marginalized
communities for special harassment. The street brawl that ensues
leaves Exley literally as well as spiritually in the gutter, bloodied
and weeping as he struggles to understand his own monstrousness.</TE>
<TE>   He concludes that it can only have been a desperate and pathetic
response to the sad realization that, in America, if you're not
somebody, you're nobody. Or as he puts it: "I fought because I
understood, and I could not bear to understand, that it was my
destiny--unlike that of my father, whose fate it was to hear the roar
of the crowd--to sit in the stands with most men and acclaim others.
It was my fate, my destiny, my end, to be a fan."</TE>
<TE>   The majestic irony of "A Fan's Notes," of course, is that Exley's
catalog of failures was a smashing literary success. It won him
instant celebrity and a nomination for the 1968 National Book Award.
Over time it has become a classic American cult novel, cherished by
succeeding generations of readers who marvel at their own capacity to
feel such sympathy for a man who often comes across (in his own
self-portrait!) as a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, arrogant,
self-pitying drunk.</TE>
<TE>   That Exley was somehow able to convey his basic humanity and to
make readers actually like him despite his flaws stands as one of the
greatest magic tricks in American literature. For some of us, "A
Fan's Notes" was inspirational in ways that novels by more famous
"canonized" writers could never be.</TE>
<TE>   Exley showed us that no life was too mundane or boring, or indeed
too ugly, to be turned into achingly beautiful art. Destined for
anonymity, he refused his destiny and defiantly wrote, fueled by
faith in his value as a man and an artist. To anyone who has
considered writing a novel but abandoned the idea after doubting his
or her ability to tell an interesting story, he set a fine--some
might even say fatherly--example.</TE>
<TE>   "Pages From a Cold Island," the 1974 follow-up to "A Fan's Notes,"
opens with the author learning of Wilson's death from the newspaper
obituaries. For the next 273 pages, Exley can't seem to make up his
mind whether he wants to write another boozy romp, a la "A Fan's
Notes," or a sober biography of Wilson, a literary giant and fellow
upstater onto whom Exley projected his own filial fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this is just what men who lose their fathers early in life
do: Pick another. Or maybe father-swapping on this order is a
perversion unique to writers, who are always on the lookout for icons
to worship (before, inevitably, toppling them). I do know that when I
read certain novels by Richard Ford or David Gates, or the eloquent
and rhapsodic sportswriting of Frank Deford, or even some of the
e-mails that Randy and I--still good friends a decade
later--exchange, I hear in the words of all these sons the
unmistakable Watertown accent of the sad-eyed but funny man at the
end of the bar. I feel extraordinarily lucky to have gotten to know
him.</TE>

<HD>Illness Without Metaphor</HD>
<DH>A LIFE SHAKEN: My Encounter with Parkinson's Disease, By
Joel Havemann, Johns Hopkins University Press: 176 pp., $24.95 *
LUCKY MAN: A Memoir, By Michael J. Fox, Hyperion: 260 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABRAHAM VERGHESE</AU>
<BD>Abraham Verghese is a physician, writer and the
author, most recently, of "The Tennis Partner."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its end stages, Parkinson's disease can reduce its victims to a
frozen, rigid, mute, unblinking, locked-in state. In writing about
their struggles with this disease, Joel Havemann and Michael J. Fox
display the opposite qualities: nimbleness, great passion,
hyper-alertness and an awareness of what is meaningful in life--as if
the disease has blessed them with special vision and a unique voice.
The beauty of such a narrative stance is that it not only transcends
the illness but surprises and captivates the reader.</LD>
<LD>   Both men can recall the exact moment when the first symptom
appeared that heralded the onset of this degenerative condition.
Havemann, a journalist with the Los Angeles Times, was at a
restaurant eating dessert; the task of spooning raspberries from his
plate to his mouth was suddenly impossible. Fox, the actor, woke up
one morning to find a " ... message in my left hand. It had me
trembling. It wasn't a fax, telegram, memo, or the usual sort of
missive.... In fact, my hand held nothing at all. The trembling was
the message." The trajectory of both men's lives was altered from
that moment on, and these memoirs are the result.</LD>
<TE>   "A Life Shaken" opens with Havemann sitting in his office at the
Washington bureau of The Times. He is on a deadline and work is
piling up, but his arms and legs shake uncontrollably. He can do
nothing but wait for his pills to take effect. When, after a long
time, they do, he notes: "With Parkinson's it feels so good just to
feel ordinary.... When my pills are working, I can move as smoothly
as the next guy. I can live life pretty much as I did before
Parkinson's landed me in the windowless room."</TE>
<TE>   Befitting Havemann's vast experience as a journalist, "A Life
Shaken" works hard to educate the reader about Parkinson's disease, a
condition associated with the triad of tremor, rigidity and
diminished movement. There are diagrams of the brain and basal
ganglia, and illustrations of the means by which the neurotransmitter
dopamine affects movement and muscle tone, and how its depletion in
Parkinson's patients can affect muscle control in the entire body.</TE>
<TE>   He reviews the history, the surgical options and the promising
research in Parkinson's disease. But Havemann's scientific discourse
never feels burdensome, perhaps because we have identified with him
so keenly from the opening pages, and we find ourselves seeking the
same knowledge about Parkinson's that he has discovered.</TE>
<TE>   His own Parkinson's saga has evolved over 11 years, beginning as
he managed a demanding job as a foreign correspondent in Brussels.
His aging father's illness, his mother-in-law's dementia and the
pleasures and trials of marriage and fatherhood often eclipsed his
own battles to control his symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "every week, every month, every year, the Parkinson's
beast grows fiercer." But, he says, "Parkinson's wins if it makes me
focus on the long term--and give up. My strategy is to concentrate on
the short term--and keep going." By the end of the book, we find
ourselves rooting for this person we did not know before.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, we all feel we know Fox before we pick up his book.
But perhaps we only thought we knew him. In "Lucky Man," Fox writes:
"Contrary to the happy-go-lucky image I cultivated, there were things
that worried me more than I'd let on. My health, however, had never
been one of them." He was completely unprepared for the "two words
the neurologist bludgeoned me with that day: Parkinson's disease."</TE>
<TE>   After this first chapter, detailing the onset of his illness, Fox
takes us back to his childhood in Canada where he was one of five
children born to a Canadian army officer and his wife. Being "tiny
and decidedly hyper compared to the other kids in that family, I was
considered something of an oddity." His thespian bent led to an
audition for a Canadian television part and then a move to Hollywood,
where he struggled. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast in
the TV series "Family Ties." "Pacific Bell had long since cut off
service to my apartment, and as I spelled out my contract
demands--modest by today's standards, but incredibly lucrative given
my financial straits--I was standing at a pay phone outside of a
Pioneer Chicken franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Fox writes, always with humor but also with insight, about his
subsequent rise to stardom and the other milestones in his life: his
marriage, his first child, his drinking and subsequent sobriety. When
he was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, he went into a sort of
denial, not seeing a neurologist, popping the pills for Parkinson's
disease which he carried loose in his pocket so that he could always
be "on" when he was on camera. By 1994, "My unwillingness to let
[wife] Tracy and [son] Sam see a version of me any less than ideal
put a certain distance between us ... so I lowered my guard at home,
allowed myself to be open with my symptoms around my family. What a
relief it was to relax for a change."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Havemann, Fox chose ablative neurosurgery to relieve the
symptoms on his left side. Parkinson's often affects one side of the
body before spreading to the other. The surgery involves screwing a
halo onto the skull, taking radiographic pictures and, after careful
measurement, passing a needle into the brain to destroy specific
cells. It is hazardous but can dramatically relieve certain symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery was successful, but to his great dismay, symptoms soon
developed on his right side. In 1998, Fox went public with his
disease, and his celebrity did much to bring attention to it. "In the
last couple of years, I've gone from talking to my agent on a
cellular phone to discussing cellular biology with some of the
world's leading scientists."</TE>
<TE>   Havemann and Fox both hope that a cure for the disease will come
soon, perhaps in their lifetime. President George W. Bush's
announcement last year of severe restrictions on funding fetal
stem-cell research seems particularly shortsighted after reading
these memoirs. The Michael J. Fox Foundation, as if to counter this
Luddite trend in Washington, has offered a $2.5-million grant to the
first researcher able to create a line of cells that produces
dopamine.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of these two poignant memoirs are very different men.
What they have in common, however, is not just Parkinson's, but the
fact that both have led interesting lives and both write well. One
senses that their memoirs would make good reading whether or not they
had Parkinson's disease. But their affliction has given them a
heightened sense of observation, a unique narrative stance, which
allows them to see the world in a different light. And both men have
been "lucky"--the sense in which Fox titles his book--in finding
meaning in their lives. It is precisely the sort of remove and
insight that so often escapes people who are in good health.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald E. Westlake's "Put a Lid on It" is a great caper, fast-cut and
facetious, about the interface between politics and crime, which have
a lot in common, as we know. As the book opens, Francis Xavier
Meehan, a recidivist thief, is held for a federal crime in the
Manhattan Correctional Center. When it closes, he's looking for
rehabilitation, preferably in the company of his lawyer, Mrs.
Goldfarb.</LD>
<LD>   In between, Meehan robs the rich to give to the richer (and keep a
little for himself). The president has recklessly given away
sensitive intelligence affecting national security and the security
of others. Neither the lapse nor the bloody mess it caused would
matter much if the indiscretion did not teeter on the brink of
exposure. Only expert intervention can save the president's bacon and
the forthcoming election. Meehan provides it and his ramble 'twixt
the two points is great fun. Scenes that are not hilarious are
breathless, scenes that aren't whimsical are nimble. Mostly, though,
they're all of the above. Sometimes Westlake's farces are better than
the ones they put on in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Siegel's "Lines of Defense" lays out the ravages and
raptures of prosperity. It's urbanization and gentrification time in
La Graciosa, a small town inland from California's Central Coast, not
far from San Luis Obispo. Venture capital has kick-started Chumash
County where La Graciosa sits. Ecology-friendly developments,
earth-toned condos, upscale retail centers, joggers, croissants,
sushi and cappuccino shops have followed.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Bard, a Chumash County sheriff's detective and a good one,
becomes deeply involved in the investigation of a fire, first
declared accidental, then recognized as arson and double homicide.
The county district attorney's office, more interested in
obfuscation, tries to damp down the investigation; then turns to
railroading a suspect whose guilt Bard questions. Proceeding in
counterpoint with the D.A.'s campaign to convict the accused man,
Bard's attempts to clear him and find the real culprit isolate the
detective, jeopardize his career and the safety of those he loves.</TE>
<TE>   The setting is vivid with local color, parochial politics,
corporate and community meddling and muddling, and heavy-breathing
personal travails for all involved. The murky doings grow ever more
opaque and fraught. There is a lot of driving, mostly on winding
roads through the late night and early morning fogs that grace the
area; and there's a lot of soul-searching about personal and legal
ethics. Complicated, compelling and contrived, Siegel, a staff writer
for The Times, spins a yarn that provides amateurs of legal drama
with plenty of suspense.</TE>
<TE>   P.I. Bill Smith is the hero, the self-destructive but persistent
anti-hero, of S.J. Rozan's "Winter and Night," which is all about the
joys of life and death in small, cozy towns; and the ineluctable fact
that the gods visit the sins of the fathers upon the children.</TE>
<TE>   Bill's 15-year-old nephew, Gary, asks for his uncle's help on
matters unknown, then disappears leaving his kinsman, the private
investigator, to seek him out in the streets of New York, the wilds
of New Jersey, the maze of the Internet but, above all, through the
smirch and chill of Warrenstown, N.J. Warrenstown is a football town
that revolves around jocks. Boys dream of a chance to play, to shine,
to be recruited. Their elders share their ambitions. "Same," growls
the sheriff, once the co-captain of the high school team, "as half
the towns in America."</TE>
<TE>   More than about money, the local pecking order turns upon high
school football and post-high school exploits. But, as Bill soon
finds, in a community where no one is quite what he seems or what he
pretends to be, yesterday's secrets weigh heavy on today. Poking into
long-buried crimes, as Bill is forced to do in his search for Gary,
stirs up trouble. Not only for the town, for the school, for the
football team, but for Bill who cannot come to terms with his own
demons, his memories, his father's sins and, perhaps, his own.</TE>
<TE>   An intrepid investigator and a deeply flawed man, Bill keeps going
mostly on bourbon, caffeine and cell phones. The best things about
him are grim determination and his partner, Lydia Chin, who listens
to his rantings and reins in his rages. In the end, things will work
out in an explosive finale, though not without serious damage to many
of those involved. As one nice girl comments: "I don't see how you
can call it justice." And as Bill answers, speaking presumably for
Rozan too, "That's the problem with justice. There's no such thing."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of what is written about California has been the work of
visitors who bring their own presumptions and prejudices along with
them, stay only briefly and then go back home and tell the rest of
the world what they think they saw here.</LD>
<LD>   The phenomenon, as we discover in "Lands of Promise and Despair,"
is hundreds of years old: The word "California" in fact first
appeared in print in 1510, when the Spanish author Garci Rodriguez de
Montalvo was inspired by the reports of early New World explorers to
conjure up an island paradise where black women in gold armor (their
queen was named "Calafia") procreated with kidnapped sailors. The
name came to be attached to the Golden State, which was depicted as
an island by early Spanish map makers.</LD>
<LD>   "[S]ometimes, without realizing it, we give foreign authors the
last word," write Rose Marie Beebe and Robert M. Senkewicz, the
editors of "Lands of Promise and Despair," a richly illustrated
anthology of witness accounts of the troubled but crucial period when
native Californians and Europeans first came into contact with each
other. The authors' self-declared goal--and one that they accomplish
with scholarly authority and a flair for storytelling--is to restore
to the modern reader "a genuine experience of Spanish and Mexican
California from the inside."</LD>
<TE>   "Lands of Promise and Despair" surveys what we might call the
pre-history of California. Much has been written about the era that
began with the Gold Rush in 1849, but Europeans had already been here
for some 300 years when gold was found at Sutter's Mill. And the
first Spanish conquistadors, of course, encountered a native
population whose own history goes back thousands of years and a
native culture that had produced an oral tradition so rich that it
was expressed in 100 different languages.</TE>
<TE>   Professors at Santa Clara University, Beebe and Senkewicz have
selected and collected the most colorful and revealing passages of
the oral histories known as testimonios, as well as the letters and
journals of explorers and settlers and the official reports of
Spanish colonial bureaucrats who saw it all with their own eyes. From
the outset, and over the centuries, the constant theme is conquest.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a pleasant place," wrote explorer Sebastian Vizcaino to the
king of Spain about his voyage to the bay he dubbed Monterey in 1602.
"The area is very populated by people whom I considered to be meek,
gentle, quiet, and quite amenable to conversion to Catholicism and to
becoming subjects of Your Majesty."</TE>
<TE>   Not every Spanish chronicler was quite so confident--or so
clueless. When the Jesuits tried to disrupt the traditional
leadership of the native Californios by forbidding the local chiefs
and shamans to take more than one wife, their followers rose up in
rebellion and attacked a string of missions throughout Baja
California.</TE>
<TE>   "When the rebels approach they will no doubt give their war cry
and kill everyone inside the fortifications," declared a pair of
dispirited Spanish soldiers to a mission priest in 1734. "They are
fully aware that our force inside the fort is small and that when our
men are killed it will be the end of all this, and then, Father,
goodbye to the Californias for many years to come."</TE>
<TE>   A century later, when the Spanish were gone and California was a
province of an independent Mexico, armed resistance was still going
on. Resentful of the priestly urgings to be baptized, for example,
one band of native Californians attacked a mission in 1840, killed a
corporal of the Mexican garrison and went in search of the mission
father, who begged his house servant to save his life by sitting on
top of him and thus concealing him under her skirts. The scene of his
successful concealment, as recalled by the woman herself, is comical
and dreadful.</TE>
<TE>   "Father ... begged me for God's sake not to give him away," she
recalled, "promising me that if the Virgin Mary got him out of that
conflict he was in, he would give me everything I might need from
then on in order to live leisurely and with no need to serve anyone
as long as God remembered me."</TE>
<TE>   The occasional murder of a soldier or priest, of course, was
ultimately futile, as we are constantly reminded in "Lands of Promise
and Despair": The Old World planted itself in the New World, and the
original Californians survived only on the ragged edges. Still, here
and there, embedded in the writings of Europeans, we find fragments
of the oral traditions that were nearly obliterated, including a
poignant lament by the Aztec victims of the original Spanish
conquistadors:</TE>
<TE>   Broken spears lie in the roads;</TE>
<TE>   we have torn our hair in our grief.</TE>
<TE>   The houses are roofless now, and their walls</TE>
<TE>   are red with blood.</TE>
<TE>   The imperial ambition that inspired the Spanish conquistadors was
eventually defeated by an even more forceful one, the doctrine of
Manifest Destiny that lured Americans all the way to California. A
glimpse is given here in an 1841 letter from Mariano Guadalupe
Vallejo, the Mexican commander in charge of the northern district of
Alta California, to the Ministry of War in Mexico: "I received word
of the arrival at the town of San Jose of a party of thirty-three
foreigners from Missouri," he reported. "I had them appear before me
to demand their passports, and I was told that they had none, because
they did not deem them necessary...."</TE>
<TE>   Another and especially vivid example of the same phenomenon is
offered in "Death Valley in '49," a truly heroic account of what a
young man named William Lewis Manly saw on the way to California's
gold fields. Seeking a shortcut, his party blundered into Death
Valley, and their gold fever was suddenly replaced with the primal
challenge of survival in a desert wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "A hoard of twenty-dollar gold pieces could now stand before us
the whole day long with no temptation to touch a single coin," wrote
Manly, "for its very weight would drag us nearer death."</TE>
<TE>   First published in 1894, and now offered in a re-edited, annotated
and highly readable edition, "Death Valley in '49" is the memoir of a
man whose real life was as full of adventure as any John Wayne movie
or Zane Grey novel. Manly, for example, was an accomplished
frontiersman even before he set out for California: "We had to be
real Indians in custom and actions in order to be considered their
equals," he writes of the years he spent as a trapper. "We got our
food in the same way they did, and so they had nothing to ask us
for."</TE>
<TE>   Once stranded, his courage, skill and tenacity saved the lives of
the men, women and children in whose company he was traveling.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us knew exactly where we were, nor when the journey would
be ended, nor when substantial relief would come," he wrote of the
worst moments in the place that his party dubbed Death Valley and
where several features of the landscape now bear his name. "One
fellow said he knew this was the Creator's dumping place, where he
had left the worthless dregs after making a world, and the devil had
scraped these together a little."</TE>
<TE>   "Death Valley in '49" is a survival story, of course, but it is
also, ultimately, a morality tale, as historian Patricia Nelson
Limerick points out in her introduction to the new edition. "Each
time Manly traveled ahead in the desert, climbed a mountain, and
assessed the prospect ahead, his loyalty was put to the test," she
writes. "Without dependents, he could 'pick up my knapsack and gun
and go off,' travel fast and save himself. But saving his own life
would come at too high a price: 'I felt I should be morally guilty of
murder.' "</TE>

<LD>Just released: "Homesick and Happy to Be Here," a debut album nearly
a decade in the making, by L.A.'s Aberdeen. Available through
www.betterlookingrecords.com.</LD>
<LD>   Aberdeen? Begun in 1992 by Palm Desert High classmates John Girgus
and Beth Arzy--"we were high school musical sweethearts," Girgus
says--the group cemented a tiny place in pop lore by releasing two
singles, in 1993 and '94, on England's Sarah Records. Now enjoying
cult status, Sarah was a mom-and-pop label that favored jangly,
gentle Britpop. As planned at its outset, the label folded after 100
releases.</LD>
<LD>   Sweethearts sour: "Beth and I had a volatile relationship," says
Girgus, 27, a marketing representative for Sony Music. "Onstage
fights, arguments.... We had a nasty breakup." For six years, their
works in progress languished.</LD>
<TE>   Peace signs: After a few chance meetings at concerts, "one day
fighting didn't happen," Girgus says. "We found out we could be
civil." With the help of some musician friends, notably ex-Fonda
guitarist David Newton, "Homesick" took shape. The album is a
charming combination of strummy bedroom pop, fuzzy and smoldering
guitars, and girl-boy vocals highlighted by Arzy's plaintive
entreaties.</TE>
<TE>   This from Britain: "Yes, I like it," says Matt Haynes, the Sarah
Records co-founder who now runs Shinkansen Recordings in London.
"Obviously it's not a million miles away from the singles Aberdeen
recorded for Sarah."</TE>
<TE>   A new wrinkle: Shortly after Aberdeen was done recording, Arzy
moved to London to become the vocalist for Trembling Blue Stars--the
current project of Bob Wratten, who fronted Sarah Records' best-known
band, the Field Mice. Trembling Blue Stars records for Shinkansen, so
it's no wonder that Haynes, as endeared as he is to Aberdeen's music,
is puzzled over "to what extent [Aberdeen] actually exists."</TE>
<TE>   To be or not to be: "I'd say yes, it exists," Girgus says. "We
made a record."</TE>

<HD>Can He Still Be a Hero?</HD>
<DH>David Bowie turns in an album that some see as a return to
his artistic heights</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>Richard Cromelin is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not quite time to make a reservation at the rest home for Ziggy
Stardust, but it's worth noting that David Bowie's landmark album
"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars" came
out in 1972, meaning that the carrot-topped character has now reached
the traditional expiration age: Never trust an androgynous pied piper
over 30.</LD>
<LD>   Bowie himself turned 55 in January, and while he's fit and
personally content, with a 22-month-old daughter and a supermodel
wife (Iman) keeping him on his toes, he knows what that age means in
his chosen profession. This multimedia innovator didn't even bother
making a video for his new record, because the outlets don't play
videos by 55-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   "The ways for me to promote what I'm making become fewer and fewer
as I get older, so I have to take advantage of touring and playing
things live to people," Bowie says. "I can't obviously bank on any
radio or video or anything like that, because I'm not the age for
that kind of thing."</LD>
<TE>   What Bowie did or didn't do to promote his work didn't seem to
matter much in the past decade. By the early '90s, he had made the
transition from the slick, soulless chart-topper of the early 1980s
to a rededicated if erratic artist. But such albums for Virgin
Records as "Outside" and "Earthling" came and went without causing a
ripple. Bowie quietly left the turmoil-racked label last year, he
says, after the business department neglected to sign his extension.</TE>
<TE>   But a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity. Out of the
blue, Bowie and his old record producer Tony Visconti, a storied team
responsible for such Bowie milestones as 1971's "The Man Who Sold the
World" and 1977's "Low," returned to the studio last year for the
first time since "Scary Monsters" in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The just-released "Heathen" intermittently carries whiffs of their
past work, but the most obvious references--"Space Oddity" in "Slip
Away" and "Heroes" in "Slow Burn"--weren't Visconti productions.
"Heathen" is distinctly its own record, and a liberating escape from
the heavy concepts and arrangements that encumbered much of his '90s
work. It's relaxed, straightforward, quietly intense. Even the
electronic adornments sound warm and organic in this melancholy
world.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, direct, emotional and sometimes playful, it includes
versions of songs by the Pixies, Neil Young and the Legendary
Stardust Cowboy, along with Bowie originals that recharge his basic
themes of obsession, alienation and mortality. The question of
whether it will sell better than "Outside" (less than 200,000) or
"Earthling" (under 250,000) is intriguing, but that's never really
the main point with Bowie, whose influence and impact have always
been far greater than his record sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Englishman arrived in the early '70s as a revolutionary
figure, a gender-bending harlequin who distilled Velvet Underground
rock and an inflated pop emotionalism into a message of personal
liberation.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting a succession of theatrical personae--Ziggy Stardust,
Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke--Bowie popularized glam-rock,
championed scrappy outsiders such as the New York Dolls and Iggy Pop,
and introduced theatrical staging to rock shows.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he would bring elements of contemporary art and literature
to his themes and methods in works that often focused on existential
isolation and the fragmentation of personal identity. Along the way,
he anticipated punk rock, goth, electronica and industrial rock, and
became an actor, a painter and patron of cutting-edge art. His
younger disciples include Trent Reznor, who co-billed Bowie on the
1995 Nine Inch Nails tour, and Moby, who invited Bowie to play on
this summer's edition of his Area2 tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted David Bowie to be involved in Area2, because apart from
being my favorite musician of the 20th century, he's a remarkable
performer," Moby says. "And almost no one has positively influenced
popular music more than he has."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Bowie has sold a lot of albums in three
decades, something that didn't escape the executives at Sony's
Columbia Records when they heard some early takes from "Heathen."
They soon signed Bowie, through his ISO label, to a three-album deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a huge fan and have followed Bowie from my college years back
in the '70s," says Will Botwin, president of the Columbia Records
Group. "I was immediately taken with the feeling of this record. It
felt like a little bit of a throwback with Tony, but clearly a very
current record and a very important record as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to us that his visibility and the recognition of him
having new albums out was fairly low. They weren't events, and they
didn't seem to be heralded as much and didn't seem to be talked about
as much. We really felt like we could reinvigorate David's career and
establish a new level of fans in 2002 that maybe has been missing
over the last handful of records."</TE>
<TE>   Bowie's commercial impact and artistic value have rarely resided
in the same works. The only time that critical consensus and cash
register ka-ching coincided was during the 1970s stretch that
included "Diamond Dogs" and "Young Americans," with its surprising
turn to R&amp;B. Bowie then moved into murkier waters, introducing
electronics in the influential "Low," "Heroes" and "Lodger."</TE>
<TE>   Those records and "Scary Monsters" weren't big sellers, but Bowie
made up for it in the 1980s. "Let's Dance," produced by Chic's Nile
Rodgers, became his second No. 1 single, and he was seduced by the
success, turning out such mainstream-friendly albums as "Tonight" and
"Never Let Me Down."</TE>
<TE>   Snapping to his senses, he formed an abrasive hard-rock quartet,
Tin Machine, to revive his passion for music. The Virgin albums that
followed in the '90s were a mixed lot, but some people could detect
something alive and kicking.</TE>
<TE>   "I particularly liked 'Earthling' and 'Outside,' " says producer
Visconti, who apprenticed on records by such '60s British rock greats
as Procol Harum and the Move. "I thought they were really good, those
two. I knew he was definitely working up to ["Heathen"]. I could hear
that he had found his muse again. I found them a little inconsistent,
but I heard my old friend shining through again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bowie had reunited with Eno--a collaborator on "Low" and producer
of "Heroes" and "Lodger"-- for "Outside," but that didn't create
nearly the stir in Bowiedom as the Visconti pairing, which Bowie says
stemmed simply from a desire to work together in the studio again.
Not that he treated it lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "Being very aware that what we have done is held in fairly high
esteem by the people that bought it," Bowie says, "I was really wary
of doing something that would cheapen the relationship or tarnish it
in some way, if we just went in and rehashed or something. So I
started stockpiling what I felt were really strong pieces of work, so
we could go in with a very sound structure to begin with, which
wouldn't give us any excuse to lean back on the past ....</TE>
<TE>   "That allowed us to work within a kind of signature mode. You can
certainly tell it's a Bowie-Visconti album, but it doesn't have to
borrow too much from the past.... I was very wary there are no cribs.
'Sunday' was cited by somebody as sounding quite like 'Low,' and
there is nothing on 'Low' that even resembles 'Sunday.' That's
exactly the kind of thing that we didn't do.... It doesn't owe very
much to the past in that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Columbia's marketing people are breaking a sweat
to increase his sales. If MTV won't play a video on its own, they'll
shoot a commercial for the album that looks like a video and buy
advertising time. If his old fans have evolved into couch potatoes,
they'll send him to the "Today" show and the A&amp;E cable channel (Bowie
appears on the "Live by Request" show that premiered this weekend and
repeats next Sunday and June 27).</TE>
<TE>   Bowie, who has lived in New York for the past 10 years, will also
make the rounds of the late-night network shows. The campaign
benefits further from some coincidental activity: The Museum of
Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills and New York has just opened a
four-part retrospective of Bowie's visual works, and the singer is
the director of this year's Meltdown, an eclectic festival of music,
film and art in London that began Saturday and will continue through
June 29.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy has sold millions of records over the years," says Larry
Jenkins, Columbia's senior vice president of marketing and media.
"The last couple of albums have not sold that well, and I think we
can get a lot of people back who for one reason or another didn't buy
those last few records."</TE>
<TE>   Bowie isn't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I can do much about that," he says. "I have a very
loyal fan base, and other than that anomaly in the early '80s and the
first Tin Machine album, I've had virtually the same record sales for
nearly 35 years. I don't really think it's gonna change very much.
And I'm very happy with that audience, it's kept me going. If a major
label could exert more weight and increase that audience, it would be
lovely, but I'm not gonna lose sleep over it at all."</TE>

<HD>True to a Difficult Age</HD>
<DH>Jodie Foster and her young 'Altar Boys' co-stars bonded
over the desire to show teens honestly, sadness and all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>Sorina Diaconescu is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most things adults know better. Except certain things, which
teenagers know best. Like that first time you fall in love and walk
around with a tingly, achy sensation coiled in the pit of your
stomach. Or the first time you break up, and the certainty that
you'll never be able to get over it seems wired in every cell of your
body.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of stuff has been on Jodie Foster's mind lately. "I've
been thinking a lot about when I was 15, 16, feeling like I was
completely alone in the world and there was nobody to understand what
I was going through," she says, at 39 very much a grown-up mom but
irresistibly drawn to matters of the adolescent heart. "I don't think
I've ever been as dark or as sad. But to me it was also beautiful: I
never felt as much. So I really wanted to make a movie that is true
to those things."</LD>
<TE>   To this end, Foster rolled up her sleeves and went to work as an
indie film producer; the sweet, tart fruit of her labor arrived in
New York and Los Angeles theaters Friday. "The Dangerous Lives of
Altar Boys" is a movie about teenagers that strives to convey both
their exuberance and immaculate seriousness; its eye-candy layers
peel off one by one to reveal the big emotions of youth. Embodying
the passage from innocence to experience are three young
actors--Emile Hirsch, Kieran Culkin and Jena Malone--who were about
the same age as their characters, 15, when "Altar Boys" wrapped.
After the nearly two-year post-production process (the film includes
animated sequences), the three are older and wiser to the ways of
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Teen movie conventions routinely allow 15-year-old characters to
be played by those in their 20s who need to shave twice a day. "Their
voices are way low, so they squeak them up by tightening their
jockstraps," Hirsch jokes. "I know people in high school who look
like, honestly, they're still in sixth grade. But in the movies, how
these people look is like adults!"</TE>
<TE>   Teen actors are rarely asked to play parts that make use of what
comes naturally to them, says "Altar Boys" director Peter Care. No
amount of adult competence can convey to the same effect the
clumsiness of body language, the transparency of emotion, the mixture
of bravado and fragility typical of that age, Care suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "When boys are getting 13, 14, 15, they don't know what the heck
is going on with their bodies, and they have that mixture of real
innocence and yearning for the truth about life written all over
their faces," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, who knows something about growing up on screen, shared
those insights with Hirsch and Malone recently when she joined them
in a conversation about cinematic and real-life adolescence in the
Mid-Wilshire office of the film's publicity firm. Looks allowed
Foster to be cast as a teen in "Stealing Home" at 25, when she
remembers vowing to herself that it would be for the last time.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you feel like you were stealing all these roles from the
younger kids?" Hirsch asks. He has been acting since age 10, but the
role of Francis, the protagonist among the titular altar boys and a
daydreamer whose feverish imagination turns everybody around him into
comic-book characters, is his meatiest part yet.</TE>
<TE>   Foster fought to cast teenage leads and used her star power to
secure wider audiences by giving herself a supporting part. With
"Altar Boys," her ambitions extend to repairing other omissions of
the teen movie genre, especially the absence of dark themes with big
appeal to the hearts and minds of teenagers but seldom reflected on
the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I think adults love to believe that sadness is not a part of
children's lives," she says. At that age, "the questions are huge and
complicated, and a lot of them are incredibly sad: 'What will I be
like?' 'Will I be successful, or will everybody spit on me?' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It began as a 1994 J.D. Salinger-esque novel by author Chris
Fuhrman, and the story has sprung to the big screen with its
sensibility intact. In performances that bring to mind the gauche
charm of teenage poetry scribbled in notebook margins, Hirsch and
Culkin play Francis and Tim, respectively, ringleaders of a gang of
teenage daredevils on the loose in an early-'70s Southern town.</TE>
<TE>   They fancy themselves comic book heroes and scheme to sow fright
in the souls of their Catholic high-school teachers. They seek
forbidden wisdom in books and alcohol. And sometimes they stare at
bedroom ceilings studded with Day-Glo stars and try hard to imagine
what William Blake meant when he praised the nakedness of woman as
the work of God.</TE>
<TE>   Malone plays a strange girl named Margie, who is the subject of
Francis' love-struck doodlings and ultimately his guide into the
bittersweet business of adulthood. Foster dons a nun's habit and a
prosthetic leg as Sister Assumpta, the uptight teacher who haunts the
teenagers' dreams as a motorcycle-riding hellcat.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of "Altar Boys" was to have on screen true teens who come
across not just as "the daughter, or the son, but someone with
emotions, complications, problems: things that are not necessarily
stereotypical of what a young person is," says Malone, 17: "Allowing
young [characters] to live and breathe and become a lot of different
things that don't seem particularly accessible. Things that are just
... like, universal, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   "Those things that people have to deal with: love and hurt and
loss, all of that," Culkin picks up the thread by phone from
Manhattan. At the ripe age of 19, he is the oldest of the trio and
proudly proclaims that he's "out of school and into life." He slipped
naturally into the role of charismatic Tim, the fairest of the altar
boys who is given to dionysiac histrionics and much verse quoting.
"There's a lot of movies for kids out there, but they're really not
my style," he says simply. "The kind of movies 'Not Another Teen
Movie' makes fun of--except that movie was funny."</TE>
<TE>   Amid a slew of pictures that target teens with glib, ironic
messages, "Altar Boys" stands out for a tone that is equal parts
black humor and poetry. "At that age you are into the poetry of
things, but you also have a darker side, drawn to violence and video
games and being naughty in school," director Care says. In the film,
the satirical angle surfaces in animated sequences that represent
Francis' comic-style drawings come to life. It is the stuff of
dramatic thoughts and wild emotions that boys of his age feel but
typically cannot articulate. The clear split between fantasy and
reality, says the director, freed the movie to deal truthfully with
the more delicate, private emotions of teens--like falling in love.</TE>
<TE>   Foster is convinced that the first time this happens is unlike any
other time in your life. "Adults say, 'You know what? You're gonna
fall in love 20 times in your life. It doesn't matter!' " she says,
mimicking a motherly voice. "But that's just not right, because the
first time that happens it's more painful and more horrible than any
other time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If adults turn a blind eye to the darkness of young age, does it
comes as a surprise that teens go hunting for answers to the
difficult questions of life in grown-up movies?</TE>
<TE>   Malone: "I remember seeing 'Thelma &amp; Louise' when I was 9 and not
being able to get those women out of my head," Foster: "The movies
that really touched you when you were younger are never the movies
you were supposed to see; it's always the R-rated movies. For me, it
was 'Coming Home,' it was 'A Dog Day Afternoon.' " ("Altar Boys" is
also R-rated.)</TE>
<TE>   Besides the gloom and doom that makes being a teen so pleasantly
dramatic, there is fun to be had--especially if you happen to be an
actor. "Some things that you do ... it's not even acting, a lot of
it," Hirsch says. "Some of the stuff I did before 'Altar Boys,' all
these movies--they were really horrible. But you know, I got to go to
Australia for three months in seventh grade to do a monster movie: It
was just fun, like an adventure."</TE>
<TE>   According to Foster, collaborating with adults and having opinions
valued puts teenage actors light-years ahead of their peers. "Acting
is basically psychology," she says, pointing to her head and speaking
in her familiarly rapid, precise delivery as Malone and Hirsch listen
intently. "For a young person to be dealing with psychology in that
way, to understand about emotions and talk about how people feel, I
think it's really helpful."On the downside, you end up spending way
too much time with grown-ups, and being in their world of money and
power is "kind of crazy," Malone says.</TE>
<TE>   Foster's knowledge of the movie business since age 6 has made her
protective toward young actors. "I'm like the ultra-mother on the
set," she says. "But some people aren't."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, they tell you, 'Tough it out!' " Hirsch says, nodding, and
that's when the war stories come spilling out: Foster's "bad, bad
frostbite that always comes back," a souvenir from the set of "The
Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane," which she did at 12. Outfitted
only in thin liner socks, she soldiered on for take after take in
below-freezing temperatures, until tears came and someone finally
asked what was wrong. "Like they couldn't tell I was cold!" she
bristles.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is the story of Robert De Niro taking Foster
under his wing during the making of "Taxi Driver," when he helped her
concoct an Oscar-nominated performance as a precocious streetwalker.
But not all adults were as generous. "I do remember actors being
actively unhelpful," Foster says. "Like trying to get me upset for a
scene. Instead of saying, 'OK, let's talk about what this person's
feelings are,' they'd say something like, 'You're no good!' Or they
would just talk at me, like, 'Be happy! Smile!' They just couldn't
imagine that [I had] a brain and could think for myself."</TE>
<TE>   Care says he treated his two young male leads as adults, or as if
they were his teenage sons, as the occasion demanded. He admits that
sometimes the boys were just boys: "One day Kieran would be totally
on, he would want to change the script, and his changes were great,"
Care recalls. "And then the next day it would be opposite: Emile
would be on fire, reacting instead of acting--absolutely amazing. But
Kieran would be totally unfocused because he stayed up too late
watching wrestling the night before. And you're going crazy!" Care
says.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the first-time director wants to complain too much about
working with teenagers: "I heard that adult actors do it the same."</TE>

<LD>The following is a Nov. 5, 1971, news story by Times staff writer
Kevin Thomas on the opening night of the first Los Angeles
International Film Exposition, more popularly known as Filmex.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Students, starlets, hippies and vintage Hollywood celebrities
rubbed shoulders at Thursday night's circus-like opening of the first
Los Angeles International Film Exposition at Grauman's Chinese
Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, Los Angeles, the traditional center of the
American motion-picture industry, is having a major film festival.
Appropriately it is being in held in what is probably the most famous
of all Hollywood tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   A tightrope walker, a fire-eater and a baby elephant greeted the
arriving guests, attired in everything from satin to blue jeans.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-day event, launched with the West Coast premiere of "The
Last Picture Show," attracted both the old Hollywood and the new.
Groucho Marx and silent star Leatrice Joy were there, and so was Ryan
O'Neal. Andy Warhol was also there with his superstar Candy Darling.</TE>
<TE>   Filmex, short for Los Angeles International Film Exposition, is
budgeted at $120,000 and was launched with $60,000 in private
donations. As of Thursday evening, a festival official reported
$22,000 in ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   The exposition is Hollywood's formal recognition that film is both
art and entertainment, timeless and international in scope.</TE>
<TE>   The noncompetitive festival, which consists of 45 individual
events to be held both at Grauman's and the County Art Museum, will
present 16 pictures from 12 countries in their West Coast premieres.
Most of these films have been previewed by the press, and they are of
consistently high quality--unusual for a film festival.</TE>
<TE>   Filmex will also honor Hollywood's own often overlooked artistic
heritage with a special series of classic movies, which will be made
available to Los Angeles schoolchildren free of charge. Even the once
lowly regarded but highly influential B movie will be given its due.</TE>
<TE>   A nonprofit undertaking by veteran director George Cukor, Filmex
is co-sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Harold Lloyd Foundation and
the film schools of UCLA, USC and CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   "Filmex is a happy mix of the old and the new," said Cukor. "It's
something for everybody, but above all we hope it offers theatrical
excitement and joy. I think we can all use some of that nowadays."</TE>

<LD>With "Sunshine State," John Sayles continues his movie tour of
America: Call him the Fodor's of filmmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about going to extremes: Since 1996, the writer-director has
set films in Texas ("Lone Star"), Alaska ("Limbo") and now Florida
(with a stopover in Central America in "Men With Guns"). "Sunshine
State" opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Think of Sayles' films as dramatic travelogues, in which the
settings are as much characters as the people who live there.
Marketing being what it is, it's only a matter of time before someone
hits on a scheme to assemble the John Sayles tour for cinematic
Americans. It would probably go something like this.</LD>

<TE>   Return of the Secaucus Seven (1980): Welcome to small-town life.
No, not in New Jersey, where Secaucus is, but in New Hampshire, where
two main characters are hosts of a reunion of college pals (who were
once arrested in Secaucus en route to an antiwar march in Washington;
hence the title). Nestle into a house for a weekend gathering:
playing charades, acting out old impulses and indulging in plenty of
recreational drinking. Basketball with the townies and recriminations
about ancient personal history also pass the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matewan (1987): In the scenic West Virginia mountains, you'll find
yourself sleeping in coal miners' tents and shacks, and defending
your life while trying to uphold the dignity of a growing union
movement. Get the feel of the dirt beneath your nails--and over your
head--in our authentic coal mines. Talk about extreme vacations: Wait
until you experience the adrenaline rush as you distribute pro-union
pamphlets while battling anti-union goons and struggling for the
dignity of the working man in the face of corporate evil.
Non-struggle tours also available.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Passion Fish (1992): We gahr-own-tee you'll love our special
zydeco stop in a Louisiana backwater. It doesn't matter whether
you're recovering from a crippling accident or a crippling addiction:
The small-town atmosphere of this remote Cajun locale will shift your
focus from the blackened state of your existence to the brighter side
of life. Ladies, take advantage of a plentiful supply of local men,
with personalities so calm and nurturing they should come with a
prescription.</TE>

<TE>   Lone Star (1995): Spicy multiculturalism is the order of the day
in this scenic, if remote, stop on the Texas-Mexico border. Check out
our Wild West Days pageant, offering insight into our racist past,
followed closely by NAFTA Days. Archeological digs daily, sure to
unearth evidence of old crimes. Border patrol ride-alongs available.
Find out why we're all one big happy family in this little corner of
Texas.</TE>

<TE>   Limbo (1999): Got an itch for the last frontier? Or just want to
hide from something? Then head for Alaska, where you'd be amazed at
how easy it is to get lost in a threatening environment. Watch your
back: You never know who to trust, and it's hard to tell the good
guys from the bad guys. That's just part of the fun in America's
unexplored tundra--at least until the oil companies are finished with
it. One-way wilderness trips available by boat or plane.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunshine State (2002): Long a land of dreams corrupted by greed
and opportunism, the new Florida is highways and seafood, souvenir
shops and easily developed swampland. Avast, matey--this is pirate
country, whether you're talking about Capt. Kidd or the modern-day
land grabbers looking to build that next big gated seniors'
community. And the locals? They're as feisty and common-sensical as
you would hope. Don't forget the sunscreen.</TE>

<HD>The Big-Band Survival Kit</HD>
<DH>Large jazz aggregations contributed mightily to the music
of the 20th century. But they need establishment support to thrive in
the 21st.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>Don Heckman writes frequently about jazz for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big jazz band is, as always, the symphony orchestra of jazz. Its
sectional groupings of trumpets, trombones, saxophones and rhythm
have provided composers and arrangers with an extraordinary musical
palette of an almost infinite array of timbral sounds, colors,
harmonies and rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   In the 75 or 80 years since the instrumentation became
established, it has generated music of every manner--much of it well
beyond the limits of jazz. It would not stretch credibility to
suggest that this unique musical collective can actually be described
as the symphony orchestra not only of jazz, but of 20th century
American popular music.</LD>
<LD>   Consider some of its achievements. Duke Ellington's orchestra
comes to mind immediately, of course, with its nearly 50 years of
magnificent work. But there's much more. Add the organizations led by
Fletcher Henderson, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Benny Goodman,
Woody Herman, Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, Dizzy Gillespie and Gerry
Mulligan, and the surface has barely been scratched.</LD>
<TE>   Toss in the more inventive big swing bands--Glenn Miller, the
Dorsey Brothers, Harry James, Claude Thornhill, Gene Krupa, etc.--add
such special projects as the Gil Evans and Miles Davis
collaborations, and bring it up to date with the Maria Schneider Jazz
Orchestra, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra and the Lincoln Center
Jazz Orchestra, and there are still dozens of worthy names that have
been left off the list.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, given the vital role that these ensembles have performed in
America's musical history, they continue to face grave difficulties
in simply surviving on the contemporary cultural scene.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, for example, two high-visibility large groups
have taken major hits: Carnegie Hall management has elected to
discontinue its support of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, and the Los
Angeles Philharmonic has not renewed the contract of the
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra as the Hollywood Bowl's resident jazz
ensemble. (The Carnegie band's presumed final tour brings it, along
with the Clayton-Hamilton ensemble, to the Bowl on Aug. 21)</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Wynton Marsalis' well-funded Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra,
in fact, the number of financially stable big bands performing on a
regular, continuing basis is abysmally small.</TE>
<TE>   True, numerous so-called "ghost big bands"--groups using the names
and the music of departed bandleaders--still tour the country. (A
typical example, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, performs at the Bowl on
July 10.) But these are essentially nostalgia acts, different only in
musical style from Beatles look-alike groups.</TE>
<TE>   What's the problem? Why has the U.S., which has been responsible
for both the origination and the creative expansion of the big-band
format, had so much difficulty in sustaining it?</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons. The first is financial: Lacking
governmental or corporate sponsorship, the cost of salaries,
maintenance and travel for an ensemble of 16 to 20 musicians can
quickly rise to astronomical heights--considerably beyond the payroll
of a five-piece rock ensemble (assuming it's not the Rolling Stones).</TE>
<TE>   The second reason is small groups' great success in using
technology to simulate some of the textural qualities of big band
music (although rarely in musically convincing fashion). The
orchestra for the annual Grammy Awards, for example, has shrunk from
a large ensemble structured around big band instrumentation to a
mini-band with a small contingent of horns "enhanced" by electronic
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   The third reason is more subtle, directly connected to the simple
entertainment-world fact that styles and preferences change. The
ragtime music of the early 20th century gave way to the New Orleans
music of the Jazz Age '20s, followed by the swing bands of the '30s
and '40s, the doo-wop of the '50s, the rock of the '60s, the disco of
the '70s, and the rhythm &amp; blues, hip-hop, rap, female divas and boy
bands of succeeding decades.</TE>
<TE>   And the fourth reason--closely related to the ascendance of small
groups and the advent of electronics--is the unfortunate manner in
which big bands are generally presented in live performances. Subject
to sound technicians who often are more familiar with rock music than
horn bands--with enough microphones to completely manipulate an
ensemble's audio character--the resulting music can bear little
resemblance to what the musicians had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent example from a Playboy Jazz Festival performance,
the Count Basie Orchestra, which is famous for the subtle, almost
subliminal presence of a guitar in the rhythm section, was amplified
so that the guitar was raised to a level higher than the trumpet
section. That's not exactly the best way to introduce new listeners
to the beauties of Basie's music.</TE>
<TE>   So, if they cost a ton to maintain, are impractical, stylistically
out of touch with current musical tastes and rarely heard in proper
fashion, wouldn't it be appropriate to simply view big bands as
dinosaurs? Not any more than it would be to view the classical
symphony orchestra as a worn-out vestige of 19th century European
culture. And that, apparently, is not the case, because virtually
every major city in America manages to support a symphonic ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Without in any way diminishing the obvious importance of the
master classical composers, doesn't it seem a bit odd that so much
funding is available to ensure that their music is heard in its most
pristine form, while so little is a devoted to guaranteeing the
continued availability of works by Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn,
Fletcher Henderson, Don Redman, Sy Oliver, Benny Carter, Quincy
Jones, Bill Holman, Pete Rugolo, Gerry Mulligan, Thad Jones, Frank
Foster, Gil Evans, Gary McFarland and dozens of others?</TE>
<TE>   Commonly referred to as "America's classical music," jazz
shouldn't have to take a backseat. Solutions are possible, but time
is not on the side of delay.</TE>
<TE>   The answers to how to preserve and cherish this music already
exist. Marsalis' efforts at Lincoln Center--a resident orchestra that
records and tours regularly--provide a powerful blueprint for
engaging corporate, business and government entities in the support
of jazz. Because New York City is obviously different from, say,
Chicago or Los Angeles, Marsalis' methods will have to be modified to
adapt to local conditions. But there is plenty of backing available
in most major cities to support the establishment of resident big
bands. Making the case to potential sponsors will require the same
combination of business savvy and creative justification that
Marsalis has established at Lincoln Center.</TE>
<TE>   It will also take some imaginative, blue-sky risk-taking. Let's
take a look at the local scene, for example. This afternoon and
evening, the Playboy Jazz Festival presents the second day of its
24th annual event at the Hollywood Bowl. Only two big bands were
scheduled: the Charles Mingus Big Band and the Count Basie Orchestra.
Yet Playboy founder Hugh Hefner has often noted his affection for and
allegiance to big jazz bands.</TE>
<TE>   Given that affinity and Playboy's long dedication to jazz, why not
consider the establishment of a Playboy Big Jazz Band? With Hefner's
blessing, a virtual all-star ensemble could be established,
performing an annual concert season, preserving the enormous existing
repertoire while remaining responsive to new works by young
composers. What better way to underscore the importance of the big
jazz band in American culture, while simultaneously honoring Hefner's
memories of his musical youth.</TE>
<TE>   What about the Philharmonic? Yes, it deserves credit for the
three-year Hollywood Bowl presence of the Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra.
But why stop now? With Walt Disney Concert Hall soon to open, there
would seem to be plenty of opportunity to further explore the
creation of a permanent Los Angeles jazz orchestra--either through
Clayton-Hamilton or a new entity. Southern California's jazz history,
from the Central Avenue years to the present, has been filled with
big band achievements. The Philharmonic is the ideal entity to create
an ensemble dedicated to the perpetuation of those achievements and
the presentation of newly composed music for this vital instrumental
collective.</TE>
<TE>   There are other options, as well. The Luckman Jazz Orchestra at
Cal State Los Angeles is a fine ensemble, hampered by an unfortunate
lack of funding, but perfectly capable--given appropriate
financing--of producing six to eight imaginative concerts annually
under the creative direction of James Newton. Dozens of other bands
assemble on an ad hoc basis from time to time, usually dedicated to
the writing of a single composer, but occasionally--as in the case of
the Frankie Capp Juggernaut--focused on keeping the jazz repertoire
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Any local solution to the problem of sustaining big band music
will have to overcome the balkanization of the Southern California
jazz community, with its numerous conflicting interests and agendas.
But the results would surely justify whatever efforts may be required
to maintain and enhance an ensemble that has provided the soundtrack
for so much of 20th century American life.</TE>

<DH>Neil Simon has another go at his perennial favorite, 'The
Odd Couple,' for Geffen Playhouse</DH>

<LD>Oscar climbs all over the couch, then wipes his feet on it. He points
an aerosol can at Felix's pasta and gives it a good spray before
flinging pasta and plate against the wall. And in case prissy,
neatnik Felix still doesn't get the message, Oscar reminds his
roommate that every single thing Felix does is irritating.</LD>
<LD>   There are plenty of people laughing, but this rehearsal is a
little different from the hundreds, maybe thousands, of other
rehearsals each year of Neil Simon's classic comedy, "The Odd
Couple." At this rehearsal, the playwright is in the room and he's
not just listening. He's rewriting.</LD>
<LD>   The Tony-winning "Odd Couple" has been a hit play, movie and TV
series. But Simon, who rewrote his 1965 play in 1985 for women
roommates, is tinkering with it again. "I didn't want to just bring
'The Odd Couple' back on stage, because enough people have seen the
play or film that they could probably say the words along with the
actors," says the nation's most-produced playwright of his
most-produced play. "I had to change it."</LD>
<TE>   "Oscar and Felix, a New Look at the Odd Couple" opens at the
Geffen Playhouse in Westwood on Wednesday. John Larroquette (TV's
"Night Court") plays Oscar, Joe Regalbuto ("Murphy Brown") plays
Felix. " 'The Odd Couple's' been playing around the world for 36
years and people seem to love it," says Simon, 74, during a lunch
break from rehearsals. "But I wanted to give it a new look. I placed
it in 2002, and there's a slightly different relationship between
Felix and Oscar, much more revealing of who they really are."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who spent eight months rewriting even before he walked into
rehearsals, has also compressed the play's three acts into two.
Although he hasn't tampered much with the story or characters, Simon
says, "I rewrote about 70%."</TE>
<TE>   Make that number a little higher, suggests Peter Bonerz, who is
directing the Geffen production. He guesses that the script has
changed another 5% to 10% since rehearsals started in mid-May. Bonerz
adds, "He's warned us that once preview audiences come in, it will
change again, depending on their response."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of playwrights come to rehearsals to protect their material,
observes Geffen producing director Gilbert Cates. "They don't want a
line changed. Neil comes to rehearsals to work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon looks like a university professor as he sits just offstage
in the rehearsal room. His arms are crossed on his chest, and he's
smiling more than laughing as the actors play out his lines. (Bonerz
says Simon "laughs silently.")</TE>
<TE>   "It's going well," Simon says later. "I like the way it's going."</TE>
<TE>   So do the actors. "I was having difficulty with the first scene,
understanding exactly what Felix was doing there, and he gave me
insight into who Felix is and what makes him tick," Regalbuto says.
"This is a part that's been done by icons in film and theater, and to
be able to get that kind of clarity as to what he wants is terrific.
The playwright's alive. And he's here."</TE>
<TE>   "Oscar and Felix" is Simon's 33rd play, including both earlier
versions of "The Odd Couple," and he's nearly done with his 34th, an
all-new play due at the Geffen next season. There have also been 25
screenplays, about half of them adaptations of his plays, three Tony
Awards ("The Odd Couple" in 1965, "Biloxi Blues" in 1985 and "Lost in
Yonkers" in 1991), a Pulitzer Prize ("Lost in Yonkers"), and assorted
Oscar and Emmy nominations. He once had four shows simultaneously on
Broadway in the '60s, and in 1983, a Broadway theater was named after
him.</TE>
<TE>   Although no contemporary American playwright has fared better at
the box office, he can hardly be called a favorite of critics.
Despite their accolades for his "Brighton Beach" trilogy and "Lost in
Yonkers," New York Times critics have called 2000's "The Dinner
Party" "a French farce with a Brooklyn accent," and last year's "45
Seconds Over Broadway" "a sincere but paper-thin valentine to New
York." Writing of "Rumors" in 1988, then-critic Frank Rich commented
that Simon "casually empties out a file cabinet's worth of often
tangentially relevant jokes."</TE>
<TE>   At theatrical licensing company Samuel French, President Charles
van Nostrand says he thinks Simon "is treated unfairly by the
critical press." The playwright is too often dismissed because he
writes comedy, adds Manny Azenberg, who has produced 22 of Simon's
plays. "There was 'Barefoot in the Park' in 1963 and 'Lost in
Yonkers' in 1991. Can you name another American playwright who has
remained current for 40 years?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon sighs audibly when it comes to critics. "They think that if
you write that many plays, they come easily for you, and they never
do. Never. Some are more enjoyable to write than others, but none of
them are easy."</TE>
<TE>   "The Odd Couple" was among the easier ones. With most of his
plays, Simon says, "I have a general idea and the play comes to me as
I write it. With 'The Odd Couple,' I had an idea of the beginning,
middle and end."</TE>
<TE>   The playwright, who was still living in New York at the time,
tells of coming to Los Angeles in the early '60s to visit his brother
Danny. Danny and a friend had each broken up with a spouse, had to
save money for alimony and decided to share an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Danny it was a great idea for a play, and he should write
it," Simon says. "He started to, but he didn't get past Page 15. He
said to me, 'You're the playwright. You write it.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Simon did.</TE>
<TE>   "There's hardly anyone in this world who hasn't lived with
somebody else at some point--a mother, a son, a friend. There are any
number of variations, and that's why the play is so successful," he
observes. "People realize, 'Yes, I've been through this and know what
it's like to have your roommate do things you can't stand.' "</TE>
<TE>   Simon's characters are also very real, Larroquette adds. "They're
about real people, and sometimes fairly tragic people. Oscar is
living alone, in a bit of a cave, doesn't have his wife, doesn't have
his son, is past his prime and very alone. Both men are easily
identifiable. They're both very nice, and we want them to have some
shred of happiness in their lives. I think the audience roots for
them easily."</TE>
<TE>   Simon surely does. When actresses started writing to him about the
play, wanting to perform it, he came up with "The Odd Couple" female
version, substituting Trivial Pursuit for a poker game and a double
date with two brothers rather than two sisters. Referring to his
"Brighton Beach" and "Plaza Suite" trilogies, Simon quips that now he
has an "Odd Couple" trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he says, "I wanted to write a play--I always want
to write a play. It was time for next year's play. Everybody is doing
revivals now, and Manny wanted to do a revival of 'Brighton Beach
Memoirs' and 'Broadway Bound' together. I said, 'Let's just do "The
Odd Couple." It would be easier.'</TE>
<TE>   "Also what happened is that somebody sent me [the L.A. Theatre
Works] audio version of the play with two very good actors. I
listened to it, and I heard the audience laughing. But there should
have been laughs where there weren't, and I thought I could write the
play better today. I think I know more about writing now."</TE>
<TE>   Enter Cates and his Geffen Playhouse. Simon knew Cates and also
was drawn to the Geffen's 500-seat size. Although many of his early
plays began at the Ahmanson Theatre, he says today that "I feel a
little less pressure than if I were on the stage of the Ahmanson with
a new play.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Ahmanson, it's like opening on Broadway, minus the 3,000
miles. You're going to have 1,500 people every night. I'm not saying
it's any easier, but I just feel more relaxed working here. The
ambience is wonderful, it feels like a college theater or English
theater, and with 500 seats, I feel I can get a really good
perspective on how the audience likes the play."</TE>
<TE>   While Simon indicates his hope that the play will go on to
Broadway, Cates emphasizes, "We don't do plays for that reason. As a
byproduct, it's great. People will come and look at it, and if they
want to take it to Broadway, would make a deal with Neil and the
Geffen."</TE>
<TE>   The same would hold true for Simon's next play. The four-character
love story is basically serious, the playwright says, but it has a
lot of comedy in it because the characters are witty. Although the
characters are fictitious, "it's very clear I think of them as
Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett. I didn't call them that because
that would make the play biographical, and it isn't. It's out of my
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Simon wrote the first scene of the play 10 years ago, then put it
aside. "I read it recently, just before we went into rehearsal, and
continued writing. I'm putting the finishing touches on it now."</TE>
<TE>   Coming up, he reflects, is a very busy year: some rewrites of his
1966 book of the musical "Sweet Charity" for a potential Broadway
revival. A possible film for Showtime, with Richard Benjamin
directing, based on Simon's 1996 memoir, "Rewrites." Maybe another
play. "And that," he sighs, "is enough work."</TE>

<HD>Fun or Folly--She's Willing to Try</HD>
<DH>She may be a theater veteran, but Patty Duke had never sung
or danced on stage. Until now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>Irene Lacher is a regular contributor to Calendar.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outside the Madeline Clark rehearsal studio on Burbank Boulevard,
flowers tumble down white trellises and a cool pool of water beckons
weary actors on their breaks. It certainly looks like a mini-arcadia,
but here, as elsewhere in Hollywood adjacent, things aren't always as
they seem. Many of the blooms are real, but they're augmented with
plastic impostors. This may be the only garden in town that needs to
be both watered and dusted.</LD>
<LD>   Usual expectations have a rough time of it inside the rehearsal
hall too. It's the first cast reading of a new production of Stephen
Sondheim's "Follies," which opens today, and people are getting to
know one another. A petite woman with a short crop of wheat-colored
hair walks over to the three young actresses sitting behind her.
"Hello," she says, extending her hand. "I'm Patty Duke."</LD>
<LD>   The stage manager stands up and delivers a blizzard of
announcements, then directs cast members to program his number into
their cell phones. Duke looks up in mock consternation. "I'm still
learning how to sing and dance," she says.</LD>
<TE>   Wait, didn't Duke already know how to dance the minuet? Or was
that her Scottish "identical cousin" Cathy, the television alter ego
who helped Duke blaze an indelible groove in boomer consciousness
with "The Patty Duke Show" from 1963 to 1966 and countless reruns
since? Duke went on to reign as the queen of TV movies, with a
whopping 76 to her credit.</TE>
<TE>   But the TV movie industry is barely surviving "Survivor" and its
clones, not to mention game shows that mint millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   So what else can a girl do but sing Sondheim?</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, at the lofty age of 55, Duke is making her debut as a
singer-dancer in the Reprise! production of "Follies," which runs
through June 23 at the Wadsworth Theatre in Brentwood. The show also
stars Vikki Carr, Bob Gunton, Harry Groener and Donna McKechnie, as
well as Jack Carter, Carol Lawrence and Justine Johnston, who
appeared in the original production 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Follies" resurrects old Broadway in a musical set in a vaudeville
theater that's about to be torn down. The theater owner summons the
former hoofers to a reunion, and two couples struggle with the
fractures in their marriages against a backdrop of their re-created
youth, before their dreams were dashed by their own follies.</TE>
<TE>   The show opened on Broadway in 1971 with music and lyrics by the
most sophisticated artist in musical theater. Duke has some musical
history herself. As a teen star, she recorded six bubble gum records,
including her one hit, 1964's "Please Don't Just Stand There." Her
last professional venture in music was the 1965 film, "Billie," in
which she played a singing tomboy who joins the boys' track team.
(Her voice was dubbed over in the soundtrack of the 1967 camp
clunker, "Valley of the Dolls.")</TE>
<TE>   So wouldn't Sondheim seem like the logical next step?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It's a leap, isn't it?" she says and laughs. It's a couple of
days before the first rehearsal, and Duke is being interviewed on a
sunny bench outside the darkened Wadsworth. For a TV icon, she looks
very much like the nice lady from a small Idaho town that she's
become in recent years. She's wearing a pink flowered dress topped by
an unbuttoned white blouse with short sleeves, barely any makeup and
big wire-rimmed glasses that magnify her blue eyes. She speaks in a
raspy voice that bears little relationship to the TV teen of yore
after so many years of smoking and stress. Duke laughs easily as she
explains why she opted to brave her first musical in 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that went into making the decision was that I
really wanted to take a risk," she continues. "I have a wonderful
life, but I have not been working in television. That was my
bailiwick, and I thought, 'My God, if not now, when? How many more
times are people going to offer me a musical?'</TE>
<TE>   "So here I am," she says with a hoot. "Terrified."</TE>
<TE>   Duke, who went public with her 1982 discovery that she was
manic-depressive, is famous for facing her fears. When director
Arthur Allan Seidelman invited her to audition for the part of
Phyllis two months ago, she went for it. Seidelman has known Duke for
a dozen years and had worked with her on several projects, including
the 1996 TV film "Harvest of Fire," about arson among the Amish, as
well as play readings in L.A. and New York. He thought she'd be
perfect for the role of the embittered survivor Phyllis.</TE>
<TE>   The glamorous, world-weary Phyllis has one of the most difficult
songs in the show, crammed with rapid-fire, tongue-twisting
Sondheim-isms. In "The Story of Lucy and Jessie," Phyllis sings about
the two rivals for her husband's love--herself (Jessie) and the
housewife Sally (Lucy), or "juicy but drab Lucy and dressy but cold
Jessie."</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought that she was a brilliant actress and has all the
qualities that are so right for Phyllis--intelligence, emotional
complexity," Seidelman says. "She's at a perfect point in her life to
play Phyllis. I also knew that she sang and was interested in doing
musicals, so I put it all together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duke's career began on the stage in 1959, when she played Helen
Keller in the Broadway production of "The Miracle Worker," a role she
re-created on film in an Oscar-winning performance. At the time, the
New York Times raved, "As Helen, little Miss Duke is altogether
superb."</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, she performed in theaters around the country,
sometimes with her third husband, John Astin. But by the '80s, her
stage career had dwindled to a trickle, drying up completely after a
1990 run of "Meetings on the Porch" at the Canon Theatre in Beverly
Hills. So by the time Seidelman asked her to do a reading of Richard
Alfieri's "The Sisters" in L.A. five years ago, the stage was a
distant memory for her.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost foreign to me, and I wasn't sure I understood the
play all that well," Duke says. "I got two lines out of my mouth, and
the audience roared with laughter. I suddenly knew what the play was
about. And it was that kind of night for me where I could do no
wrong. It was like the manic highs, and what that is, of course, is
the drug that keeps you coming back for more." Since then, she's been
getting most of her fixes in civic theater in Spokane, Wash., near
her home in northern Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   When Duke arrived for her "Follies" audition, Seidelman asked the
production's music director, Gerald Sternbach, to help prepare her.
"She was really gung-ho when I vocalized her, and she sight-read it a
little bit," Sternbach says. "She's musical enough to hit the notes
and, because of her instincts, she gets the values of the lyric and
the arc of the piece."</TE>
<TE>   Duke was offered the job on the spot. "She has the perfect voice
for Phyllis," Seidelman says. "It's filled with the dramatic
intensity and bite that is Phyllis."</TE>
<TE>   When Duke returned to Idaho, she got to work. For the next two
months, she spent four hours a day, six days a week, working with
singing and dancing coaches from a local college. Oddly enough, those
were the first lessons she'd ever had, because the Svengali-like
couple who managed her as a child and made her a star never bothered
with them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fascinating to me that they did not insist that there be
those kinds of lessons," Duke muses. "But she [Ethel Ross] was a
dancer, and she decided if I ever needed to dance, she'd teach me the
five steps I needed and that would be that. Then when I got away from
them on my own, I was so involved in my own mental illness and
getting married and having children, the idea of going to tap-dance
classes didn't come up."</TE>
<TE>   Ethel Ross and her then-husband, John, isolated her from her
family, subjected her to relentless work and changed her given name
from Anna Marie, declaring, "Anna Marie is dead." She recounted her
childhood trials--as the daughter of a chronically depressed mother
who kicked out her alcoholic father when she was 6--in the first of
two best-selling memoirs, "Call Me Anna" (1988), written with Los
Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan.</TE>
<TE>   But she's quick to point out that the couple who claimed her youth
also protected her by seeing that she owned one-third of "The Patty
Duke Show," which produced income for her when it was rerun on
Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite until a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that she has some distance from that painful period, Duke can
count her blessings. "When you walk down the street and a total
stranger sings a 40-year-old theme to you, you go, 'Someone was
paying attention.' I love it! Strangers nod and smile or call out, 'I
love you.' What a nice way to go through life. Other people don't
even say 'excuse me' to other people, and a total stranger is sending
me love vibes."</TE>
<TE>   The reruns have also generated a new crop of fervent fans. Not
long ago, a group of nine college-age Patty Duke aficionados from
around the country traveled to Spokane to catch a stage performance.
After the show, she invited them to the 80-acre farm she shares with
her firefighter husband, Michael Pearce, 47, adopted son Kevin, 13,
and 53 llamas, horses, miniature donkeys and horses, goats, sheep and
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "What was most fun--or most frightening, I'm not sure which--was
one would start talking about an episode of the old series, and
they'd all pick it up," she says. "They knew every line. When they
went home, I hugged and kissed each one of them and said, 'Now get a
life!' "</TE>
<TE>   Duke moved on long ago. "Patty" doesn't play much of a role in her
personal life, where she's known as Anna. Her family calls her Anna
Banana. And now that her actor son Sean Astin, 31, has a child of his
own and another on the way, she's become Nana Anna Banana.</TE>
<TE>   After she married Pearce in 1985, Duke became stepmother to his
daughters, Charlene, 24, a genetic researcher, and Raelene, who
drowned in a 1998 car accident at age 22. The wound hasn't totally
healed yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll see a girl driving in a car and her hair seems to be the
same way and you go...." She gasps. "I thought maybe I was just being
mentally ill, but my husband says that he has the same experience. We
seem to be at a rather calm place, but even that will get better for
us as we decide what it is we believe in terms of the larger picture.
I mean, I believe, then I don't believe. I'm hoping God's ego will
handle it OK," she says and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   As for her other children, Duke says she's grateful for her close
relationships with Sean and his actor brother, Mackenzie Astin, 29,
despite the rough childhood to which she subjected them before her
illness was diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no patience," she says. "This was not all the time. The
thing that these kids had going against them was that you never knew
when what was all hunky-dory was going to fly out the window and you
were going to be screamed at and berated and either ostracized or
made to do some humiliating punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Mac has told her he's finally ready to write a memoir about those
years, which leaves her with mixed emotions. "My stomach goes grrrrr.
We know what he's going to write about. And I really have told
everything I can tell without impeding on the privacy of other
people.</TE>
<TE>   "But as painful as it might be for me, it will also be remarkably
interesting to finally really hear it from their point of view. They
just sort of said, 'She's OK now. She's taking her pills.' Well,
that's not enough for them. They have to examine it further. And if
that means making Mom look not so good, that's the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   But since there are indeed second acts in life, Duke is hoping
that hers will be a robust career on the stage, ultimate destination
New York. Meanwhile, she's bonding with her fellow thespians in the
strange garden on Burbank Boulevard, where she's taking a cigarette
break. At one point, Sternbach goes over to her and bends down to
embrace her 5-foot frame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so proud of you," he stage-whispers into her ear. "Fearless.
You're fearless."</TE>

<LD>Hurrah for Christopher Knight ("Why Pay to See Our Own Art?," June
9)! He wrote for the art-loving public, poor and not-so-poor alike. A
county institution, supported by our tax dollars, should by all means
be available free of charge to all ... just as the libraries are (as
Knight so ably pointed out).</LD>
<LD>   Among our friends, cultured and concerned people, there are
rumblings of discontent about the enormous expense involved in
tearing down the existing museum and erecting a new building, which
Knight considers "exciting" (open for dispute).</LD>
<LD>   If all that money can be spent on the facility itself, not put to
public vote, what gives the institution the right to assume that we
should be willing to support it with admission fees?</LD>
<TE>   PEGGY AYLSWORTH LEVINE</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't agree more with Knight's call to eliminate the
admission charge for LACMA's permanent collection. Letting us in for
free may even convince me to reinstate my membership in an
institution that I had begun to perceive as imperious when it decided
unilaterally that another face-lift was more important than the
mission to build the collection and serve the public.</TE>
<TE>   PETER HESS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was with wistfulness and longing that the photo of the Saint
Louis Art Museum greeted me in Knight's article on LACMA's admission
policy. After returning to Los Angeles from living in St. Louis for
two years, I have missed my spur-of-the-moment visits to the free
museum, where I could linger over artwork that I would not normally
have been drawn to in a typical marathon visit of trying to get my
money's worth of art viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Since my return to L.A. last year, I have not visited LACMA
because, honestly, right now I can't afford it at $7 per person plus
parking expenses. But I have visited the Getty twice, where $5 parks
a carload of people. How sad that the Getty, in the hills of
Brentwood, is becoming the accessible people's museum instead of
LACMA, in the heart of the city.</TE>

<TE>   I agree with Knight's argument for free admittance to LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   I did go to the Luca Giordano exhibition (it was indeed
remarkable), but was surprised at the $7 admission fee and dismayed
to find only two other people attending the show.</TE>
<TE>   A museum of this stature should really be a public institution
similar to a library. People certainly should not be dissuaded from
attending because of a steep admission fee. A voluntary fee could be
substituted and would probably bring in almost as much revenue, or
perhaps the shortfall could be taken out of the massive
reconstruction budget.</TE>

<LD>Some interesting lines in Steve Hochman's write-up on the BellRays
(Pop Eye, June 9). Has Alan McGee done it again? Yes, thanks to Alan,
we can finally discover the BellRays.</LD>
<LD>   Come on. The BellRays have won best local band awards from both
the LA Weekly critics poll and the New Times readers poll.</LD>
<LD>   They have been a headlining act in Los Angeles for five years.
They have toured the United States as club headliners for, I dunno,
three or four years at least. Now, McGee talks it up and we all bow
to the East.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the case, they're a great band and I hope they burst
through to mainstream consciousness, because the mainstream could use
just such a kick. If they succeed, however, it would be sad if McGee
gets the big pat on the back as if the wave of his hand made it all
so.</TE>

<LD>It should be noted that the four classic MGM films cited by Robert W.
Welkos as part of that company's "storied history" are no longer
owned by the studio ("A Lion Laid Low," June 9). They and about 2,000
other pre-1986 MGM titles and the studio's fabled Culver City lot
were sold to Turner Broadcasting 16 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the foresight of Ted Turner, the films' current owner,
AOL Time Warner--through its far-flung cable television and home
video divisions--now profits handsomely from the toil of long-gone
MGM stars, writers, technicians and financial investments.</LD>
<LD>   Reading Welkos' article, one would never know that the cause of
MGM's sad decline is fairly simple: As majority stockholder over most
of the past 33 years, Las Vegas entrepreneur Kirk Kerkorian has
systematically gutted the studio to finance the building of
hotel-casinos, an airline and assorted other ventures, periodically
reinventing the company to great fanfare, but always conspicuously
leaving it a lion bereft of its teeth.</LD>

<LD>I am writing in response to Agustin Gurza's article on Paulina Rubio
("She's Ready [She Says]," June 9). I am shocked that the editor
allowed such a biased article to be published. I give Gurza credit
for the detail and information he supplied. He did a good job
pointing out her high points, but an even better one pointing out her
low points.</LD>
<LD>   If Gurza's intentions were to make people see what kind of artist
he thinks Rubio is, to me it showed unprofessional journalism with
catty lines and remarks in every other paragraph.</LD>
<LD>   Rubio summed it up perfectly when she stated, "I'm not going to
change because of anyone." That is why we fans, old and new, admire
and respect her. And we think she is ready.</LD>

<LD>Reed Johnson's commentary on "Attack of the Clones" ("Who's Soaring
Now?," June 2) is completely flawed, as he and other "critics"
futilely compare "Attack of the Clones" and "Spider-Man." Johnson's
bias toward "Spider-Man" is rooted in the movie's "recognizable,
loving and rapturous view of New York."</LD>
<LD>   Johnson complains about the "big, portentous digital set-pieces"
of "Attack of the Clones." I could not disagree more that "no single
image" from "Episode II" was "remotely lyrical or memorable." Jango
Fett blasting at Obi-Wan Kenobi while flying away in a downpour.
R2-D2 flying to save Padme. The light-saber battle between Anakin and
Count Dooku. "Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" should not be
compared. Spidey is at his best grounded on this planet, whereas the
Jedis are at their best battling evil a long time ago, in a galaxy
far, far away.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Johnson rightly praises the excellence of "character and plot" in
"Spider-Man." The plot is suspenseful; the characters grow and change
before our eyes. But he does not give credit for these things to the
person who deserves it most.</TE>
<TE>   It is no coincidence that the writer, David Koepp, has his name on
the mega-hits "Jurassic Park," "Mission: Impossible" and
"Spider-Man." By recognizing the contribution of the screenwriter,
Johnson can help lead the way to more great summer films like
"Spider-Man."</TE>

<HD>An Ancient Legend Goes Aloft</HD>
<DH>The Arthurian 'Avalon' adds aerialists, rock music and
puppets to dance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>Victoria Looseleaf is a frequent contributor to
Calendar.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not as if dancer-choreographer Josie Walsh is reinventing the
wheel with her upcoming multidisciplinary production, "Avalon," but
she is trying to put an indelible spin on the legend of King Arthur.
Indeed, in the Walsh work, which opens Wednesday at Hollywood's
Doolittle Theatre, ballet blends with hip-hop, aerialists soar over
martial artists and actors, and a long-haired singer belts out
apocalyptic, industrial rock while parading around the stage on
stilts.</LD>
<LD>   If it all sounds a bit Cirque du Soleil-ish, according to
30-year-old Walsh, who has danced with, among others, Joffrey Ballet
and Zurich Ballet, think again. During a break in rehearsal--a steamy
pas de deux--Walsh explains: "They're circus-based with some dance,
we're just the opposite. We're dance-based and we use circus arts to
enhance choreographic opportunities--a way to successfully defy
gravity. Cirque creates an experience more than a story. I'm trying
to do both--where you walk into a world and there's a story within
that."</LD>
<TE>   Walsh's universe, populated by a cast of 23, is one in which
Christians and pagans duke it out. There are the usual characters of
Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, along with birds, spiders, fauns and
alluring sirens, to name but a few of the creations inhabiting
"Avalon." Abetting Walsh are her 2-year-old dance company, Myo;
Ingrid Hoffman, artistic director of Belisama Aerial Dance Project;
theatrical director-puppeteer Jamie Alexis (who also wrote the
actors' dialogue and helped design the costumes); and the rock band
Surve, fronted by Walsh's husband, Paul Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Avalon" unfolds in a linear fashion with a narrative, it
is far from traditional. The actors are mainly used to introduce more
than 10 dance numbers created by Walsh. The dance, she says, is the
energy behind what the actors say.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point is to keep the show seamless," says Walsh, who
began choreographing five years ago at Zurich Ballet and who
currently teaches 10 classes a week as well as choreographs and
dances for television sitcoms and fashion shows. "I didn't want just
a series of unconnected dance pieces. The actors weave the story, and
the dance is another expression of what they said. We also make the
audience part of the story."</TE>
<TE>   During scene changes and intermissions, for example, Merlin and
other characters carry on a dialogue with patrons in their seats and
in the lobby. "It's almost like stepping into a different dimension,"
Walsh says.</TE>
<TE>   "Avalon" has plenty of theatrical models beyond nouveau cirque.
Peter Brook's 1973 Ahmanson staging of the Royal Shakespeare
Company's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" had Oberon and Puck swinging
from trapezes, while the Flying Karamazov Brothers, in their 1984
performance of Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors" at the Mark Taper
Forum, made use of gymnastics and juggling, among other sideshow
skills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, however, came by her notion to combine circus arts with
dance a bit by happenstance. She met Hoffman, a trapeze artist, when
Hoffman signed up for one of her ballet classes in 1999. That
connection led to Hoffman's troupe of aerialists and Walsh's Myo
company presenting "CarniVinyl," a series of performances at the El
Rey Theatre in spring 2001.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Hoffman began training the Myo dancers in trapeze
work. Serendipitously, Hoffman and Walsh were both obsessed with the
Arthurian legend, and after three months of working together, the
result was "Avalon." The show debuted last November at the 300-seat
Ivar Theatre in Hollywood, and has since been expanded for the
1,100-seat Doolittle house with a larger cast and several revamped
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Writing about the original production, Times dance critic Lewis
Segal said the show resembled a Las Vegas production in miniature,
with "big ambitions and plenty of talent to realize them."</TE>
<TE>   Myo member Aaron Hendry, who trained in track and field and has
been a street performer in Europe, also danced with Jacques Heim's
acrobatic Diavolo Dance Theatre in L.A. for a year.</TE>
<TE>   In "Avalon," Hendry assumes several roles, mostly for comic
relief, including a sword-fighting King Stag and a Pan-like faun who
gambols in the audience. In addition, he does trapeze work, courtesy
of Hoffman's instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, physical theater and spectacle theater is a new way of
telling a story," Hendry says. "When you go to see a play, that's
words. You know words, and words don't surprise you. When you go see
a play that is told with a language you don't know, like 'Avalon,' it
makes you think that things are possible that you didn't previously
believe to be possible."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Ferris, 21, the youngest Myo member, studied ballet and jazz
in Phoenix before moving to L.A. in 1999. She too enrolled in Walsh's
ballet classes, where students execute fouettes to music by the
folk-pop duo Dead Can Dance more often than to Chopin. Ferris was one
of the dancers who learned her aerial moves from Hoffman. She works
with lengths of fabric "rope" instead of a trapeze.</TE>
<TE>   "At first it was a little scary, climbing up these pieces of
fabric," she says, "but in a sense it's dancing, only you're using a
tool besides your body. You're defying gravity, but in a way you do
that when you have to leap and jump in the air as a dancer. You have
to learn how to be sustained in the air, know where your body weight
is, how to tie yourself up and do certain tricks."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, who recently suffered a shoulder injury (and last
performed solo in May at the American Stunt Awards in Santa Monica),
will dance in "Avalon," but is laying off the trapeze for this show.
The star flier, instead, is Ginger Griep-Ruiz, a Cirque du Soleil
aerialist, along with nine of Myo's 12 members.</TE>
<TE>   Says Hoffman: "I've worked with circus performers before, and when
you work with circus performers, even though you're getting more
tricks and skills, the dancers are far more expressive with their
bodies."</TE>
<TE>   As for the logistics of putting actors, aerialists and dancers on
stage together, Walsh acknowledges that it's been tough. Her
shoestring budget has meant limited rehearsal time for the entire
cast at the Doolittle. "We know what we're doing with the show now,"
she says, "and the separate rehearsals are for perfecting the
different arts and disciplines--the weaving and the interludes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a kamikaze jump to the Doolittle," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh hopes this leap leads to another. She has recently
incorporated Myo and has another multidisciplinary production in
mind: "Gone With the Whim," her take on Scarlett O'Hara and company.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to keep doing this," she says. "My shows are meant to be
entertaining, to reach a non-dance as well as a dance crowd. I don't
want to copy somebody else. My work just comes through, and I'm just
being true to that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unconventional," Walsh adds with a laugh, "that's for
sure."</TE>

<DH>Ruprecht von Kaufmann wants viewers to feel a little
trapped in his large canvases because they raise questions about
ourselves</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>Leah Ollman is a regular contributor to Calendar.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruprecht von Kaufmann's paintings are unnerving. They thrust viewers
into face-to-face confrontations with the vulnerable, naked and
trapped, the compromised and the morally ambiguous. Daunting as well
is Von Kaufmann's technical facility. He paints physical and
psychological aspects of the human figure with uncanny
persuasiveness.</LD>
<LD>   At 28, Von Kaufmann has already had a handful of well-received
solo exhibitions in San Diego, Chicago and Los Angeles. Several group
shows of representational painting--most recently, "Representing
L.A.," at the Laguna Art Museum--have also featured his work, which
abounds with religious, literary, philosophical, historical and art
historical references. Grady Harp, curating a show of figurative art
for the Art Institute of Southern California in 1999, wrote of the
way Von Kaufmann draws "from the pessimism of 20th century
philosophy, literature and psychology" while allowing for the
possibility of redemption. Of the 14 artists in that show, Harp wrote
in the exhibition catalog, "it is the youngest among them, Ruprecht
von Kaufmann, who shakes his fist at the universe most fiercely."</LD>
<LD>   Although figurative art is generally considered a genre distinct
from abstraction and conceptual art, Von Kaufmann rejects the
division.</LD>
<TE>   "For me, it's quite natural to work with figures, but there are
certain things that are easier to achieve through abstraction," he
said, sitting in the Koplin Gallery, where his latest show was about
to be installed. "I don't really believe in the categorization of
styles. It's absurd, because they blend together. They're not
mutually exclusive. A conceptual artist can use figures in his work,
and figurative paintings, to a certain degree, are abstract. When you
look really close at a painting, you have all these textures and they
kind of fall apart into something different, and you can just enjoy
the quality of the paint."</TE>
<TE>   Categorizing people can be just as problematic, says Von Kaufmann,
a tall, slightly reserved young man with a spunky, tousled haircut.
He's referring to three huge paintings in the show. They depict a
dense pack of nude figures, in one case waist-high in water, who are
seemingly pressed against a pane of glass. Men, women, and children
in a variety of shapes and colors cram together like subway
passengers at rush hour. But they aren't headed anywhere, they're
stuck, fully exposed, in a sort of display case. Most are passively
resigned to their fate, although a few are agitated enough to seek
reprieve above the heads of the others. Along the back of one man's
neck, a tattoo reads, "All animals are equal, some are more equal
than others."</TE>
<TE>   The titles of the paintings--"S-80-116-12," for instance--refer,
somewhat jokingly, Von Kaufmann says, to the size of the canvas and
the number of figures each contains. He calls the series "the human
zoo."</TE>
<TE>   "We always like to categorize groups," the German-born artist
says, with just a trace of an accent. "It helps us to say they're not
us, we'd better just care for ourselves. But we need to think of how
our actions are going to impact this other group of people. That's
why I like this image of people stuck together, because every move
that one person does is going to impact another person. Many people
still think of this planet as being really big, but I think it's
getting smaller and smaller. Everything we do is eventually going to
come around to haunt us."</TE>
<TE>   The figures in the paintings stand nearly life-size, and the glass
they appear to press against reveals itself in part through faint
reflections of clothed spectators on our side of the display.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to use figurative painting in a different way, not as
though you're looking into another space, like television, which is
not very real," he said. "The canvas is like a mirror, and this way,
hopefully the humanity of the figures is more real."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by these paintings, the viewer might feel trapped,
which is just what Von Kaufmann wants. Yet he doesn't see the works
as disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people see them that way," he says. "I want to make them
beautiful. They're not comfortable, but you want people to stop and
engage themselves a bit. I'm very attracted to that combination of
beautiful and appalling."</TE>
<TE>   He finds that friction in the meditative yet bleak canvases of
Mark Rothko and the aggressive but elegiac works of Anselm Kiefer.
It's also one of the striking characteristics of the work of F. Scott
Hess, Von Kaufmann's mentor at Art Center College of Design. Hess, in
his most recent body of work, paints scenes jarring in their marriage
of the vivid and the mysterious.</TE>
<TE>   Before transferring to the Pasadena campus in the mid-'90s, Von
Kaufmann studied briefly at the school's former European annex in
Switzerland. After graduating, he stayed in L.A. for a few years,
working part-time as a design consultant for Fox television, doing
"dreadful things that paid well." Disenchanted with Southern
California, in December 2000, he moved to New York.</TE>
<TE>   The "human zoo" paintings in the Koplin show were conceived before
the events of Sept. 11, although Von Kaufmann recognizes that the
attacks have heightened the urgency of their humanistic message. The
other series in the show came directly out of the terrorist attacks
and their aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "I was inspired by hearing the word 'evil' too often on the
radio," Von Kaufmann explains. It seemed "very easy and lazy," he
says, to use that label with such black-and-white certainty,
pronouncing people either with us or against us, guilty or innocent.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he had been working on a group of paintings of
fetuses, floating in utero, modest-sized canvases in radiant orange,
violet and emerald. He decided to pair each canvas with a painting on
film, made to look like the X-ray of a baby, and displayed in a light
box. To the X-ray images he applied identification labels, among
them: Stalin, Pol Pot, Robespierre, Leslie Groves (director of the
Manhattan Project), Carl Clauberg (Nazi doctor in charge of mass
sterilization program).   "I was trying to find people who shared a
common characteristic, that they started out believing so strongly in
their ideals that they eventually were willing to pay any price to
achieve that goal."</TE>
<TE>   The series, like so much of Von Kaufmann's work, plays off the
friction between what appeals to the eye and what chafes the mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to force a certain perspective on the viewer," he says.
"First you'll see a cute little baby, and at first you'll sympathize.
Then you see who it is and you're appalled. All of these started out,
presumably, as loved children. Was it their environment, their times,
or an evil gene? Is there such a thing as an evil gene?"</TE>
<TE>   An additional painting in the series brings those provocative
questions close to home. In format, it resembles the rest, with the
floating fetus exuding innocence and the painted X-ray presenting a
falsely authoritative window to the subject's inner being. Von
Kaufmann labels this one differently, however. In place of a specific
name, he's identified this package of human possibility, in German,
as "Jederman"--"everyone." This, he hopes, is where we project
ourselves into the picture and muse on our own potential for evil.</TE>
<TE>   Von Kaufmann's previous work summoned us in as well through the
bracing stares of the figures that bridge the pictorial space and our
own.</TE>
<TE>   The narratives, though, tended to be more complex, with symbolic
elements pulling them in multiple, incompatible directions. One
painting from 1998, for instance, shows several physicians attending
to a dying man. One doctor's clipboard bears a sketch of a work by
Marcel Duchamp, another the name of German satirist. The new work is
more pared down, but just as involving. In his statement for the
Koplin show, Von Kaufmann declares that he wants to "turn the viewer
into a conspirator." He rails against complacency, both the kind that
enables a viewer to pass by a painting without becoming engaged, and
the kind that allows for violence to recur with cyclical regularity.</TE>
<TE>   "When people see a representational painting, there are
recognizable clues that give them ways to approach the painting," he
said. "But at the same time, they can also distance themselves by
saying, 'This is just a painting. I'm looking into a window to
another world, but it's not really my world.' I was looking for a way
to draw the viewer into the paintings and have them participate, to
lessen the narrative and base the work on impact. I was looking for
ways to simplify the narrative, but I still put in a lot of clues."</TE>

<LD>   KORN</LD>
<LD>   "Untouchables"</LD>
<TE>   Epic/Immortal</TE>
<TE>   Kick-starting the nu-metal movement a decade ago with its
self-titled debut while tearing into the tortured souls of America's
youth with anguished themes and raging rhythms wasn't enough for
Korn. The Bakersfield-bred, L.A.-based quintet went on to explore
disparate styles and soundscapes with each subsequent release, from
the bawdy, humorous "Life Is Peachy" to its hook-heavy follow-up,
"Follow the Leader," to the grim, gritty "Issues."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Korn's fifth album proves again that the group
isn't out to ride the bandwagon--unless it's in a demolition derby.
Revved-up hip-hoppish grooves, monstrous riffs and vocals that range
freakishly from demonic to childlike have become its signature and
inspired a slew of copycats, but this time out Korn grinds its sound
down to its gloomy core.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Jonathan Davis may be best known for his possessed shrieks
and beat-box vocal inflections, but on "Untouchables," he keeps them
to a minimum and instead churns out more straightforward, if equally
agonized, croons and wails. Catchy choruses collide with furious
beats on tunes such as the audacious opener, "Here to Stay," while
the noisy assaults "Embrace" and "Wake Up Hate" have a
Metallica-meets-Ministry menace. But it's slow, goth-like cuts such
as "Thoughtless" and "Alone I Break" that demonstrate the band's
maturity and ability to transcend neo-metal shtick.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, "Untouchables" takes a more languid approach more akin
to the mechanical eroticism of Nine Inch Nails, the bleak harmonies
of Alice in Chains and even the melodious musings of Staind than to
the rowdy attacks of today's rapping headbangers. Indeed, now that
the simple punch of retro-punk and buoyant zing of folksy pop seem to
be loosening modern metal's hold on rock radio, Korn's subtle shift
in velocity feels fresh.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the band's sinister bent
and ability to convey frustration in an aggressive yet melancholy
way.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever kind of backlash may be ahead for heavy music,
"Untouchables" demonstrates Korn's trust that somber, severe
perspectives on life coupled with relentless, infectious sounds will
continue to touch adolescent rock fans.</TE>

<TE>   OAKENFOLD</TE>
<TE>   "Bunkka"</TE>
<TE>   Maverick</TE>
<TE>   While Paul Oakenfold is one of the most popular DJs in the world,
he is also accomplished in the studio. As much as for his club gigs,
the Englishman made his mark in the U.K. in the late '80s by handling
production for the Happy Mondays. So although "Bunkka" (in stores
Tuesday) is his first "artist album" (i.e., a recording of original
material), Oakenfold brings strong studio credentials to the table,
and this exceptionally tight electronic record reflects those skills.</TE>
<TE>   Utilizing a number of guest performers, including Nelly Furtado
(who appears with Tricky on the rhythmic, sultry "The Harder They
Come"), Perry Farrell (the break-beat "Time of Your Life") and Hunter
S. Thompson, the album offers a distinctive musical map through the
many subgenres of the dance world.</TE>
<TE>   Oakenfold's greatest asset as a producer is how adept he is at
every genre and tempo. From the fast-paced techno opener, "Ready,
Set, Go," to the hypnotic "Hold Your Hand" (with Icelandic singer
Emiliana Torrini) to dramatic, gothic "Zoo York," every track is
crisp.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Bunkka" might be a little too polished. More spontaneity
or a few imperfections could provide insight into Oakenfold as an
artist, something his longtime followers surely were hoping for from
this collection.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as a studio work, "Bunkka" lives up to the high
expectations. Oakenfold plays the Mayan Theatre in L.A. on Monday.</TE>

<TE>   WYCLEF JEAN</TE>
<TE>   "Masquerade"</TE>
<TE>   Columbia</TE>
<TE>   On Wyclef Jean's first two solo albums, "Wyclef Jean Presents the
Carnival" and "The Ecleftic," the co-founder of rap trio the Fugees
was like a glad-handing hip-hop diplomat, spreading his genres around
to please everyone who might listen. Those albums were eclectic with
a capital E, but the overblown world music arrangements often felt
clumsily tacked on to Wyclef Jean's streetwise raps.</TE>
<TE>   'Clef has left the carnival behind on "Masquerade," whose title
refers not to party time but to bogus hip-hop posers.</TE>
<TE>   The album's lithe, understated hip-hop is a spiritual heir to the
Fugees' 1996 breakthrough album, "The Score." On the first track,
"Peace God," Wyclef raps about doing it " 'Crouching Tiger'-style,"
but it's just a subtle dash of Asian flavor--a trilling flute gliding
over a stutter-kick beat. "PJ's," with its ominous piano figure,
takes its cue from the Wu-Tang Clan's urban gothic.</TE>
<TE>   "Masquerade" works best on tracks such as these, when Wyclef
telescopes his hip-hop into tightly arranged proportions. It stumbles
whenever he gets lazy and resorts to the familiar. "What a Night," a
remake of the Four Seasons' 1976 hit "Oh What a Night," and a wan
version of Bob Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" are facile
radio-hit bids best suited for wannabe players.</TE>

<TE>   JULIA FORDHAM</TE>
<TE>   "Concrete Love"</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard</TE>
<TE>   The British singer-songwriter's first new release since 1997's
"East West" is a smooth, quietly passionate collection of blue-eyed
neo-soul pop that updates her sound while retaining her well-honed
romantic themes of heartbreak, yearning and newfound bliss.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of guest vocalists India.Arie (harmonizing on the
title track) and Joe Henry underscores Fordham's versatility. Yet
it's the Southern California resident's own agile, four-octave voice
that often rivets the listener as she slips precisely from sultry
depths to soaring heights.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing resilience and vulnerability, Fordham makes such numbers
as the torchy "Missing Man" and the gospel-tinged "Roadside Angel"
particularly affecting, while her sinuous purring gives the jazzy
"Love" a cool, Sade-like sensation.</TE>
<TE>   "Roadside Angel" was inspired by Minnie Riperton, to whom Fordham
pays further homage by rendering the late singer's 1975 chart-topper,
"Lovin' You," in a hidden closing track. Fordham's admiration for
this song explains the album's '70s-pop sensibility, which is
carefully modernized with rhythmic electronica undercurrents by Joni
Mitchell producer Larry Klein.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing complex emotions with simple phrases, Fordham (who
plays the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Tuesday, the day of the
album's release) is pragmatic even when things don't work out.
Indeed, one of her nicer twists is the almost-blues ballad "Foolish
Thing," which laments a lost love even while realizing the guy
couldn't handle her fabulousness anyway.</TE>

<TE>   ANASTACIA</TE>
<TE>   "Freak of Nature"</TE>
<TE>   Epic</TE>
<TE>   This New York-raised singer is the latest in a long line of
American-born artists who went overseas to make a name. The aspiring
diva conquered Europe with her 2000 debut, "Not That Kind," which
went multi-platinum worldwide and earned her numerous international
awards.</TE>
<TE>   Anastacia now sets her sights homeward with this 13-track
collection (in stores Tuesday). The record's centerpiece is the
forceful pop anthem "Paid My Dues," which dominated MTV Europe for
much of last year. Anastacia's husky vocals distinguish "Paid My
Dues" from the scores of other dance pop tunes out there and give it
a gritty authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "Freak of Nature" is best when Anastacia plays the diva card and
lets her considerable attitude dominate the sound. In the old-school
disco number "One Day in Your Life," she declares, "I'm stronger than
before" with an authority that would make Gloria Gaynor proud.</TE>
<TE>   Anastacia also matches R&amp;B singer Faith Evans note for note on the
duet "I Thought I Told You That," which rides a heavy, repetitive
beat that crosses hip-hop and pop.</TE>
<TE>   "Freak of Nature" does suffer from too-heavy production at times,
and from a few misguided ballads, particularly the maudlin "I Dreamed
You." But Anastacia's obvious charisma shines through those
shortcomings.</TE>

<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Jerry Cantrell, "Degradation Trip," Roadrunner. Alice in
Chains self-destructed long before the recent drug-overdose death of
singer Layne Staley, but this second solo album from guitarist
Cantrell suggests the band still had musical fire left. The sound is
dependably rough and moody, where grunge meets Zeppelin. His vocals
are surprisingly strong, fittingly dark but unmannered. Yet the epic
voice missing on the song "Solitude" isn't Staley's but Robert
Plant's, as the guitarist slowly weaves electric and acoustic
guitars, his voice growling of dark thoughts and misty mountaintops,
lamenting of endless agony and despair, like a man who lost his band
too soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Guided by Voices, "Universal Truths and Cycles," Matador.
Last year's slick major-label project behind him, Robert Pollard
returns as extemporaneous--not to mention smirky--as ever. Pollard
devotees will celebrate this self-produced effort (due Tuesday) as a
return to "form." Others might wonder: What foolishness will you
suffer for the odd three minutes of pop genius? Guided by Voices
performs Wednesday at the West Hollywood House of Blues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   *** DJ Quik, "Under Tha Influence," Bungalo. This Compton
rapper-producer mixes frank sex talk and rugged gangster themes with
delightful results. Quik again hits his groove on his sixth album, a
strong batch of elegant beats and cunning lyrics from one of the
genre's most underappreciated artists. Quik has a social slant too,
mourning the death in 2000 of his rapping friend Mausberg, and the
toll the streets can exact on the touching "50 Ways."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Outrageous Cherry, "The Book of Spectral Projections,"
Rainbow Quartz. Originally released in England on Alan McGee's
Poptones label, this Detroit foursome's sprawling opus flails gamely
amid a psychedelic haze. Echoes of everything from garagey Stone
Roses to '60s piffle can be found here. Sorting them out is like
reading by lava lamp. The band performs July 21 at the Knitting
Factory Hollywood as part of International Pop Overthrow.</TE>

<HD>They Build Out Loud</HD>
<DH>Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and their bright, busy
architecture are the subjects of a crowded retrospective in San
Diego. Messy vitality, that's their style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>Christopher Reynolds is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown are a dapper, steel-willed
couple of architects with courtly manners and tastes more catholic
than some people find seemly. These enthusiasms include, but are not
limited to, Italian palazzos, Las Vegas, neon, Pennsylvania
farmhouses, Shakespearean sonnets, Lionel trains, Mickey Mouse,
miniskirts and the mosques of Cairo.</LD>
<LD>   Hence the untidy scene this summer at the Museum of Contemporary
Art San Diego, where a retrospective exhibition of the architects'
work is running through Sept. 8.</LD>
<LD>   Organized last year by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the
exhibition is a bright, loud, dense show, full of the interactions
between classical architecture and pop culture that have put Venturi
and Scott Brown among the world's most provocative architectural
thinkers since World War II.</LD>
<TE>   The irony in all this, Venturi said at the La Jolla museum just
before the exhibition's June 2 opening, is that "very few people
understand us. They don't understand what iconography means, and they
don't understand that we're in the electronic era, not the
industrial. A lot of people don't respect us. And a lot of people who
respect us still don't get us."</TE>
<TE>   These are just a few contradictions that Venturi and Scott Brown,
who have been personal and professional partners for 35 years, carry
with them.</TE>
<TE>   Although both are fond of coining aphorisms (beginning with
Venturi's "Less is a bore," circa 1966), the two former professors
consider themselves advocates for architecture that pays more
attention to history and context, less to novelty.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi's name is the one that rings bells internationally--he was
named alone when a Pritzker Prize jury gave him architecture's most
prestigious honor in 1991--but both say that Scott Brown, with her
background in architecture and city planning, brings a heightened
sense of site context and social ramifications to their work.</TE>
<TE>   Although the home in Philadelphia that Venturi designed for his
mother in 1964 is an icon of postmodernism among architecture
students, and although Venturi and Scott Brown have had about 180 of
their designs built over the years, their most widely recognized work
is not a signature building, but their books. Venturi's "Complexity
and Contradiction in Architecture" (1966) won him a name as a foe of
the stripped-down, industrial-flavored minimalism of the
International Style. In 1972, he and Scott Brown collaborated on
"Learning From Las Vegas" with Steven Izenour (who died last year
after 33 years as a principal in their firm).</TE>
<TE>   And although they've been outspoken in their admiration of
commercial design and pop culture, they get most of their commissions
from museums and universities, including two prominent buildings at
UCLA, the McDonald Medical Research Laboratories and the Gonda
(Goldschmied) Neuroscience and Genetics Research Center (completed in
1991 and 1998, respectively).</TE>
<TE>   They've never built in Las Vegas. In fact, joked Venturi, "we
probably made a mistake. We probably should have said, 'Learning From
Los Angeles.' One of my favorite things is to drive east on Sunset
Boulevard and just melt into the Sunset Strip. I am just thrilled by
the Sunset Strip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Venturi, who will mark his 77th birthday on June 25, was born in
Philadelphia, educated at Princeton and influenced by a two-year
fellowship in Rome in the mid-1950s. Scott Brown, 70, was born and
reared in southern Africa and came to the United States in 1958 to
study at the University of Pennsylvania. She and Venturi met as
fellow faculty members there in 1960--a year after the death of Scott
Brown's first husband, architect Robert Scott Brown--and began
collaborating on courses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, having accepted a position at UCLA, Scott Brown took
Venturi to Las Vegas for the first time, where the two were
alternately "appalled and fascinated," and the idea for "Learning
From Las Vegas" was born. A year later they married in Santa Monica
but soon returned to Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   They continue to live there while juggling clients as far-flung as
France and Japan. Even so, most commercial clients "are afraid of
us," Scott Brown said. Perhaps because they are so widely known for
outspokenness and challenging conventional wisdom, she said, "it's
been very hard for us, and it took us a long, long time" to reach
their current position.</TE>
<TE>   "No top-tier architectural firm of our time has more first-rate
unbuilt work in its archives," the New Republic's architecture
critic, Martin Filler, wrote last year. Filler blames clients, not
the architects, for the record of disappointments. But whatever the
root, Filler wrote, "this makes their retrospective a rather
bittersweet affair."</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, only so much gloom possible in a museum full of
Venturi and Scott Brown's designs. In their buildings, as in
conversation, they like nothing more than toying with words and
symbols.</TE>
<TE>   "Beware the urban bumpkin," Venturi once warned in a collection of
slogans. Also: "I'll take the vulgar over the pretentious any day."</TE>
<TE>   They once proposed placing a massive red apple in Manhattan's
Times Square (it didn't happen) and suggested a black-and-white
Dalmatian print for the walls of a fire station at the Walt Disney
World Resort in Florida (which did happen). And both enjoy the idea
of their show running roughly parallel with the retrospective of that
other habitual visual punster, Andy Warhol, at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He acknowledges the significance of the everyday and the
familiar, and makes it special by giving it a new context, by
changing its scale," Venturi said. In the end, "it's both familiar
and unfamiliar at the same time"--the same strategy of ambiguity that
Venturi and Scott Brown use in their designs.</TE>
<TE>   As with Warhol, some audiences look, shrug and wave off the work.
Writing in Building Design magazine last year, one critic complained
that all three--Venturi, Scott Brown and Warhol--had embraced
superficiality as a virtue and found "a perverse authenticity in
commercial junk."</TE>
<TE>   When Venturi and Scott look around among their contemporaries,
they like the work of Rem Koolhaas, who, like them, first made his
name with books, not buildings. Among younger up-and-comers, Venturi
and Scott Brown like a London-based firm called FAT.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't done much yet, and everything is very wry," Venturi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a visit to the FAT Web site reveals plenty of cleverness,
several designs that draw on postmodernist thinking, and a complex,
contradictory blurb of endorsement from none other than Robert
Venturi: "Not boring," it says, "but in a good way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even before the La Jolla exhibition's promotional sign went up at
the end of May--"Out of the Ordinary," in 3-foot red letters, just
below the roof line--the museum bore signs of Venturi and Scott
Brown: They designed a 1996 renovation and expansion there, updating
a building that was first designed as a residence by Irving Gill in
1916.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi is quick to voice his respect for the original--he counts
Gill's design among the five most significant homes in North America,
he says--but for even a casual visitor to the building, Venturi and
Scott Brown's sensibilities come bursting through soon enough.
Stepping past Gill's stately arches and columns into the atrium, a
visitor is struck by light and looks to see a skylight shooting
through the ceiling in the shape of a seven-point star, its edges
lighted in white neon.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition, adapted for display here with the architects'
input, is crowded enough to make the La Jolla museum's curators
nervous. The space, acknowledged assistant curator Rachel Teagle, "is
insanely tight, but it's fun. One of their favorite aphorisms is
'messy vitality,' and that's something we're going for in this
exhibition."</TE>
<TE>   The galleries teem with italicized slogans and bright-hued
designs, including "The Architect's Dream," a multimedia display
designed for the show that catalogs Venturi and Scott Brown's many
loves, including the palazzos, farmhouses, sonnets and toy trains.
(Also on the list: Michelangelo, bungalows, Beethoven and ketchup,
among other things.)</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition brings together drawings, photos, models and videos
in tight concentration. On some walls, images are stacked three high.
The display is arranged by six themes: academic, commercial, civic,
museums, housing, and decorative work, including a long row of
playfully decorated chairs.</TE>
<TE>   One central attraction is a model of the house Venturi built for
his mother, Vanna, in 1964. In his first book, "Complexity and
Contradiction in Architecture," Venturi used the home's design to
buttress his argument that architects and critics, then smitten with
the International Style, were overlooking the immense possibilities
within the "ordinary" vocabulary of American vernacular buildings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In awarding Venturi the Pritzker in 1991, the jury asserted that
Venturi's thinking, especially in that first book and house, "has
resulted in changing the course of architecture in this century,
allowing architects and consumers the freedom to accept
inconsistencies in form and pattern, to enjoy popular taste."</TE>
<TE>   Another chunk of exhibition space goes to Venturi and Scott
Brown's Sainsbury Wing addition to Britain's National Gallery,
completed the same year that Venturi was awarded the Pritzker. That
project may look relatively sedate compared with other work from the
last decade, but the National Gallery stands at the edge of Trafalgar
Square, one of the most treasured public spaces in London, and the
Venturi-Scott Brown design set of a storm of debate.</TE>
<TE>   One critic called it "a virtuoso demonstration of space, light,
volume and proportion." Another complained that "outside it is all
clever clowning, as short-lived and tiresome as a pun; inside it is
confused, ugly and incompetent."</TE>
<TE>   Good art, Venturi has since philosophized, "cannot be universally
liked in its time ... the issue is, do the right people hate it?"</TE>
<TE>   Less publicized projects, built and unbuilt, make up most of the
exhibition's 291 items. There is, for instance, the Baghdad mosque
that Venturi and Scott Brown proposed in a 1982 competition sponsored
(and then abandoned) by Saddam Hussein; and the University of
Michigan campus master plans they toiled over in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   For the La Jolla incarnation of the show, Venturi and Scott Brown
successfully lobbied for more photos and the inclusion of their
unbuilt designs for a new Philadelphia Orchestra concert hall. On
that project, which Scott Brown says is the unbuilt design that
haunts her most, Venturi and Scott Brown first won the commission,
and then lost it when one of the project's principal financial
backers lobbied instead for Argentine architect Rafael Vinoly.
(Vinoly's building, the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, opened
in December to mixed reviews.)</TE>
<TE>   The unbuilt project that nags at Venturi most is in the show too.
The Whitehall Ferry Terminal stands at Manhattan's edge as a landmark
for commuters from Staten Island, its facade doubled by reflection on
the water. In Venturi and Scott Brown's first design, the facade was
dominated by an enormous clock face; later, it was covered with an
LED signboard, intended to display information and images to
commuters.</TE>
<TE>   It was a chance for Venturi to erect a symbol of the electronic
age, and to leave a Venturi-Scott Brown calling card on a piece of
high-profile lower Manhattan real estate. But after prevailing in a
competition and working on the project from 1992 to 1996, the two
resigned the commission amid local officials' opposition to their
design. (The project, which went to Anderson/Schwartz Architects and
was delayed by the Sept. 11 attacks, remains under construction.)</TE>
<TE>   What keeps an architect working through such setbacks? With
Venturi nodding along, Scott Brown offered two fresh explanations,
each of them difficult to mount on a museum wall.</TE>
<TE>   "As we flew into Toulouse recently, we saw our [provincial
government] building there, a very, very big building," she said. "We
were at great pains to make it not look big from the ground. But from
the air you can really see how big it is. When I looked down at that,
I said, 'I did that.'</TE>
<TE>   "And at Michigan now, there's an extremely large hole in the
ground, several acres big. I am responsible for that hole. It's a
marvelous feeling, the notion that something has been in your head,
and there you see it."</TE>

<DH>L.A. Film Fest leaders want to turn it into a world-class

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Independent Features Project/West acquired the Los Angeles
Film Festival two years ago, it aspired to do what no one had ever
done: build a world-class film festival in the heart of movieland.
Almost immediately, executive director Dawn Hudson started to hear
passionate and disparate opinions of how she should proceed.</LD>
<LD>   "Someone said, 'You should just show documentary films.' One
person said we should make it like a filmmakers' campus and focus on
the art, not the business of filmmaking," she recalled. "Another said
it should be only a festival for the industry. A filmmaker said,
'Just make sure you have all the agents there. We want our films
bought.' Another said it should be for the general public only, a
film lovers' festival. Another person said, 'You should be Cannes in
L.A. and have a market and a festival and put it on the beach.' "</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the IFP/West, a respected nonprofit known for its
Independent Spirit Awards and support programs for indie filmmakers,
will open a reinvented festival with something for almost everyone.
"We're moving from a niche festival to a more general film festival,"
L.A. Film Festival programming director Rachel Rosen said. "We're
stretching any number of ways."</LD>
<TE>   Even among well-wishers, however, questions abound. For one, the
metamorphosis comes amid an explosion of film festivals, which have
multiplied an estimated fivefold during the past five years. There
are now 1,600 festivals around the world and 650 in the United
States, according to Filmfestivals Entertainment Group, an
international organization that provides Web and television support
to film festivals. None of the more than two dozen festivals in Los
Angeles ranks in the top 10, a list dominated by Sundance, Cannes,
Toronto, Venice and Berlin, said Bruno Chatelin, Filmfestivals' chief
operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   For another, it's unclear whether L.A. can support--or even
wants--another film festival. New festivals seem to pop up all the
time around Southern California, whether to promote tourism or to
draw specialty audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, you could make the argument that perhaps no
other city in the world is more able to support such a divergent mix
of film events," said Christian Gaines, director of the AFI Fest, the
American Film Institute festival, one of the largest and most
respected of Los Angeles' existing festivals. "On the other, you can
argue it contributes to disorientation and confusion among the film
community as well as the general public. Their feelings are, 'There
are too many film events and I can't quite keep up with them all.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the world's film center, Los Angeles needs a film festival less
than almost any other place in the world, said film critic Roger
Ebert. "There's no need for one in a town where every commercial
release plays usually before it plays anywhere else," he said. "It's
a company town that doesn't want anyone else managing the company
softball team."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the proliferation of local film festivals and the presence
of one of the world's three top film markets, the American Film
Market, Ebert said Sundance has become the "de facto Los Angeles film
festival."</TE>
<TE>   The city just doesn't provide the same cachet as far-flung
locales, said Dawn Moyer-Sims, marketing manager of Outfest, Los
Angeles' gay and lesbian festival, which takes place in July. "People
here want to go somewhere else to do it. It's exotic to go to
Sundance with a bunch of people hopping on a plane with their newly
purchased parkas and seeing what this snow stuff is all about. It's
exotic to say 'I'm flying off to Cannes and you can reach me on my
cell phone,' rather than 'I'm going down the street to the Directors
Guild of America.' "</TE>
<TE>   The very nature of Los Angeles--sprawling, chaotic, culturally
diverse, professionally jaded--raises the question of whether anyone
could create a world-class festival in the world center of the
entertainment industry. Jon Fitzgerald, a former director of the AFI
Fest, said, "In Los Angeles, you've got the unique combination of
being in the industry's backyard, but you have a very diverse
cultural community. It's really hard to have something for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, festivals have become an increasingly important
tool in getting audiences to see films--particularly smaller
independent films. "The more the film studios are in the clutches of
multinational companies, the fewer opportunities are in the
mainstream to make anything quirky," said "A Hollywood Education"
author and screenwriter David Freeman.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as festivals keep popping up, there's a chance that some
of this newer, more interesting work gets to be shown to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those problems that is bigger than show business,"
he added. "This is a cultural issue that cuts across national lines.
Anything the country does that provides the best of what we can make
is valuable, and should be treasured and encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers naturally are also looking for career-boosting deals
and distribution. Large festival audiences, especially
cinema-literate ones, can generate the kind of word-of-mouth that is
"gold to any marketing campaign," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a strong mix of films (153 in all) and related events,
IFP/West-Los Angeles Film Festival leaders know that their grand
ambitions rest on their ability to sell the 10-day event--Thursday
through June 29--to audiences beyond the usual film festival crowds.
"The biggest key to having a successful festival in Los Angeles is
having the ability to market to the general public," festival
director Rich Raddon said. To do that, they lined up high-level
sponsors, Target and In Style magazine, and by the spring had
unrolled an active marketing campaign. Hudson said the festival could
never have pulled off a publicity campaign on a similar scale on its
own.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't be marketing the festival on our limited resources in
this city, given that people spend millions and millions to open a
film here," Hudson said. The festival's $850,000 budget has been
augmented by an equal amount of in-kind donations, Raddon said.</TE>
<TE>   The dream of creating a major film festival in Los Angeles goes
back more than 30 years. One of the first to push for a festival was
the late director George Cukor, who in 1970 tried in vain to persuade
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to take
responsibility. His supporters hoped for a world-class event that
could challenge Lincoln Center's New York Film Festival artistically
and Cannes as a spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's foes, however, feared having their product labeled "art
house" and believed most films could only suffer from debuting at a
festival (this was well before a movie could benefit from "festival
buzz"). Minus the studios' cooperation, the festival would lack the
necessary glitz to gain worldwide attention. What's more, opponents
worried that the more influential New York critics would dismiss a
festival on the very grounds that it took place in the shadow of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, everybody was talking about it. [The supporters]
thought the academy should do it, the county museum should do it. It
was obvious that no one was going to do it," said Barbara Smith, who
now directs the American Cinematheque in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   So a group that included Smith and "the two Garys"--Gary Essert
and Gary Abrahams--set up an independent organization in 1971, the
once controversial but now much lamented Los Angeles International
Film Exposition, better known as Filmex. Local film lovers become
misty-eyed now when they recall playful Filmex ads, the galas, the
campy parades that included a baby elephant and a fire-eater, and the
hundreds of rarely seen films and movie marathons.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Smith said, people are amazed that at its peak
Filmex was filling two theaters in Century City, one with 1,400 seats
and the other with 800, five times a day. "They forget that in the
1970s, there was only one cable channel in L.A., the Z Channel. There
were no video stores. It was a very different time than now," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Filmex is a kind of model for the new Los Angeles
Film Festival, according to Raddon. "There hasn't been anything since
Filmex that captured the potential the city has to offer, a
world-class film festival. That's what we're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Filmex died in 1983 from a combination of politics and
administrative troubles. The AFI Fest grew from its ashes as other
festivals proliferated--from ethnic and geographic ones in Silver
Lake, Malibu and Palm Springs, to a method acting one in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Robert Faust, a local entrepreneur who had been producing
the IFP/West's Independent Spirit Awards, decided to start a festival
for American indie films. "For years, there were niche events like
Outfest," he said. "There was nothing for the masses that would
garner both the public and the industry's interest." The Los Angeles
Independent Film Festival, held in April, was timed to give
filmmakers an alternative to Sundance, which is held in January.</TE>
<TE>   After five years, Faust sold the festival to IFP/West, an
organization he felt was well positioned in the community to attract
the best new filmmakers. A name change dropped the word "independent"
partly because to some it implied an image of lesser quality, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As a former producer, Raddon understands filmmakers, one of the
keys to running a successful festival, Faust said. "With IFP growing
it more and perhaps taking it to the next level, I think the industry
is going to pay more attention to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a challenge in Los Angeles to get anybody excited about
anything," Faust added. "People see stars here when they go out to
eat. It's not as big a deal" as in Sundance, Toronto or Cannes, he
said. "People in L.A. are jaded, and the industry as well, for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Former AFI Fest director Fitzgerald, a co-founder of the maverick
Slamdance festival in Park City, Utah, said, "L.A. itself doesn't
care. People around Cannes love it when the festival comes. People
flock to celebrities. Not us. We see them all the time....It's hard
to get L.A. to pay attention. When a festival is going on in Cannes,
there's nothing else going on."</TE>
<TE>   Even if there was more money behind the L.A. Film Fest, success
wouldn't be a slam-dunk, studio executives said privately. In a city
where impressions often count more than reality, the festival needs
to seriously work on its personality to get attention, they said: It
needs more stars, more attendance, more acquisitions, more fun.</TE>
<TE>   Ebert, who runs his own Overlooked Film Festival, said it would
take someone with the stature and prestige of Steven Spielberg or
Robert De Niro to create a major film festival in Los Angeles. "There
are too many egos for an ordinary film fest-type person to prevail,"
he said, adding that De Niro's celebrity status helped the Tribeca
Film Festival achieve instant respect upon its debut in New York.</TE>
<TE>   According to one school of thought, the best way for Los Angeles
to become a major international player is for one or more of the
city's biggest festivals to merge with the American Film Market, the
annual marketplace begun 22 years ago by independent producers and
distributors as an alternative to Cannes.</TE>
<TE>   At first cool to the idea, the trade organization has begun to see
the benefits, according to Greg Ptacek, communications director for
AFMA, the trade organization that sponsors the market in Santa
Monica. "Festivals bring in celebrities. Having celebrity is
important even if all you want to do is business," he said. They
attract the international press, which in turn attracts more and
bigger filmmakers, ultimately raising the bottom line for everyone,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Ptacek said the organization is considering an alliance, but it is
also thinking of hosting its own.</TE>
<TE>   To some, this year's Los Angeles Film Festival looks promising,
with outdoor screenings, an expanded program designed by the newly
hired Rosen, formerly of the San Francisco International Film
Festival, and guest director Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien").
Cuaron will be the host of a retreat for participating filmmakers in
Ojai and, separately, will show festival audiences three films that
have influenced him: "Adieu Philippine" (1962), "Canoa" (1975) and
"Sunrise" (1927.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Utley, president of marketing for Fox Searchlight, was
shocked last year when she attended the L.A. Film Fest for the first
time. "I saw nametags, passes, question-and-answer sessions with
filmmakers, everything you would see in a film festival. I wasn't
aware that happened here at home."</TE>
<TE>   Utley, like many others, said she had always found it odd there
wasn't a big festival in the industry's home town that elicited the
same enthusiasm as film festivals elsewhere. She called it a
shame--particularly since a local festival offers small studios such
as Searchlight the opportunity to premiere films to a built-in
audience. "It's ironic that in the world capital of entertainment, so
few people actually realize there's a film festival here," said Rick
Carpenter, president of DDB Worldwide Communications Group, a Los
Angeles-based advertising agency and one of the organizations
IFP/West has courted aggressively to donate time, expertise or
advertising space to the festival.</TE>
<TE>   So far, DDB has produced billboards and ads running in theaters on
the theme "Everyone Likes to Watch." IFP/West's Hudson said "street
teams" pass out candy with the festival logo in movie theaters in the
evening. Public radio stations, local newspapers including the Los
Angeles Times, and major sponsor In Style have donated advertising.
Target donated cash for the narrative feature prize. "We've had a lot
of filmmakers come to us because of the $50,000 grant," Hudson said.</TE>
<TE>   Raddon isn't sure the campaign has reached all the communities the
festival wants to attract. For instance, one new documentary, "OT:
Our Town," follows eager students at Dominguez High School in the
Crenshaw District as they stage the school's first theatrical
production in 22 years. "I'm hoping those kids and families in
Crenshaw come up for the film festival. I don't know if they will,"
Raddon said.</TE>
<TE>   Utley said Hudson and Raddon impressed her with their plans for a
"people's festival. We wanted to be supportive of that idea."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Fox Searchlight will screen "The Good Girl," an edgy
comedy starring Jennifer Aniston as an unhappily married shopgirl.
Lions Gate will also present a Nick Broomfield documentary, "Biggie
and Tupac," and a feature, "Lovely &amp; Amazing," an ensemble family
comedy. The festival is a cheap way to launch the summer features,
both of which are scheduled be released in August, Utley said.</TE>
<TE>   One key to a successful local festival, she added, is to persuade
more studios to premiere more films that haven't already been
screened in other festivals. "If the lineup is amazing, then everyone
in the industry will want to go."</TE>
<TE>   Big studio chiefs, who sometimes premiere their smarter,
award-contending films at the Toronto Film Festival in September,
said privately there was no reason to participate in a local film
festival that doesn't get daily media coverage. They would be seeking
publicity for new releases, and in Los Angeles, the major studios
prefer to control publicity at the time they choose. (But they didn't
want to be identified because they want to appear supportive of the
L.A. fest.)</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the L.A. Film Fest increased attendance 150%, to
30,000, and boasted its biggest success, "Kissing Jessica Stein."</TE>
<TE>   "The festival delivered me," said director Charles
Herman-Wurmfeld, whose movie was acquired for distribution and
represented his first professional break in 15 years. His film, made
for less than $1 million, was distributed to 400 theaters and has
made $6.5 million so far, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the filmmaking community argue that Los Angeles needs and
deserves its own major festival--especially now, when young
filmmakers are taking advantage of digital video to create more
independent films, and when most major studios have scant interest in
the small and the quirky.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Wexler, who will screen her feature "A Ball in the House,"
said a festival in the center of the film world is a boon for a small
works like hers, a black comedy about a small-town teenager trying to
stay sober that will probably initially appeal to art-house crowds.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole industry's out there. It'll be fairly easy to get
someone to drive over. You can say, 'It's only on Sunset, can you go
to see it?' "</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Film Fest is on the right path, she added. "They're more
selective, devoting more resources to fewer films."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron said, "It would be great to have a really important
festival evolving in the context of the [film] industry capital of
the world. It is about time, by the way.</TE>
<TE>   "A key in L.A. is to reach out for the normal, mainstream
audience. It would be a beautiful thing to expose them to the
diversity that cinema is all about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand, we believe we're involved in a cause,"
Raddon said, "the cause of promoting voices that wouldn't otherwise
be heard. This summer, everywhere I look, it's 'Spider-Man.' "</TE>
<TE>   If there's any one thing all 153 films have in common this year,
Rosen said, "it's whatever it takes to get a movie made when no one's
asking you to make it. And that applies straight down the line from
the international films to some of the archival films to the American
documentaries and features. I doubt there was anyone throwing money
at any of these filmmakers or begging them to get out there with a
camera."</TE>
<TE>   She and her team screened more than 2,500 entries, including
shorts and features. Her schedule for the event shows a checkerboard
full of gray, black and blue color blocks to help people sort the
galas from the special events, the music video screenings from the
seminars, and figure out where to go for the international showcase
movies, the shorts, high school films, narrative competition films,
and the documentary competition. Events will be held mostly around
Hollywood, from the festival center at the Laemmle Sunset 5 in West
Hollywood, to the DGA, the ArcLight Cinerama Dome, the John Anson
Ford Amphitheatre and the Chateau Marmont.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson said she hopes the festival will inspire industry and
non-industry people alike to remember why they loved going to movies
in the first place. "When you go to the festival and see wonderful
films, and you're not hearing the box office report the next morning,
and they haven't been prepackaged to you, there is that exciting
sense of discovery and more of a pure film experience. It takes us
all back to whenever you first discovered film as a powerful medium."</TE>
<TE>   It was "Kissing Jessica Stein" that made Berkeley filmmaker Myra
Paci sit up and take notice. Her first feature film, "Searching for
Paradise," the story of a young woman disillusioned by what she
learns about her father after his death, had been accepted by three
other film festivals this year. She said she pulled it out of the
other festivals because the L.A. Film Fest wanted the world premiere.</TE>
<TE>   She is hopeful she will be able to sell her film here. "The Los
Angeles Film Festival is getting to be such a big festival. Plus,
it's placed in the center of the filmmaking industry. A lot of sales
happen there and there's a lot of attention by the press and buyers.
This is a festival that has a lot of weight for a filmmaker who wants
to go on to make more movies."</TE>

<BD>Don Heckman writes frequently about jazz for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While big bands haven't been very visible in recent years, they
haven't disappeared completely, by any means. Nor have they ceased to
be a powerful instrumental vehicle for musicians and composers. But
they need more support.</LD>
<LD>   Recording a big band is expensive enough to significantly reduce
the number of CD releases of new performances (although reissues,
which obviously cost considerably less to produce, arrive with some
frequency). Many recordings are simply labors of love, with musicians
working for bare minimum, and no one expecting to break even--much
less make a profit. Still, the quality and diversity of the ensembles
that do manage to release CDs serve as persuasive testimony to the
enduring importance of the big jazz band.</LD>
<LD>   Let's start with a pair of recordings centered on the
groundbreaking work of the Dizzy Gillespie big bands.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Star Big Band, "Things to Come" (***,
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild). Trumpeter Jon Faddis (who was music
director of Gillespie's last big band) has been a determined
supporter of the legacy through his efforts to honor the trumpet
playing that was a primary contributor to the bebop revolution of the
'40s, as well as the equally influential compositions and
arrangements for small groups and big bands. His Gillespie Alumni
All-Star group includes some stellar talent associated at one time or
another with the bebop great--including saxophonists James Moody and
Jimmy Heath, trumpeter Claudio Roditi, and trombonist Slide Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   This outing, recorded at a September 2000 concert, vividly
displays the stirring life force still present in such classic items
associated with the Gillespie big band as "Manteca," " 'Round
Midnight" and the still extraordinary-sounding Walter Fuller
composition "Things to Come." Ragged edges here and there underscore
the powerful technical demands in the music, but the performances are
spirited enough to more than compensate for the occasional flaws.
Faddis does his usual persuasive take on the Gillespie trumpet parts,
and there are fine solo contributions, especially from Moody,
Hampton, alto saxophonist Antonio Hart and pianist Renee Rosnes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dizzy Gillespie, "Bebop Professor" (*** 1/2, Bluebird/RCA). In
contrast to the Gillespie Alumni Band, here's the real deal. Although
only seven of the 13 tracks display the trumpeter's big band of the
late '40s (the rest are small-group efforts), the selections that are
included offer convincing illustrations of the twisting rhythms and
thick-textured, dissonant harmonies being explored by bop arrangers
and composers of the period.</TE>
<TE>   Definitive numbers such as "Good Bait," "Two Bass Hit" and "A
Night in Tunisia" make it clear that bop writers were perfectly
capable of producing appealing melodies. Gillespie's original version
of "Manteca" affords an interesting contrast with the Alumni Band's
version. And George Russell's pioneering Latin jazz-tinged "Cubana
Be/Cubana Bop" is a fascinating work (pair of works, actually) that
deserves frequent revisiting and reinterpretation through big band
repertory ensembles. Unfortunately, such ensembles are in short
supply these days (at least in this country), with a relatively small
number functioning on a daily basis over an extended period of time.
That's a shame, because the few such aggregations that do exist make
a convincing case for the instrumentation's far-ranging potential.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, "Can I Persuade You" (*** 1/2, Planet
Arts Records). In many respects, this outfit defines the creative
productivity that can flow from an essentially tenured repertory big
jazz band. The group came into existence in 1966 as the Thad
Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra; the current version (Jones left in 1979
and Lewis died in 1990) performs every Monday night at New York's
Village Vanguard, initiates residencies at schools, and appears at
clinic-workshops and cultural exchanges around the world.</TE>
<TE>   None of this would necessarily matter all that much if the music
wasn't first-rate--but it is. Blessed with an extraordinary library
of original compositions, the band has gathered works by Jimmy
Giuffre, Bob Mintzer, Ed Neumeister, Garnett Brown and Bill Holman
for this new release. In addition, there are two moody selections by
the late (and far too little known) composer Juliane Beth Cavadini.</TE>
<TE>   The results are consistently engaging. It's a pleasure to hear the
mixture of bright swing and easygoing melody-making in Giuffre's
writing, even in an early '80s chart, "Dragon Fly." Brown's original
"Bachafillen" and his surprisingly vivacious interpretation of
Ellington's "Sophisticated Lady" are a reminder that his composition
skills fully match his fine trombone work. And Holman's rendering of
"Just Friends," in which he contrasts full band unisons with sudden
bursts of contrapuntal byplay, is the work of a vivid musical
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Matthews &amp; the Manhattan Jazz Orchestra, "Hey Duke" (***,
Milestone Records). Matthews' orchestra has been in existence since
1989. But, like the longer-lived Vanguard ensemble, it has--through
the work of its veteran leader and arranger--investigated a broad
stylistic array of material. A previous album, "Bach 2000," offered
jazz takes on a collection of Baroque masterpieces, and with "Hey
Duke," the ensemble dips into the rich treasure chest of Ellingtonia.</TE>
<TE>   The material is almost all familiar--"Prelude to a Kiss," "Mood
Indigo," "Satin Doll," "Cotton Tail," etc. (with the single addition
of Matthews' tribute number, "Song for Edward")--exhibiting the many
ways in which the music of Ellington, like that of Bach, can
stimulate endless variations and reinterpretations. It is delivered
by an all-star aggregation of New York City players, with gripping
solo work from trumpeters Ryan Kisor and Lew Soloff, alto saxophonist
Chris Hunter, and soprano saxophonist Aaron Heick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Maritime Jazz Orchestra, "Now and Now Again" (***, Justin Time
Records). This Canadian group is yet another standing ensemble with a
history of producing innovative big jazz band projects. In this
latest outing, it performs--as it did in a 1996 album--in support of
a trio of envelope-stretching British jazz artists: trumpeter Kenny
Wheeler, vocalist Norma Winstone and pianist John Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The program is devoted to four extended works, three by Wheeler
(the fourth by Taylor), the longest a nearly 30-minute composition by
the trumpeter titled "Sweet Ruby Suite." The writing is richly
textured and harmonically complex, occasionally reminiscent,
especially when Wheeler solos on flugelhorn, of the Gil Evans-Miles
Davis collaborations, more often standing on its own creative values.
Winstone, one of the finest--and least acknowledged--jazz singers
working today, functions mostly within the instrumental passage, her
variable-textured voice adding an unusually warm character to the
ensemble sound.</TE>
<TE>   This is lovely, captivating music, offering another slant on the
value of established big jazz band ensembles. Not only do they
preserve and reinterpret classic repertoire, they also offer the
seemingly limitless potential of their instrumentation as a vehicle
for new composition. Many European countries, recognizing their
value, provide the support needed to keep such groups alive. The
U.S.-- birthplace of the big jazz band--should do the same.</TE>

<HD>Feeding a New Appetite for Home Cooking</HD>
<DH>Consumers: The food industry is focusing on comfort,
convenience and customization in minimal-effort meal kits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's essentially a canned soup packaged with a pouch of baking mix.
But when you stir in a little water and put Homestyle Bakes Chicken &amp;
Dumplings into the oven, you're cooking--at least by today's
standards.</LD>
<LD>   After years of focusing on grab-and-go products that required
virtually no preparation, the food industry is finding a lucrative
niche in products that require a few extra cooking steps. The aim: to
satisfy people who yearn for the security and nostalgia of
home-cooked dinners without having to spend a lot of time in the
kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   A slew of these minimal-effort meal kits have crowded into
supermarket shelves, freezer and meat cases, squeezing sales of fresh
meat and threatening the grande dame of quick dinners, General Mills
Inc.'s Hamburger Helper, which requires more effort.</LD>
<TE>   A few, such as ConAgra Foods Inc.'s Homestyle Bakes, already have
become runaway hits. Taking in $100 million in the year ended April
21, the meat-included meal kit is the best-selling new grocery
product of 2001-02, according to market research firm Information
Resources Inc.</TE>
<TE>   And with more of these shortcuts on the way in the next year, the
supermarket is slowly changing from a food ingredients store to a
prep kitchen, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturers are rearranging the supermarket," said Harry
Balzer, vice president of research firm NPD Group. "Meal centers are
being created."</TE>
<TE>   Although consumers may say they want to do more cooking, most
won't spare more than 15 minutes for preparation, said P.J. Rosch,
brand manager for Homestyle Bakes.</TE>
<TE>   And with most decisions about dinner being made between 4 p.m. and
6 p.m., few can be bothered to plan meals and hunt down or defrost
ingredients, Balzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Yearning for Home-Cooked Meals</TE>
<TE>   What shoppers are demanding, food companies say, are "think-free"
meals that require only a tad more effort than a frozen dinner, maybe
a little stirring or browning.</TE>
<TE>   "Mothers are looking for meal solutions to alleviate their guilt
[about not cooking]," Rosch said. "They may not feel like hamburgers
or mac and cheese for the third time that week."</TE>
<TE>   This yearning for home-cooked meals began in earnest after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, as more people found solace in the family
ritual of sharing a meal, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in two decades, the number of meals eaten at
restaurants dropped, NPD Group said. But people didn't immediately
tie on an apron, analysts say. The number of takeout meals increased
as did as sales of quick-to-fix meals such as Homestyle Bakes.</TE>
<TE>   And after a decade of favoring mostly fresh ingredients, consumers
also began to sacrifice some of this for convenience.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as people have become more comfortable with using
processed and prepared ingredients, magazines and television shows
have begun using them more in recipes. A potato salad recipe in Real
Simple magazine calls for a pouch of partially cooked Simply
Potatoes. A homemade pie uses frozen Boston Market cinnamon apples
and a frozen pie crust.</TE>
<TE>   People may have a greater interest in cooking, and are
increasingly buying tools to do it, but they are using a lot more
shortcuts thanks to convenient new products that are pre-chopped and
precooked.</TE>
<TE>   "The definition of cooking is changing," said Balzer of NPD Group.
"People are assembling," he said, and then heating the mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing Foster Farms Fast Favorites requires a family chef only
to dump a packet of cooked chicken and sauce into a skillet along
with a pouch of precooked pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Rich Dinner Starters, now hitting stores, requires only the
cooking of pasta and the heating of cooked meat and sauce.</TE>
<TE>   General Mills' Tuna Helper Complete includes a pouch of tuna so
consumers don't have to wheel their cart down another aisle to get
it. By contrast, the meat must be bought separately for Hamburger
Helper.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for convenience in whatever form they can get
it," said Karen Ramos, spokeswoman for Albertson's Inc., the nation's
second-largest food and drug chain.</TE>
<TE>   For people who don't want to cook at all, Albertsons stores stock
rotisserie chickens and other prepared deli meals. For those who do,
the stores are assembling all the ingredients for certain meals at
ends of aisles.</TE>
<TE>   The question most food companies are struggling with, however, is:
How much do people want to do in the kitchen?</TE>
<TE>   Though sales of the one-box-meal Homestyle Bakes took off last
year, sales dropped off for Hamburger Helper-style kits that require
consumers to cook meat.</TE>
<TE>   However, food companies say people still are a bit old-fashioned.
Nuking a frozen entree in the microwave isn't enough to make most
people feel like they are cooking.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to stick something on the stove," said Lisa Allen of
the Grocery Manufacturers of America. "It smells good even if they
didn't have to roast the chicken."</TE>
<TE>   For meal kits such as Campbell Soup Co.'s Supper Bakes and Kraft
Foods Inc.'s Freshmade Bakes, cooks must purchase and brown meat, but
the kits include the rest of the ingredients for a meal.</TE>
<TE>   This convenience doesn't come cheap. Most of these meal kits are
more expensive than buying the ingredients separately, but they're
also less expensive than a restaurant dinner, so few shoppers have
been turned off by prices from $5 to $9.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with so many new products hitting the market, few have
turned into consistent hits. Instead, said Ed Kuehnle, Information
Resources' group president, consumers have flitted from product to
product as they try them out.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Nestle's Skillet Sensations, which Information
Resources ranked as a top seller a couple of years ago, saw its sales
slip 21% in the year ended April 21 as more competitors entered the
fray.</TE>
<TE>   Products Competing</TE>
<TE>   for Shelf Space</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, new competitors have made shelf space more difficult to
hold on to for frozen vegetable side dishes, bottled pasta sauces and
some other types of fresh meat products.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of these new products will make it, Kuehnle said. Shoppers
will decide which are truly worth the price.</TE>
<TE>   Homemaker Alexandra Reed of Anaheim Hills said she was turned off
by these convenience meals after she tried Campbell's Supper Bakes
last year. Pregnant and tired when she picked it up at the market,
she thought the pork chops and stuffing bake looked like an easy
dinner. But when she pulled it out of the oven, it tasted "gooey" and
"bland."</TE>
<TE>   "I probably could have done better just putting the pork chops in
a pan and frying them without any seasoning," she said. And although
the stuffing was tasty, she said, she could have bought it separately
and saved money.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the biggest shortcut she has since tried is the old
standby Shake and Bake. "After that experience, I was soured on the
whole meal-in-a-box thing."</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>My American Child of China</HD>
<DH>As she enters our lives, her ancestors will intertwine with
ours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at."</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years ago I came upon this witticism and wrote it down in
my address book. I've pondered the words since. Am I right to wish
they were true, knowing they aren't?</LD>
<LD>   There's bouncy all-American idealism here: Anybody can be somebody
no matter where they started. You can't argue with that, as far as it
goes.</LD>
<TE>   But where one starts, way back, is no small concern either, and
seems to be becoming a bigger deal all the time.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a boy and my father was asked, he would say he was from
Nevada. My mother would say she was from Utah.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, it dawned on me that there was more to it. People
would persist: What kind of a name is "Balzar"? They didn't want to
know where we were from geographically, but who we were ethnically.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, my father's family lied about it.</TE>
<TE>   We were Basques, they said. It was good to be Basque in Nevada.
Basques were part of the state's rough-and-tumble beginnings, and
they had odd names, and that's what I understood of it.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after I'd grown, we buried my grandmother in a family plot
in Reno. An adjacent gravestone was marked "Stefano Balzarini." We
were Italians.</TE>
<TE>   It was just as good being Italian as Basque, as far as I was
concerned. But it hadn't been good for my paternal grandmother. She
was a WASP named Reed, and she was a mail-order bride; she came West
from Indiana in 1906 to marry a man who worked for the railroad.
Unfortunately, in her America an Italian was a step down. So the
truth was not spoken while she lived.</TE>
<TE>   My mother's side of the family did not allow that kind of
reinvention. They were Mormons, and they were precise about ancestry.
My grandfather's two-volume handwritten genealogy traces the family
tree back to medieval England. My forbears came to America on the
Mayflower, and one of them signed the Mayflower Compact. In some
quarters that stands one well in the pedigree department, although I
never think to mention it when I'm a guest at a Native American
potlatch.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic heritage is on my mind again now. That's because if all
goes as planned, I will be flying into Changsha, China, today. This
is Father's Day. I'm adding a page to the family genealogy and
becoming a father for the second time.</TE>
<TE>   Li Xing Guo, 18 months old, will be delivered across a room and
passed from an orphanage caregiver into the arms of my wife and me.
It's "gotcha day," in the vernacular of adoptive families.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, Li Xing will become Gracie Anne. Daughter of
China; our daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule has us concluding the paperwork and returning in time
to grill hot dogs and celebrate the U.S.A. on the Fourth of July. She
will arrive with a Chinese passport. But the instant she touches our
soil, she will become an American citizen with a snipped-off last
name that originated in Italy and once passed as Basque.</TE>
<TE>   So how will this play out in her life? These 10,000 miles between
where she's from and where she's at? Like all children, she begins
with no say in parents or geography. She will toddle into a society
that's ever more mixed but still apart, uneasy with its bloodlines
and its memories.</TE>
<TE>   We hope we can give her wisdom. She will learn about the complex
heritage of China. And about African cultures because I spent an
important part of my life there. And Finnish traditions because
that's my wife's heritage. And Russia because her maternal
grandfather is a Russian scholar. And naturally, like all Southern
California girls, she will be shaped by Mexico. I want her to see
culture through food, through art, through music, through history,
through values, through celebrations and through awareness of
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing those things, we dearly hope, will enrich her
understanding of the meaning of this country. Then, in 20 years or
so, we can talk about the old adage in her father's address book and
see if we've made progress.</TE>

<HD>Getting Away With a Blatant Gerrymander</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is the associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So even deals with the devil, it seems, are legally binding and will
be enforced by the courts.</LD>
<LD>   What else are Latinos to conclude in the wake of last week's
ruling by a panel of three federal judges who dismissed a lawsuit
that was designed to stop blatant racial gerrymandering against
Latino voters in the most recent state redistricting plan?</LD>
<LD>   The ruling itself, a 91-page tome by two U.S. District Court
judges, Christina A. Snyder and Margaret M. Morrow, and Judge Stephen
Reinhardt of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was not
unreasonable.</LD>
<TE>   The jurists pointed to the dramatic political progress Latinos
have made in California in recent years, such as winning dozens of
seats in Congress and the Legislature and nearly electing a Latino
mayor in Los Angeles last year. They concluded that the three
instances of gerrymandering cited in the lawsuit--an Assembly and
congressional district in San Diego and a congressional seat in the
San Fernando Valley--were not so severe that the entire state
redistricting should be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. But just how much discrimination against Latinos or
any other significant bloc of voters should be tolerated before the
courts step in and call a halt under provisions of the federal Voting
Rights Act?</TE>
<TE>   The judges didn't really answer that question, which is why
attorneys for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund
are still weighing the possibility of appealing to the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a risky strategy, given the current makeup of the
high court and especially the overt hostility of right-wing justices
like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas to civil rights cases.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one is tempted to urge MALDEF to push this case along. At
least that will keep some heat on those politicians, including many
Latinos, who were willing to allow their own people to be treated as
political pawns as long as they remained safe in Latino districts.</TE>
<TE>   They are the lost souls in this case. Their personal ambitions led
them to cut a deal with the devil, in the guise of Democratic
political consultant Michael Berman. He was paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars by members of Congress and the Legislature to
draw them safe new districts using the population data gathered in
the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting is such an arcane process that Berman might have
gotten away with his demographic sleights of hand except for one very
big mistake. He could not resist helping out his older brother, Rep.
Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills), by drawing him a super-safe
district. He did that by shifting thousands of new Latino voters out
of Howard Berman's East Valley district and into the adjacent
district of Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   It was a display of raw politics equaled only by the opportunism
of the nine Latino members of the state Assembly and all seven
Latinos in the state Senate who voted to approve the Berman plan.
Only two Latino Assembly members--Democrats Lou Correa of Santa Ana
and Sarah Reyes of Fresno, voted against the Berman plan. Democrat
Juan Vargas of San Diego abstained rather than vote for it.</TE>
<TE>   One reason I wish that the three federal judges had let MALDEF's
lawsuit go to trial is that it would have forced some of the
politicians who signed off on the Bermans' gerrymander to take the
stand in court. Then, whether Anglo or Latino, they would have had to
explain their logic and defend their actions under oath.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, every effort MALDEF attorneys made in pretrial motions
to shed light on the secret talks that led to the new legislative
districts was fiercely opposed by lawyers for the Legislature. Did
state legislators have something to hide? We may never know.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not get too cynical here. Better instead to hope that as
citizen-inspired reforms like term limits and tighter controls on
campaign spending take effect, we will see fewer hacks with Spanish
surnames elected to office and more honest, courageous officeholders
like Vargas, Correa and Reyes.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Waste Poses Its Own 'Dirty' Threat</HD>
<DH>Jose Padilla's arrest alerts us to the danger of
radioactive byproducts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARSHALL DRUMMOND</AU>
<BD>Marshall Drummond, chancellor of the L.A. Community
Colleges, served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences
subcommittee on emerging technologies for radioactive waste
management and disposal, which advises the Department of Energy on
storage and disposal of nuclear waste.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an odd sort of way, Jose Padilla did the American public a favor
by allegedly tinkering with a plot for a "dirty" bomb. Finally there
is some public awareness of nuclear waste dangers.</LD>
<LD>   The nuclear industry, born out of weapons research and propelled
by the public's desire for advanced medical treatment, cheap domestic
energy sources and the weapons jobs complex, grew rapidly in the
1960s, only to be almost stopped in the 1980s by anti-nuke activists
and a growing group of fearful people saying "not in my backyard."</LD>
<LD>   Lost on the public is the fact that over the last 30 years,
literally tons of nuclear waste--most benign but some very
nasty--have accumulated in thousands of temporary sites across the
nation.</LD>
<TE>   Low-level waste--which is not fissionable, meaning it cannot cause
a chain reaction or explosion--covers a vast array of material,
including gowns and gloves used to work with radioactive material,
X-ray film and medical isotopes.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to dispose of and, because it is far more
prevalent and generally less well secured, is the type of waste that
is most likely to find its way into a dirty bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Far nastier stuff is high-level waste. It mostly consists of spent
reactor fuel, but the problem is that it is still "hot."</TE>
<TE>   This fuel used to be reprocessed for additional use, but the
byproducts often violated the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act,
so old plants were shuttered and not many new ones were built.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that spent fuel is stored on-site at nuclear energy
plants. The good news is that security at these places is pretty
good, and the spent fuel is so dangerous and difficult to handle that
terrorists would need highly specialized training and equipment that
is almost impossible to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, a terrorist who got his hands on this stuff at noon
would be dead before sundown, and unless it was pulverized it would
be fairly easy to retrieve.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to make light of the threat because inhaling even a
microscopic amount of high-level waste can induce fatal cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Low-level nuclear waste is a problem to get rid of, but the more
serious danger is posed by high-level waste.</TE>
<TE>   The recent movement toward finally putting Yucca Mountain in
Nevada into service for storage is long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   The half-life of some of this waste is 5,000 years--meaning it is
dangerous for close to 10,000 years. What if the weather changes and
Nevada becomes a savanna? What if water seepage a thousand years from
now lets a waste stream escape the confines? However, "what if"
scenarios are small potatoes when contrasted with hundreds of
temporary storage sites dispersed all over the country that are
vulnerable to theft, poor inventory controls and tracking practices.</TE>
<TE>   Getting high-level waste into a place where it can be protected
and controlled and constantly inventoried is the first step to
avoiding a disaster far more serious than one that could be caused by
a dirty bomb. Even without a terrorist in the equation, there is the
real possibility of mishandling or an accidental fission accident.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to all forms of nuclear waste, what can we do to
safeguard our society?</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Padilla, the first steps in reducing the threat of a
dirty bomb are underway. This involves recognizing and acknowledging
the threat, heightening intelligence gathering, enforcing storage
regulations and border surveillance and developing a plan in case of
an emergency event.</TE>
<TE>   As for high-level waste, it is extremely important that we as a
nation take seriously our responsibility to deal with this material.
This will require a strategy to eventually move a large amount of
this material from temporary storage places to permanent secure
storage.</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain has been built using billions of taxpayer dollars.
It has been tested and is ready to do its job, yet the NIMBYs and the
anti-nuke crowd keep sowing seeds of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla might have been enough to cause us all to stop, learn
about the problem and deal with nuclear waste.</TE>

<HD>Blythe Spirit Is Taken Away</HD>
<DH>When Toby Morelock died, the desert town lost more than a
cabby. It lost a sympathetic ear, a lifeline and a man who cared
about people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLYTHE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>This desert town is so small, you can spit from one end clear to the
other. At least, that's how the locals tell it.</LD>
<LD>   Snuggled up against the Arizona border, Blythe is a dusty and
sweltering patch of modest homes, motels and saloons. Slow living
turns still slower in summer, when temperatures climb to 110 and
above.</LD>
<LD>   It's a town so steeped in heat and inertia it can't afford to lose
its air-conditioners, beer coolers or, evidently, its cabby.</LD>
<TE>   Blythe's one and only taxi driver, 81-year-old Arthur "Toby"
Morelock, died last December. He has not been replaced. Folks here
aren't sure he ever will be, really.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock was more than just a ride about town. He was a delivery
service, a sympathetic ear, a lifeline. Morelock's Taxi Service
schlepped the city's residents from the grocery to home, from bar to
bar, just about anywhere they wanted, for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he didn't serve a great magnitude of people," said Blythe
Mayor Robert Crane, "but there are people here who really needed him.
He was a safety net for people."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's still the Dial-a-Ride service, though the
locals don't seem to care much for it because patrons have to make an
appointment the day before. Its drivers won't wait while riders run
into the grocery store, and they just aren't around at 2 a.m. when
you need a ride home from, say, Jim Dandy's bar.</TE>
<TE>   And Morelock did so much more. He would pick up a prescription, a
pizza, or, if you were really in need, the occasional six-pack.</TE>
<TE>   A soft touch, he had a reputation for picking up pedestrians at no
charge just to get them out of the blistering heat.</TE>
<TE>   From his barstool at the Horny Toad Saloon, David Anderson
recalled that sometimes when he called Toby at closing time, he
didn't have a dime in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "And he'd just say, 'That's OK. Just pay me when your money
comes,' " said Anderson, who gets by on Social Security. "That's the
kind of guy he was."</TE>
<TE>   Before Morelock, it was hard to keep a good, honest cabby in town.
Most were flaky, sometimes answering calls, sometimes not. One would
arrive with liquor on his breath.</TE>
<TE>   No one would have guessed that Toby Morelock would become the sole
cabdriver here. Until 1976, he owned a tractor repair shop in
downtown Blythe.</TE>
<TE>   But that was hard, back-breaking work, and business had slowed in
the once-bustling agricultural community.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock simply came home one day and said he was starting a taxi
business, as his widow, Leona Morelock, remembers it. She never
questioned the wisdom of opening a taxi service in their tiny town,
where half of the 23,000 residents are inmates at Blythe's two
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Toby had a certain charisma that inspired even those who hardly
knew him.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Leona married him back in 1943 after just a four-day
courtship, breaking her engagement with another man.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just, wow!" Leona Morelock, 81, says today, sounding every
bit like a girl with a schoolyard crush.</TE>
<TE>   In old family photos, he stands out, even as one of 11 siblings.
He wasn't just handsome. He was movie-star handsome, tall with a
square jaw, held high.</TE>
<TE>   He was cocky but kind, and people just flocked to him, his wife
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Blythe's cabby had a dedicated group of patrons--Alpha Beta
Bill, AAA Joe, Murdock (just Murdock) and the Naked Guy, named for
his habit of stripping down to nothing in the fields around Blythe
for no particular reason.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock became such a staple in the town that businesses relied
on him to run packages into Los Angeles in the days before Blythe had
a Federal Express office. He transported lab work for the hospital.
And when the first of two prisons was built in 1989, he delivered
anxious wives and teary-eyed moms on visiting day.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Crow, 54, met Morelock as she walked home from errands one
day back in 1997. It was 115 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too hot to be walking on a day like this," he called to her,
waving off her protestations that she couldn't afford a cab. "I'm
taking you home."</TE>
<TE>   Morelock would see 64-year-old Fred Banke, who lost a leg years
ago, walking to the grocery store. The cab driver would insist he was
headed there anyway. Then he'd be waiting when Banke was ready to go
home.</TE>
<TE>   "That was Toby," Banke said. "I sure miss that guy a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Morelock, a World War II Army veteran, was a pushover.
This was a man who in his 70s cold-cocked a twentysomething punk who
demanded a late-night ride and, in the process, cursed Leona
Morelock.</TE>
<TE>   Around town, though, most people remember Morelock's softer side.
Especially the town's bar patrons, now caught with no ride home in
the wee hours--or sometimes in the middle of the afternoon--or for
the regulars swatting flies and drinking on the stoop outside the B&amp;B
Bait shop</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie Blythe, the Horny Toad's owner and barkeep, feels the
void keenly. Blythe, whose ex-husband was related to town founder
Thomas Blythe, kept Morelock's phone number over her bar for 20
years. Now, she's reduced to driving the drunkest customers home
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to get them home somehow so they don't get arrested," said
Blythe, 74, standing with her hands on her hips one evening behind
her bar.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly irritated, she said it's the city's responsibility to find
a new cabby. "I tell you, everybody's getting pretty mad about it."</TE>
<TE>   Morelock, relatives said, knew it would be hard to find someone
who cared about his riders as much as he did. That's why--even after
he got the cancer diagnosis, even after the chemotherapy made him so
weak he could hardly stand--he tried to pick up fares. Pain shot
through his left shoulder so badly, customers remember how he winced
just reaching for the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   When loved ones begged him to quit, he would respond simply: "I
can't let customers wait."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until April 2001, just eight months before his death,
that he finally cut the phone line to Morelock's Taxi.</TE>
<TE>   A few people have called City Hall, wondering how to get a taxi
license. But no one has applied. Mayor Crane doesn't expect anyone
will, what with the city expanding its bus service later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Leona Morelock said that every now and then her private line still
rings with someone looking for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame," she said. "He'd hate to think people were still
out there waiting for him. And if he could get there, he still would.
I just know it."</TE>

<HD>Darkened Lighthouse Has Brighter Days Ahead</HD>
<DH>Preservation: It took volunteers more than a decade, but
historic St. George Reef structure is due to reopen in the fall. Its
rescuers hope it will help attract tourists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER COLEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. GEORGE REEF, Calif.</DL>
<LD>First, it was fog. Volunteers who were trying to restore a
110-year-old lighthouse by carrying a 5-ton lantern room by
helicopter over the Pacific Ocean waited it out.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the rain. The plan to move the dome was delayed again,
and volunteers wondered when they would have another chance.</LD>
<LD>   But the next morning, Guy Towers and the rest of his restoration
team saw the rain ease up. They made their move, and soon the
helicopter hovered in the drizzle, picked up the lantern room and
carried it to St. George Reef Lighthouse while about 100 spectators
huddled in the Crescent City harbor on the far northwestern coast of
California.</LD>
<TE>   For fans of a landmark that has seen plenty of disasters, it was
what they hoped was more than a break in the weather. They hoped the
lantern's return April 13 would signal the revival of a lighthouse
that once steered seafarers away from the area's ship-eating reef.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, the restoration by the St. George Reef Lighthouse
Preservation Society could create a tourist attraction in a forgotten
corner of California whose logging and fishing industries have long
faded.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting six miles off the coast, the 150-foot lighthouse cost
$704,000 to build in 1892. Named after the dragon-slaying St. George,
it sits surrounded by the "dragon rocks" that tore the bottom from
the steamer Brother Jonathan in 1865, killing at least 145 passengers
and crew.</TE>
<TE>   The lighthouse destined to tame the rocks was the most expensive
the federal government ever built. The deadliest too.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1892 and 1975, when the lighthouse was replaced by a buoy,
five lighthouse workers died. That included three U.S. Coast
Guardsmen killed in 1951 when their boat capsized as they left the
rock.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing the 16-sided, 12-foot-high lighthouse dome has bedeviled
Towers and the other volunteers. Weather delays kept them from making
the helicopter trip; no one wanted to risk $60,000 for the cost of
the dome and the helicopter for a failure.</TE>
<TE>   When it's done, the society will have turned the St. George Reef
Lighthouse into the only one of three offshore lighthouses in the
world that will be open to the public. There, visitors will learn
more about its turbulent history.</TE>
<TE>   Crescent City's other lighthouse, the nearby Battery Point
Lighthouse, still lights the harbor from shore and also serves as a
museum.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to the St. George Reef Lighthouse now is by a
six-minute helicopter ride low over the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The iron railings that once surrounded the deck of the lighthouse
have rusted into the sea, leaving an ideal landing pad for the
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   There are seven levels from the basement, where the coal-fired
generators ran the lighthouse, to the lantern at the top that housed
the rotating lens.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the old paint peels in large patches from the damp
ceilings and cement walls. Much of the paint was lead-based, so
workers must be careful while removing it, volunteer Terry McNamara
said.</TE>
<TE>   The upper deck, just below the lantern room, is more than 130 feet
above the rocks, encircled by bands of rust that 110 years ago were
scrolling cast-iron railings.</TE>
<TE>   Lights are run off a generator. When it sputters, Towers or one of
the volunteers races down the 90 narrow, spiraling stone steps as the
lights flicker to refill the fuel. If the lights go out, the steep
stairwell goes nearly black.</TE>
<TE>   A retired social worker, Towers first became interested in
lighthouses in the early 1980s, when he discovered the Punta Gorda
lighthouse in Humboldt County.</TE>
<TE>   He embarked on a two-decade obsession, in which he once spent
three years cataloging the world's lighthouses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, after he had moved to Crescent City, he learned that the
government planned to sell the lighthouse as scrap. Towers and
several friends formed the nonprofit preservation society and then
spent 10 years getting government approvals to take jurisdiction over
the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   He worked closely with Bob Bolen, a retired airline mechanic who
was instrumental in removing and transporting the lighthouse's giant
Fresnel lens in 1983. The 18-foot rotating lens now sits in the Del
Norte County Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Bolen, now wheelchair-bound, paid the $24,000 the society needed
to finish the restoration work on the dome and hire a helicopter to
bring it back to the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   For that, he got the best view of the lantern room's return--the
front seat of the chase helicopter trailing the cargo chopper.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second attempt to transport the dome in two years.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, a donated helicopter lifted the lantern room from
the lighthouse and carried it to shore. But as it approached land,
the helicopter dipped too low, dragging the iron and glass room along
the beach in Crescent City harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a crumpled mess," said Alice Towers, Guy's wife.</TE>
<TE>   But that disaster turned into a blessing, Towers said, as the
publicity led to more donations. Also, the room had broken in the
right places.</TE>
<TE>   Its top survived, and the rest of the room was rebuilt with
stainless steel, not cast iron, and polycarbonate, not glass. That
saved about 5,000 pounds, Towers said, although it still weighs a
hefty 10,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   As the helicopter lifted the lantern room for its second flight,
Towers and half a dozen volunteers waited on the rock at the top of
the lighthouse for the big cargo chopper to hover, then lower the
dome. Cables trailed from the room that would be threaded through
holes in the ledge to guide it to its proper position.</TE>
<TE>   Towers grabbed the first line and wrapped it around his arm. The
helicopter rose, taking Towers with it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I was ringing a bell, riding the bell up and down,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 32 bolt holes lined up "perfectly," he said. "The sweetest
sound I've ever heard was when that lantern room set and it made that
'clunk.' "</TE>
<TE>   After the lift, Bolen was all smiles as he was helped out of the
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   He and other volunteers will start raising money to replace the
rusting railings in time for a planned opening this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials prohibit travel to the lighthouse between June
15 and Oct. 15, when sea lions are mating, so tours will be offered
only in the fall and spring. Eventually, Towers hopes to have a
helicopter stationed in Crescent City to ferry visitors on day trips.</TE>
<TE>   The time and money to revive the lighthouse will be worth it,
Bolen said.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, they're monuments to our forefathers who came to our
country and to the men who didn't make it," Bolen said. "They didn't
make it because they didn't have lighthouses."</TE>

<HD>Agency Made the Desert Bloom, But at a Price</HD>
<DH>Environment: The Bureau of Reclamation has irrigated the
West for 100 years. Critics say it has also wreaked havoc with
habitats and economies along the way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BARNARD</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Reclamation Act of 1902,
he gave a new government agency the unambiguous charge to go forth
and make the desert bloom by bringing water to family farms.</LD>
<LD>   The idea, says University of Oklahoma historian Donald J. Pisani,
was to boost the West out of the depression of the 1890s by helping
populate the vast empty lands with yeomen farmers.</LD>
<LD>   A century later, the family farms are mostly history, and the
Bureau of Reclamation is looking at a much more complicated world,
balancing endangered species against large-scale agriculture,
industry, growing cities, and Indian tribes.</LD>
<TE>   As the bureau prepares for its centennial celebration Monday in
Las Vegas near its proudest achievement, the towering Hoover Dam, not
everyone touched by federal water projects is ready to eat cake.</TE>
<TE>   "The bureau has done everything it could to do one thing and one
thing well, and that is deliver water to farmers," said Glen Spain of
the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns. "But it completely
wrecked some of the region's most important rivers" and the fishing
economies that went with them.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happens when 19th century policies collide with 21st
century needs," said Barry Nelson, senior policy analyst for the
Natural Resources Defense Council. "The bureau has failed to change
its policies to meet the real needs of the West. And I don't mean
just environmental needs. The environmental, economic and community
needs of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Back when nature was for conquering and the effects of turning
whole watersheds upside down was not understood, the bureau produced
some of the nation's greatest engineering achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Its 180 water projects in 17 Western states include the Hoover Dam
on the Arizona-Nevada border and the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, both
on the Colorado River; the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in
Washington; and the sprawling Central Valley Project in California.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau is the nation's biggest wholesale water supplier,
providing 10 trillion gallons of water to 31 million people annually.</TE>
<TE>   That water, much of it subsidized, supplies one of every five
Western farms, producing 60% of the nation's vegetables and 25% of
its fruits and nuts. The bureau's 58 hydroelectric plants generate 42
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's goal in the early days was expressed by Franklin
Lane, Interior secretary from 1913 to 1920, who said it was a crime
to let one drop of water flow unused to the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end you look at the West as a kind of laboratory
experiment that is still going on where you have a lot of disquieting
signs something is terribly wrong," said Pisani, a keynote speaker at
bureau festivities in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, waterfowl deaths and deformities at Kesterson Reservoir
in California were traced to the toxic metal selenium, concentrated
in the water by bureau projects.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years after construction of Glen Canyon Dam, scientists are
trying to figure out how to reverse the damage to the Colorado River:
shrinking beaches, declining native species, invasion of alien fish
and plants, and erosion of archeological sites.</TE>
<TE>   Wild salmon runs in the Northwest and California have plummeted,
in part from habitat lost to bureau projects.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the bureau's long-standing dedication to irrigating
220,000 acres of the Klamath Basin straddling the Oregon-California
border crashed into the Endangered Species Act. With drought making
water scarce, the bureau had to cut off water to most of the 1,400
farms to protect endangered suckers and threatened salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau Commissioner John W. Keys III characterized the water
shutoff -- the first in the bureau's history -- as the agency's
biggest challenge since the 1976 collapse of Teton Dam in Idaho,
which killed 11 people and destroyed 4,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a new problem. The Truckee-Carson Project in Nevada ran
into similar issues in 1909.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco swells fought the bureau's plan to build a dam on
Lake Tahoe so more water could flow down the Truckee River. The
Paiute Tribe on Nevada's Pyramid Lake opposed diverting more water
from their kokanee salmon fishery. Urban boosters in Reno and farmers
around Fallon, Nev., clamored for more water.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, many of the farms failed, and the city of Reno became
the primary beneficiary, Pisani said. It was an outcome repeated
throughout the West.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, the Bureau of Reclamation, when it provided Hoover
Dam, contributed far more to the growth of Los Angeles and the
industrial development of the West than [to] agricultural
development," Pisani said.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's last big project authorization came in 1968 for the
Central Arizona Project, and the agency is now searching for a new
mission, said Pisani.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Keys counters that the bureau has no doubt about its
mission, which is to maintain its old projects, build new ones, and
develop new sources of water, such as desalinated seawater and
treated wastewater.</TE>
<TE>   "Wastewater is the last great river we have to tap," Keys said.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath Basin farmer Rod Blackman said the public has become less
supportive of farming and the bureau's water projects as people have
gotten farther away from the family farm.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they feel guilty that they live in a large city that
pollutes and is made of concrete that once maybe a farm used to sit
on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Raley, assistant Interior secretary for water and science,
foresees the bureau taking an increasing role as water broker. In the
Klamath Basin, for example, the agency began a water bank to allow
farmers, the government and others to buy the water they need for
crops and fish, while compensating those who go without.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the best solution long-term for these complex
situations where you've got competing demands is to let the market
work," said Raley. "As we look to the next century, that is the way
that we foresee that water will be shifted from existing uses to
emerging uses in a way that is consistent with the way the system
exists."</TE>

<HD>A Third Way: Boroughs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Deadlines have a way of focusing the mind. Now that Hollywood and San
Fernando Valley secession are on the November ballot, some groups and
individuals who had favored breaking up Los Angeles are beginning to
have qualms. At the same time, those who oppose secession are
starting to see that even if secession were properly defeated, many
Angelenos, from Wilmington to Woodland Hills, would continue to feel
estranged from their own city.</LD>
<LD>   There has never been a better time or a more urgent need to talk
about an alternative that would both keep Los Angeles united and fix
the problems that have driven so many to consider smashing it apart.
That alternative is a borough system.</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind boroughs is fairly simple: Some decisions--street
repairs, say, or park services--are better handled locally. Other
services, such as water and power, should be regional. So why not
create a system that combines the two? The notion that semiautonomous
boroughs would particularly suit a sprawling city like Los Angeles
has been around for years; figuring out how to do it is where the
devil lies. And a borough system need not throw away the time and
effort already invested in local neighborhood councils; they would be
incorporated into the regional boroughs.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Los Angeles City Council members Wendy Greuel, Janice
Hahn and Tom LaBonge resurrected the idea. It turned out that state
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, a well-respected Valley legislator and
former Assembly speaker, was working on a more concrete borough plan.
The challenge before the City Council and Mayor James K. Hahn is to
forge a single plan--not another study, not another layer of
bureaucracy, but a pragmatic, politically sensible plan--and to do so
in time to put it on the November ballot alongside secession.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics say the City Council would never agree to sharing power,
much less putting itself out of business. (Hertzberg calls for
replacing the council with a board of borough presidents.) Skeptics
say this is too radical a change to rush. We say there's no time like
the present--with politics of extremism pressing on one side and
apathy on the other--to inspire much-needed creative thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking apart L.A. is a terrible idea, and not just because a
world-renowned city would be voting to dismantle itself. Secession
activities have cost taxpayers at least $2 million already, not
counting the city staff time devoted to the two-year study. Worse,
residents don't know what costs, court battles and chaos would follow
a vote to split. Worst of all, all of this money and energy has not
spruced up a single park, fixed a single traffic-clogged intersection
or given a single child an after-school alternative to a
gang-infested street.</TE>
<TE>   Even if voters defeat secession--and we fervently hope they
do--the city will wake up the next morning with a bruised and divided
electorate and more of the status quo. That's not a goal anyone can
get excited about.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of details and horse trading would have to be worked out
before the council and the mayor could agree to place a borough plan
on the ballot and give the voters that choice. No one is suggesting
that boroughs would inspire citywide singing of "We Are the World."
But here's the most important thing a borough system would do: give
Angelenos something to vote for, not just vote against.</TE>

<LD>"I'm sure you checked the gas tank first," the passing father said to
the teenage boy who was muttering mightily over the stupid lawn
mower's stubborn refusal to start. "Of course!" the boy replied with
great dishonest impatience. When the father had gone, the boy
discovered the tank bone-dry and confronted his own stupidity in
private embarrassment. That lesson about motors--and the larger
instruction on fathering--were not forgotten. They come to mind still
today, even after many other lessons and Father's Days.</LD>
<LD>   There are as many styles to essential parenting as there are
dutiful parents, and countless lessons to be learned and passed on
during our individual bumpy journeys to and through adulthood and
parenthood. For many in modern single-parent families, those
"fathers" who teach with patience and above all, love, come in the
form of coaches or teachers. Some parental styles complement each
other; others conflict. All are essential in shaping the adult-to-be
and the fuzzy auras that surround the two sentimental Sundays we
annually devote to fathers and mothers, present and passed.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the Father's Day focus, for obvious commercial reasons, is
on youngsters acknowledging their male parent with a gift, often a
gadget or an item of clothing. It's heartwarming and it sells things.
You know the advertisements with too-perfect family groupings
reveling in the sand, piling on Dad, everyone smiling and not one
jelly stain in sight. If those are real families, we'll eat the new
shirts. The Father's Day reality, of course, is closer to a
bleary-eyed Dad, who thought he might sleep in, being awakened to
accept loving special delivery of orange juice, some of which remains
in the glass.</TE>
<TE>   But there is another sort of Father's Day observance, as invisible
as the lessons fathers teach, though no less meaningful. That's the
time today when sons and daughters pause to recall in the privacy of
their own imperfect memories some of the tiny moments with their
dads. The big hands and strong arms that lifted them once so high
over a scary hole. The hard knees that once bounced so hard, the
childish giggles caught in the throat. The weak jokes and firm
handshakes. The familiar face appearing in the stands when he was
supposed to be many miles away. The perfectly timed postgame ice
cream that melted the memory of the Little League error. And the
shared, seemingly spontaneous memory of his own athletic stumble many
years before.</TE>
<TE>   They can't make Father's Day greeting cards to recall those kinds
of memories. They don't have to.</TE>

<LD>As crime bosses go, the dapper John Gotti was a double-breasted
dummy. Even moviemakers know the Feds have listening devices
everywhere. But Gotti blabbed on and on to what passed for pals in
his line of work. And the tapes rolled from a transmitter planted at
Gotti's favorite table in his New York clubhouse. (The untold story
of how that historic bug got there, now, there's a movie.) So Gotti,
his son, brothers and assorted captains end up in prison, where the
street thug-turned-big tipper died of cancer the other day.</LD>
<LD>   Gotti was well coiffed, well dressed and ruthless. After a
Brooklyn neighbor accidentally hit Gotti's son with his car, killing
the 12-year-old, the neighbor disappeared. One of many who crossed
Gotti's path. So why our fascination with a murderous racketeer?</LD>
<LD>   Americans, who, after all, began national life with a bloody
revolution and enthusiastic sacking of Loyalist properties, have long
been intrigued by rebels, nonconformists and downright bad dudes. Who
but a nonconformist would see Plymouth Rock in September as an
opportunity?</LD>
<TE>   Although it's hard to picture Ben Franklin groupies, our history
and fables are full of less-savory legends--characters such as Billy
the Kid, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde and Al Capone; the compelling
"Godfather" and "Sopranos" sagas; even the tangled nonfiction legal
struggles of the doddering dons presiding over modern mobs. They all
provide story fodder for the public. Some stories may even be true.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have dukes and earls in America, so we grant levels of
fame; it's more democratic. In fact, seeking, seizing and maintaining
fame is now big business. But often in modern times, this process of
celebrating celebrities has somehow become less a means of applauding
and admiring accomplishments and more a mere entertainment through
personalities, like popcorn for the mind.</TE>
<TE>   Through quips, dress and style, Gotti made himself a celebrity.
Watching gangsters, of course, makes no one an adherent. But with
youngsters watching as we create, consume, savor and discard
succeeding shipments of celebrities, many famous for misbehaviors,
perhaps we should remind ourselves that celebrity used to have a
socially unacceptable offshoot. It was called notoriety.</TE>

<HD>Pension Fund Losses Spell Lower-Profit Era</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's pension funds have lost money in the last two years, and
that spells big changes ahead for corporate earnings growth, the
stock market and the personal retirement plans of millions of
Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate pension plans have lost $630 billion since 1999, a 14%
decline, according to a new study by Cerulli Associates Inc., a
Boston-based research firm.</LD>
<LD>   That may not sound too threatening considering that private
pension funds assets--the money set aside to fund the retirements of
more than tens of millions of working Americans--still total $4
trillion after rising dramatically in the bull market years of the
'90s.</LD>
<TE>   Public employee pension funds also have declined in value--to a
little more than $2 trillion--as have individual retirement
accounts--to $2.6 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   But the two-year decline does more than break a pattern.  It will
alter expectations of stock market gains and force companies to
contribute fresh money to their defined-benefit pension plans. That
will tend to reduce potential growth of earnings and arguably the
potential rise in stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals with 401(k) and other defined-contribution pension
plans also will have to lower expectations of big gains in their
retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The returns on investment that companies and individuals should
expect in the coming years are about 3% to 4% a year, rather than the
9% returns they count on today, says Robert Arnott of First Quadrant,
an investment management firm in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott is not alone in saying investment expectations are in for a
reality check. Corporations</TE>
<TE>   will have to lower their "assumption about long-term rate of
return on assets," says Stephen Nesbitt, senior managing director of
Wilshire Associates Inc., a Santa Monica financial research firm.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of lower assumptions about investment returns will be
that companies will have to generate higher earnings from their
business operations, says Jeremy Gold, head of New York-based
consulting firm Jeremy Gold Pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Change is coming to the vast complex of corporations, public
agencies and management firms that invest Americans' retirement nest
eggs. The last time two consecutive years of losses occurred in
pension funds</TE>
<TE>   was in the 1970s. And that</TE>
<TE>   decline launched wide-ranging reforms in pension regulation,
including the development of</TE>
<TE>   the 401(k) plan.</TE>
<TE>   The need of higher returns for pension funds also contributed to
the wrenching restructuring of U.S. industry in the 1980s, when
investment managers demanded that companies produce higher earnings.
The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, the
largest pension fund with more than $150 billion in assets, was one
of the first funds to demand that company managements do a better job
of producing profits.</TE>
<TE>   Pension funds and retirement assets in the 1970s were only a
shadow of the giant they have become. At that time, almost all
pension assets were held in corporate funds that had grown since the
post-World War II era.</TE>
<TE>   To fund pension benefits for their employees, the pension funds of
General Motors Corp. or U.S. Steel Corp., for example, were invested
in stocks of other companies and in government and corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   State and local government employees had pension funds that also
had grown large.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last quarter of a century, new varieties of retirement
accounts such as IRAs and defined-contribution plans, in which
employees make investment choices, have pushed the total to more than
$8 trillion, the largest single block of investment capital in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   And in the stock market boom of the '90s, all such funds made
gains large enough to cause illusions and distortions. Individuals
grew accustomed to rapid gains in their portfolios. Companies got a
free ride on their pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   Because investment gains swelled pension assets, companies did not
have to make annual contributions to the funds. The money instead
became part of earnings, making reported profits higher than they
would have</TE>
<TE>   been otherwise. The bull market was so strong that profits of the
large companies that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index may have
been overstated by more than 30%, investment experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many companies regarded pension assets in excess of future
obligations as "surpluses" and took them into reported profits as
well. The total of such surpluses in more than 300 companies at the
peak in 2000 amounted to $238 billion, Wilshire Associates said.</TE>
<TE>   But now that the boom is over, corporate earnings have been
declining and so have the stock markets. The surplus is gone, and
whether the stock market will soon regain its '90s peaks has become a
frequent topic of debate.</TE>
<TE>   Without rising pension assets to boost them, profit growth will be
harder to achieve for companies-- and so will investment gains. If
pension fund managers want higher-than-average gains, they will have
to put more of their money into alternative investments such as
venture capital, developing-nation markets and high-yield bonds, says
Arnott of First Quadrant, which manages $28 billion in pension
assets.</TE>
<TE>   Pension funds now invest 5% to 10% of their assets in such
alternative vehicles. The funds are expected to invest a higher
percentage but realistically, prudent funds cannot afford to put too
many billions of dollars into high-risk investments.</TE>
<TE>   For individuals managing their own defined-contribution plans such
as IRAs or 401(k)s, a new tax law allows larger contributions by
individuals older than 50, so such accounts will grow. But investment
gains may be another matter, says Peter Starr, managing director of
Cerulli Associates. Last year, average investments in 401(k) accounts
dropped by 11%, or $4,528 per account.</TE>
<TE>   So what can individuals do about their investments? Lower their
expectations and look realistically at some conservative investments,
advise the pros. Treasury bonds that have protection from inflation
are returning 3% to 4% a year. That may not sound like much, but in a
tax-deferred IRA account, it can add up impressively.</TE>
<TE>   Most investment professionals are not forecasting a disastrous
decline in the stock market, but rather the kind of market that has
characterized practically every decade--one of modest gains and many
fluctuations.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, an important point to keep in mind is that a chastened
outlook for the stock market does not mean a gloomy one for the U.S.
economy. Most economic growth comes from new ideas and new
companies--a truth that has been evident in every period of U.S.
history, including the high-tech 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In this decade, with increased venture capital available,
continued developments in information technology and medical and
biological science will bring forth new companies and new divisions
of old companies-- and new investment opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   After a boom that inevitably frayed into illusions and
distortions, realism can be bracing.</TE>

<TE>   Largest U.S. Pension Funds</TE>
<TE>   In little more than 50 years, pension funds have grown into unique
repositories of retirement income for American workers and, at about
$8 trillion in aggregate, the largest block of investment capital in
the U.S. economy.</TE>

aging society. Countries in Europe and Asia are now studying
U.S.-style pension management as a solution to the problems of
financially strained government retirement programs.</TE>

<LD>"Artists Put Pressure on for Benefits" [June 3] should be a wake-up
scream for any musical artist--either mega-star or mini-star--who
thinks their record companies dearly love them and would never leave
them in the lurch and stranded without retirement, medical or health
insurance benefits.</LD>
<LD>   As Mary Wells' and Jackie Wilson's end-of-career lives tragically
show, stardom can all too quickly fade into starvation.</LD>
<LD>   The business model on which record companies operate is corporate
slavery. Economic servitude is the engine that propelled record
companies' revenues upward to $32 billion last year. And whether the
artist is Mary Wells or Jackie Wilson, recording artists, as a class,
are simply working on "the plantation."</LD>
<TE>   By defrauding their contracted recording artists out of necessary
retirement and other benefits, record companies, en masse, are
violating federal and state employment laws.</TE>
<TE>   That they do so with impunity brings to mind the employment
practices of the agricultural and farming industry before Cesar
Chavez forced ranchers to provide reasonable wages and benefits for
their "stoop laborers." Similarly, the eradication of the "largest
plantation"--comprising the entire recording industry--will occur
only when:</TE>
<TE>   * Artists, especially teenagers, demand retirement, medical and
health benefits prior to, and as a condition of, contract-signing.</TE>
<TE>   * Artists demand that quarterly statements be issued, showing
record company contributions to their chosen benefit plans.</TE>
<TE>   * Recording contracts stipulate sanctions and penalties (including
"opt-out" clauses and financial settlements) that can be invoked
against the record companies for failing to provide or continue these
benefits.</TE>

Market Beat, June 2].</TE>
<TE>   The fallout has been a long time coming and corporate abuse
escalated over years of no retribution or limit-setting.</TE>
<TE>   The new corporate mantra: "The more you steal, the more you
deserve to steal."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I'm still in the market, just "holding." To invest more is a

4].</TE>
<TE>   As a Westchester resident for more than 15 years, I am disgusted
with the total disregard Maguire Partners has shown for both the
fragile environment and the residents of adjacent neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire Partners razed the entire property with a fleet of
bulldozers and created huge soil bunkers along Jefferson and Lincoln
boulevards, blocking all additional work from view.</TE>
<TE>   The first buildings in the Water's Edge section are unimaginative,
overcrowded and built right to the curb with minimal or no setback or
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if occupancy rates remain low and the project goes
bankrupt, the land can be bought back and restored as regional
parkland and expanded nature preserves.</TE>

<HD>Instead of Tapping 401(k), Seek Another Route to Son's
Degree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My son has just been admitted to a top college. At the same
time, my employer decided to downsize, and I lost my job. Since I
would like to give him the opportunity of a solid education, I am
wondering whether I can use some money from my 401(k) without having
to pay penalties and taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You can't get a tax-free distribution from your 401(k).
You got a tax break when the money went in, so Uncle Sam wants his
due when the money comes out.</LD>
<LD>   You can avoid penalties, however, by first rolling the money into
an individual retirement account and then taking the distribution
from your IRA. As long as the money goes for qualified education
expenses--tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment, plus room and
board if your son will be at least a half-time student--you'll pay
just the income tax due and not the 10% federal penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Taking money out of your retirement funds is a pretty expensive
way to go, however. Once you take out that money, you can't put it
back. A $30,000 withdrawal could cost you nearly $150,000 in future
retirement money, assuming it would have earned an average 8% a year
for the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a better plan: Alert the school's financial aid office of
the change in your finances to see whether your son might qualify for
more help. Also, talk to your bank about taking out a home equity
loan. Borrowing against your home equity shouldn't be done lightly,
but at least a home equity loan offers a tax deduction and probably
will do less damage to your future finances.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on paying for college, see Kristin Davis'
book, "Financing College: How Much You'll Really Have to Pay and
Where to Get the Money" (2001, Kiplinger Books).</TE>
<TE>   Selecting Insurance for Long-Term Care</TE>
<TE>   Q: After seeing my parents' life savings wiped out by nursing home
costs, I've decided to purchase long-term-care insurance. One
insurance company I'm considering has a Standard &amp; Poor's rating of
A- and offers a very attractive package. The other company has a
rating of AA+ and offers a package that's not as good as the other.
How much consideration should I give the companies' S&amp;P ratings in my
decision?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unfortunately, there's no easy answer to that question. You
must consider a number of factors when choosing long-term-care
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   You also need to be a smart shopper because some companies charge
hundreds of dollars more than others for essentially the same
policies, said long-term-care expert Bonnie Burns of California
Health Advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that your state insurance regulator probably
offers some help. In California, the Department of Insurance posts
information about such insurance on its Web site at www.insurance
.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   You also can order the department's long-term care guide for
consumers by calling (800) 927-4357. The information applies only to
California residents, but your state probably has a similar guide.</TE>
<TE>   Retirement Planning</TE>
<TE>   for Self-Employed</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I are self-employed, ages 36 and 33, and are
fortunate enough to have $5,000 to $10,000 left over each month after
bills are paid. We have $500,000 in life insurance and mutual fund
investments, but we do not have any retirement accounts. I'm
concerned about that, plus financing our children's education (they
are 1 and 5), but we don't know anything about stock markets. What
should we do with that extra cash so it will be there when we're
ready for our early retirement?</TE>
<TE>   A: Would that more people had your problems.</TE>
<TE>   You're definitely overdue to start retirement plans, and as
self-employed people you have more options and can salt away more
money than most other folks. A savvy certified public accountant
(which you should have anyway, being businesspeople) can review your
options with you. One type of plan, known as a defined contribution
plan, would allow you to invest 20% or more of your income for
retirement. A traditional pension plan, which pays a set benefit in
retirement, could allow you to put away even more.</TE>
<TE>   You're also smart to start saving now for your children's
education. Given your income level, you're unlikely to get financial
aid when they're ready for college. You also should get a review of
your insurance, credit and overall tax situation.</TE>
<TE>   With the amount of money you have and the complexity of your
needs, you probably will want to hire a financial planner for advice.
You can find more information about how to do that at
www.latimes.com/money.</TE>
<TE>   You also should begin educating yourself so stock markets and
investments aren't such a mystery. Good books to start with include
Eric Tyson's "Personal Finance for Dummies" and Kathy Kristof's
"Investing 101."</TE>

<LD>ImClone's Ex-CEO Faces Insider Trading Charges</LD>
<LD>   Another week, another bombshell from corporate America. On
Wednesday, the former chief executive of biotechnology company
ImClone Systems Inc. was arrested on charges of violating
insider-trading laws.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel D. Waksal, 54, who stepped down last month amid deepening
questions about his family's trading of ImClone stock, was accused of
tipping off two relatives to impending bad news from the Food and
Drug Administration about the company's top drug prospect.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday, Waksal appeared before a House committee but declined to
answer questions, instead asserting his 5th Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   But his brother, Harlan W. Waksal, who replaced him as ImClone
CEO, did testify, telling lawmakers that he phoned his brother with
news that the FDA was about to reject the firm's application to
market cancer drug Erbitrux.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan Waksal's testimony before a subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee seemed to corroborate key elements of
the government's case against Samuel Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech to Pay City of Hope $300 Million</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County jury awarded City of Hope National Medical
Center $300.2 million in compensatory damages after finding that its
former collaborator, Genentech Inc., breached the 26-year-old
contract that launched the biotechnology revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech-funded research at City of Hope produced the first
biotechnology drug, human insulin, creating an industry--and the
seeds of an epic legal battle that could play out in court for years
to come.</TE>
<TE>   By a 9-3 vote, jurors found that Genentech failed to pay the
Duarte-based cancer hospital royalties on nearly two dozen other
drugs, including the hepatitis B vaccine, that stemmed from City of
Hope research.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors also found, voting 10 to 2, that Genentech, based in South
San Francisco, acted with malice or fraud. The jury will reconvene
this week to determine punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   If the award withstands an expected appeal, it could be an
extraordinary windfall for medical researchers at City of Hope, a
world-renowned nonprofit cancer center. It also would be a huge
financial blow to biotech giant Genentech, an industry leader with
$2.2 billion in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   Univision to Acquire Hispanic Broadcasting</TE>
<TE>   Univision Communications Inc. said it will acquire the nation's
largest Spanish-language radio network, Dallas-based Hispanic
Broadcasting Corp., in a $3.5-billion stock deal that would round out
its portfolio as a media conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Univision commands more than 70% of the
Spanish-language TV market and owns three record labels but had no
voice in radio before this deal. Hispanic Broadcasting owns 55 radio
stations, including five in Los Angeles, the nation's largest Latino
market.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would bolster the company's growing music division by
giving Univision artists valuable exposure and air time on popular
radio stations in the nation's top Latino markets.</TE>
<TE>   Judge OKs Unocal</TE>
<TE>   Abuse Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   A group of Burmese refugees won a landmark victory when a Los
Angeles judge ruled that Unocal Corp. could be tried for human rights
violations, including forced labor, that allegedly occurred during
construction of a $1.2-billion natural gas pipeline in Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Victoria Gerrard Chaney's ruling means that
if the case goes to trial in September as scheduled, Unocal would
become the first U.S. corporation held to answer in an American
courtroom foreigners' allegations of abuse abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being watched closely in business and legal circles
because of its implications for other multinational corporations.</TE>
<TE>   State's Unemployment Rate Edges Down</TE>
<TE>   California's unemployment rate dipped to 6.3% in May, further
evidence that the state's economy is on the mend.</TE>
<TE>   That's down from a revised 6.5% in April. But the number of
workers on business and government payrolls, considered to be the
most reliable measure of the labor market's health, declined by 9,000
jobs last month, signaling that recovery may be a long way off for
the state's job seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure to improve profitability and unsure of the
economy's pep, companies continue to hold off on hiring as employers
trim positions rather than create them.</TE>
<TE>   The state's unemployment rate improved last month in part because
some discouraged workers dropped out of the labor force.</TE>
<TE>   ICN Pharmaceuticals Chairman Steps Down</TE>
<TE>   Milan Panic, the man who said he was "born to fight" even when it
wasn't a good idea, chose not to, announcing that he will step down
as chairman and chief executive of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., the
company he started in Los Angeles 42 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Panic's decision, made two weeks after dissident shareholders took
control of the ICN board of directors, marks the end of a successful
but controversial stewardship that saw the firm grow from a $200
stake and a converted washing machine into a global research-based
pharmaceutical business.</TE>
<TE>   "There are better things in life to do than to fight, and I am 72.
It's time for me to consider doing something else," Panic said. "If
it helps the company, then I will do well [as a shareholder] and my
grandchildren will do well."</TE>
<TE>   Just how well the Costa Mesa-based company will do without Panic
at the helm is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts had predicted that ICN stock would rise once Panic's
control of the company had ended, because ICN's past is as colored by
Panic's problems as anything else, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Judge Answers Key Jury Question</TE>
<TE>   The judge presiding over the Arthur Andersen criminal trial was
thrust into uncharted territory when jurors asked her whether they
could convict the firm even if they couldn't agree on which Andersen
executive violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon, after acknowledging there was
a lack of case law on the issue, ruled that jurors could convict the
firm of obstruction of justice even if they disagree on which
executive was guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which was sequestered, had been deliberating for nearly
two weeks when they told Harmon they had failed to reach a unanimous
decision.</TE>
<TE>   She then read a special instruction, called an Allen charge,
asking the panel to renew efforts to reach a verdict and avoid a
mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the jury asked the judge for clarification on the
issue, which legal scholars concede was a gray area with little, if
any, precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors continued their deliberations into Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Construction Begins on Toyota's Tijuana Plant</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's President Vicente Fox kicked off construction of a Toyota
Motor Co. automotive factory in Tijuana that over time may bring an
influx of investments and thousands of jobs to the Mexican state of
Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   Fox also provided new impetus for construction of a proposed rail
line to link Baja with the Western U.S. transportation grid.</TE>
<TE>   By transferring operating rights of such a line to the state from
the federal government, Fox hopes to jump-start a $250-million
proposal to make Ensenada a major rail-linked container cargo center.</TE>
<TE>   Bochco Copyright Lawsuit Reinstated</TE>
<TE>   In an embarrassment for A-list TV producer Steven Bochco, a
federal appeals court ruled that his defunct CBS hospital drama,
"City of Angels," bore a "striking" resemblance to a series idea
allegedly pitched to him a decade ago by a Los Angeles couple.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling reinstates a lawsuit
filed in March 2000 by businessman Jerome C. Metcalf and his wife,
Laurie, alleging that Bochco infringed their idea. That lawsuit was
tossed out last year.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling does not mean that Bochco was found to have copied
their idea, only that the Metcalfs have a right to sue him over it.</TE>

<HD>There's Something Afoot at Skechers</HD>
<DH>Analysts say the footwear company, led by a father-son
team, has hit its stride</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade after being pushed aside by footwear maker L.A. Gear, the
founders of Skechers USA Inc. have impressed Wall Street and industry
insiders with a resounding comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Robert Greenberg and his son Michael Greenberg,
the company's president, have created a footwear company that, by
flouting industry formula, has boldly strode into the No. 3 U.S.
sales slot behind Nike Inc. and Reebok International.</LD>
<LD>   The Manhattan Beach-based company has gained traction in a
slippery economy by designing for all kinds of shoe buyers--men,
women, teens and kids--and all kinds of tastes with 1,500 styles,
including athletic shoes, clunky boots, basic brown shoes, trendy
platforms, steel-toed sneakers, fuzzy slippers and even shoe skates.
By comparison, the average shoe maker has 100 to 200 selections and
usually is identified with a specific type of shoe, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   Overall footwear sales have been sluggish to negative for 18
months, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Assn. in
Arlington, Va. But Skechers' sales grew 42% in 2001 from the previous
year and rose about 8% in the first quarter of 2002, compared with
the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   While broadening its base and often selling shoes at lower prices
than its competitors, Skechers has paid special attention to young
women, who tend to buy shoes for all members of the family while
shopping for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "So you're outfitting the whole family," said Michael Pachter, a
Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst. "It's a brilliant strategy, and
I'm absolutely shocked that no one else has figured it out."</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts remain cautious about Skechers, because this is
an industry in which styles shift rapidly, a brand's cachet can dim
suddenly and even a seasonal fluctuation will pluck profits from the
bottom line. Skechers is competing against a daunting array of
rivals, including Adidas-Salomon, Steven Madden Ltd. and C&amp;J Clark
International Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Skechers aims its styles mainly at teens and young
adults, always a dicey prospect, said Roz Bryant, an analyst with
Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a group whose taste can swing rather widely," she said.
"So that is definitely a risk in looking at Skechers as a stock. The
share price is likely to move up and down as the company hits and
misses with its customers."</TE>
<TE>   And it's been mostly hits. Skechers stock closed at $22.10 on
Friday, down 5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. The share price
has climbed about 50% this year, but still is down 28% compared with
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings, meanwhile, tumbled about 50% in the third and fourth
quarters of 2001, prompting the footwear maker to implement
cost-cutting measures, including firing about 5% of its work force of
2,000.</TE>
<TE>   But with sales nearing $1 billion, Skechers has pulled into an
enviable position within the industry, analysts say. It logged a
strong first quarter and has boosted financial projections for the
year. A recent report by Smartmoney.com named Skechers one of 16
attractively valued small-cap companies with "solid growth
prospects." This month, Skechers made Business Week's top 10 list of
"hot growth companies."</TE>
<TE>   Skechers "has done a very good job of really becoming a big player
in this market," said Steven Richter, an analyst with Wellington
Management. That's partly because it is quick to react to consumer
sentiment, retail experts say.</TE>
<TE>   When clunky shoe styles cooled last fall, Skechers immediately
launched a "sexy and frivolous" line called Skechers by Michelle K,
targeting trend-conscious 18-to-34-year-old women, said Ellen
Campuzano, president of the Committee For Colour &amp; Trends, a New York
trend-tracking firm. The line retailed at $60 to $250 a pair, while a
new juniors line launched about the same time sold for $20 to $70.</TE>
<TE>   "Stupid they're not," Campuzano said, adding that the footwear
maker, which also operates 85 stores, has become so adept at
mimicking hot new styles that other companies increasingly copy
theirs. "Everybody wants to knock off their good shoes."</TE>
<TE>   CEO Robert Greenberg, 62, says Skechers "interprets categories"
but doesn't "knock off styles."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the Greenbergs are having an effect on the industry,
said Fawn Evenson, vice president of the American Apparel &amp; Footwear
Assn. "To take this company and make it a premier brand, I think
people just look at it in awe."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Greenbergs are resilient. And plentiful. Robert
Greenberg's four other sons and a daughter also work for the company,
along with a niece and a nephew.</TE>
<TE>   The siblings, who live in Manhattan Beach, socialize and vacation
together. But shop talk often dominates and they can be a bit
single-minded, said Jeffrey Greenberg, 34, a company director who is
in charge of TV advertising. If they gather at a restaurant, for
example, "we watch feet as everybody's going out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Retail a Tradition</TE>
<TE>   in Greenberg Family</TE>
<TE>   The family's retail roots stretch back to the 1930s when Harry
Greenberg, Robert's father, opened Belle's Market in Boston, a
grocery store named for his wife. Robert Greenberg's career has
included importing wigs, selling denim and running a chain of
roller-skating stores.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Greenberg, 39, was 8 years old when he began trailing his
father to work, rising early to accompany him to a warehouse or
office and napping afternoons on corrugated boxes or under the
conference table.</TE>
<TE>   At 9, he discovered the financial upside of hanging out with dad
when a secretary, trying to occupy him, asked Michael to put labels
on invoices, promising to pay him $7 a box and figuring he would be
lucky to finish one. He made $130.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Greenberg remembers working summers with his father at the
Wild Oats Jeans Co. warehouse in Boston, taping boxes and "riding
around on the conveyer belt" while his dad did "the boring stuff" in
an office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Robert Greenberg moved his family to California, where he
picked up the Hang 10 license for shoe skates. Once he realized that
it was the "uppers" that held the most promise, Greenberg began
focusing on shoes instead of skates and, in 1983, L.A. Gear was born.</TE>
<TE>   The brand took off, making a hit with teens and young women and
getting a boost from the red-hot aerobics craze. Michael quit college
to join his father in the business. In 1986, Robert Greenberg bought
out his partner and took the company public.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Gear soon became the nation's third-largest footwear seller,
but it began to struggle as it tried to move into "performance"
athletic shoes and apparel and failed to shift rapidly enough with
fashion trends. In 1991 sales plunged 25%, resulting in a $45-million
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, investors rode in, dumping $100 million into the
company for a 34% stake. Before long, the Greenbergs were out.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, the philosophies did not marry up,"
Michael Greenberg said. "It made sense for the Greenberg family to
depart ... without a fight."</TE>
<TE>   In December 1992, L.A. Gear announced that former executives,
including Robert Greenberg, had agreed to pay $29.3 million to settle
a shareholder lawsuit. The lawsuit, which involved stock purchases
made from 1989 to 1991, alleged that company officers had violated
securities laws by issuing misleading statements meant to boost the
stock price. The defendants said the settlement was not an admission
of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Gear filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998 and
continues to operate as a footwear company in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Once they left L.A. Gear, the Greenbergs didn't waste much time
worrying about their predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat on the couch for maybe a week," Michael Greenberg said.
"But in that week, we were talking about our next move."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, they co-founded Skechers, importing the clunky
Dr. (Doc) Martens work boots and shoes from a British maker and
selling them for $90 to $134.</TE>
<TE>   The new company's name--which in teen lingo means someone who is
antsy and can't sit still--was suggested by Josh Greenberg, now 29,
who helps his father with product development.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it would work," Robert Greenberg said. But when
his daughter's girlfriend offered the same suggestion, he changed his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   L.A Gear Experience</TE>
<TE>   Blazed Trail to Success</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Skechers was making its own work boots for men, women and
children and selling them at retailers such as Foot Locker, Macy's
and Nordstrom. The business went public in June 1999 with 30 stores.
Today, its stores make about 10% of its sales, and there are plans to
open at least a dozen more outlets this year.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Greenberg said the experience and contacts he developed at
L.A. Gear have helped fuel Skechers' success. And, despite the
similarities of the two companies, the Greenbergs say Skechers is not
destined to follow in L.A. Gear's footsteps. L.A. Gear was hampered
by its image as a women's aerobics shoe, Michael said, while Skechers
has branched out.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost impossible to compare Skechers with any of its
competitors, analysts say, because its products spread across more
categories than any other footwear company. Nike, for example, is
considered an athletic shoe company, while Timberland Co. is known
for its hiking shoes and Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. is seen as a
dress and casual shoe company, said Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with
CIBC World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers keeps its name in the limelight by featuring celebrities
in its advertising, including actors Robert Downey Jr. and Matt
Dillon and Lakers basketball star Rick Fox. It recently signed a
three-year advertising contract with singer Britney Spears and began
selling Skechers Britney 4 Wheelers roller skates in stores this
month. Skechers advertises in more than 100 U.S. magazines each
month.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is pumping advertising into the European market
because international sales are considered key to Skechers' future
growth. It is opening more stores and showrooms abroad and has taken
control of its European distribution centers. International sales
rose by more than 65% in the first quarter and account for more than
13% of total sales, which the company says could grow to as much as
30% over the next three to five years. "The potential is enormous,"
Robert Greenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But challenges lie ahead. The plethora of styles has resulted in
inventory backups that are higher than the industry average, which
can pose problems when sales soften, analysts say. At the end of last
year, Skechers' inventory was up 40%, a situation that has since
improved.</TE>
<TE>   Nike may go after Skechers' sneaker business with its new Hurley
brand, a hot apparel name among surfers and skateboarders, said
Joseph Teklits, an analyst with Wachovia Securities, who reiterated
his "buy" rating on Skechers stock Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Nike spokeswoman Leslye Mundy declined to say Friday whether Nike
plans to make shoes with the Hurley brand.</TE>
<TE>   "When this is communicated by Nike, it could be a problem for
[Skechers] shares," Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   And analyst Bryant said the fact that Skechers' five largest
customers accounted for more than a quarter of its total sales in
2001 "should give people pause."</TE>
<TE>   The Greenbergs, however, sound confident about the future. The
family unit has strengthened the company, Michael and Robert
Greenberg say.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard part is, you don't want to fail under any
circumstances," Robert Greenberg said, "because everybody fails."</TE>

<HD>Tax Evasion Found at All Income Levels</HD>
<DH>Personal finance: Many Americans use legal-- or
illegal--strategies to avoid paying federal, state and local taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent arrest of former Tyco International Ltd. chairman L.
Dennis Kozlowski on charges of evading $1 million in sales taxes is
throwing light on a shadowy subject: Americans who try to gain an
edge--legally or illegally--on the tax collector.</LD>
<LD>   Some wealthy Californians sail to international waters to buy
yachts tax-free. Many waiters, waitresses, beauticians and parking
valets don't report all their tip income, accountants say. Some
small-business owners fail to ring up cash sales, playing poor for
tax purposes, while some philanthropists overstate the value of
charitable contributions to pad itemized deductions.</LD>
<LD>   "Many people cheat on their taxes all the time," said Steve
Toscher, a partner at Beverly Hills law firm Hochman Salkin Rettig
Toscher &amp; Perez. "I don't know that you can say that rich people
cheat more than poor people, but there's certainly more inducement
and opportunity to cheat."</LD>
<TE>   Almost anyone can find a way to chisel if they want to, tax
accountants say.</TE>
<TE>   The tax-avoidance strategy Kozlowski is charged with using is
among the most common--on a much smaller scale--because of the big
differences in state tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski is charged with evading $1 million in New York state and
city sales taxes on artwork by having dealers ship empty boxes to his
offices in New Hampshire, where there is no state sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to sales tax avoidance, almost any consumer can
participate. Many shop in no-tax and low-tax states and never think
about filing a so-called use tax form, which is required for those
who buy something in a lower-tax state--or by catalog or over the
Web--and take it back home.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes business owners offer to forgo sales tax when the
consumer pays in cash--a conspiratorial fraud that probably saves the
merchant from reporting--and paying income tax on--the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers go to New Jersey; Northern Californians go to
Oregon," said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at accounting
firm Deloitte &amp; Touche. "Avoiding the payment of sales and use taxes
borders on being a national sport."</TE>
<TE>   Towns along borders between low- or no-tax states and high-tax
states often become busy retail centers, said Bill Ahern, spokesman
for the Tax Foundation in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "On the Maryland-Delaware border, there are roughly 125 stores,"
Ahern said. Delaware has no sales tax, while Maryland's rate is 5%.
"Delaware is simply filled with retail outlets catering to
out-of-state buyers."</TE>
<TE>   There are even greater incentives to avoid so-called sin taxes,
imposed on alcohol and cigarettes, Ahern said. The tax rate on
alcohol sales ranges from $1.50 a gallon in the District of Columbia
to nearly $6.50 in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "You can legally bring back one bottle from D.C. to Virginia,"
Ahern said. "But you see people outside Central Liquor [near the
state line] loading up their trunks."</TE>
<TE>   Other illegal tax-shaving strategies include understating the
purchase price of a used car bought from a private party, Toscher
said.</TE>
<TE>   Car dealers collect sales taxes at the time of purchase. But
anyone buying an auto from a private party must pay sales tax when
the vehicle is registered. Too often, buyers will tell the Department
of Motor Vehicles that a $10,000 car cost only $7,000 to shave $240
off the tax bill, Toscher said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really nuts, but people do it all the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy boaters join the tax-avoidance party by sailing offshore
to complete their yacht purchases, said Robert Schriebman, a tax
attorney in Rolling Hills Estates. The broker then takes the buyers
home and sails the yacht to Mexico for a few months, to meet some
technical requirements that can allow the owner to avoid paying sales
taxes, he said. The process may seem burdensome, but yachts can sell
for $500,000 to $1 million, so avoiding sales tax saves tens of
thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "You can buy a condominium for what you save on the sales taxes,"
Schriebman said. "And then you get a tax shelter with the
condominium."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to cheating on income taxes, the pockets of
opportunity are rare for many employees, but numerous for
small-business owners and workers who deal in cash, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Companies report employee wages directly to the IRS, which then
matches what employers say with what workers report on their tax
returns. That makes it almost impossible for someone with primarily
wage income to understate their earnings, said Jerry Feffer, partner
with Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.</TE>
<TE>   But people who earn tips are mostly on the honor system when it
comes to reporting how much cash they receive. Most restaurants
include a minimal amount of estimated tip income on W-2 forms for
their waiters and waitresses, but experts believe many servers don't
tell the IRS that they earned more.</TE>
<TE>   Small-business owners--from retailers to contractors--often skirt
the tax system by not ringing up and reporting cash sales, experts
add.</TE>
<TE>   "I was buying a cell phone the other day and the guy says to me,
'If you pay me in cash, I don't have to charge you sales tax,' " said
Joel Isaacson, a tax accountant in New York. "I know what he's doing
and I'm thinking, 'I like paying taxes. I like it when you pay taxes.
Then we all pay our fair share.' But it happens all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Even though there are no hard numbers on how many Americans cheat
on their taxes, tax officials suspect that tax fraud has increased
sharply in recent years. The IRS used to estimate cheating by
conducting random line-by-line audits.</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency hasn't had the staff or congressional support
to conduct these audits in more than a decade. A limited version of
the program is planned, but analyzing the results could take years.</TE>
<TE>   Some accountants believe that today's historically low audit rates
almost encourage the unscrupulous to cheat on their income taxes,
because the chance of getting caught is minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, for example, about 2% of taxpayers earning more than
$100,000 faced in-person audits. Today, the in-person audit rate for
these filers is less than one-half of 1%. To put it another way,
although two in 100 high-income taxpayers grappled with face-to-face
audits in 1995, now it's fewer than one in 200.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are guided by risk-reward ratios rather than pure
ethics will make a judgment that cheating has less cost associated
with it," said Phil Holthouse, partner at Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van
Trigt, a Los Angeles tax law and accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   There are other issues, too. The U.S. tax system has some clear
definitions for which deductions are legitimate--such as
contributions to retirement plans--and which deductions are
fraudulent--such as characterizing your personal purchases as
deductible business expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But there are shades of gray. There can be legitimate disagreement
over whether certain expenses can be classified as deductions--and
how much to deduct if the item's value isn't apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Tax accountants and lawyers consistently find passages in the tax
code that can be interpreted two ways--one that benefits the
government and the other that benefits the taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   "You see people hire individuals to give you opinions that say the
law of probability is in your favor that [the tax shelter] is
kosher," Schriebman said. It's not really cheating; it's taxpaying on
the edge."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of complexity can create an incentive to push the
envelope, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you have high marginal tax rates, the pressure to cheat
increases. Whenever you have complexity, the ability to cheat
increases. And when you have no confidence that everybody else is
paying their fair share, you have more motivation to cheat," said
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that the government can do to increase
compliance--outside of lecturing everybody about playing by the
rules--is have lower rates and simpler rules," he said.</TE>

<LD>Re "Detention of a Citizen Questioned," June 12: The detention of
Jose Padilla, an American citizen, in the absence of criminal
charges, an arraignment or access to legal counsel--and the lack of
outrage in the press about this action--should frighten and anger
every American. Whether the 1942 Supreme Court decision cited by the
Justice Department is a relevant precedent or not, the bottom line is
that we are being asked to place unquestioning trust in Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft and President Bush, who at best are fallible and at
worst may act in bad faith.</LD>
<LD>   The constitutional system of checks and balances was created
precisely to prevent this kind of unilateral administration of power
by the government, particularly the executive branch, because the
framers knew that all governments would ultimately abuse such power.
For Americans to believe that the current administration is immune
from the lessons of history is naive and dangerous. Exactly what are
we trying to protect from terrorists if not constitutional democracy?</LD>
<LD>   Dan Brezenoff</LD>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every U.S. passport has a warning saying that anyone who joins a
foreign army automatically loses, as in renounces, his citizenship.
Therefore, Padilla illegally reentered this country as a spy,
saboteur and/or terrorist and has absolutely no rights afforded
American citizens. Furthermore, a 1942 Supreme Court precedent
involving U.S.-born Nazi saboteurs ruled that a captured combatant
has no constitutional rights, whether or not the war was declared by
Congress. Forward thinkers, those Supremes!</TE>
<TE>   Here's a guy who figured violent street gangs were too warm and
fuzzy, so he joined Al Qaeda to kill Americans. By giving this the
front page, are you siding with this madman over his intended
victims?</TE>

<TE>   As I read the pundits and spin-masters telling us why we urgently
need a Department of Homeland Security, I keep waiting for someone to
explain where the National Security Agency went. What exactly is it
doing with its published $10-billion annual budget? According to the
NSA Web site: The National Security Agency coordinates, directs and
performs highly specialized activities to protect the United States
and produce foreign intelligence information.</TE>
<TE>   According to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security
would be: 1) one department whose primary mission is to protect the
American homeland; and 2) one department to synthesize and analyze
homeland security intelligence from multiple sources.</TE>
<TE>   I know the world is different now, but have we abandoned the
concept of a smaller government completely, or has that become the
bastion of the Democratic Party? If that is the case, you can find me
looking out the window hoping to catch a glimpse of some flying pigs.</TE>

<LD>The Times appears to have solidified an editorial policy to glorify,
at every opportunity, the endless stream of Palestinian terrorists
who have "no choice" but to murder innocent civilians ("Guide for
Bombers Maps His Methods," June 12). Does The Times truly believe
that the warped mentality of a chauffeur for would-be terrorists is
more newsworthy than the stories of the grandparents and
grandchildren whose lives are stolen, with each bomb blast, by the
terrorist murderers who pretend to be working for a noble cause?</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians who are being killed consist, in large part, of
individuals who have committed an act of murder, are preparing to
commit an act of murder or are killed by other Palestinians who
suspect them of complicity with the Israelis. The Jews who are being
killed by the Palestinians are people as innocent as those who were
working in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Scully claims that women priests, women bishops and an end to
celibacy have nothing to do with the current scandal (letter, June
12). Nothing could be further from the truth. If God had never
instilled within us the need for sexual expression, the human race
would not have lived long enough to leave the caves. It is both the
minimal socializing with women on an intimate level and celibacy that
are at the very root of the current scandal.</LD>
<LD>   By suppressing the natural, human need for sexual expression the
church is also suppressing the human spirit. As we all know,
suppressing any need leads to it eventually surfacing somewhere else.
Suppressing the human spirit has always led to some form of
rebellion. The history of the world is filled with examples of this.</LD>
<LD>   America considers itself the country with the most freedoms. Yet
we have made taboo one of the most important aspects of the human
experience to the point where violence is more acceptable as
entertainment than sexual expression. Scully's inability to see the
blatant correlation between the scandal and the issues of celibacy
and a woman's role in the church only guarantees such a scandal
happening again.</LD>

<TE>   One Catholic activist's suggestion that "all Catholics would write
down their grievances on slips of paper and place them in a bowl,
where they would be burned" amazes and amuses me no end ("Bishops
Confront Pressure to Give More Power to Laity," June 12). Isn't this
stretching "turning the other cheek" a bit too far? I only hope that
this suggestion is not adopted by governmental agencies, corporations
and other lay organizations as a means of "answering" complaints.</TE>

<LD>I am a 55-year-old who just graduated from Cal State Northridge in
sociology. Math and statistics are both required. In answer to Irene
Clark (letter, June 5), there is no secret. I am not math-oriented
either, and I did stumble many times; fortunately I had great
professors who picked me up when I did stumble. Like Steven
Spielberg, if you want it bad enough, you go for it, no matter what
your age. I fulfilled a long-held dream; maybe you can too, Irene--go
for it! Congratulations to Spielberg for a job well done.</LD>

<LD>Re "Council Districts Redrawn to Benefit Valley, Latinos," June 12: I
am outraged that the City Council would vote to move my district
(Venice) out of the hands of Councilwoman Ruth Galanter (whom I voted
for 15 years ago) and into the hands of Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski. (Who is she?)</LD>
<LD>   The councilwoman I voted for will now be representing the East
Valley. This should have gone before the voters. It should not be
politically decided by trying to influence the secession movement.
This is a perfect example of how out of touch the City Council is
with its constituents.</LD>
<LD>   Mindy Taylor-Ross</LD>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Galanter seems to think she's the only person capable of
representing the 6th District. She is term-limited and a lame duck.
It is not unusual for reapportionment plans to gerrymander a district
that will cease to exist.</TE>
<TE>   This notion that Los Angeles residents have been disenfranchised
is not true. Voters affected by this redistricting plan will have the
opportunity to cast votes in the next election. To allege voters lack
representation is just false. They just won't have Galanter as that
representative.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter's whining about the eventual dissolution of this council
district has been ongoing for months. It's a political reality she
fails to accept. It is this lack of maturity on her part that
probably denied her the council presidency despite being one of the
council's senior members.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas J. Antonicello</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The people of Los Angeles want the districts to represent a
geographic area that is related or at least is just logical. For
example: How about four districts for the Valley. Use the 405 Freeway
as the east/west line and Roscoe Boulevard for the north/south line.
This division will represent the people no matter what their
background--white, black, pink, brown, yellow, green with orange
dots, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Represent the people of Los Angeles, period.</TE>

<LD>Re "Disabled's Right to Jobs Narrowed," June 11: The Supreme Court
has once again found a chance to limit the most significant civil
rights legislation in 35 years. While the case involving a former
Chevron refinery worker with liver disease who wanted his job back
has its complexities, the issue lies not with the decision itself but
with the disturbing trend of the court's opinions. In three decisions
involving the Americans With Disabilities Act this year, the Supreme
Court has sided with business. In those three rulings, justices have
overruled the appeals court decision. In March, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said that the ADA was written with haste and was too broad.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of interpretation, the court sees its job as that of
rewriting ADA legislation in its own image. This power is not granted
to the court by the Constitution. Yet, with its new authority, the
court denies power to people with disabilities and their rights to
reasonable accommodations in the workplace.</LD>
<LD>   O'Connor has said that this court will be remembered for the
amount of ADA cases it will have to hear. She's right; yet the
court's legacy will not be with its burden of work but with the
denial of civil liberties and the court's ignorance of disability.</LD>

<LD>Quick! Check around your offices for an empty seedpod, as I suspect
Michael Ramirez might have been body-snatched. Lately he has made
some criticisms that might actually make the powers that be
uncomfortable and has actually shown concern for the welfare of the
common citizen! Indeed, his June 13 editorial cartoon depicting Shaq
as Los Angeles standing head and shoulders above the Valley and
Hollywood nearly mirrors a letter I was poised to write. This is
impossible!</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, if you won't make too big a deal about it, neither
will I. It would be a welcome change from the status quo.</LD>

<LD>"High Court Backs Forced Confessions" (June 11) is depressing. Only
hypocrites refer to that 1787 document called the Constitution of the
United States as having any meaning. The executive, legislative and
judicial branches of government twist it as fits their special needs.</LD>
<LD>   The 1787 framers constructed a document that applied to everybody.
They erroneously assumed that those elected to office would be
persons of ethics--not the trash we now have. Impeachment was the
tool to keep departments in line. If public officials in Washington
were impeached for violating the 1787 Constitution there would be
nobody left.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Know the right people, ask the right questions and Mayme A. Clayton
will gladly invite you in to wander through her semi-secret treasure
trove.</LD>
<LD>   If you do, she'll first wind you through the curio-packed rooms of
her modest home on the fringes of West Adams. Shelves buckling with
books and videos, walls and side tables cluttered with recent
snapshots and hand-tinted portraits of another era are merely
teasers.</LD>
<LD>   Out back, up five crumbling cement steps, past shaggy trees, a
rusting bicycle and a wild tangle of desert succulents, Clayton
nimbly negotiates the path in purple suede hiking boots. She slips a
key into the lock of her garage side door, which opens onto a
startling sight: Harsh fluorescent tubes beam down on towers of
books, rising floor to ceiling. They snake, stairstep style, along
the wall. They geyser up at the center of the room. They are piled
precariously on tables. Amid them are stacks of musty papers--sheet
music, old letters, stray photographs, lobby cards. Videos tower like
pillars. Photo albums crowd on a makeshift shelf. Bankers' boxes sub
as filing cabinets.</LD>
<TE>   On this humid afternoon, Clayton engages in a playful game of
show-and-tell, pausing over some highlights. No need for decimal
systems, memory serves. She sinks her hand between two particularly
prodigious piles, fishing out a slim, signed 1773 edition of "Poems
on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral" by poet and ex-slave
Phillis Wheatley stowed in a box secured with a gold Christmas cord.
It is the first published book by an African American.</TE>
<TE>   Signed first editions of Zora Neale Hurston's fiction and folklore
share shelf space with aging, exquisite editions of Paul Laurence
Dunbar's poetry, the essays of W.E.B. DuBois and the fiction of
Richard Wright. In a gust of dust and mildew, Clayton, riffling
through the card catalog in her head, puts her hands on letters, some
sheathed in plastic, others open to the elements: a note typed by
Josephine Baker; handwritten correspondence--yellowed and
fading--from George Washington Carver on letterhead from Tuskegee
Normal and Industrial Institute. And with a conspiratorial wink, she
passes under the light a fragile text, the memoir, nearly a century
and a half old, of ex-slave and abolitionist Sojourner Truth.</TE>
<TE>   The Western States Black Research and Educational Center, as
Clayton has named this expansive, idiosyncratic collection, is her
close-to-the-heart endeavor to preserve African American memorabilia.
In what is arguably the largest such collection on the West Coast,
Clayton figures she has amassed upward of 20,000 pieces--more than
500 films, 300 videos and thousands of books and magazines, along
with sheet music, tracts and pamphlets. There are framed
advertisements for hair care products and breakfast cereal, old movie
and jazz stills.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no sprinklers or fire extinguishers. No climate
control. Insurance? "We need to have more," she says. Security? "My
dog," she declares, placing her folded fists on her hips. "I don't
need anything more than that. Some guy jumped over the fence, and I
came out and Tootie had him pinned against the wall!"</TE>
<TE>   Today is a particularly busy day in a particularly busy season for
Clayton. Sporting in a bright orange sweatshirt and kente-patterned
beads, she threads herself through the narrow curves of crawl space,
with an urgent sense of duty. Normally, around this time of year, she
is getting ready for the annual Reel Black Cowboy Film Festival at
the Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage, assembling films and other
related period ephemera. But lately, Clayton has begun the serious
first steps of planning for a permanent home for her hard-won
collection, assisted by her oldest son, Avery.</TE>
<TE>   A retired librarian, Clayton, 78, has been building this
collection since the early 1970s. It's a vast and eclectic library
that attracts collectors, writers, actors and scholars from across
the country. Actor-director Ivan Dixon ("Hogan's Heroes") has spread
the word in his circle about Clayton's holdings. Film and TV
historian Donald Bogle considers Clayton's collection "unmatchable
and invaluable." And Alex Haley, who knew a little something about
the importance of a connect-the-dots legacy, visited, then inscribed
a note inside the center's copy of "Roots": "For my brothers and
sisters, I deeply share your sentiments that our history should be
preserved."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Clayton has been wooed and courted. She's
entertained offers that sounded too good to be true from universities
and from various social organizations institutions, public and
private, all earnest efforts to help get these fragile books, records
and priceless papers safely stored. But Clayton hasn't always been so
happy with the follow-through. She's been even less enthusiastic
about her would-be helpers' plans. "So many have wanted to pitch in.
But," she says wagging a finger, "you have to be careful about
phonies."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few months, though, the wariness has dissipated bit
by bit as she and Avery, an artist, have begun more actively to
explore what it might take to construct, from the ground up, her own
facility--a community center with her research collection as its
heart.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in May, strategy meetings with community activists,
filmmakers and librarians began in earnest: "We had been thinking
about a way to try to connect with a university. We've talked with
USC and UCLA. I like the prestige that would come with the university
or an institution like the Getty," says Clayton, the unspoken "but"
as heavy as the humidity in the air. "You just don't know what is
deep in their brain, what they really mean. They just talk about
'having it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The object, though, says Clayton, has always been to share it.</TE>
<TE>   The art of collecting these stories, images and songs involves
more than merely amassing stacks of books and paper. "Collectors are
important," says Bogle, "because their great enthusiasm and great
passion usually puts them way ahead of the curve in the culture in
general." In other words, they find import in castoffs that others
don't value--or even notice. For Clayton, collecting is a way of
retelling a story, passing down a people's history that in her time
had either been skewed or ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd worked at UCLA for 15 years in the law library and was put on
loan to Afro-American studies when they were building that department
in the late '60s," Clayton recalls, carefully balancing herself on a
tall stool behind her book and paper stacks. With a master's in
library science from Vermont's Goddard College and a doctorate in
humanities from now-closed Sierra University in Santa Monica, Clayton
was selected to help. "The advisory committee didn't think that black
students needed retrospective books, history.... " she says. "They
wanted contemporary authors. They only wanted to deal with the
present."</TE>
<TE>   Clayton paid them no mind. She began paging through catalogs,
contacting bookstores that dealt in rare and used books. She began
building a collection that reflected the nuances of the black
experience in America. Those efforts put her in contact with a wide
world of collectors and antiquity experts and inspired her side
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   After resigning from UCLA in the '70s, Clayton took a job at
Universal Books in Hollywood. "They had a huge black book
collection," gushes Clayton like a schoolgirl with a crush. She
expanded the store's holdings and eventually became partner. When the
store hit hard times, the partners divided its inventory, and Clayton
left with "every black book in the store."</TE>
<TE>   Those 4,000 books went into the garage, "and it just kept
snowballing." The Western States Black Research and Educational
Center was born. Clayton got the word out, talking to schools and
civic organizations. She bought film libraries and inherited old
photographs and stows of books or records that people had crammed
into attics or basements. "A grandfather might die and the grandkids
don't know what to do with the stuff. I'd tell 'em, 'I'm happy to
take them.' " Too often, she says, when people die in this
community--entertainers, teachers, athletes, lawyers--their
collections just disappear. Gone. "That story's gone forever."</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Steele, head of the department of special collections in
the Young Research Center at UCLA, knows all about the nature of
ephemera, how easy it is for eras to slip through one's hands. For
some time, she's known of Mayme Clayton and her remarkable collection
and has recently been advising the Claytons. "She's had a very clear
vision for years, and those are the best kind of collectors," says
Steele, but fine collections fueled by such passion and direction are
always difficult to let go of. "It's wrenching to part with something
so personal or that is such a signifier ... but something has to be
done. That smell when you walk into the room, the mildew, that is not
a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Clayton doesn't have to be reminded. She knows it's time. She's
surrounded by evidence of evolution--the cycle of a neighborhood, a
yellowed book, her body. But in thinking about the future, "I just
have to make sure we wouldn't be giving up anything," she explains,
busy over her bankers' box files, searching for the awe-inspiring
curio, another missing link.</TE>
<TE>   What has been remarkable to many is the manner in which Clayton
has more than made do. "Sometimes we get caught up in 'if I don't get
that grant ... I can't do it,' " says Johnie Scott, associate
professor of Pan African studies at Cal State Northridge, who's known
Clayton since his days with the Watts Writers Workshop. "She's a
griot. Literally as well as figuratively. She holds our stories."</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the ancestors were talking to you," says actress and
singer Jenifer Lewis, recalling a recent visit to the collection.
"Even the smell was delicious!" There is energy you get from touching
things that are old. Things that changed humanity. I ain't gonna lie
to you. I couldn't even put a face on slavery, but you come out so
moved. My cells were dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Avery Clayton, 55, knows the effect. He and his younger brothers,
Renai and Lloyd, grew up watching their mother sail in with new
acquisitions and, remarkably, fit them into her ever-burgeoning
stacks. "She'd get a little money and buy a book here and there,"
bits and pieces toward a grander vision. "Our parents instilled a
sense of social purpose," he says. "We would show up at marches with
picket signs, talk about events of the day. In that atmosphere, we
knew about the history."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's why the notion of keeping the artifacts close
by--accessible as, say, a closet or basement--is so important to the
Claytons. They envision a full-service neighborhood center, rather
than shelves in a library or museum collection. Building such a
center, would almost be like having her collection at home. "But,"
says Avery, "you're not ready until you're ready." Avery's presence,
say those close to Clayton, has helped her warm to the notion of
exploring possibilities. "Avery is a trusted and loyal son," says
UCLA's Steele, "whose interest is in line with her own."</TE>
<TE>   And Avery knows what's ahead. First, a feasibility study that
could cost as much as $70,000, he says. They'll need an inventory and
an appraisal. They'll have to move the collection to an interim
facility. And that's just for starters. "Then we can begin looking
for funding."</TE>
<TE>   But the dreaming has already begun. Avery unrolls a drawing of a
building. He smooths it out amid tubes of acrylics and pots of
turpentine on his studio worktable in Altadena. With the eraser tip
of a pencil, he points out the amenities: exhibition rooms, studio
space, a cafe. An engraved marker out front facing Crenshaw
Boulevard, their preferred site, would announce: "The Mayme A.
Clayton Library and Cultural Center."</TE>
<TE>   Avery has his moments of uncertainty. "There are times I think,
who are you to think you can do this?' It's so big. But I remind
myself, she deserves to see this building in her lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   He leans closer to the pencil sketch. The building would be a
cylinder of stucco trimmed in copper. Three stories. "There's the
gift shop, classrooms, a print shop. And of course, the book and
memorabilia collection." Adjacent to it all, there's a garden, full
of shaggy trees and wild with desert succulents. It's right beside
the place, where, just like always, "They can come in and read," says
Clayton, "as much as they want to."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorothy Wong's second-grade students at El Rodeo Elementary in
Beverly Hills had these suggestions and comments on teasing.</LD>
<LD>   * If I were being teased, I would go tell somebody so they could
help me. If nobody were there, I would walk away. I think a person
who teases is very rude and should learn a lesson. (Tyler, 7)</LD>
<LD>   * Sometimes my brother teases me at home. Sometimes my mom fake
teases me. Sometimes I cry, but most of the time I tell an adult. I
will try my best not to tease anyone. (Kara, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * Once someone teased me after I got a haircut. She said my hair
was ugly. I told her that I didn't like what she said to me. I guess
she thought about what I said, because a few days later she told me
she didn't know what she said was mean. (Carly, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * My sister always teases me. I handle it by telling my parents.
Also my friends tease me sometimes. I handle it by telling their
parents. My brother sometimes teases me. I handle it by telling him
to stop. Sometimes my older sister teases me. I handle it by
screaming, "Stop!" (Brodric, 7)</TE>
<TE>   Kathy McNutt's second-grade students at Welby Way Magnet School in
West Hills sent these responses.</TE>
<TE>   * My sister said, "Na-na-na-na-na-na." I didn't chase her because
I needed to do homework. (Rachel, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My neighbor and my sister always tease me. When they call me
stupid, I don't care because I know I am not stupid. (Carol, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * The first time my brother called me a bad word, I said, "Stop
it!" The second time I told my mom, and he got in big trouble.
(Melody, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My big brother made fun of my middle name, which is McNairy. He
called me, "McNairy Canary." Since this was my grandma's maiden name,
I said, "If you want to make fun of your grandma, go ahead!" Then he
stopped. (Kirstyn, 8)</TE>

<HD>Late Bloomer on the Cutting Edge</HD>
<DH>At 40, Rick Owens is receiving accolades usually reserved
for younger designers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Piles of fabric drift across the raw concrete floor like sand dunes,
their flow impeded only by a few spare pieces of furniture, a stuffed
monkey on a pedestal, a skull perched on a lamp and a gleaming black
grand piano. Paint flakes from rough walls in the intriguingly
decaying work space that designer Rick Owens also calls home. In a
trio of disheveled storefronts off Hollywood Boulevard, the designer
lives and works in a seamless aesthetic that melds dingy luxury with
gothic glamour.</LD>
<LD>   Here, behind dusty windows and mysterious gates, is the future of
American fashion. It was so declared by the Council of Fashion
Designers of America, a New York-based trade group that two weeks ago
handed Owens its Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent. Though he's
been working as a designer for nearly 10 years, six under his own
label, it took two New York fashion shows, an endorsement by Vogue
editor Anna Wintour, raves from retailers and celebrities and a few
compelling photos to grab fashion's attention.</LD>
<LD>   As a congratulatory bouquet of lilies scented a corner of his
apartment atelier, Owens still basked in winning the equivalent of a
fashion Oscar. "It was pretty heady," he said. His well-wishers have
included the likes of David Bowie.</LD>
<TE>   "At the beginning I was a little embarrassed," said the designer,
40, of his nomination along with decades-younger Zac Posen, Behnaz
Sarafpour and Peter Som. "I felt I was a little old for that. Like I
was this old vampire with all these other young nominees. But I have
to admit that it's nobody's fault but my own, because I never let
myself be visible until fairly recently."</TE>
<TE>   His potential was obscured by his lifestyle. Owens
matter-of-factly calls himself "a skinny, white, vodka-swilling Goth"
who realized that being drunk every night hindered his progress. His
desire for all-night parties went away when his self-abuse got ugly
some years ago. Now he's a muscled picture of health, and his clothes
are firmly on high fashion's radar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very elegant, but it's street," said Maxfield buyer Sarah
Stewart, who has bought his line for five years and appreciates how
Owens pulls from the gritty side of Hollywood. Though his $500 to
$800 crinkled silk skirts, $1,200 washed leather jackets and $200
overdyed cotton T-shirts have been a fixture at Maxfield, Henri
Bendel in New York and Maria-Luisa in Paris, Owens is the
glamourista's secret.</TE>
<TE>   That changed just a year ago, when he signed with Eo Bocci
Associates, a Turin-based sales agency that has arranged his
manufacturing at a nearby family-run factory, Olmar and Mirta, and
within a year boosted his distribution from 10 stores to 90,
including Barneys New York. "If it took a while, it was only my own
natural reticence," he said, while settling into a lunch of salmon
and buttered bread at Les Deux Cafes, the Hollywood hot spot that
faces his studio and is operated by his muse and partner of 13 years,
Michele Lamy, who is 17 years his senior.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there were people who were interested, but they didn't
detect a level of commitment in me," he said. Now he spends weeks at
a time in the remote Italian village of Concordia, overseeing
production and designing until midnight. "I'm taking it super
seriously," he said. "This is life and death for me."</TE>
<TE>   He knew that showing in New York would be like stepping over a
divide. "I was intimidated by the whole lifestyle issues it
entailed," said Owens, dressed in his signature shadow-gray tank top,
overdyed slashed pants and high-tops.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you start, you can never stop. You're looking at this
financial burden for the rest of your life." Worse, he sacrificed a
contained life that he called idyllic. Working and living across Las
Palmas Avenue from Lamy's restaurant has helped create a comfortable
nucleus that includes Lamy; her ex-husband and business partner,
filmmaker Richard Newton; and their daughter, Scarlett Rouge Newton,
20.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very family-oriented," said friend Anne Crawford, an L.A.
publicist. "When he's here, his time is really precious. He'll be at
the restaurant every night because that is kind of their cafeteria,
and that's their family time."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see Owens as a gentle, shy artist, but that image is
incomplete. He's also the provocateur who grins when he shows you a
self-portrait that he sent to several publications as his press
portrait. It shows a naked Owens urinating toward a kneeling man.
That was just one picture that he sent as an introduction to
photographer Annie Leibovitz, who later shot him for a Vogue photo
essay. The other showed him in bed with the scoliosis-afflicted dwarf
transvestite Goddess Bunny.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are a little too prim, I get impatient," he said.
"And there's something wonderfully adolescent and rebellious about
doing things like that."</TE>
<TE>   The self-described late bloomer has lived a fantasy bohemian life
that once had him and Lamy living at Chateau Marmont. In his 20s, he
sported a nose ring, got his first tattoos and lived like a squatter
in a Culver City warehouse space that was reachable only by ladder.
"I was so delusional in those days," he says with a measure of
disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long journey from Porterville, a town of 30,000 north
of Bakersfield where Owens was the only child of a social worker
father, John, now 86, and a teacher's aide mother, Connie, 70. After
high school, Owens studied painting for almost two years beginning in
1979 at the Otis Parsons Art Institute in L.A. He learned pattern
making at Trade Tech College. He spent six years applying those
skills in the garment district, including two years for Lamy, a
former defense lawyer who was a clothing designer when they met. Now
he draws for pleasure, or to sketch a new collection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a personal thing doing painting and stuff," he says of
his decision to abandon fine art. "It would have been hard to, like,
hustle that. I can totally hustle clothes."</TE>
<TE>   To create what he calls "vintage clothes, but from what planet?"
Owens cultivates living fashion history. He's a regular visitor to
the home of Eleanor Lambert, 98, a pioneer New York fashion
publicist. And when he lunches with famed couturier James Galanos,
Owens admits to pumping him for stories.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of history in everything that I do," he said.
"Since my clothes are autobiographical, there is a certain element of
dissolution. There's always a bit of naughty and nice that makes
things a little more realistic."</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual to find an unfinished hem on an item that might
also sport a French seam that hides raw edges. "People say I'm edgy
or rough," he said, "but everything I do is sort of classical. It's
almost textbook." With their intricate drapes, folds and delicate
seams, his clothes seem like sensual modern togas. Unlike many
designer neophytes who jumped into today's asymmetrical silhouettes,
Owens' abstractions fit.</TE>
<TE>   "The clothes are sexy," said Ed Burstell, vice president of
Bendel, where Owens is a top-selling designer. "And they are
extremely flattering to different body types."</TE>
<TE>   Owens' clothes are different because they're not made for an
18-year-old supermodel. "I'm making clothes for people of my
generation. I'm 40, and I think my clientele is 40 and around there.
They're not completely starry-eyed," he said. "I like those really
strong, sensitive, artsy women in their 40s and early 50s." And he
knows that they still like to impress their husbands, without
resorting to tawdriness: "I think my clientele can look sexy without
looking ridiculous." As proof, there's Lamy in two gray-toned tank
tops over a flowing white silk skirt topped with a washed leather
jacket that fits like a second skin.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in his clothes day and night, she personifies Owens'
philosophy of timeless clothing. Crawford, the friend and publicist,
once asked Lamy what she wore to the beach. "Rick Owens," came the
answer. "But I didn't know he made swimwear," Crawford replied. He
doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like out of a Fellini movie," Crawford said. "She'll emerge
out of the water in a full-length dress with the train dragging in
the sand." Lamy wears the clothes wherever she happens to be, as
other women do jeans and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Both Owens and his muse understand the importance of the dramatic
gesture, the commitment to living life as an ongoing artistic
enterprise. That shiny black grand piano is not only the sole
important, grown-up piece of furniture in their living quarters; it's
a symbol of the kind of cultured, educated life that inspires both of
them. Neither one can play a note.</TE>

<HD>Fatherhood That Goes Beyond a Blood Bond</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today won't be much of a Father's Day for the man known in court
papers as Thomas G. The little boy who calls him dad will be off on a
visit with his mother.</LD>
<LD>   But it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. His Father's
Day gift came 10 days ago, when the California Supreme Court declared
him the father of a 6-year-old, to whom he is related not by marriage
or blood, but only by history and love.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling decrees that a man who takes on the role of a father
can be considered a legal dad, even if he is not the biological
father and is not married to the child's mother, and even if Mom
doesn't want him around.</LD>
<TE>   What that means for Thomas and Nicholas--the boy he considers his
son--is that life will go on pretty much as it has. There'll be
baseball practices, summer camp, evenings working in the yard. Thomas
will try to plan a vacation. Nick will try to make good on his
Father's Day's gift--promises to "grow plants, clean my room, water
the yard."</TE>
<TE>   What the case means for the rest of us is just as simple: Common
sense won this time.</TE>
<TE>   The facts in the case are straightforward, the participants fairly
ordinary. Here is what their court file says:</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly was already pregnant with Nicholas when she and Thomas
met and moved in together. The biological father was not around.
Thomas was there when the baby was born and was listed on his birth
certificate as the father. When the couple split up a few years
later, Thomas moved to Northern California but continued to pay bills
and visit.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in December 1999, the two fought over plans for a Christmas
Day visit. Kimberly bit Thomas, he called police and she was taken to
jail. Thomas took Nicholas, then 4, back to Alameda County to live
with him. A court there granted him custody, but a month later
Kimberly showed up and complained that Thomas was not the real dad
and thus had no right to raise her son.</TE>
<TE>   The case flopped back and forth in court for years, while Nicholas
remained with Thomas. He had regular visits with his mom, but she was
not allowed to keep him because of her "drug use, transiency, lack of
gainful employment and violence toward others."</TE>
<TE>   Social workers wanted him to stay with Thomas, the only father
he'd ever known, and lawyers for the boy concurred. But the Alameda
County Social Services Agency objected, concerned that granting
paternal rights to Thomas would unleash a flood of claims from
meddling would-be dads.</TE>
<TE>   That seems like a ludicrous concern. Considering the effort we
make to corral deadbeat dads and the money we spend on foster care
for the thousands of kids of drug-addict moms, we ought to have a
welcome mat out for a man like Thomas, who's willing to take on the
job of volunteer dad.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' lawyer Franklin Free handles custody cases from all over
the state, "and I can't say I've noticed a lot of guys lurking around
the courthouse, looking for an opportunity to take responsibility for
children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, any man so inclined might be deterred by Thomas' story.
He spent three years, and close to $50,000 on legal fees and
expenses, in his fight for parental status. He lost his telemarketing
business, and his truck was repossessed. He went to work selling cars
and had to move back home with his mom in Lakewood. "I went from
making six figures and driving a car worth $50,000," he said, "to
having a $3,000 car and renting a house.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times when I had to sit down with my mom and my dad
and talk to them about it. They encouraged me to do what I felt was
right. So if for the next 10 years I was broke, that's a sacrifice I
was willing to make. I could always make more money. But I could
never get back what I might miss, if I lost my son."</TE>
<TE>   It might have been easier to drop the fight. It wasn't his kid,
after all, and staying involved with Nicholas ensured that Kimberly
would remain a thorn in his side. Walking away would have taken him
off the hook and dovetailed neatly with what we believe about
unmarried fathers--men who tend to cut and run and leave the county
to raise the kids.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas may reflect the changing face of fatherhood. A recent
national study of low-income families found that young fathers,
married or not, are more involved with their young children than
conventional wisdom suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to focus on the men who are not involved in their
children's lives, not paying child support ... and that leads to a
lot of stereotypes," said New York University professor Katherine
Tamif-LeMonda, who helped conduct the research as part of an
evaluation of the federal program known as Early Head Start.</TE>
<TE>   "What we find when we go into these families is that ... 90% [of
kids younger than 3] have a father figure in their lives,"
Tamif-LeMonda said. "There's the stereotype of the deadbeat dad ...
but there's an incredible investment and commitment by many of these
men. They're bathing them, they're reading to them, they're changing
diapers....They're doing the things that we tend to relate to
mothers."</TE>
<TE>   Today, with almost one-third of all children born to unmarried
women, we all have a stake in encouraging fathers, boyfriends, even
ex-boyfriends to step up to the plate. And, judging from a flurry of
recent court rulings helping to reshape the definition of fatherhood,
legal standing for them may be on the way.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take the court's decree to convince Thomas G. that
fatherhood does not rest on paternity. He has known that since he was
a child, thanks to the man that he calls dad.</TE>
<TE>   "My stepfather wasn't concerned with biology," he said. "He loved
my mom and was willing to take on the responsibility of the two kids
she brought into the relationship."</TE>
<TE>   His father is the man who took him camping, bought his dirt bikes,
taught him how to water ski and encouraged him to keep fighting for
his son when the struggle seemed discouraging.</TE>
<TE>   Now as Thomas tucks Nick into bed, takes him to his Cub Scout
meetings, cheers him on at baseball games, he is teaching his son
that same lesson ... that love transcends biology.</TE>

<LD>Big Fish, Go Fish</LD>
<LD>   There was Go Fish, Ping-Pong Pop, Rubber-Ducky Dash and stars
everywhere on the rolling lawns of Ken Roberts' 112-acre Mandeville
Canyon estate last Sunday, but this was no ordinary charity carnival:
Target a Time for Heroes raised nearly $2 million for the Elizabeth
Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Delivered by an armada of shuttle buses, the more than 2,000
guests (adults $1,000, kids $250) started arriving before noon to
hear stories read by Tom Cruise ("Where the Wild Things Are"),
Patrick Stewart and Anjelica Huston, among others; try their luck at
game booths operated by the likes of Mary Steenburgen, Ted Danson,
Jennifer Connelly, Lisa Kudrow and David Copperfield; and get tips
from pro athletes, including skateboarder Tony Hawk and figure skater
Scott Hamilton.</LD>
<TE>   Kids big and little wove their way through the grounds, from the
Hollywood makeover station to the "Survivor Hut." For armchair
athletes, there was a temporary-tattoo parlor (the Lakers' logo was a
hot item); photo ops with the stars and specialties prepared by chefs
from 26 premium eateries. No Slurpees, popcorn or cotton candy here.
The bill o' fare was strictly L.A. groove: quesadillas, fresh
seafood, designer salads, gourmet pizzas and mega-calorie desserts.</TE>
<TE>   The carnival, which was underwritten by Target, drew on the labor
of 200-plus volunteers. A number of HIV-positive youngsters from Camp
Heartland in Malibu and their families were guests at the event.</TE>
<TE>   It's been 14 years since the foundation was started by three moms,
Susan DeLaurentis, Susie Zeegen and Glaser, who died from AIDS in
1994. It now has 150 sites worldwide that focus on the prevention and
treatment of life-threatening childhood illnesses. "Around the world,
800,000 children are infected with HIV every year," said Kate Carr,
CEO of the foundation. "The problem is ready to explode in India and
Russia. Sadly, there are still 200 new cases every year in the United
States and that number is not decreasing. We need to spread the
prevention message."</TE>
<TE>   Echoing that plea were AIDS activist Florence Ngobeni of
Johannesburg, South Africa; and Dr. David Kessler, dean of Yale
School of Medicine and former FDA commissioner, who chairs the
foundation board. "We now have the drugs to prevent the transmission
of HIV from a mother to a child," Kessler said. "For a few dollars,
we can give a drug to a newborn and prevent HIV, but the challenge is
the lack of infrastructure in the developing countries to deliver the
drugs. That's why we cannot rest until pediatric AIDS is eradicated."</TE>

<TE>   Icon Awards</TE>
<TE>   Two individuals who characterize the mantra of the UCLA Center on
Aging, "Live Better Longer," were honored at the center's annual
gala: Hugh Downs, former anchor of ABC's "20/20," and philanthropist
Robert Ahmanson received the 2002 Icon Award.</TE>
<TE>   Downs, an Emmy Award winner and author of nine books, has had a
broadcasting career spanning more than 60 years. Ahmanson, who heads
the Ahmanson Foundation, is a dedicated UCLA alumnus and benefactor.
Before approaching the mike to accept the award from past Icon
awardee, Art Linkletter, Ahmanson got some unsolicited advice. "Don't
try to be funny. You're not a comedian," warned a friend, humorist
Stan Freberg. With typical modesty, Ahmanson took heed and kept it
brief. "I'm told I was supposed to be on from 9:04 to 9:07, It's now
9:20. So thank you very much," he said, and exited. It brought down
the house.</TE>
<TE>   Downs, who teaches at the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication
at Arizona State University, received his award from his grandson,
Cameron Black, an MBA candidate at ASU. "In a curious role reversal,
Cameron is now my mentor," Downs said. "He has been a potent force in
helping me to avoid backwatering myself into some stagnant channel of
accumulated years."</TE>
<TE>   Timothy J. Noonan chaired the black-tie event June 8 at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceutica Products,
which raised $355,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among those in the crowd of more than 450 were UCLA Chancellor
Albert Carnesale and his wife, Robin; Gigi and Gary Small; Mimi
Perloff; Barbara and Hugh Smith; Roberta Haft; Mickey and Joe Wapner;
Nanette Fabray; Shelley Fabares; Bronya and Andrew Galef; and Gail
and Gerald Oppenheimer.</TE>

<TE>   Power Play</TE>
<TE>   Beholding rare Chinese artifacts such as a 2,000-year-old jade
burial shroud, supporters of the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in
Santa Ana previewed its new exhibit, "Symbols of Power: Masterpieces
from the Nanjing Museum," at a gala benefit that raised $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   About 350 guests enjoyed a champagne reception in the museum lobby
before touring the exhibit, which runs until next spring. It features
250 objects, including 50 gilt buddhas from the Forbidden City, an
edict from a Chinese emperor inscribed upon a solid gold tablet,
ancient currency, fine porcelain, religious objects and an emperor's
silk robe.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a representation of 5,000 years of Chinese history on an
Imperial level," museum President Peter Keller said. "Until the
Chinese capital was moved to Beijing, the Nanjing was the national
museum of China."</TE>
<TE>   After the June 8 preview, guests were led by dancing Chinese
dragons to the museum's tree-studded courtyard, where they dined
alfresco on duck with plum sauce and chocolate mint cake. Anne Shih
was gala chairwoman; co-chairwomen were Sheila Mann and Jan Wilhelm.</TE>

<TE>   Breath of Life</TE>
<TE>   Displaying courage beyond her years, 15-year-old Stacy Motenko
stood in front of 425 guests at the Cystic Fibrosis Guild's annual
black-tie gala and told them about the challenges of living with the
disease. And then the student at Capistrano Valley High School
challenged them to see her as a wholesome individual despite her
illness.</TE>
<TE>   "Cystic fibrosis is what I have--not who I am," she told guests at
the June 8 event that netted $442,000 for research and patient care.</TE>
<TE>   During the festivities at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel in
Anaheim, the teenager presented the Breath of Life Award to her
parents, Debbie and Paul Motenko, her grandparents, Harold and Adele
Motenko, and her aunt and uncle, Mickey and Gail Isen, for their
ongoing efforts to raise funds to help find a cure for cystic
fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   "Stacy has the dreams of every teen," said Paul Motenko, one of
two chief executive officers of Chicago Pizza &amp; Brewery. "We're
committed to making them come true."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Hook was gala chairwoman.</TE>

<TE>   Members of the President's Century Circle, the highest support

on the grounds of the soon-to-open Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation president Richard M. Ferry and his wife, Maude, hosted
the June 4 event recognizing members who have donated a minimum of
$10,000 annually for the foundation's programs to aid needy students
in the 278 schools in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. More than 5,000
disadvantaged children received scholarships this year, and $5
million has been allotted for 5,698 tuition awards for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Rogelio Duenas, a recent graduate of L.A.'s Cathedral High School,
whose education was financed by the foundation, was a special guest.
College-bound with the hope of attending medical school, Duenas
expressed his gratitude for the help he received. "At Cathedral, the
teachers cared about me and became my second family," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those attending: Helen and Bill Close, Bette and Ray Rodeno,
Margot and Thomas Barron, Silvia and Kevin Dretzka, Stanley Hayden,
Susana and Bill Houston, Kathleen McCarthy, Laura and Bill Siart,
Patty and Nicholas Weber, Christine Cronin and Mark Hurst, and Jill

<LD>A long time ago--so long ago that bubble gum had not yet been
invented--a farmer found something wonderful growing in his garden.
"Look!" Mr. Jones called to his family. "I grew this new food, and I
just tasted it. It's delicious and nutritious, but it has no name."</LD>
<LD>   "It's good to look at," said his wife. "I like the red color."</LD>
<LD>   "It's good to eat too," Mr. Jones said. "It's so delicious that
every time I take a bite, it makes me feel good all the way down from
my head to my toes."</LD>
<TE>   "Let me try," Mrs. Jones said, reaching down into the garden. She
smiled. "My, my, this one is nice and round, just like yours."</TE>
<TE>   "Just go ahead and taste it," her husband urged.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Jones took a large bite. Her face beamed. "I like it! You're
right. It's delicious. It makes me feel good all the way down from my
head to my toes."</TE>
<TE>   The farmer nodded. "But what shall we call it? This new food needs
a good name."</TE>
<TE>   They thought and thought but neither one could think of anything.
Then their son reached into the garden. "Let me try one," Junior
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. and Mrs. Jones watched him take a big bite. "Do you like it?"
they asked.</TE>
<TE>   Junior grinned. "I sure do!"</TE>
<TE>   "It made me feel good all the way down from my head to my toes,"
Mrs. Jones said. "Did it work that way for you too?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Junior. "Just like you, it made me feel good all the
way down from my head to my toes. And so now I think I have a good
name for it."</TE>
<TE>   "What?" asked his mother and father. "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Tomatoes," said Junior.</TE>
<TE>   So that's the way "tomatoes" got their name.</TE>

<AU>GIOCONDA BELLI</AU>
<BD>Gioconda Belli is a Nicaraguan poet and novelist who
lives in Santa Monica.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lawn in front of Columbia University's domed library is filled
with families anxiously awaiting the start of the 2002 commencement
ceremonies. When the band begins to play and the river of young men
and women pours down the stairs on both sides of the central plaza
for the traditional procession around the campus, everybody stands.
We are all trying to find the familiar face of a son, a daughter or a
friend beneath the graduation caps.</LD>
<LD>   It is a beautiful day in New York, sunny and breezy, and around me
people are beaming with joy and anticipation. I stand on my chair as
I see many other mothers do. I want to be certain to see my son as he
walks by amid the flowing robes of his graduating peers. I tell
myself I won't fail to recognize him, although the identical caps and
gowns somehow erase differences. I am looking for my son's grin of
happiness in every passing face.</LD>
<LD>   I am Nicaraguan. Camilo's father is Brazilian. But my son looks
like an Irishman: red-haired, freckled, fair-skinned. When we first
came to the U.S., people assumed he could understand them, although
he couldn't speak a word of English.</LD>
<TE>   We finally see him and shout his name; his face lights up and he
waves to us. The procession ends with the graduates taking a seat in
the center of the campus plaza.</TE>
<TE>   But as beautiful as the day is, as much as I want to dwell on the
satisfaction I derive from looking at my son, I can't stop thinking
of the changed world in which he will begin his adult life. From
where I sit, I can see a policeman's silhouette on the roof of the
library. I see the shadows of uniformed guards keeping watch from
behind windows in the campus buildings around us. Helicopters fly
overhead several times during the ceremony. I think most of us are
aware that these promising young men and women could be targeted,
that their loss would hurt, not only the United States but many
countries around the world. I cringe at the thought as much as I
cringe at the fact that I am harboring this fear in a place where,
until Sept. 11, it would have seemed paranoid to think that someone
would want to cause harm.</TE>
<TE>   They seem--for this moment, at least--unaware of the uncertainty.
As the graduates go up on the stage to receive their Columbia pins,
those who wait their turn throw a colorful ball in the air. They are
restless, getting up from their seats, walking to the back to greet
family or friends, talking among themselves. Beneath their gowns,
many wear jeans, their feet in sandals, sneakers, even flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they are not simply the class of 2002: They are also the
first post-Sept. 11 graduates, the class of Sept. 12. Like my son,
many of these kids probably volunteered in the days after the World
Trade Center tragedy, packing and distributing food to the rescue
workers. All, no doubt, were deeply affected by the horror and
proximity.</TE>
<TE>   I am sure they realize they are going into an uncertain world. I
am less sure we have prepared them for their role in it. Being part
of the intellectual elite of this sole remaining--and now
besieged--superpower carries responsibilities made perfectly apparent
by the events of last fall. But in this era of educational
specialization, how many of them have acquired broad knowledge of
world history and geography?</TE>
<TE>   When I came to the U.S. to attend school, most of my
classmates--in college-level courses--couldn't have found Nicaragua
on a map. Bananas and witch doctory were the two things my country
seemed to bring to mind. This is a country where many people consider
acquiring knowledge about the world at large to be a choice, not a
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Three of my children have now gone to school in the U.S., and I've
noticed that most of the emphasis has been on familiarizing them with
the different U.S. cultures--Native American, African, Latin
American--so they will be more accepting of the ethnic and racial
diversity within their own society. If my son had not chosen history
as his major at Columbia, I don't know how much real knowledge of the
world beyond our borders he would have received.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the decisive role that the U.S. plays in the lives of
millions of people around the globe, it disturbs me to see how little
instruction young people get about the historical and geographical
background against which the U.S. government carries on its foreign
policy. The traditional focus on European and American history must
be broadened to include the Third World. Given its importance in the
shape of things to come, understanding the Third World will be
crucial to understanding the world's challenges, dangers and hopes. I
hope powerful nations will come to grips with the fact that they have
accumulated most of the wealth of this planet. I hope they will come
to realize that the social, ecological and demographic consequences
of this gross inequality are eventually going to threaten everybody's
survival.</TE>
<TE>   Our younger generations will have to learn a different meaning for
the concept of self-interest and realize it is very much in our
interest not to simply think of our own kind in the world. It might
mean they won't be as carefree as they are now, that their sense of
entitlement will be measured in terms of their compassion and sense
of social responsibility, that they will have to bring forth a new
ethical standard of coexistence.</TE>
<TE>   As for now, here they are, exuberant and joyful. Many of them have
not yet had time to think of a future beyond this day. But tomorrow
they will take their place at the helm of this chariot that is our
planet, and I dare to hope, as a mother, that against all odds
they'll do a better job than we have.</TE>

<KH>U.S. ECONOMY</KH>
<HD>No Light at the End of the Tunnel</HD>
<DH>What if continued public spending and large-scale deficits
slow the recovery?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>David Friedman, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the U.S. economy is growing at anything like the 5.6% annual clip
reported last quarter, why are U.S. stock markets sagging and
economic confidence still shaky? Corporate accounting skulduggery and
fear of terrorist attacks are commonly cited reasons. But the real
problem is more fundamental: Nobody seems to know how the economy
will generate new and sustained wealth. Currently, the most
bureaucratic and least productive sectors--government, health-care,
social and education services--are driving the economy, while
entrepreneurial industries and manufacturing languish. In the absence
of at least a plausible fantasy about the "next big thing" that will
ignite the private economy, many investors are understandably
uncertain about what the public sector's accelerating expansion means
for our economic future.</LD>
<TE>   During the 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. economy transformed
itself from an aging, uncompetitive has-been into a beehive of
industrial ingenuity as large companies split up into more
entrepreneurial units. After the recession in the early 1990s, the
Internet and the newly emergent "digital age" reinvigorated the
industrial transformation. To be sure, new-economy hype and Wall
Street excess eventually masked the nation's more fundamental
economic development. For years, however, U.S. entrepreneurial
creativity and highly effective industrial reorganization were the
engines of wealth creation. From 1994 to 1998, nearly 12 million jobs
were created. About 4.6 million of them were in goods-producing
sectors--manufacturing, construction, business services and trade.
Government, health-care, social and education services added just 2.4
million jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually none of these trends, nor any newer, more promising
ones, can be discerned in today's economy. Over the last four years,
wealth-producing manufacturing, business services, construction and
trade industries steadily declined, losing more than 700,000 jobs.
Manufacturing employment alone fell by 11%, the sector's second-worst
decline since 1939. Business services, which produced 2.3 million
jobs from 1994 to 1998, rose by only 800,000 from 1998 to 2002,
roughly matching the expansion in education, social services and
health care.</TE>
<TE>   But wealth-consuming sectors--government, state-supported social
and education services, health care--grew even more rapidly from 1998
to 2002 despite the most recent recession. These sectors added more
than by 3.2 million jobs, one-third more than from 1994 to 1998, and
constituted 60% of U.S. total employment growth. If growth in retail
employment is factored in, an astonishing 80% of total U.S. job
growth since 1998 has been in wealth-consuming sectors, compared with
just 35% from 1994 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   These trends show few signs of abating. In the last quarter,
government and related services added 220,000 jobs, while
manufacturing, construction and business services shed 300,000. So
that first-quarter report of 5.6% annual growth is a bit misleading.
Aside from the fact that such reports tend to magnify any one
quarter's performance, the nation's seemingly robust growth mainly
reflected the continuing expansion of public and closely aligned
sectors.</TE>
<TE>   All this undercuts more hopeful interpretations of some recent
economic developments. The U.S. manufacturing decline, for example,
is often downplayed as natural. As countries mature, goes the
argument, they shift from making widgets to designing software. This
change may inconvenience workers in the doomed sectors, but, over
time, they will find more rewarding jobs and benefit from cheap,
high-quality imports or products churned out by automated factories.</TE>
<TE>   Such beliefs were plausible in 1994-1998, when business-service
employment was booming. As millions of jobs in technically demanding
work--programming computers, setting up communications systems, for
example--were created, business services offset slower growth or job
losses in manufacturing. Economists even debated whether such
services should be reclassified to reflect their productive role in
the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But when manufacturing went into a tailspin in the later 1990s,
the business-service growth that powered the healthiest phases of the
decade's boom slowed too. Rather than supplant manufacturing,
business-service enterprises depended on healthy factories, which,
after all, were among their biggest clients.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, service-sector expansion began shifting from the
private to the public. In 1994-98, engineering, management, film and
business services, all of which are private-sector wealth-producing
activities, accounted for more than half of the growth in U.S.
service employment. During the next four years, however, they
generated just one-third of total service growth. Personal services,
such as cutting hair, grew more rapidly instead.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine how service-sector expansion can play a role
in wealth creation if growth in, say, manicurists exceeds that of
engineers. Currently, growth in service jobs appears to be
increasingly dependent on government spending, a connection not
normally correlated with sustainable wealth creation.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is also suffering from nervousness about the public
sector's fiscal solvency. The dramatic expansion of state and local
government jobs and functions over the last few years has already
produced billions of dollars of red ink. The federal budget may soon
follow suit, depending on its response to last year's terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Government pump-priming during economic slowdowns is hardly new.
But the current government spending spree is unusual in both its
scope and longevity. Most states, like California, did little to
limit spending even when the stock-market bubble that was financing
their budgets had clearly popped. And they continue to create
hundreds of thousands of government jobs, most of which are subject
to stringent civil-service protections and strong representation by
public-employee unions. Today's public-sector expansion may be
permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Government planners hope that the private economy will soon
recover, allowing tax revenues to rise and pay for all this public
expansion. But what if it doesn't? What if continued public spending,
and possibly large-scale deficits, slow the recovery?</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of examples of public spending burdens crippling
highflying economies. Japan's high-growth period, for example, was
once the envy of the world but stalled in the early 1990s when the
nation's real estate bubble abruptly burst. The Japanese government
repeatedly tried to spend its way into a recovery, but only succeeded
in amassing a huge public deficit. Remarkably enough, some analysts
now worry that Japan, like Argentina and Russia, might even default
on its debt.</TE>
<TE>   No one has suggested that the U.S. economy is heading toward
anything like a similar fiscal meltdown. Yet neither has anyone
painted a picture of how growth in the public sector shall lead us
into a new era of sustained prosperity when the manufacturing economy
is rapidly declining.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the potential new sources of economic vitality seem
longshots, at best. Biotechnology, for example, seems years from
making a significant commercial impact. Older, once-appealing
theories of economic expansion are even less compelling. Few, for
example, still openly tout, let alone believe in, the wild-eyed
claims once made about digital-age prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   Until U.S. economic growth is more balanced and its emerging
public finance challenge more manageable, it's likely that our
economic prospects will fail to fire investors' and consumers'
enthusiasm. An expanding public sector may be necessary at a time of
global terrorism. We'll soon learn whether it also can choke off the
economic development necessary for sustained prosperity.</TE>

<HD>The War on Football</HD>
<DH>Some feminists say it's killing off less popular men's
sports on college campuses. But the real culprit is Title IX.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GAVORA</AU>
<BD>Jessica Gavora is the author of "Tilting the Playing
Field: Schools, Sports, Sex and Title IX."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Today, 30 years after Title IX outlawed sex discrimination in
education, the number of men's college sports teams done in by
"gender equity" is depressingly large. A few recent sacrifices:
Howard University, with a 60% female student body but "only" a 30%
female roster of athletes, recently killed baseball and wrestling.
Bucknell dropped wrestling and men's crew. Bowling Green State
University eliminated men's swimming, men's tennis and men's track
and field. The University of Vermont, Tulane and Bowling Green all
eliminated men's track but kept women's. The Universities of Iowa,
Nebraska and Kansas eliminated their male swimmers and divers but
continue to fund the women with whom the men used to share facilities
and road trips.</LD>
<LD>   Unquestionably, women have achieved much in the 30 years Title IX
has been on the books. Once unwelcome interlopers, girls and women
now make up just under 40% of high school and college athletes. And
although Title IX surely played a role in this progress for women,
the sacrifice of men's teams to fill a federally imposed gender quota
has been the law's most obvious accomplishment.As a result, pro-quota
women's activists are desperately looking for ways to change the
subject. Their latest tactic is to return to an old grudge most of us
thought the women's movement had left behind decades ago: the war on
football.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not Title IX's fault, it's chicken college presidents and
athletic directors who won't bite the bullet on the irresponsible
spending of their football programs," Women's Sports Foundation
Executive Director Donna Lopiano said recently of cuts to men's
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The logic--such as it is--of sports-gender bean counters like
Lopiano holds that football, for schools that have it, is the fat man
tipping the canoe of gender equity in college sports. With rosters
approaching 100 players and scholarship limits three and four times
higher than other sports, football programs make Title IX's mandate
of reaching "proportionality" much more difficult. Schools struggling
to match female athletic participation with female enrollment find
they have to have four or five women's teams just to "make up" for
the numbers that football adds to the male side of the athletic
ledger. Many schools offer the maximum number of scholarships in each
sport played by women in their conference and still can't match the
number of men who turn out--many of whom never even get a chance to
play--on the gridiron each Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Big-time college football may be complacent and uncaring, but is
it responsible for losses in men's collegiate athletics? Most
participants in men's minor sports don't think so. They understand
that the phenomenon that wins the multimillion-dollar television
contracts and fills the stands every Sunday at Notre Dame, Michigan,
North Carolina and Nebraska also pays the bills for
nonrevenue-generating men's--and women's--teams. The National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. reports that the average Division I-A
football program cleared $3.8 million in profit after expenses in
1999. Women's sports teams at the same schools, meanwhile, lost an
average of $2.3 million per school.</TE>
<TE>   Not all football programs make money, but those that do are the
most successful in creating what Title IX activists claim they want:
more athletic opportunities for women. Colleges and universities that
belong to conferences with big-time football and basketball
television contracts and bowl games--powerhouses like Iowa, Minnesota
and Florida--field the largest and most diverse women's sports
programs. Schools with less-successful men's programs have fewer
female athletes relative to male athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Title IX's reverberations are being felt everywhere.
Marquette University eliminated its wrestling team this year,
something officials there say they did to comply with the law's
mandate that the percentages of women and men who play athletics
match the percentages of women and men in the student body. The
blame-football-first crowd can't pin this one on its usual scapegoat:
Marquette has no football team.</TE>
<TE>   Caught between higher education's love of football's money-making
potential and its loathing of the wrath of the women's lobby are
men's so-called "nonrevenue" sports. Less popular sports like
wrestling, men's gymnastics, track and swimming are hemorrhaging
teams under Title IX. Their losses have been so great--the number of
collegiate wrestling programs has been cut in half--that
organizations representing coaches from wrestling, gymnastics, track
and field and swimming have joined in a lawsuit against the
Department of Education challenging the current interpretation of
Title IX. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington
earlier this year argues that Title IX quotas are discriminatory
against men.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the big guys--football and men's basketball--have
stayed on the sidelines, surveying the carnage and cynically
calculating that Title IX cuts will never affect them.</TE>
<TE>   But whether you are pro football or con football, there is one
undeniable fact in the debate over Title IX: No amount of cutting the
fat from football will make girls and women any more willing to turn
out for sports in the same numbers as boys and men.</TE>
<TE>   It takes nothing away from female athletes to acknowledge that
women as a group are less willing than men to play college sports
without being offered a scholarship or without an assurance they will
get in the game to play. For now at least, men are much more willing
to "walk on" to teams without a scholarship--a practice that adds
little to a school's expenses but a lot to the men's side of their
Title IX ledger.</TE>
<TE>   With men more apt to turn out to play, scholarship or no,
virtually every college and university today is forced to limit the
number of athletes men's teams can accept. Women's teams, in
contrast, are given incentives to recruit and retain as many players
as possible. The result is that women's squad sizes are typically
smaller than men's--it takes 18 scholarships to produce the average
21-woman track and field squad, whereas 32 men will come out to
collect 12.6 scholarships for the average men's team. NCAA schools
offer about 600 more teams for women than for men, and still male
collegiate athletes outnumber females by about 50,000. It has little
to do with football and everything to do with differences between
women and men--differences feminists would rather try to legislate
away than acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Football isn't killing men's sports; a twisted interpretation of
Title IX is. For too long, federal officials have at worst encouraged
and at best turned a blind eye to systematic injustices perpetrated
under Title IX. Ending this injustice will not close doors for girls
and women in education, it will ensure that the door to equal
opportunity stays open for another 30 years.</TE>

<HD>No More Reform, Please</HD>
<DH>Secession, now boroughs. Why not see  if the new charter
works?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>XANDRA KAYDEN</AU>
<BD>Xandra Kayden is a senior fellow at the UCLA School of
Public Policy and Social Research.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles is processing political reform like a Cuisinart with a
broken pause button. In response to calls to overhaul city
government, L.A. citizens worked hard to revive a more than
75-year-old governmental structure that many felt had lapsed into a
political coma. It took three years to write and adopt a new charter,
and its implementation has been underway for less than two years.
Among the City Charter's innovative features are neighborhood
councils, which give residents a more direct voice in the affairs of
their communities. The secessionists, as expected, were not placated
by any of this, and the Hollywood and Valley clans successfully got
their proposed divorce on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes a third way--boroughs. One proposal would give an
appointed commission a set of guidelines and charge its members with
coming up with a borough scheme. Another plan, put together by former
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, arrives fully formed. Both
proposals only surfaced after it became clear that secession will be
voted on, and neither, so far, has made it to the ballot as an
alternative to busting up the city. For that to happen, the City
Council would have to agree.</LD>
<TE>   But wait a minute. Los Angeles has been reforming itself for
nearly a decade (Remember the Christopher Commission?). Why rush to
reform the city again when we barely have reform in place? Thomas
Jefferson called for revolution every 20 years. We have at least
another decade to go before we should start all over again.</TE>
<TE>   The boroughs concept was an idea in the original charter but was
never implemented. The provision was deleted from the charter in the
early 1970s. Both charter reform commissions considered a borough
system but rejected it in favor of neighborhood councils.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, boroughs, or something resembling them, may have a place in a
city like Los Angeles. Hertzberg has been interested in governmental
reform for years and is an effective tinkerer. Yet there's a touch of
irony in his desire to save the city from the secessionists. The
Valley legislator, more than anyone else, moved the secession option
along by pushing through a bill that took away the City Council's
veto of secession attempts, arranged for state funding that made the
secession studies possible and enormously strengthened the Local
Agency Formation Commission that oversees proposed breakaways.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg's solution to what he facilitated--as detailed as his
borough system is--still constitutes as radical a departure as
secession. For starters, his plan would eliminate the City Council,
and its use of part-time politicians would be a nightmare for the
city Ethics Commission. One reason resources never seem to go where
they are most needed is political expediency. Rather than allocate
funds according to need and argue over whose need is greater, it is
more collegial to divide the money by districts: five at the county
level, 15 at the city. That way, politicians don't have to fight with
each other over issues that really matter. If we use population as
the basis and divide by nine--the number of boroughs proposed by
Hertzberg--what about need?</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, there is a borough-like alternative embedded in the
neighborhood-council system the new charter created. The Department
of Neighborhood Empowerment staff is decentralized into three areas
of the city, but clearly more division will be needed as more
councils are certified (37 now, more than 80 are in the pipeline).
Each of the seven area planning commissions, which have real
authority, works with councils within its boundaries. If constituency
service centers were added to the neighborhood council and planning
department staffs, as is the case in the 8th District Empowerment
Congress created by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, every city
department would have a desk at the level of the seven area planning
commissions, bringing government closer to residents and making it
easier for departments to talk to one another.</TE>
<TE>   There is no perfect form of government. There is only what people
can agree to, as we did overwhelmingly with the new charter. It
countless hearings and a genuine consensus based on compromise to
achieve the reform embodied in the charter. It seems rather late in
the day to propose a radically different course.</TE>

<DH>Despite increased live organ donation in the U.S., the gap
between potential recipients and suitable organs is widening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DREW LIMSKY</AU>
<BD>Drew Limsky teaches at City College of New York.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Of the more than 13,000 kidney transplants performed in the U.S. last
year, about 40% were achieved with the help of live kidney donors. I
was one of them. Last January, I donated a kidney to my mother.</LD>
<LD>   Usually, kidney transplants are not technically complicated
procedures. Still, to volunteer to be a live organ donor is to enter
a discrete and anomalous class of perfectly healthy people who submit
to major surgery for no therapeutic or cosmetic reason. We willingly
become worse--or less--than we were before. Live organ donation is a
wonderful thing, but it's also a little gruesome, letting your body
be used for spare parts. It goes against the instinct for
self-preservation. If there are saintly souls who are able to endure
this ordeal without ambivalence, I wasn't one of them.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, my mother's kidneys began to fail. Kidney disease is
progressive; it almost never slows down or reverses itself because,
in their effort to function more efficiently, the damaged kidneys
destroy themselves. More than a year ago, my mother's nephrologist
recommended a kidney transplant as the best therapy. Kidneys for
transplant can come from cadavers--but only from people who die while
on life support--or from live donors. We were told that kidneys from
cadavers do become available, but people remain on waiting lists for
years as their bodies weaken from dialysis, the thrice-weekly method
of removing toxins from the blood when the kidneys no longer can.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the marked increase in live organ donation in the U.S.
(the number doubled between 1994 and 2001), the gap continues to
widen between potential recipients and suitable organs. At present,
51,000 Americans are awaiting kidney transplants; eight to nine die
every day. Part of the reason for the crushingly long wait--and part
of the reason for the rise in live donations--is that so few
Americans carry organ donor cards, and in this country organs can't
be harvested without such a card unless there is specific permission
from the family.</TE>
<TE>   In at least 13 countries, including France and Spain, the
presumption is that organs are up for harvest. Those who wish not to
have their organs used after they die must opt out formally and carry
a non-organ-donor ID card (although even in countries with so-called
presumed consent laws, the family can still override the wishes of
the deceased). In Belgium, live donation remains unpopular and all
but unnecessary because only 2% of Belgians opt out of presumed
donation, and there is virtually no organ waiting list. Live donation
"is never our first choice," Belgian transplant expert Yves
Vanrenterghem says. Austria's experience has been similarly
successful, and Spain, where just 18% of the population opts out, has
seen its number of actual transplants double in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   When my two brothers and I heard about the three- to five-year
wait for a cadaveric kidney, we all agreed to be tested for
compatibility of blood type, tissues and antigens. I was the only
match. Then I went through a battery of tests to ensure that my
kidney and I were healthy enough to do this. I aced everything. In
general, men have larger, more effective kidneys than women, which is
why, in terms of gender, a male-to-female transplant is the best-case
scenario. The tests showed that my two kidneys were doing the work of
three: I had superkidneys. The post-op restrictions would be few and
manageable: no contact sports (to protect the remaining kidney), no
Advil. I was assured that the donation would not affect my longevity
or the quality of my life.</TE>
<TE>   Today, most live kidney donations in major transplant centers are
being done laparoscopically--a minimally invasive kind of surgery
that leaves a two- to three-inch scar. All through the testing
process we were operating under the assumption that I would have it
this way, too. But a week before my surgery, I was told that my
musculature pretty much disqualified me for laparoscopy. That meant
major surgery: a longer hospital stay, a longer recovery period,
greater risk of complications and, most troubling to my bodybuilder
vanity, a 6- to 10-inch incision. The transplant unit had never lost
a donor, but the team's head surgeon couldn't "guarantee" that I'd be
as physically strong after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   I freaked out on the doctors, who, to their credit, were
unflappable. In the end, I decided to go ahead, but the night before
the surgery was one of the worst of my life.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery was a success. My kidney began working in my mother
even before her incision was closed. After a short-lived rejection
episode, she gradually improved. She's taking anti-rejection drugs
and will probably be on some form of them for the rest of her life,
but for all intents and purposes, she's cured. My five days in the
hospital weren't as bad as I'd imagined. Everyone was marveling at
the "small" five-inch scar on my side (I guess my tantrums, and the
fact that my coordinator--a goddess named Eleanor--had been "stamping
her feet" about my aesthetic concerns, worked).</TE>
<TE>   The next few weeks were not easy. I lost 17 pounds. I went back to
work two weeks after the operation, walking like an old man. Against
doctor's orders, I returned to the gym around the same time
(struggling with 10-pound weights), which saved my sanity. Now, five
months later, I'm about 95% myself: I still feel things shifting
around in there, and the abdominal muscles on my right side may take
another half-year to look and feel normal again.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson
has instituted a $10-million federal program to increase organ and
tissue donation. But if we adopted a presumptive donation system,
fewer healthy people would have to submit to major surgery to save
the lives of their children, parents, siblings, friends
and--increasingly--strangers. The success rates of live-donor kidneys
are somewhat higher than cadaveric (though both work well more than
90% of the time), and certainly people would--and should--still agree
to become live donors. But imagine those three-year-long lists, those
seasons in medical limbo, or medical purgatory, being slashed to one
year or six months. It's something to think about. And those
cadaveric donors won't feel a thing.</TE>

<BD>This piece was excerpted from a lecture delivered by
the Ha'aretz editor-in-chief last month at the 9th World Editors'
Forum in Bruges, Belgium. The Tel Aviv-based newspaper can be found
on the Internet at www.haaretzdaily .com.</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>First, the good news: Abu Ali's nine children are alive and well--as
well as children can be among the ruins of the Jenin refugee camp.
Please deliver this news to all of your friends who may have read, a
few weeks ago, Abu Ali's mournful declaration: "All my nine children
are buried beneath the ruins." Abu Ali's photograph was spread across
a double page in a distinguished and influential European magazine
under the title: "The survivors tell their story."</LD>
<LD>   Israeli tanks and bulldozers had entered the camp, Abu Ali
recalled. He went out to fill his car, telling his nine children to
meet him at a nearby intersection. But the Israeli forces blocked his
way back, and it was a week, he told the reporter, before he could
return to the ruins of what had been his home. "It smells of death
here," he is quoted as saying. "I am sure all my children are buried
beneath the rubble. Come back in a week and you will see their
corpses."</LD>
<LD>   The reporter and his editors did not wait a week to publish the
tentative story. They were not satisfied with the extent of the
tragedy that they could see with their eyes and legitimately depict
in their copy. The desire to hype the story blunted their healthy
journalistic instincts to doubt and double-check any story before
publishing it.</LD>
<TE>   I recently made some inquiries about Abu Ali's case. First, final
numbers indicate that three children and four women were killed
during the fighting in the Jenin refugee camp. Second, Abu Ali's
children were not among them. And third, the magazine did not bother
to tell its readers of this relatively happy end to its story.</TE>
<TE>   The last 20 months of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have
created a crisis of values for journalism. The coverage and comment
have exhibited four fundamental sins: obsessiveness, prejudice,
condescension and ignorance. The story of Abu Ali conveniently
exemplifies all four.</TE>
<TE>   The intensive media coverage of the conflict is often so
self-absorbed and so harmful to the region that it is a disgrace to
our profession. I wonder whether the disseminators of the Abu Ali
story were conscious of the impact they may have had on readers, from
the back streets of Jakarta to the universities of Boston, from the
Muslim neighborhoods in Marseilles to the Jewish community in
Toronto. Were they conscious, one wonders, of the effect of their
story on the parties themselves?</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide resonance of the conflict has meant that there is a
greatly intensified response to the work of Ha'aretz, the newspaper
where I am editor in chief. All of us at the paper, reporters and
editors alike, find ourselves dealing with consequences of our work
in ways we never experienced in the past--and frankly never expected
to experience.</TE>
<TE>   The months of violence have forced our venerable 84-year-old
newspaper to play its part in the collective national ethos, though
our critics claim we do not show sufficient enthusiasm for this role.
Daily, we feel the impact of our work in our contacts with Israeli
public opinion, and we can trace our impact, though less measurable,
on world public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   That does not mean, though, that we are free of those four
cardinal sins I referred to. Oh, yes, we are often obsessed.
Sometimes we do prejudge. I hope we are not ignorant. As to the
fourth sin, condescension, many of our readers think we are
condescending toward them.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a best-selling Israeli author, politically
middle-of-the-road, canceled her subscription to Ha'aretz. She wrote
(and I quote): " ... I have reached the conclusion that you and I
don't live in the same place. A large and growing proportion of the
reports and articles in your newspaper stink of the foreign press,
which regards the State of Israel as a different, distant and
repulsive territory."</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the situation of Ha'aretz and that of the
international press covering the region is, I hope, now clearly
emerging. Unlike those who report the conflict as a grand adventure,
we live the consequences of our reporting with every inch of our
being.</TE>
<TE>   Ha'aretz is a small paper in a small country. Our paid daily
circulation, Hebrew and English, reaches 100,000 copies--less than
10% of the Israeli newspaper market. Nonetheless, in the last 15
months since we launched our online edition, our Hebrew-language Web
site is now logging half a million page-views a day, and our
English-language site, another 700,000, mainly from outside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Very quickly, we were forced to recognize that despite our modest
pretensions, we had been chosen by many on the Net as producers,
suppliers and packagers of information from the Middle East. We are
servicing individuals, media groups, communities and organizations
all around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deceptive. Practically,
acquiring information from the region is easy, but it is no simple
task to assess to what extent that information reflects reality. On
the day-to-day level, it is hard to argue with what the eyes see,
though it is preferable to put the visual images into context. What
the ears hear, particularly in the Middle East, can be seriously
misleading, if it isn't backed up with additional information--or
carefully attributed to its source. It can be difficult to
distinguish between a solid source providing an accurate account and
someone lying through his teeth in the service of his nation, or
pushing an elaborate but baseless conspiracy theory. Exaggeration,
disinformation and provocation are the region's stock-in-trade.</TE>
<TE>   At the most basic level of sight and sound, the conflict is easy
to cover. But that is also the greatest stumbling block. Nothing is
what it appears to be. Even simple, neutral coverage is often loaded;
in many cases, there is no real distinction between peaceful civilian
and underground militant, between a decent politician and an active
terrorist. So is the use of contradictory terminology that often
reflects the two sides' conflicting narratives. "Shaheed" (martyr) or
"suicide bomber"? "Resistance fighter" or "terrorist?" These are all
different expressions for the same person. By choosing to use one of
them, you expose your own take on the conflict. In the Middle East,
naivete is an intolerable professional failing, especially when it
comes to terminology.</TE>
<TE>   The story as depicted in the media is sometimes painfully present
tense, lacking in context and lacking in consequence. The image of
Palestinian terrorism suspects, stripped to their underpants, with an
Israeli soldier aiming his rifle at them, is inevitably shocking to
anyone who does not know how much blood has been spilled by people
wearing explosive belts under their clothes, who managed to slip
through the checkpoints in the age of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   As the Palestinian intifada goes on, Ha'aretz finds itself in a
crisis of confidence with some of its readers who want to regard the
newspaper as a source of solidarity and consolation, and not only as
a mirror, reflecting and exposing reality.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel has gradually disengaged from the Palestinian
territories over recent years, our coverage of those territories has
become more like foreign correspondency in some respects than like
domestic reporting. Yet, at the same time, we remain intimately
familiar with the territories and with the Palestinian community--as
though they were parts of our domestic beat. Over the years, our
coverage has spanned most areas of Palestinian society. Our reporters
have acquired a deep knowledge of its mores and culture and deep
relationships with their sources.</TE>
<TE>   Ha'aretz today has nine reporters covering various aspects of the
Palestinian side of the story. And we enjoy a special advantage
because a senior member of our editorial staff, Amira Hass, has lived
in the territories since 1993, first in Gaza and later, after the
Palestinian Authority was established, in Ramallah, reporting full
time from inside the Palestinian areas. This is unique for an
Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   One of the skills required by a Ha'aretz reporter covering these
beats is the ability to critically examine manipulative information
of all kinds and to filter it. Only someone deeply informed and
intimately connected can, sometimes within a few hours, scotch a
rumor or reduce an exaggerated report to its actual proportions.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, thanks to Hass' presence in Jenin as soon as the camp was
opened, and thanks to the credibility of her reports from the chaotic
scene, Ha'aretz was able to quickly and reliably report that there
was no massacre in Jenin during or after the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Ha'aretz's years of readiness to listen to the
Palestinian side, and because of the natural inclination of the
newspaper to regard our mission to be the exposure of wrongdoing,
there are Ha'aretz reporters who have specialized in documenting
humanitarian cases on the Palestinian side. This is not new for us.
But as the relationship between the sides has deteriorated, and
Palestinian violence has intensified against Israelis, some of our
readers have found it difficult to accept an Israeli reporter who
shows sympathy or even compassion for Palestinian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to be conclusive about the basic question "What actually
happened there?" is not always fruitful, especially as we try to sift
through and match Israeli and Palestinian sources. We make a huge
effort to give our reader a clear picture, but nevertheless some of
the stories seem equivocal. They cite two or more conflicting
versions, but sometimes make no final judgment. And that, of course,
can leave your reader frustrated and angry.</TE>
<TE>   If the paper exposes cases of vandalism by Israeli soldiers during
the recent massive military operation on the West Bank, we do so in
good faith, trusting that our work helps to clean the system. Now,
though, as a result of our Internet presence, Ha'aretz is quoted in
unprecedented numbers of articles and reports.</TE>
<TE>   When a story is quoted widely, under our name, as proof of
Israel's profound and pervasive evil, I find myself thinking that
perhaps there is a fifth major sin in running a paper in this region:
The sin of naivete.</TE>

<AU>MICHAEL SKUBE</AU>
<BD>Michael Skube is an Atlanta writer.</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Like anyone else, Ozzy Osbourne would like some privacy when he's
using the john. It's simple courtesy. So the 12 cameras recording
"real life" in the Osbourne home six days a week discreetly look away
when Ozzy--or someone in the family--is called to the water closet.
Television can't get enough of reality--or what it imagines is
reality--these days, whether in the form of survivors, moles or big
brothers. But if it's reality you want, wouldn't you say a man
sitting on a commode is about as real as it gets?</LD>
<LD>   The bathroom's where Ozzy, ordinarily as unself-conscious as a
monkey in the zoo, draws the line. Also the bedroom he shares with
wife and manager Sharon. Anything else is fair game--which is to say,
offered for public consumption--in "The Osbournes," the hit reality
show on MTV. And its audience is consuming it more as voyeurs than as
viewers. Every episode, about 6 million viewers have watched Ozzy
fumble with a channel changer, bicker with his wife and kids (they
bicker a lot and Ozzy cusses a lot), wander around the house (Beverly
Hills mansion, actually) looking for his socks or whatever. They even
watched as the family dog threw up. It's all in the family, this one
anyway.</LD>
<TE>   And yet respectable, suit-wearing people love Ozzy, a former
drug-and-booze addict who was frontman for the heavy-metal group
Black Sabbath in the '70s. He was always something of a freak, with
his Technicolor hair and Satanic antics. He was young then and only
another strung-out rocker. Now, at 53, he's positively cool, coping
with his wife, coping with his kids, coping with himself. Mike Tyson
chewed on an opponent's ear and elicited disgust and loathing. Ozzy
bit the head off some poor bat (also a dove), and he's been lionized
ever since. You have to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   In May, at the White House Correspondents' Assn. dinner,
television's talking heads and the pundits of print were smitten. No
one--not Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, not the president--was
so much the center of fawning attention as Ozzy and Sharon. What
explains it? Well, the Washington Post reported it this way:
Something about the Osbournes' "skewed domesticity" clicked with the
public. "Beneath the freaky facade, Ozzy is us."</TE>
<TE>   Come again?</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry, but Ozzy is not anyone I know. Even the Osbournes'
eldest daughter, Aimee, is embarrassed and would take no part in the
show. "I find it so annoying," she told Rolling Stone. "At school,
almost every day, some retard would go, 'So, do you guys eat bats?'
And I'd like say, 'Yeah, all the time. You should come over, we're
having a bat barbecue this week.' "</TE>
<TE>   From the 1950s "Ozzie and Harriet" to Ozzy and Sharon (both
couples sharing with us two teenagers) is a long and winding road,
every kilometer of it littered with the detritus of pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozzie and Harriet" was only a sitcom, not self-exposure. In the
back of your mind you knew it was staged, but you didn't think about
it one way or another. Then, in the 1970s, a mutation occurred.
Television became interested in real life, something it knew nothing
about. It went looking for a family it could live with, cameras in
place, over a period of months, and it found that family in the Louds
of California. The results, as anyone who remembers will attest, were
not pretty. If this was the American family, switch to the ball game,
will you? Better still, turn off the TV.</TE>
<TE>   The Louds were a family unaware of its fault lines. The Osbournes
are something else altogether. They actually revel in
dysfunction--and the audience revels with them. What fun to be
screwed up, vicariously or otherwise. When it comes to this, a show
says more about its audience than about its characters.</TE>
<TE>   It was around this time that distinctions between public and
private matters began eroding in popular culture. In memoirs, in
journalism and elsewhere, the impulse to confess had taken hold. What
had been private had to be made public. Pop psychology was rampant,
with dubious consequences. Introspection was idle without catharsis,
one's soiled linen hung out in full view. Public and private were no
longer distinct spheres, each with its own claims and prerogatives,
but mirror images of one another. Seen from either end, the other
appeared smaller than what we had imagined--and it not infrequently
seemed debased. The slimy underside of things came to be seen as the
only reality that counted. The rest was illusion.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to write "The Osbournes" off to a generation's
infatuation with testing (and busting) boundaries. The truth is,
representation of quotidian reality has never been something that
either broadcasting or telecasting understood. In a more naive time,
radio tried to "re-create" events, the most ancient examples being
sports announcers who would "call" baseball games they were not
actually seeing. Details of the game would come in by telegraph and
the announcer (Ronald Reagan was one) would "re-create" the game,
embellishing dry fact with surprise and exclamation, commentary and
"observation." They were imparting life, or the sound of it. All the
while, listeners were unaware it was theater.</TE>
<TE>   Once television came along, even Walter Cronkite, whose probity no
one doubts, played the game. In "How to Watch TV News," Neil Postman
and Steve Powers tell us that CBS' "You Are There," which ran for
four seasons in the 1950s (and again in 1971) with Cronkite as host,
"re-created various historical events, complete with conversations no
one had ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   It was entertainment masked as news, long before entertainment
became the imperative of the medium. In time, network news would
become hostage to that imperative, and entertainment would become,
ever more desperately, an imagined facsimile of "real life."</TE>
<TE>   Thus so-called reality shows such as CBS' "Survivor," ABC's "The
Mole" and CBS' "Big Brother."</TE>
<TE>   None of these was realistic in the least, but now comes "The
Osbournes." This is reality? This is, in the words of the Washington
Post's writer, "just another American family who really care about
each another"?</TE>
<TE>   No, this is domestic vaudeville, half an hour of slapstick no more
real than Howdy Doody was. Somehow we knew Buffalo Bob and Howdy
weren't next door. I don't think Ozzy and Sharon are either. Not all
neighbors are alike, and every neighborhood has its eccentrics. But
in the dusk of the evening, I step onto the deck and smell the sweet
aroma of someone grilling chicken. At least I hope it's chicken. No
one I know of is grilling bats.</TE>

<KH>CUBA</KH>
<HD>Fidel Castro Is No Osama bin Laden</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WAYNE S. SMITH</AU>
<BD>Wayne S. Smith, a senior fellow at the Center for
International Policy, is former chief of the U.S. Interests Section
in Havana.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A cornerstone of the Bush administration's Cuba policy
is that Cuba is a terrorist state with hostile intentions toward us.
Otherwise, why not engage it as we do China, Vietnam and other
nondemocratic states?</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that the administration can't come up with a shred
of credible evidence to prove its point. Nor is it above using
outright fabrications. For example, the State Department has made
much of a speech given by Fidel Castro in Tehran last year in which
he supposedly said "Iran and Cuba, in cooperation with each another,
can bring America to its knees."</LD>
<LD>   But as it turns out, Castro never uttered those words. Professor
Nelson Valdes of the University of New Mexico has acquired and
analyzed all the transcripts of Castro's public statements while in
Iran and can attest that there is nothing even resembling such a
quote. It is a complete fabrication.</LD>
<TE>   When I was in Havana this month, Cuban foreign ministry officials
confirmed that Castro categorically denies making the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The reductio ad absurdum of the effort to label Cuba "a terrorist
state" can be found in the State Department's "Overview of
State-Sponsored Terrorism," issued May 21. Cuba is again included.
Why? Well, the State Department claims Castro has "vacillated" on the
war against terrorism and has "continued to view terror as a
legitimate revolutionary tactic."</TE>
<TE>   But this is patently untrue. Castro has consistently denounced
terrorism since Sept. 11, calling for its "total eradication." He
immediately condemned the attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, expressed solidarity with the American people and offered
to cooperate with all governments in the defeat of terrorism. Cuba
has signed all 12 U.N. counter-terrorism conventions and early this
year offered to sign a bilateral agreement with the U.S. providing
for joint efforts against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. declined, thus leaving us with a rather Kafkaesque
situation: Cuba offers to cooperate with us in the war against
terrorism, the State Department refuses the offer but simultaneously
complains that Cuba won't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that the Bush administration doesn't want to sign any
agreements with the Cubans and doesn't want to be perceived as
cooperating with them because that might offend the hard-line exiles
in Florida and lose the president's brother votes in the
gubernatorial election.</TE>
<TE>   One can also conclude from State's report on state-sponsored
terrorism that no one in the department consults with other
governments. The overview claims, for example, that Cuba has provided
"some degree of safe haven and support" to members of the
Revolutionary Armed Forced of Colombia (FARC) and the National
Liberation Army (ELN).</TE>
<TE>   But in April, the chairman of Colombia's joint chiefs of staff,
Gen. Fernando Tapias, told the House Committee on International
Relations: "There is no information ... that Cuba is in any way
linked to terrorist activities in Colombia. Indeed, Cuban authorities
are buttressing the peace movement.... And this is the information
that I have from the president and the commissioners."</TE>
<TE>   The May 21 report also mentions Niall Connolly, one of three
members of the Irish Republican Army arrested in Colombia on
suspicion of providing explosives to the FARC guerrilla group. It
notes that he lived a number of years in Cuba. True enough. Last
year, the Cuban government said that Connolly had been the
representative in Cuba of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
Nothing improper in that. According to the Cubans, Connolly had left
Cuba and returned to Ireland some time earlier. Subsequently, he
turned up in Colombia. But no evidence has been brought to light
suggesting any Cuban connection with his activities in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Stretching even further and again ignoring evidence to the
contrary, the State Department overview suggests that Cuba may have
harbored members of a Chilean terrorist group because it had twice
denied Chilean extradition requests, claiming that the wanted persons
were not in Cuba. Omitted is that this episode was thoroughly
investigated by the Chilean government, which last February sent two
Chilean senators to Havana to look into the matter. They returned
completely satisfied with Cuban explanations and convinced that Cuba
was not harboring any Chilean terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The report also complains that Cuba is harboring some members of
the separatist Basque Homeland and Freedom (ETA). There are a few
Basques living in Cuba, but Cuba is not "harboring" them. Most
arrived years ago as the result of an agreement with the
then-government of Felipe Gonzalez in Spain, which asked the Cubans
to take them. A few other Basques have subsequently traveled to Cuba,
and it is true that the current Spanish government does not consider
the Gonzalez agreement still operative. But that government has not
asked for the extradition of a single Basque. And it is noteworthy
that, in April, the head of the Basque regional government paid a
state visit to Cuba, something he would probably not have done if he
thought Cuba was "harboring Basque terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the State Department raises the issue of American
fugitives in Cuba. Yes, there are a number of them. But there is no
evidence that any are engaged in terrorist activities or any other
activities against the United States. Furthermore, there are Cuban
fugitives in the U.S., several of them terrorists with extensive FBI
files. If having fugitives from another country within your borders
were grounds for making the list of terrorist nations, the U.S. would
have to be on it as well.</TE>
<TE>   If what is in the May 21 report is the best evidence the State
Department can come up with, Cuba should not be on the list at all.
Claiming that Cuba is a terrorist state undermines our credibility
where we need it most--in the struggle against real terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Take Proper Steps to Ensure the Safe Use of Ladder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 500,000 people a year are treated for ladder-related
injuries in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons.</LD>
<LD>   The notion that ladder safety begins when you place your foot on
the first step is wrong. Ladder safety begins when you shop for a
ladder--a daunting task considering all the choices.</LD>
<LD>   First is ladder style--step or extension? Often you will need
both. A stepladder can be used indoors and outdoors but has height
limitations. An extension ladder is used primarily outdoors where
extra height is needed, as in the case of a two-story home. An
extension ladder can be useful indoors when there are unusually high
ceilings.</LD>
<TE>   Next is size. When it comes to ladders, size matters. For
stepladders, the ladder's height plus 4 feet equals the total reach.
For example, a 4-foot ladder can be used to reach an 8-foot ceiling.
Use a 6-foot ladder to reach a 10-foot ceiling, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   For an extension ladder, the base and upper sections must overlap.
So, a 20-foot extension ladder is only good for about 17 feet. The
ladder must extend beyond the roofline 2 to 3 feet so that it can be
used for balance as you climb onto the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Ladders are sold by "duty rating"--the weight a ladder is rated to
carry. The more weight it will hold, the stronger it must be.</TE>
<TE>   The American National Safety Institute establishes duty rating.
The five ratings and their respective load capacities are Type IAA
special duty--375 pounds; Type IA extra heavy duty--300 pounds; Type
I heavy duty--250 pounds; Type II medium duty--225 pounds; and Type
III light duty--200 pounds. When in doubt, always err on the side of
a heavier duty rating.</TE>
<TE>   The final consideration in choosing a ladder is construction
material. The choices are wood, aluminum and fiberglass. The oldest
and most familiar material is wood.</TE>
<TE>   Wood ladders have a sturdy feeling. But their heaviness makes them
cumbersome and somewhat difficult to transport. Also, wood must be
regularly maintained to prevent cracking, splitting and rotting.</TE>
<TE>   Wood is economical and, when clean and dry, does not conduct
electricity. If you do electrical work, you should choose a
fiberglass ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Ladders made from high-strength aluminum are a lightweight,
rot-free alternative to wood. But aluminum ladders don't last longer
than wood. Salt air or chemicals can corrode and weaken them.</TE>
<TE>   Fiberglass has become as popular as aluminum was when it first
replaced wood. Fiberglass ladders are lighter than wood but heavier
than aluminum. They aren't subject to rot, they don't bend easily and
they come in several colors. Manufacturers say that they will last
generations.</TE>
<TE>   But plastics and resins oxidize in the same fashion as all other
carbon-based materials. Only time will tell whether fiberglass will
last longer than the others.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing the right ladder is only part of the safety equation.
Proper use and maintenance are also important. Always read and abide
by the instruction labels and stickers on a ladder before setting
foot on it.</TE>
<TE>   Make a thorough inspection to be sure the ladder is safe and in
good working order. Even a perfectly good ladder can be unsafe if not
used properly.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some rules and a few tips that could help prevent a
ladder accident and perhaps serious injury:</TE>
<TE>   * Never use a worn-out ladder. In some instances it can be
repaired, but more often it is advisable to get a new one.</TE>
<TE>   * Never use a ladder unless it is rated to carry your weight. If
the salesperson at the store can't tell you the weight that the
ladder is capable of carrying, don't purchase it.</TE>
<TE>   * Use a ladder that is the right length for the job. For
stepladders, the ladder's height plus 4 feet equals the total reach.
And that warning at the top, "This is not a step," means just that.</TE>
<TE>   * Rest the ladder properly. Don't rest the high leg on a block of
wood or a brick. Instead, dig a hole for the lower leg. Also, don't
stand the ladder up at too little or too great of an angle. The safe
angle is about 75 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, too much angle reduces the ladder's strength, and not
enough angle could cause you to tip backward.</TE>

<HD>Builders' Arbitration Rights on Defects Upheld</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for home builders, the California state Court of Appeal
last week upheld a builder's right to enforce arbitration agreements
that include construction-defect claims.</LD>
<LD>   In Basura vs. U.S. Home Corp., the appellate court held that
homeowners who agree to an arbitration provision in a residential
purchase and sale contract must arbitrate those claims in which
interstate commerce is involved, such as the interstate movement of
construction materials and equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiffs in Basura vs. U.S. Home Corp. signed a broad
arbitration agreement when they purchased their Palmdale homes, but
later refused to arbitrate their dispute with the builders over
construction defects, said the builders' attorney, Sandra Stewart, of
Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson. Among the list of plaintiffs' complaints was
defective framing.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who heard the case
refused to enforce the arbitration provision, claiming it was not
broad enough, and was therefore not enforceable under a California
law, Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Court of Appeal judges ruled unanimously that
the Federal Arbitration Act, passed by Congress about 80 years ago,
preempts, or protects, against state laws that strip away rights to
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   That law does not, however, include enforcement of arbitration
agreements that are unfair, according to builder's attorney Kenneth
Bley.</TE>
<TE>   Construction-defect lawsuits have proliferated dramatically in the
last decade. The vast majority of those lawsuits are settled out of
court through the arbitration process.</TE>

<LD>Forget the 400-square-foot master suite and the remote-controlled hot
tub: Domestic comfort doesn't reside in the sort of useless gimmicks
so common in new houses today.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, it's a host of tiny and very ordinary conveniences that
help tip the balance toward a comfortable house.</LD>
<LD>   Here are a few worth insisting on:</LD>
<TE>   * Entry: A floor finish that'll take some punishment and look
better for it, a convenient place to put not just your coat but your
shoes and a dripping umbrella, a comfortable place to sit and a place
to put things while you fumble for your keys.</TE>
<TE>   * Kitchen: Base cabinets with shelves that pull out, a really
quiet dishwasher and waste disposal unit, a smooth-surfaced range
that won't catch crumbs and grease, a range hood that actually does
something besides drone and a place to put the garbage and
recyclables without having to poke around under the sink.</TE>
<TE>   * Bathroom: A lavatory counter matched to your height, so you
don't have to stoop to use it; a sink that water can't puddle behind;
faucets you can grip even with soapy hands; a mirror with lighting
fixtures on either side instead of overhead; a toilet-paper dispenser
within a non-contortionist's reach; a powerful exhaust fan that
doesn't drone or whine; towel bars you can reach from the shower; and
a bathroom heater that warms your whole body and not just the top of
your head.</TE>
<TE>   * Shower: A permanent place to keep soap and shampoo, a place to
sit down and enough room to wave your arms a little without banging
into the walls.</TE>
<TE>   * Bedroom: A good, glare-free bedside reading lamp and a handy
place to keep a couple of books, a closet with room for the winter
blankets and closet doors that let you get to the whole closet, not
just one side or the other.</TE>
<TE>   * Living room: Who cares? Nobody goes in there.</TE>
<TE>   * Back door: A roof for shelter from the rain, and room for
gardening shoes, pet food bowls and all the rest of the messy flotsam
that gathers on the back porch.</TE>
<TE>   * General: Rooms that are sunny at the times you use them, floors
that are warm in winter and cool in summer, windows that look out on
something other than the neighbor's house.</TE>
<TE>   And no roof leaks. Architects have had 2,000 years and more to
come up with watertight roofs, but you still have to put them on wish
lists like this one.</TE>

<HD>Correct Your Credit Errors and You'll Reduce Your Interest
Rate</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Are your credit scores high enough to qualify you for the lowest
interest rate on a new home mortgage? If not, could factual errors
hidden in your electronic credit files be depressing your scores
artificially?</LD>
<LD>   Mortgage and credit industry experts say the odds of errors are
greater than you might suspect. Whereas 10 years ago loan officers
routinely reviewed individual credit reports with applicants, today's
high-speed, automated underwriting environment emphasizes credit
scores, with little opportunity for review of the files that produced
the scores.</LD>
<LD>   Match or exceed the lender's preset credit score minimum and you
get the best rates and terms. Come in below that mark, and you pay
more--possibly a lot more.</LD>
<TE>   But new developments in the mortgage credit arena are giving
consumers opportunities to check out--and correct--their credit files
quickly enough to get better rate quotes from lenders.
Credit-reporting firms have begun signing up mortgage lenders and
brokers for online data-correction services that can push up scores
in less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most ambitious of these, known as Scorefacts.com, is
run by the California-based firm, Standfacts Credit Services Inc.
Lenders and brokers participating in the Scorefacts program instruct
Standfacts to flag all loan applicants' credit reports with scores
below a designated threshold. Generally, the cutoff point separates
applicants who qualify for the lender's best rates from those who
don't.</TE>
<TE>   When home-loan applicants' scores are below the designated mark,
they immediately get an e-mail saying that their credit files contain
data they may wish to review. Applicants can then go to a secure,
Scorefacts Web site, punch in an access code, and examine the full
electronic credit files that were pulled from the three national
credit bureaus--Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. If any of the
negative information depressing their scores is wrong, applicants can
quickly begin the process of correcting the files.</TE>
<TE>   Standfacts promises lenders that most errors can be corrected
within 72 hours of receipt of documentation from creditors confirming
the mistaken information. Then the loan applicants can be
"rescored"--usually to their benefit on rates and fees.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Kassan, president of Standfacts, said he has seen scores jump
more than 100 points when the incorrect information is removed, and
the mortgage applicant is rescored. More typically, he said, scores
increase by smaller increments--20 to 30 points--"but that's
frequently all that's needed" to move an applicant into a lower
interest-rate category.</TE>
<TE>   Most lenders and brokers nationwide use FICO credit-risk scores,
named after their developer, Fair, Isaac &amp; Co. Inc. Proprietary FICO
software is installed at each of the three national credit bureaus.
Scores are generated when electronic credit files are ordered and run
through the software. High scores--720 and above--indicate a
relatively low risk of borrower default. Scores in the 600s and below
are considered higher risk.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the negative information in a credit file may be
mistaken. For instance, an incorrect report of a nonpayment on a debt
or a misfiling by a department store regarding a charge account.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most common mistakes, Kassan said, is confusion over
names within families. Father and son may have similar names, for
instance, but father always pays his bills on time while junior is a
deadbeat. The result: Some credit reports erroneously mix junior's
bad behavior with dad's pristine credit history. When dad goes to
apply for a loan, his FICO scores are too low to qualify him for the
rates and terms he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   How costly are those artificially depressed scores on a home
mortgage? Very. According to Fair, Isaac's latest nationwide rate
survey covering thousands of lenders (posted at www.myfico.com), a
consumer applying for a mortgage with a FICO score between 500 and
559 would qualify for no better than a 10.2% fixed-rate 30-year loan.</TE>
<TE>   The same person with a score between 620 and 674 would be quoted
8.43%. With a score between 700 and 719, the rate would drop to 6.7%,
and above 720 the borrower would get a 6.6% loan.</TE>
<TE>   Could the presence of unseen bad data in your files cost you 2 or
more percentage points--and potentially tens of thousands of dollars
of higher monthly payments--on your home loan? Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   If your broker or lender uses a rescoring service such as
Kassan's, you may get a shot at correcting your files in time to get
the rate you deserve. Ask about it at application.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, you can do the same thing in advance: Before applying
for a loan, order all three of your credit reports, contact any
creditors who have entered erroneous information about you, and get
it all corrected.</TE>

<HD>Mediterranean-Style Villa Is Fit for a Diva</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An opera singer who sang soprano with the Chicago Grand Opera Company
and appeared on the international stage came to California and liked
it so much that she had this Hollywood Hills house built in 1923 to
reflect her impressions of Mediterranean villas.</LD>
<LD>   The grand staircase and balcony over the entrance are replicas of
features found in the palace at Fontainebleau outside Paris</LD>
<LD>   But parts of that vision have changed over time. A Roman indoor
plunge pool, where many parties were held during the '20s, was
covered by a new kitchen built during the 1980s, and a guest house
was sold separately some years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the changes, the house still has much of its original
look, which not only appealed to the diva but also attracted such
tenants as actress Pola Negri, who lived there for a short time with
actor Rudolph Valentino.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: The sellers, who have owned this home since
1985, are listing the house because they plan to move to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $1,195,000.</TE>
<TE>   Size: Four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms in 4,260 square feet on a
14,180-square-foot lot.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home has a two-story living room and a library, den
and master suite with a marble bathroom. The home also has a roof
deck, office/gym and city-to-ocean views. On the lower level, where
roomy servants' quarters have ample windows and ventilation, there is
a maid's quarters, an office and a separate entrance. The terraced
gardens have lawns and stone walls, and there are three garages in
the same style of architecture as the house.</TE>
<TE>   Where: The house was built in a neighborhood named Holly Spring
Heights, a few blocks north of Hollywood Boulevard near Cahuenga
Boulevard. A 1923 ad for the development loosely referred to the area
as "the Riviera of California" and boasted having "all modern
utilities, such as electricity, gas, water, sewers and telephones."
The neighborhood is now known as the Hollywood Dell, a pocket of
period homes.</TE>

<LD>Whoopi Goldberg has sold her Malibu home for about $5 million. The
actress-comedian had owned the home since September 2000, when she
purchased it for about $3.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   The contemporary-style, 2,300-square-foot home has a two-bedroom
main house and a detached guest house/studio with a kitchen and
bathroom. The property also has 40 feet of beach frontage with sand
dune and ocean views.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1999, the home was completely remodeled before Goldberg
purchased it.</LD>
<TE>   Goldberg, 46, was host of the 74th Academy Awards on March 24. It
was the fourth time she had hosted the annual awards show telecast. A
few months earlier, she starred in the TNT movie "Call Me Claus."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg also has become a successful executive producer of shows
such as "Hollywood Squares," the Lifetime series "Strong Medicine"
and the 2001 Lifetime movie "What Makes a Family," for which Barbra
Streisand was also an executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy-winning comedian and founding member of Comic Relief
also earned an Oscar for best supporting actress for "Ghost" (1990).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark McGwire, who in 1998 broke Roger Maris' major league record
of 61 home runs and finished the season with a then-record 70 home
runs, and his wife, Stephanie, have listed their Huntington Harbour
waterfront estate in Huntington Beach at just under $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple put their home on the market because they are planning
to build a larger home in the Irvine development of Shady Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The first baseman, 38, retired last year from the St. Louis
Cardinals. Chicago Cub star Sammy Sosa also surpassed Maris' record
in 1998, as did San Francisco Giant left fielder Barry Bonds in 2001.
Bonds finished that season with a record 73 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   McGwire, a native of Pomona whose parents live in Mission Viejo,
has owned the Huntington Harbour home since 1991, when he first
remodeled it. In 1995, he again remodeled the home, built in 1969. He
and his wife were married in April.</TE>
<TE>   Their home has four bedrooms in about 5,000 square feet. The house
has a curved glass front door; a two-story stone turret with a round
skylight off a rooftop patio/garden; a two-story waterfall that
empties into a moat at the entrance; and a saltwater aquarium that
can be viewed from the entry, living room and sunroom.</TE>
<TE>   There is a view of the main channel from the living room or great
room. The home also has a wine room; a fireplace in the master suite;
a dock for two boats, including a 50-foot one; and parking for two
vehicles and a sports car.</TE>
<TE>   Steve and Sandy Powers at Star Real Estate in Huntington Beach
have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence J. Ellison, listed by Forbes magazine as one of the five
richest men in the world, has purchased a Malibu home for close to
its $14.5-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison is chairman and CEO of Northern California-based Oracle
Corp., which weathered the dot-com crash better than most
computer-related companies. More recently, Oracle has been involved
in an imbroglio over an ill-fated $95-million computer software
contract with the state of California.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, Ellison captured the inaugural Sausalito Cup after
winning all three races against five vintage America's Cup yachts on
San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison's new home in Malibu is believed to be a retreat, not a
main residence. It has five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in about 6,100
square feet. The Tuscan villa-style home, with 60 feet of beachfront,
also has mountain and ocean views, four patios, two fireplaces and an
indoor/outdoor wet bar.</TE>
<TE>   The house was built in the late '80s but was recently refurbished.
The home was listed as being for sale or for lease at $60,000 a
month. Katie Bentzen of Pritchett-Rapf &amp; Associates, Malibu, and June
Scott of June Scott Estates, a Coldwell Banker company in Beverly
Hills, had the listing, and Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency,
Beverly Hills, represented the buyer, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Wendle, CEO and co-founder of the Internet movie guide
Ifilm, has sold his three-house compound in Bel-Air for close to $21
million, according to Westside Realtors. The asking price was $24.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Wendle had owned the first of the three houses since 1997. He
turned the 5,200-square-foot house, built in 1934, into a
7,500-square-foot estate with five bedrooms plus a guest house. The
Spanish-style home, on a 1.2-acre promontory, also has a screening
room, city views and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Wendle later bought and remodeled two adjacent houses, which
became part of the compound he just sold. The compound is on about
five acres.</TE>
<TE>   Before Ifilm, Wendle, 42, was a co-founder of CNet and was head of
programming and marketing for Fox TV, where he was also involved in
developing such series as "Married ... With Children" and "The
Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   The buyer was described by Westside realty sources as a Canadian
architect.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian A. Green, who played Tori Spelling's love interest David
Silver on "Beverly Hills 90210" (1990-2000), has sold a
Mediterranean-style home he owned in the Outpost Estates area of
Hollywood for slightly more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Green listed the home because he bought another home in the
Hollywood Hills about a year ago for nearly $1.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house he sold has two bedrooms and three bathrooms in 3,100
square feet. Built in 1983, it had been remodeled to include a
state-of-the-art recording studio, where Green played with his band.
The home also has a mini-lagoon and a waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Since "Beverly Hills 90210," Green, 28, has appeared in the
Showtime series "Resurrection Blvd."</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Blumenfeld of Paramount Rodeo Realty, Woodland Hills, had
the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clothing designer David Dart has sold his Hollywood home for about
$1.3 million. Before Dart bought it four years ago, the home was an
Italian antique dealer's private showroom for 40 years. Among his
clients were Greta Garbo and Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1926, the Spanish-style home has five bedrooms in 3,600
square feet. Dart restored the house, which has a large living room
with beamed ceilings, a library, a formal dining room and a walled
and gated courtyard with a fountain. The home also has city views.</TE>
<TE>   Dart, in his late 30s, has a pied-a-terre in West Hollywood and a
home in New Orleans. He has showrooms in New York, Dallas, Atlanta,
Santa Monica and L.A. His corporate offices are in the City of
Industry. His designs are carried by Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus,
Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Norman of DBL Realtors represented both sides of the deal,
and he represented Dart when he bought the house.</TE>

<DH>A dank basement in a Los Feliz home becomes a cozy room for
parties and just the place for a wine cellar with climate control</DH>
<SE>Pardon Our Dust</SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were five reasons Claudia Christian needed to upgrade the
basement of her Los Feliz home last year: Three adult and two baby
opossums had pushed their way through openings in the walls and taken
up residence.</LD>
<LD>   Christian, an actress, got this news while in Germany filming
"Half Past Dead" with Steven Seagal. Her housekeeper called to report
that one opossum was nesting in the fireplace, one under a bench and
another under the treadmill. They had left droppings all over the
house and bullied the cat out of its food.</LD>
<LD>   Christian's 1914 two-story, 6,000-square-foot house sits on a
knoll with a view of Los Angeles. It has movie-star quality, with
classical revival architecture, a grand foyer, two master suites,
three offices, four wood-burning fireplaces, five bathrooms and a
pool.</LD>
<TE>   But the basement, with its dirt and cracked concrete floor, lacked
any flair. Hundreds of old wires from defunct electrical and alarm
systems, a maze of pipes and ducts, and clamminess from leaking
moisture made walking to a storage space in the basement an
unpleasant obstacle course.</TE>
<TE>   "Revolting, disgusting, gross, dirty, dusty," is how Christian
described the space. "I didn't feel it was safe."</TE>
<TE>   Humidity and mold ruined boxes of photographs--from Christian's
childhood, modeling days and early acting career--that she had stored
there since she bought the house two years ago. "That hurt enough to
snap me to my senses."</TE>
<TE>   To bring the basement's quality up to that of the house, Christian
turned to her friend Michael Weiss, a carpenter and all-around
handyman who is part of a clan of friends known as the McStaggers.</TE>
<TE>   The McStaggers dress in full regalia for medieval festivals and
party a lot, often at Christian's house. Weiss is known as Haggis
McStagger, while Christian has earned the moniker Trouble McStagger.
"It's much more like family than friends," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Topping Christian's wish list for the 720-square-foot basement: a
wine cellar to help fuel her parties. "We drink a lot of wine," she
said. The budget was initially set at $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Once Weiss considered the basement's possibilities, he realized he
could turn the rest of it into a dungeon-type space to provide more
room for socializing and an appropriate place to show off Christian's
collection of "edged weapons"--including knives, swords and daggers.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Christian gave him free rein, trusting him to create
the space he imagined. "I can look at anything, and I can see the
finished product," Weiss said. "I'm very talented to begin with, and
modest too."</TE>
<TE>   Working on the basement part-time, Weiss took five months to
complete the transformation, with help from a few friends. The job
lasted from February to June of last year, at a final cost of about
$20,000.</TE>
<TE>   As in most remodeling jobs, getting the site prepared was a major
chore. The first step was moving Christian's belongings to the
backyard and protecting them from the weather. That was followed by a
thorough cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the job, Weiss wore a dust mask. On days he didn't, "I
regretted it," he said, adding that a construction project in a "dark
and dank" basement is rife with "unpleasantries."</TE>
<TE>   Next he removed old wiring, primarily from defunct alarm systems,
and moved electrical cables and heating and cooling vents to
out-of-the-way locations.</TE>
<TE>   "You were ducking every two feet," he said. Some pipes were put
behind a half-wall so they are accessible for repairs but not
visible.</TE>
<TE>   The electrical work proved "most vexing" for Weiss, Christian
said. She recalls bringing Weiss a glass of wine one afternoon and
seeing him holding his head in his hands with a book on electrical
wiring open in his lap. Everything had to be done just right with
"ultra-new, ultra-safe wiring," he said, adding that he won't take
shortcuts. "I'm hyper-paranoid about it." When he was done, a
licensed electrician inspected the job and confirmed that it was up
to code.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the support posts were either replaced or reinforced,
depending on their condition.</TE>
<TE>   Another big task was pouring nearly 50 bags of concrete to level
the floor, which had been laid at different times over the last seven
decades (1935, 1948 and 1979, according to a file containing building
permits that came with the house). Some parts of the basement had
never been paved.</TE>
<TE>   The last project before construction could begin on the wine
cellar and storage spaces was insulating the walls to keep out
moisture.</TE>
<TE>   This involved bolting redwood 2-by-4s to each wall, which took two
weeks of drilling, applying solid foam sheets, then covering all
walls with either Tyvek house wrap or two layers of plastic. Once
that was done, cedar panels were installed. A dropped ceiling was
added to hide irregularities that could not be amended. The floors
were lined with slate.</TE>
<TE>   To construct the wine cellar, a 112-square-foot section of the
basement was fitted with a well-sealed self-closing door. Christian
wanted a basic wine cellar; this one can hold 2,000 bottles. Because
she was in a hurry to get the cellar completed for a television video
shoot at her house, Weiss bought the wine racks ready-made for
$3,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the wine cellars Weiss has done since (they are now his
specialty, and he considers clients requesting wine cellars the most
fun), he prefers to custom-build the racks in his workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Temperature and humidity control are critical for a wine cellar,
and Weiss studies the topic diligently. According to his research,
the ideal storage temperature is 55 degrees; a $1,200 air conditioner
was added to achieve this. If the room is too humid (more than 80%
relative humidity), mold will grow and the labels will be prone to
falling off. If the air is too dry, the wine will evaporate through
the corks. To control dryness, Weiss prefers a low-tech system that
involves a water-filled copper bucket and a towel to wick the water
up and into the air.</TE>
<TE>   To give the rest of the basement the dungeon look he was after, he
decorated with medieval-looking lamps and benches and displayed a
collection of weapons with a yard-sale picture frame. Posts and a
counter covered with thin copper sheeting provide a lavish look.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss created an 8-by-10-foot Moroccan bed, set in an alcove,
where guests can relax and socialize. He built the platform from
sturdy outdoor decking material and two sewn-together futons. His
favorite job was making the lush draperies that give the bed its
opulent coziness. When he found fabrics too expensive in Los Angeles,
he headed down to Mexico to make his purchases. He found
Gothic-looking couches there as well.</TE>
<TE>   For a final touch, a sign proclaiming "Welcome to the Dungeon" was
painted by another McStagger, actress Alexandra Tydings, who played
Aphrodite, the quirky goddess of love, on the TV series "Xena Warrior
Princess."</TE>
<TE>   The Moroccan bed is a hit, especially during parties of more than
20. At a recent get-together, Weiss found a throng of revelers
lounging there, talking and drinking wine. Christian said her friends
love napping on the bed. "It's quiet and dark--no clocks, no lights,
no noise," she said. "It's incredibly womb-like."</TE>
<TE>   The wine cellar is likewise put to good use, though keeping it
stocked is an ongoing struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "Claudia entertains a lot," Weiss said. "I'd come back with 20 to
30 cases [of wine], and a few weeks later it would be gone."</TE>

<HD>Landlord Can Prorate Rent After a Mid-Month Move-In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I moved into my apartment in the middle of last month. At
that time, I paid a full month's rent. The manager just handed me a
three-day notice to pay the "prorated" rent for this month. I don't
understand why I owe rent when I've paid until the middle of this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: When a tenant moves into a rental other than on the first
day of a month, there are several ways payment of rent can be
handled.</LD>
<LD>   One way is for a tenant to pay a daily rate for the number of days
remaining in the move-in month and then have the full rent due on the
first of the next month. To determine the daily rate, divide the
monthly rent by 30, and multiple this amount by the number of days
left in the month.</LD>
<TE>   Another way is the method your manager used. That is, you pay 30
days of rent at move-in time and then pay the prorated rent for the
number of days remaining in the second month. If your rental
agreement says the rent is due on the first of each month, then the
balance of rent due for the second month is due on the first day of
the second month. After this time, full rent will be due on the first
of each subsequent month.</TE>
<TE>   In your case, the three-day notice is valid. You need to pay the
past-due rent within these three days to avoid placing yourself at
risk of a court eviction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Negotiate Moving Date When Escrow Is Involved</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I are excited about moving to the house we
bought. Because we are not sure when escrow will close, we don't know
when to give the landlord our 30-day notice. Any suggestions on how
to end our month-to-month tenancy?</TE>
<TE>   A: We suggest you discuss the matter with the rental property
owner. You might offer a 30-day notice with an option to extend if
your escrow is delayed. Or, you may offer a 40- or 45-day notice,
again with an understanding that if you can move earlier, or need to
stay longer, there could be a refund of unused rent or an agreement
to continue paying rent on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   If the property owner doesn't agree, you can wait until you have a
better idea of when escrow will close, and then submit your 30-day
notice. In this case, even if you move before the 30 days expire,
your obligation for rent will end when your 30-day notice expires or
when the unit is re-rented.</TE>
<TE>   If the unit is not re-rented before your 30-day notice ends, you
may have to plan on paying rent for the days you don't occupy the
rental as well as your first mortgage payment.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid any misunderstanding later, be sure to put all agreements
with your landlord in writing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Owner Isn't Obligated to Have Joint Inspection</TE>
<TE>   Q: My former tenant received his deposit settlement, but says I
can't deduct money from his deposit because I didn't do a formal
inspection when he moved out. He says the law requires me to perform
a joint inspection with tenants on their move-out day. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no California law that requires a property owner or
their agent to complete a formal move-out inspection when a tenant
vacates a property.</TE>
<TE>   Having said this, it is strongly recommended that an owner or
agent perform move-out inspections with the departing tenants. These
inspections help avoid disagreements about the condition of the
property and what charges, if any, will be deducted from the deposit.</TE>
<TE>   These inspections also give tenants a chance to do any cleaning or
repairs to help reduce the amount that might be deducted from their
deposit. Before making repairs, a tenant should get permission,
preferably in writing, from the property owner or agent.</TE>
<TE>   An additional benefit of a joint inspection is the avoidance of
legal action. The time and aggravation of court is certainly greater
than meeting for a short time with your tenant to complete an
inspection.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE KINDRED</AU>
<BD>SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lennox Lewis remembers: They first drew blood as teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   The Catskills, 1984.</LD>
<LD>   Looking for competition, the young Englishman headed for the
mountains to spar with "this young cat up in New York named Mike
Tyson."</LD>
<TE>   Four days they went at it in a bare-bulb gym created above a
police station. "He did give me a fat lip," Lewis says, "but I gave
him a bloody mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Cus D'Amato watched. He saw everything, mostly the future.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis remembers six words from the great old trainer who had made
champions: "One day you and Mike will meet."</TE>
<TE>   Memphis, 2002. Lewis and Tyson. For the heavyweight championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It has come true," the Englishman said.</TE>
<TE>   Except for this: The Mike Tyson of then is not the Mike Tyson of
now.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson came with power and will and hands as quick as a gasp
of fear.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson loved the masochistic torture that is the bedrock of
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson produced in opponents a reaction that trainer Ray Arcel
had seen in a dozen fighters who had agreed to fight Joe Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "One sight of Joe across from them," he said, "they wilted like
tulips."</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson walked through two dozen tomato cans and contenders to
become the heavyweight champion at age 20.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson fought the way Marciano fought, and Dempsey, and
Frazier. He fought three minutes a round, as many rounds as you
wanted, willing to take punishment for the opportunity to give it.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson brought honor to a dishonorable game.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, that Tyson disintegrated.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Tyson bears a resemblance to that Tyson, a corporeal
likeness built of sneers and a bull's shoulders, as if this Tyson has
been cloned from blood left in a firehouse ring.</TE>
<TE>   But something went wrong in the cloning, so wrong that even Budd
Schulberg, who has written of the darkness in boxing's soul, says,
"My secretary asks, 'How can you like a sport in which Mike Tyson is
the main attraction?' It's not easy to answer that."</TE>
<TE>   The Tyson of 1984 was a guilty pleasure, for who among us wants to
admit gaining pleasure from a game in which the greatest rewards go
to the man most adept at injuring brains?</TE>
<TE>   But now, in Memphis 2002, that guilt had turned to shame, for only
the shameless could be entertained by an empty shell of a once-great
fighter whose public behavior has long left only two questions not
answered: How nuts, exactly, is he? Hannibal Lecter nuts?</TE>
<TE>   Students of psychopathic oratory may have parsed Tyson's
threat/promise to eat Lennox Lewis' children.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson also announced an intention to deliver blows of such force
as to explode Lewis' brain and send it splashing into the Mississippi</TE>
<TE>   River.</TE>
<TE>   In speaking of cannibalism, murder, fornication, masturbation and
prison-sex practices, Tyson used 10- and 11-letter words typical of a
man for whom English is a second language used only when the vilest
profanity fails.</TE>
<TE>   Not a darkness of the soul.</TE>
<TE>   A pornography.</TE>
<TE>   It sells. More than 15,000 people came to the Memphis Pyramid with
tickets costing as much as $2,400; another million bought the
pay-per-view telecast at $54.95.</TE>
<TE>   Each fighter's estimated $17.5 million take caused Ferdie Pacheco,
once Muhammad Ali's fight doctor, to declare, "A society that
enriches Mike Tyson rather than institutionalizing him is a sick
society."</TE>
<TE>   A Tyson victory, it says here, would have been the end of
civilization as we know it.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, Lewis came to the rescue. Bigger, stronger, faster,
smarter, he dominated Tyson before knocking him out late in the
eighth round. Seldom has any sports event produced a more satisfying
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   First, Lewis proved he belonged in the same paragraph, if not the
same sentence, with the great ones.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best heavyweight since Muhammad Ali," says his trainer,
Emanuel Steward.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Holmes was a master whose skills were equal to those of
Lewis; the warrior Tyson at 21 may have been better than both men.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no denying Lewis' domination of the nutcase Tyson. As
early as the fourth round, Steward was heard shouting at Lewis:
''TAKE HIM OUT NOW.''</TE>
<TE>   More important, now we won't have Tyson to kick around any more.
Now we can leave him to the care and supervision of trained medical
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Now we are rid of both Tysons, yesterday's and today's.</TE>
<TE>   To quote HBO boxing commentator Larry Merchant, "The myth of Mike
Tyson is forever destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The lasting image of Tyson will be that of the empty shell, almost
36 years old, flat on his back, bloody rivulets flowing from both
eyes and his nose, his right glove brought to his forehead, as if
shading his eyes, as Jack Johnson did against the midday Cuban sun 87
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Or, wait a second ...</TE>
<TE>   Might Tyson, with no other means of making money, fight again?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, some sleazy promoter will take him on a carnival tour where
he'll beat nine guys like you and me," Merchant said. "And there'll
be the idea, 'He deserves another shot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Better to remember the glorious smile on Lennox Lewis' face, an
hour after the fight, when he held high three championship belts and
heard someone shout, "Lennox, how does it feel to be the greatest
Englishman since John Lennon?"</TE>

<HD>Glavine Just Keeps Rolling Along</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Ageless left-hander leads major leagues with a
1.53 earned-run average.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL NEWBERRY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Tom Glavine has a few flecks of gray under his cap, a few more
wrinkles around the eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, he doesn't look much different than the guy who pitched
the Atlanta Braves to their first World Series in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   "Really, he's not all that gray," Chipper Jones said, glancing
toward the locker of his 36-year-old teammate. "He must be putting
some stuff in his hair."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Glavine appears to have just been pulled from a time
capsule, unaffected by the passage of the last decade or so. He's
still doing what he's always done: baffling hitters with
less-than-overpowering stuff, a sinker here, a changeup there.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, that's too simplistic," Glavine said. "I'm not the same
pitcher I was 10 years ago. I'm not the same pitcher I was last year.
But I think it's a credit that I've been able to make those changes
without people noticing."</TE>
<TE>   Glavine, who already has two Cy Young awards in his trophy case,
is better than ever. He got to 10 wins at the earliest point of his
16-year career and stands 11-2 with a major-league leading 1.53
earned-run average heading into his start Sunday against the Boston
Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   When the left-hander walks into the Hall of Fame, they should put
this mantra on his plaque: He never gave in to the hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "Those kind of guys are the most frustrating to face," Jones said.
"As a hitter, you're taught to work ahead in the count so you can
look for your pitch. But Glavine never throws your pitch. He's going
to throw what he wants, when he wants, where he wants."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy--Glavine would rather walk a guy with the bases
loaded than throw a pitch he might hit for a grand slam--has carried
him to five 20-win seasons and a career record of 235-134.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's locating and changing speeds, he's got you at his
mercy," Jones said. "It sounds crazy to say that a guy who throws 86,
87 miles an hour can do that to major league hitters. But the fact of
the matter is that he's perfected the art of pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Glavine, who's in the final year of his contract after spending
his entire career with the Braves, would like to pitch at least three
more seasons, preferably in Atlanta. He's also started pondering his
legacy--and that likely spot in Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it," Glavine said.
"If I can do anything to improve my chances, that's even better."</TE>
<TE>   In his last start, Glavine allowed just two hits in seven
scoreless innings for an 11-0 victory over Minnesota, lowering his
road ERA to an astounding 0.71.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, coincidentally, beat Glavine's Braves in the classic
1991 World Series. No one from Minnesota's championship team is still
around, but Glavine just keeps rolling along -- a major reason
Atlanta is on track for its 11th straight division title.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so good," marveled Twins first baseman Matthew LeCroy, "the
catcher never has to move his glove for a pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Glavine struggled the first half of last season, leaving many to
wonder if baseball's new edict on the strike zone--higher and
tighter, like the rule book says--would transform him into just
another pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he transformed himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pitching now," said Greg Maddux, a teammate and fellow Cy
Young winner. "He's using all of his pitches on both sides of the
plate and he's mixing his pitches up better. You can't guess with him
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   For years, hitters complained that Glavine never threw many
strikes, leaving his changeup a few inches off the outside corner but
counting on the umpire to give him the call.</TE>
<TE>   He needed a little time to adjust when the strike zone was
squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   "The umpire knows it's a ball, the hitter knows it's a ball, you
can throw it there 10 more times it's already been established it's a
ball," Glavine said. "I think that's what I was getting caught up in.
I got overly stubborn and saying, 'Well, I'll keep throwing it there
and it's going to be a strike and I'm going to get an out, because I
want it to be a strike."'</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came almost a year ago, in a June 18 game
against Florida. Glavine was handed a 5-0 lead but couldn't hold it.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, he was joined on the bench by John Smoltz, yet
another of the Braves' Cy Young winners.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoltzie came over and laid some things on the line for me,"
Glavine recalled. "He said I had given in to the strike zone or just
accepted the fact that things weren't going the way I wanted them to.
He said he didn't see the same fire he was used to seeing from me.
Sometimes, we all need a kick in the butt."</TE>
<TE>   So, Glavine changed, although the adjustments were so slight
hardly anyone noticed.</TE>
<TE>   No change there.</TE>

<DH>Golfer Dudley Hart is more concerned about keeping up with
his newborn triplets, who arrived premature, than with going on
birdie binges</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN WINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Pro golfer Dudley Hart answers his front door holding a baby.</LD>
<LD>   Behind him, where the spotless living room looks out onto a
swimming pool, it's as quiet as a Masters gallery. But in the family
room, there are signs of life--lots of it.</LD>
<LD>   A large pile of tiny clothes covers the coffee table. There are
three car seats, three baby rockers and three clipboards for Hart's
wife, Suzanne, to record feeding times and diaper changes.</LD>
<TE>   "We have three of everything," Hart says.</TE>
<TE>   They have triplets.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is one of the top golfers on the PGA Tour, and this Father's
Day, he'll be playing with a threesome--Abigail Grace, Rachel Diane
and Ryan Dudley. Born three months premature on Dec. 6, they were
released from the hospital 11 weeks later, and the babies and mom are
doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   So is dad, who already has three top-10 finishes this year--at
Atlanta, New Orleans and Fort Worth. Going into this weekend's U.S.
Open, he ranked 31st on the PGA Tour money list with $899,542, which
will buy a lot of diapers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I played well the past few weeks--out of necessity,"
Hart jokes. "Nah, I wouldn't say there's more pressure, but there's
definitely extra motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I get more focused because I figure if I'm out there and play
well and make the best of the time, maybe I won't have to play quite
as many tournaments, so I can be home a little more."</TE>
<TE>   Genial and easygoing away from the course, Hart the golfer has
been known for a quick temper since he was a club-flinging teenager.
But his father, Chuck, says parenthood is helping Dudley's career by
teaching him patience and a new perspective.</TE>
<TE>   At the Colonial last month, he finished fourth despite three
double bogeys and a triple bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "In his past few events, what we've seen is he's not beating up on
himself quite so badly," Chuck Hart says. "A year ago, a triple bogey
in the second round would have sent him home--he would have missed
the cut. But he's taking that kind of stuff more in stride, because
all of a sudden, something is more important than golf."</TE>
<TE>   Hart, 33, admits the challenge of raising triplets is less
daunting for a successful professional golfer. The Rochester, N.Y.,
native and former Florida Gator has finished in the top 60 on the
money list each of the last six years, and his career earnings total
$6.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing I thank God for every day--it was never really a
concern about money," Hart says. "We're lucky that we don't really
have to worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   The Harts have a spacious two-story home, a daytime nanny, a
nighttime nurse and a maid once a week. Because of a marketing
relationship, they receive Similac infant formula free, a savings of
thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the transition from two Harts to a full house required an
adjustment, especially for Dudley, who had never changed a diaper.
The days can become a bit of a blur, but it helps that Suzanne keeps
copious records of diaper changes, medication and meals.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to because I forget--who did I just feed?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   The couple knew there was a chance of a multiple birth because
they used an in-vitro procedure. Hart was on the road in July when
Suzanne saw her doctor to find out how many children to expect.</TE>
<TE>   After completing the first round at the Western Open, Hart phoned
home for a report.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very anxious to know if we were going to have one, two,
three, four, five, six or however many," Hart says. "The conversation
went like this: I said, 'Honey, how many?' She said, 'We have three.'
I said, 'Oh my God. I'll call you back.' Click.</TE>
<TE>   "I was totally shocked. I played great that week, but I didn't
sleep two hours a night. I just stared at the ceiling thinking, 'I
know it's going to be three girls, because I wasn't the best boy in
the world going through college, so this will be payback. That's
three weddings, three private schools, three college educations--how
are we going to do all this?' "</TE>
<TE>   The shock subsided and Hart was delighted when tests determined
one of the babies was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Everything after that is gravy. I've got my little man
in there, and I've got two beautiful girls,' " Hart says. "Three
girls would have been serious stress."</TE>
<TE>   The triplets are fraternal, which means they don't look alike. And
their personalities are already distinct:</TE>
<TE>   Abigail, the smallest, is easygoing and such a flirt that even
Sergio Garcia has been smitten. "He came up and she smiled and he
said, 'OK, I'll take my girlfriend,' " Suzanne says.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel likes to have her head up so she can see what's going on.
"She's more maintenance," Dudley says.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan tends to get teed off. "He seems to have inherited the Hart
temper," Dudley says. "When he's hungry, he screams, and he is loud.
He's got this vein on his head that looks like it's going to pop:
'Feed me immediately. Not in 10 seconds. Now!' "</TE>
<TE>   Because they were premature, each weighing about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds
at birth, the triplets are weeks behind in their development.</TE>
<TE>   They sleep a lot, but rarely all at the same time. They go through
two dozen bottles and two dozen diapers a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much 24-7 right now," Hart says. "It only takes one
of them to be awake for you to be awake."</TE>
<TE>   Hart felt guilty leaving his family, but with so many mouths to
feed, he returned to the tour in January after a three-month layoff.</TE>
<TE>   Because the nanny works five days a week, Suzanne occasionally
finds herself the only adult in the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are long days, because it's just constant and there's no
adult interaction," she says. "You may have 20 minutes of down time,
but that's when you make a bottle or throw a load of laundry in or
try to pick up."</TE>
<TE>   She and the kids began to accompany Dudley on the road last month,
and Suzanne has already been out to the course, taking one baby at a
time while the nanny stays with the other two.</TE>
<TE>   Day care provided by the PGA Tour is an option, too, and the
family will miss only two of Hart's tournaments this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The couple adjusted so well to parenthood that Suzanne is already
talking about having another baby.</TE>
<TE>   "Not now," she adds hastily. "In a couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   First they'll celebrate Dudley's first Father's Day as a dad. He
likes the role, even if it means less sleep and more dirty laundry,
his included.</TE>
<TE>   Babe in arms, he laughs when Rachel spits up on his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "You slimed me!" Hart says to his daughter, grinning at the mess.</TE>
<TE>   He has learned that as the father of triplets, it's par for the
course.</TE>

<HD>I-Rod Has Turned Into Lone Ranger</HD>
<DH>Catcher is a free agent after season and future is
uncertain in Texas</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN HAWKINS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Ivan Rodriguez leans back in a black leather chair, his hands wrapped
around a bat and his eyes fixed upon a TV showing video of the next
opponent.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 7 Texas Rangers jersey hangs behind him, awaiting
Rodriguez as it has since he became a starter as a 19-year-old
rookie.</LD>
<LD>   He often goes through his pregame routine without being noticed,
thanks to a huge post that hides his locker. And that's fine with the
30-year-old catcher, who has been to 10 All-Star games and won 10
Gold Gloves.</LD>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro, his close friend who sits nearby, finds it hard
to imagine that scene playing out in any other clubhouse. He knows,
however, that it's a possibility--with Rodriguez eligible for free
agency after this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you ever think A-Rod would be a Ranger? Did you ever think
Griffey would be a Cincinnati Red?" Palmeiro said. "If those two guys
can switch teams, so can Pudge, and so can anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Rodriguez would like to spend the rest of his career in
Texas, where he has always been one of the team's most popular
players. But he's also expected to seek at least $15 million a season
in his new contract.</TE>
<TE>   He's not likely to get that from Ranger owner Tom Hicks, who is
planning to slash the team's $105 million payroll after this season,
their third straight in last place.</TE>
<TE>   "Pudge's first choice is to play the rest of his career in Texas,
so the last thing we intend to do is close the door, especially at
this premature stage," said his agent, Jeff Moorad. "Irrespective of
the owner's comment, it's too early to project what the position will
be."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager John Hart said the Rangers want to see how
Rodriguez responds from a series of injuries, the latest a herniated
disc in his back that kept him out seven weeks, before addressing his
contract situation.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez is in the final year of the $42 million, five-year
contract he signed in 1997 when he walked into the office of
then-club president Tom Schieffer and made the deal.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Rodriguez isn't planning to make any deals on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll leave that to my agent and see what happens later," he said.
"It's got to be fair. It's got to be something that I'm going to be
happy with."</TE>
<TE>   His focus is on the field. Heading into a weekend series at
Houston, he has played only 18 games (.299, no homers, 8 RBIs), just
six since coming off the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries have hampered Rodriguez since he was the AL MVP in 1999,
when he was the first catcher since Thurman Munson in 1976 to win
that award.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was hitting .347 with 27 homers and 83 RBIs through 91
games in 2000 when a broken thumb ended his season. Last year, he
played 111 games (.308, 25 homers, 65 RBIs) before having knee
surgery for tendinitis.</TE>
<TE>   Even though 1,340 major league games as a catcher appear to be
taking their toll, Rodriguez insists he is healthy and wants to spend
the rest of his career behind the plate. And he plans to be around
for many more years.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to catch. Simply put, that's the position I want to be,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his quiet clubhouse demeanor, Rodriguez is still one of the
game's most exciting players, whether at bat or in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez throws out half of the runners who try to steal, and
he's always trying to pick off others with a quick throw. He often
punctuates a big play, whether his own or one by a teammate, with a
fist pump and a smile that is revealed when he removes his mask.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look over the history of baseball, only eight to 10
catchers have really distinguished themselves," said Hall of Fame
catcher Johnny Bench. "They only come around once a decade, so it's
his decade. I'm glad I had the last century, because he can't have
that."</TE>
<TE>   Bench, a 14-time All-Star who won two NL MVP awards (1970, 1972),
was in Texas to present Rodriguez with his 10th Gold Glove, the one
that matched Bench for the most by a catcher.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one Johnny Bench, yet Rodriguez is the Johnny Bench
of this era," said Cincinnati Manager Bob Boone, a seven-time Gold
Glove winner and four-time All-Star during his 19 major league
seasons as a catcher. "He's absolutely comparable to Bench."</TE>
<TE>   Bench and Rodriguez are the only catchers to start nine
consecutive All-Star games.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez still has a chance to make it 10.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he was out nearly two months, Rodriguez is so popular
that he had an early lead in the fan voting to be the All-Star
starter again. Jorge Posada of the New York Yankees has overtaken him
slightly in the tally.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a class of his own," Palmeiro said. "His career isn't
done yet. He's got a lot to do yet, but his talent level is
unmatched. It's unbelievable what he's been able to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Like the 37-year-old Palmeiro, the primary goal for Rodriguez is
to win a World Series before his career is over.</TE>
<TE>   "The 10 Gold Gloves, the All-Star games, the MVP and all of that,
there's still nothing better than having a ring on your hand,"
Rodriguez said. "That is the one thing I really want to have."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers were eliminated in the opening round by the Yankees in
their only three postseason appearances (1996, 1998 and 1999). They
have been in last place in the AL West since.</TE>
<TE>   "He has done it all as a player, offensively and defensively. Now
he needs to win a championship," said Rangers All-Star shortstop Alex
Rodriguez. "If he does that, he definitely will be the greatest
catcher of all time."</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: A 10-time All-Star, Ivan Rodriguez's injury problems
and salary demands will probably leave him no option but to leave
Texas, where he'd like to finish his sterling career.</CP>

<HD>Appreciating Torrey Pines' Craftsman Style</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I enjoyed reading about the Lodge at Torrey Pines ("Evoking the Past
by Design," May 19), with its Craftsman construction.</LD>
<LD>   During a vacation in 1997, we visited the Stickley Furniture
factory in Manlius, N.Y., where we were fortunate to receive tours of
the modern factory and the not-yet-open Stickley Museum, in one of
the old factory buildings toward town. They showed us much of the
classic, original Stickley furniture and also its evolution into some
newer pieces. Our host at Stickley suggested that we stay at the
Craftsman Inn in Fayetteville, N.Y.; (800) 797-4464,
www.craftsmaninn.com.</LD>
<LD>   The lobby and the dining room beautifully represented the Arts and
Crafts style, and the complex was furnished with Stickley pieces. The
dining room (where we had a fine dinner) was furnished in the Mission
style, and I was delighted that our room was furnished in the 18th
century Cherry Valley style.</LD>
<TE>   Even if it has no connection with the Craftsman Inn, I am pleased
that the Lodge at Torrey Pines has received such glowing notices.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed the article on Cambria ("Cambria's Seaside Stage," May 26),
where we stayed some years ago in a delightful group of cottages near
the ocean. I noted the word "boardwalk" in the article and assume
that this meant a walkway made of wood planks laid over sandy areas
to protect pedestrians, as they have in East Coast beach communities.
Many people here mistakenly refer to any cement, stone or other
pathway adjacent to the ocean as a "boardwalk."</LD>
<LD>   Cambria's grooming, its restaurants and its people were well worth
the long drive.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "In Patriotic Times, Rushmore Calls" (June 2): I grew up in
the Black Hills of South Dakota. In the early 1930s my parents drove
us out from Rapid City, S.D., to see Gutzon Borglum carving the four
American presidents. We spread out a picnic lunch under some pine
trees and gazed upward at the growing monument. My siblings, Melvin
and Viola, tried to climb the rock until a park ranger chased them
away.</LD>

to Find Art, History and Beauty in Cemeteries," Her World, April 14).
I'm a former Chicagoan living near Cincinnati. If you ever travel
here, check out Spring Grove (Ohio) Cemetery right off Interstate 75
north of town. As payment for fighting in the war, several
Revolutionary soldiers were awarded land rights in this area, and
some of them are buried in Spring Grove. There are also several Civil
War generals, as well as pillars of our corporate culture.</LD>
<LD>   I believe it's modeled after Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.</LD>

<HD>Over the Rainbow in Trout Country</HD>
<DH>On a stretch of river in the Grand Canyon at Lees Ferry,
fly-fishing and scenery claim the senses</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM BOOTH</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>LEES FERRY, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>It all appears so wild and true. The water is big and cold and clear.
The fish are the color of vacation sunsets. You can see them,
shouldering into the current, ready, able and wily.</LD>
<LD>   It's all a trick.</LD>
<LD>   The lovely ecosystem at Lees Ferry, Ariz., is about as phony as
the jungle ride at Disneyland.</LD>
<TE>   But what do I care? I want to go fishing.</TE>
<TE>   I had heard about this spot for years, the stretch of river in the
Grand Canyon where you can stalk rainbow trout with a fly rod. I
treated myself by stopping on the way home to Los Angeles after
covering the Winter Games in February in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   It was pure gluttony.</TE>
<TE>   So I don't really mind that the federal beavers at the Bureau of
Reclamation dammed the Colorado at Glen Canyon in the 1960s and that
the desert river now rises and falls each day with the push of a
button, based on the operation of electric turbines needed to power
air conditioners in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Or that the river here is dam- released tail water as clear as gin
and 47 degrees year-round only because it decants from the bottom of
the Lake Powell silt trap.</TE>
<TE>   Or, finally, that the cold-water species of rainbow trout were
planted here only for my enjoyment.</TE>
<TE>   The fish are here to be caught. They're wild but not native.
Chosen for their good genes, vigor and fast growth, they were poured
into the river by the Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department, along with
their food, the gammarus shrimp that serve as a primary resource for
the trout.</TE>
<TE>   Before the dam, the river was silty brown and warm. There were
catfish--no trout--and what is now Lake Powell was Glen Canyon, which
writer Edward Abbey compared with the Taj Mahal and the cathedral of
Chartres. Then the canyon was drowned and buried in mud.</TE>
<TE>   Abbey's tough and poetic eulogy, "Desert Solitaire," is sold in
the gift shop at the Foster family's Marble Canyon Lodge, and I
bought a copy. I booked a day on the river, ate an appalling haunch
of fried steak under cruel gravy at the cafe, and went to sleep in
the motel, reading Abbey and listening to the couple in the next
room, who sounded as if they were bowling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Up before dawn, last bit of moon, and I walked over to the fly
shop, bought a license, rented a pair of waders and met young Dave
Trimble, my guide for the day. He was in a rush, and you have to love
that. He goes fishing almost every day, and he is still in a hurry to
go fishing. We trailed his boat down through boulder fields and
reached the Colorado at the old site of Lees Ferry, where the
pioneers crossed in buckboard wagons before the automobile bridges
were built. You can still see the ferry cable on the shoreline. Those
were hard and capable people.</TE>
<TE>   We were going upstream through Marble Canyon to work the 15-mile
stretch between Lees Ferry and the dam, the section where motorized
fishing boats are permitted to chase the trophy trout. At the put-in,
another group was loading rubber rafts to begin its trip downstream
into the Grand Canyon, a journey that takes about a week in motorized
rafts.</TE>
<TE>   It was cold enough to make me miss my gloves. (If you go now, be
prepared to be hot. Temperatures last week were in the high 90s and
low 100s, but that 47-degree water will keep you cool, and the
outside temperatures don't affect the fishing.)</TE>
<TE>   The sunlight had only just begun to reach the top of the red stone
canyon walls a thousand feet above us. When Maj. John Wesley Powell
descended through these canyons, the first white explorer to do so,
he sometimes felt as though he were passing through a "terrible and
gloomy underworld." But Powell never knew what lay around the next
bend.</TE>
<TE>   Trimble powered the aluminum outboard skiff up the river, careful
to keep to the channels. He looked happy driving his boat, and I
hoped I looked happy too. About five miles from Lees Ferry, we pulled
up to a gravel bar and tossed out the anchor. Time to get out and
fish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fly-fishing has, unfortunately, taken on an elitist cast, no pun
intended, and the sport today wraps itself in needless arcana and
expensive ritual. To fly-fish well takes practice and thought, not
fancy pants. To fly-fish badly, as I do, is as joyous a way to goof
off in the outdoors as anything invented.</TE>
<TE>   Trimble, however, was intent on catching trout.</TE>
<TE>   He knew all the ruses. We waded out to the edge of a riffle, a
mini-rapid that some anglers insist on calling a "feeding lane." On
this early spring morning, Trimble decided that the trout might want
to eat something called a midge.</TE>
<TE>   He rigged up a beadhead nymph, a lure that looks like black lint
plucked from a baby's bellybutton. Wrapped around a barbless hook, it
was a tiny thing, and Trimble attached a BB to the line to help it
sink a few feet.</TE>
<TE>   Trimble pointed. The river was thigh-high and freezing. I cast and
began shaking more line out of the reel, a technique called mending,
so the nymph sank, bumping the bottom, and the line floated along in
the current, nice and easy, in a way that is pleasing and
natural-looking to the discerning fish eye.</TE>
<TE>   It is my experience that trout generally spend their days hidden
from sight and not eating or taking artificial flies, except when
photographers from fishing magazines are present. Standing in the
middle of the Colorado River, chilled to the bone, Trimble pointed to
our feet. Trout were circling around like curious house pets.</TE>
<TE>   When we shuffled, he said, our boots stirred up food. Why couldn't
we just dangle a nymph at our knees? Trimble thought that was
hilarious. It would be cheating. So I continued casting and mending
and retrieving.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The exercise began to warm my shoulders and back. In an hour, the
sunshine had crawled down to the river's edge, and now the tower
walls were no longer gray Manhattan but red and purple and streaked
with desert varnish, the oxides of iron painting the canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Still no fish.</TE>
<TE>   I had begun to pay slightly less attention to Trimble's
ministrations to the line. The boy likes to fish. We drove the boat
from spot to spot. We switched flies because a good guide like
Trimble knows that the real bugs and shrimp that the trout eat change
from dawn to dusk, as the river rises and falls, and living shrimp
die and change colors, and so the colors of the lures must change.</TE>
<TE>   From gray to olive to pink to orange. We tossed the trout glow
bugs, scuds, stimulators, woolly buggers and rubber band worms.</TE>
<TE>   Warmth spread now across the whole canyon, river and walls, and
the scene was as bright as a Polynesian painting. Coffee poured from
the thermos tasted deliriously rich. An apple exploded when I bit
into it. The desert smelled alternately like hot coins, smoking sage
and a deep, wet musk from the river. Wrens whistled. A hawk wheeled
and turned its back on us. I didn't really care about fishing
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   And so we immediately began catching trout, which was distracting.</TE>

<DH>The venerable British Museum, nearing 250, has been
transformed, and its collection still wows crowds</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER WHITTLE</AU>
<BD>Peter Whittle is a Los Angeles-based writer and TV
broadcaster.</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>An unapologetically grand institution, the British Museum could claim
to be a country in itself. Like the Vatican, it is almost a
mini-nation, one that offers a tour of some of the world's greatest
sights and achievements in a single shot, has 2 1/2 centuries of
market research to recommend it, and requires neither money nor
passport.</LD>
<LD>   The museum offers an unrivaled grandstand tour of global culture
ancient and modern, from Greece and Rome to Korea and Japan by way of
North America and medieval Europe to Africa and Egypt. And with more
than 5.5 million visitors a year, it certainly boasts a healthier
tourist trade than many countries.</LD>
<LD>   But the museum is definitely a place with an address, nestled
massive and imposing amid the narrow, quaint streets of the
Bloomsbury district. And next year it will celebrate its 250th
anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   I had not visited the museum since I was a child in London, so,
after hearing about the magnificence of the new Great Court--designed
by acclaimed English architect Norman Foster and built to celebrate
the new millennium--I chose a typically overcast London afternoon for
a return visit.</TE>
<TE>   If you're coming off traffic-cramped and tourist-laden Great
Russell Street, it's impossible not to be impressed by the huge
forecourt, with stone steps leading up to rows of classical columns.
The majesty of the entrance, designed in 1823 by Robert Smirke,
almost guarantees something special waiting within.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance hall, with its high ceilings, massive stone stairway
on the left and newly repainted but muted classical decoration, is
gloomy and overbearing. But pass through quickly to the crowning
glory of the museum, opened by Queen Elizabeth II two years ago.
You'll be stopped in your tracks. Like a kind of secret city, the
Great Court has sprung up inside the familiar gray exterior of the
museum and has transformed it from the inside.</TE>
<TE>   It's Europe's largest covered public square, comprising two acres
of marble floors and white Portland stone walls. Before, the
courtyard was open to the sky and housed a bleak maze of storage
rooms and book depositories for the British Library. The library,
with its circular Reading Room, had been an integral part of the
museum until most of its books were moved in 1998 to a new building
nearby on Euston Road, leaving the Reading Room in splendid
isolation. It dominates the Great Court, which encompasses it.</TE>
<TE>   The Reading Room's magnificence--its soaring arched windows, the
yellow, white and gold leaf rotunda--made the hairs on the back of my
neck stand up. Its sheer scale and height, the thousands of remaining
books and its churchlike quietness made me feel more intelligent just
by standing in it. It's as if somebody cut the dome off the U.S.
Capitol, placed it on the ground and built a library inside it.</TE>
<TE>   The place where Karl Marx came to write "Das Kapital" now houses
the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre, another venue from which to
explore the museum. From 50 computer terminals, visitors can access
images and information on thousands of the museum's 6 million
objects. The 12,000 volumes from the Paul Hamlyn Library, which now
adorn the circular shelves, also deal with aspects of the collection.
And, unlike in the past when you had to be a member of the British
Library to use the Reading Room, now everybody can enjoy it: Get a
free ticket when you visit, go in and stay as long as you like.</TE>
<TE>   The roof over the Great Court is a 65,000-square-foot canopy of
glass and crisscrossing steel, and through it I could see the sun had
finally deigned to appear. The hundreds of visitors--predominantly
German, Japanese and American--were ambling along, without that
relentlessly joyless air of tourists "doing" a place.</TE>
<TE>   Two open-plan cafes, some discreetly placed museum shops selling
an excellent array of books and the obligatory mugs, and the odd
ancient sculptures made me feel that I was in a living and breathing
classical piazza. This is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful
modern additions to London's architecture that I have seen in years.</TE>
<TE>   And the work goes on. To celebrate next year's anniversary, the
King's Library, one of the finest 19th century interiors in London,
which runs along the right side of the Great Court, is being
restored. It holds the libraries of Kings George II and III, and next
year it will contain a look-but-don't-touch permanent exhibition on
18th century learning and discovery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So where to start the international tour? There are nearly 100
display rooms, a daunting prospect for the average visitor who spends
only about three hours in the museum. It's impossible to see it all
in one shot, so it's best to stick to the highlights and take in as
much as you can on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Having toured the Reading Room with a succinct, indispensable $4
Visit Guide in hand, I made my way to the first of the Egyptian
Galleries, which are to the left of the Great Court. The Egyptian
Galleries are by far the most popular in the museum, and sure enough
these rooms, dominated by the monumental head of Ramses II, were the
most crowded--although it was still possible to get close to the
exhibits. It's one of the most important collections of its kind
outside Cairo, covering Egyptian culture from about 4000 BC to the
12th century AD. Wandering in and out of the display of sculptures
made me feel that I was at an indoor Valley of the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Walking between the pair of colossal 9th century BC human-headed
winged lions, which once guarded the Assyrian palace at Nimrud, would
give anyone more of a thrill than a ride at an amusement park. Not
that museum visitors are any better informed than those at a theme
park. There were little knots of tours going on, led by specialists
with a dogged enthusiasm and a sometimes-exasperated air. As I passed
one group, I heard a guide wearily explain to a young girl who had
asked where "antiquity" actually was on the map, that no, she was
talking about a concept rather than a place.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of about 20 French tourists in the gallery had gathered
around a glass case that held one of the highlights of the Egyptian
collection: the Rosetta Stone, the key to ancient hieroglyphics
discovered by a couple of 18th century Frenchmen. Up close, this
archeological treasure displays little of its iconic status. It's
just a hunk of black rock covered in writing, but it's one of the
museum's most-visited exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted a bit more mystery in my history, so I moved on to the
collection of mummies, which is on the second floor and best reached
by going back into the Great Court and taking one of the new stone
stairways that encircle the Reading Room.</TE>
<TE>   Food and drink are always an integral part of any vacation,
however short, so on the way to Egypt Part Two, I stopped for tea in
the new Court restaurant, which sits at the top of the stairs
overlooking the Reading Room dome. There was a time when museum food
in London was as tired and old as some of the exhibits, but in the
harshly competitive new world of leisure, most institutions have had
to pull their socks up, as they say here. The Court is one of the
best museum restaurants I've tried: modern, spacious and reasonably
priced (a traditional English tea costs $9), with--atypically
British--obliging service. The view down into the Reading Room was so
spectacular that I lingered and watched the human ants below.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In life, they say, we are surrounded by death, which may explain
why the Egyptian mummies and funeral equipment exert such a pull. Or
maybe it's the ersatz familiarity brought on by Hollywood movies. The
fascination is particularly strong among kids, who swarmed around the
encased bodies, perhaps expecting that one might suddenly come to
life.</TE>
<TE>   A heavily bandaged Cleopatra--another one, not the Queen of the
Nile--was the center of most attention. Exquisitely detailed gold
caskets for ancient dignitaries with snappy names like Henutmehyt and
Tjentmutengebtiu sit among objects put into their stone sarcophagi to
see them on their way to the afterlife. The beauty of the displays
here is that you don't need to know details. The aura cast by the
pieces manages to speak to visitors across centuries.</TE>
<TE>   I went back downstairs, nodded to Ramses II on the way and moved
on to ancient Greece and the Parthenon Galleries. In recent years
these galleries have been at the center of controversy because they
house the Elgin Marbles, sculptural friezes and broken decorative
sculptural pieces taken from the Parthenon in Athens and brought to
England in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin. Greek officials have
long campaigned for their return, but the museum and Britain's
government insist that they are here to stay.</TE>
<TE>   The quarrel is only the tip of the iceberg, because, as the
politically correct argument goes, much of what the museum displays
is plunder from years of British global imperialist domination. But
most visitors I asked in the gallery seemed indifferent to the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The main gallery, which is long, elegant and spare, allows the
sculptures to be shown as they were in their original setting. At
each end, stone remnants of horses' heads, swirling robes and seated
gods are gracefully and accurately placed so you find yourself trying
to rebuild the Parthenon to its former glory in your head. (To help
you, there's a scale model in the middle of the gallery.) Along each
of the connecting walls, friezes depict processions of horsemen and
warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to visit another country and finding that many of the
Asian galleries were closed for refurbishment, I went on to the new
Sainsbury African Galleries in the basement. On the way I had a
whistle-stop tour through countless underpopulated smaller rooms,
most of which were crowded with stark glass cases typical of older
museums. Prehistory, Ancient Anatolia, Later Mesopotamia--all were
way too dull to interest anyone but academics.</TE>
<TE>   When the museum's new director, Neil McGregor, arrives later this
summer from Britain's National Gallery, he will have his work cut out
for him dealing with the recently publicized financial troubles and
averting staff layoffs. Once he has faced these problems he should
turn his attention to the displays. Despite the inspirational new
building and excellent Roman, Greek and Egyptian collections, a large
part of the collection is still unimaginatively presented. As its
director for 15 years, McGregor managed to popularize the National
Gallery without dumbing it down. Perhaps he can work the same magic
here.</TE>
<TE>   The African galleries were alive, vividly colorful and
dramatically presented. Life-size models of warriors in ceremonial
costume, video displays, music and theatrical lighting made a great
counterpoint to the abundance of stone and glass upstairs. The
crowning exhibit was a series of 16th century Benin brasses, which,
in their striking modernity, could have been in any contemporary art
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   That was it for the day. I would have to return to see the
Americas, Oceania and the finest collection of drawings, prints and
coins found anywhere. Nevertheless I felt that I had learned more
about the world in one afternoon than I would have if I had gone on a
six-week package tour with a McDonald's at every stop.</TE>
<TE>   The British Museum does not patronize its visitors, and if it
appears a little unyielding, that's not a bad trait in a world that
yields too much.</TE>

<LD>Summer might be the slow season for ski resorts, but North America's
mountain villages don't hibernate during the warm months. Instead of
schussing, visitors mountain bike, hike, go white-water rafting or
play golf and tennis. Many of the resorts and ski towns host
festivals and concerts in summer and offer discounted packages to
make a visit even more tempting.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a sampling:</LD>
<LD>   * Salt Lake City: Utah's leading city hosted the 2002 Winter
Olympics, but what impressed people were the mountains many miles
away, where the bulk of the outdoor events took place. To attract
visitors to Utah before and after the Games, ski resorts offered
discounts of $20.02. A similar program is in effect this summer, with
many of the state's hotels, motels, condominiums and inns offering
20.02% discounts to those staying two nights or more. The discount is
valid throughout the state, so if you are going to a ski town or
anywhere else in Utah this summer or fall, inquire about it. For
details and a list of participating accommodations, call (866)
733-8824 or visit www.utah.com. Reservations should be made directly
with your chosen accommodation.</LD>
<TE>   * Canada's Whistler Area: The Whistler-Blackcomb Resort in British
Columbia is one of the biggest ski resorts in North America. Thanks
primarily to a favorable exchange rate for the Canadian dollar,
prices are lower than you might expect, in both winter and summer.
This summer, the resort is offering an array of special packages
combining two nights' double-occupancy lodging with activities such
as guided mountain-bike rides, back-country tours in a Hummer,
white-water rafting, fishing with an expert, ATV rides and mini-golf.
Rates for the packages range between $99 and $179 per person. Call
(888) 403-4727 or go online at www.whistler-blackcomb.com to find out
more.</TE>
<TE>   * Vermont's Resort Star: The biggest ski resort in the East is
offering some attractive summer packages. Killington Resort, really a
collection of several mountains and villages in central Vermont,
somehow managed to keep its ski slopes open through June 1 this year.
And when the skiing ended, the summer specials began. Stay at least
two midweek nights in Killington during the summer, and you'll pay as
little as $41 per person per night, based on two people sharing a
standard hotel room or four in a one-bedroom condo with kitchen. Some
packages include a Killington adventure pass, which allows you to
take advantage of many activities, including a gondola to a mountain
peak, going mountain biking, riding an alpine slide or water slide,
or spending an afternoon at a skateboard park. For reservations, call
(877) 458-4637 or visit www.killington.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Montana's Big Mountain: It's found in the northwest corner of
the state, just a few miles from Glacier National Park, and it
combines a spectacular natural setting with low summer prices. The
best offer, good through Sept. 29, is a three-night special at
Hibernation House. Package rates start at $199 per person, double
occupancy, including breakfast, gondola ride, a half-day hike with a
guide, and a half-day mountain bike rental. Call (800) 858-5439 or
visit www.bigmtn.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Copper Mountain, Colo.: In the heart of the Rockies two hours
from Denver, this Summit County resort offers a golfer's special all
summer: $109 per person, double occupancy, for one night's lodging
and one round at the Copper Creek Golf Course. Call (888) 219-2441 or
go to www.coppersummer.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Colorado's Winter Park Resort: Within another easy drive from
Denver you have a variety of options for combining lodging and
outdoor activities. A sample: four nights' double-occupancy hotel
accommodations, an all-day rafting trip on the Colorado River and a
half-day activity pass starts at $260 all summer. Winter Park offers
free concerts every Saturday in July.</TE>
<TE>   There also will be a jazz festival the weekend of July 13 with
Average White Band and Lee Ritenour. A rock festival is planned the
weekend of July 20 with Sheryl Crow, Ziggy Marley, the Indigo Girls
and the B-52's. For more details, call (800) 979-0332 or visit
www.winterparkresort.com.</TE>

<HD>A Love Affair With Small-Town Itailian Ports, Aboard the
Casanova</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH</AU>
<BD>Shirley Slater and Harry Basch travel as guests of the
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears twice a month.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frequent cruisers are always looking for new waters to explore, so
when Peter Deilmann Cruises announced last year that its new
94-passenger Casanova would sail on Italy's Po River out of Venice,
we signed up for a week last August.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a heat wave that blanketed Italy, we had a wonderful time,
especially in the colorful, canal-lined town of Chioggia, a sort of
poor man's Venice on the Adriatic Sea. The Casanova docked there for
an afternoon and an overnight stay, and while most passengers took an
afternoon bus excursion to Padua, we played hooky. Chioggia, bustling
with locals on market day, was a surprise. The only other tourists we
saw were fellow passengers from the Casanova, exploring the town on
their return from the tour.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the other small-town ports where we docked for visits to
cities such as Bologna were less colorful, intended primarily as an
embarkation point for the tour buses. When we chose to skip the shore
tours, we enjoyed walks into town or around the countryside.</LD>
<TE>   This summer the Casanova will sail every Saturday round trip from
Venice with optional shore excursions to the historic cities of
Padua, Bologna, Parma, Cremona, Verona, Mantua and Ferrara, plus a
full day and overnight stay on board in Venice, which allows time to
explore the city, take a gondola ride and visit nearby Murano, Burano
and Torcello.</TE>
<TE>   This new Peter Deilmann Cruises vessel was the most luxurious
European river cruise we've experienced.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers aboard our sailing included about two dozen
Americans and Brits; the rest were Europeans, and most of them spoke
German. There were separate English and German tours if there were
enough passengers to fill two buses; otherwise the guide alternated
explanations in both languages to one busload. The ship's hotel
director and most of the cooking and service staff are Austrian.</TE>
<TE>   Public areas aboard the Casanova are forward on both decks, richly
decorated with paintings from the collection of the company's owner.
There are upholstered chairs and sofas in the lounge with its
granite-topped bar, gold-tasseled silk draperies at the windows and
well-polished brass trim everywhere. The dining room, which is
nonsmoking, is a bright, sunny room with assigned single-seating
tables for four or six.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast and lunch service combine buffet and hot dishes ordered
from a menu; dinner is served at the table. It usually began with an
appetizer, such as smoked duck with cranberry mousse, followed by a
hot or cold soup and a small fish course before a choice of main
courses (which always included one vegetarian selection) and dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Food and service were splendid. Fruits were always ripe and salads
crisp; the cheese tray, with six or eight local selections, was
always at the ideal temperature; and the wine list had a range of
choices and prices.</TE>
<TE>   Two dinners during the week are designated formal, and most
passengers wear tuxedos, dinner jackets or dark suits. Although
jackets (but not ties) are requested every night in the dining room,
many men on our cruise settled for long-sleeved shirts in the hot
weather. Daytime wear is casual, with shorts and T-shirts acceptable
in the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   You'll want to pack sturdy shoes for touring the Po River Valley
towns, because many have cobblestone streets and stone steps, and
skirts or long pants and tops with sleeves are required for visits to
churches.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Deck atop the vessel is furnished with yellow-and-white
striped chairs and loungers that reminded us of the old Giorgio in
Beverly Hills. It offers full bar service as well as celebrations
with sparkling wine, canapes and live music on some evenings.
Everything on the top deck can be folded down when the boat goes
under low bridges on the river; even the wheelhouse was flattened
once or twice during our cruise.</TE>
<TE>   A gift shop and beauty salon share a tiny space behind the
reception desk. One of the many perks is the chance to take your
luggage aboard the ship during the morning and leave it there safely
while you explore Venice, even though check-in and boarding don't
take place until afternoon. This is especially handy for Americans
arriving on early morning planes.</TE>
<TE>   The Casanova has two types of cabins. All have large windows, but
those on Deck 1 have French door-style windows that open; those on
Deck 2, closer to the waterline, have fixed windows. Deck 2 rooms
have a small desk/dresser under the window with additional drawer and
counter-top space lacking in Deck 1 rooms. Beds are fixed, so you
must request twins or a double bed when you book. Two junior suites
(slightly larger than the standard cabins) are also available.
Bathrooms are handsomely designed, with an excellent glassed-in
shower.</TE>
<TE>   Each cabin is stocked with a refrigerated mini-bar, and above it
is a TV set that gets dozens of European channels plus CNN. Movies in
German and English are also screened daily on an in-house channel.</TE>
<TE>   Each night a pianist entertains with pop music and light classics
before and after dinner in the lounge, and in some ports local
entertainers come aboard--an opera singer, a quartet of Venetian
musicians, a musical duo from Mantua who performed songs from "Hello,
Dolly!" that seemed to have been learned phonetically from a record.</TE>
<TE>   The line has also introduced the Frederic Chopin, a new ship that
began seven- and 11-day round-trip cruises from Berlin into eastern
Germany and Poland at the end of March. The season continues through
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-day Casanova cruise/tour package includes a stay in London, a
two-day rail journey to Venice with overnight accommodation in a cozy
compartment on the Venice Simplon-Orient Express, an overnight stay
in Venice and the seven-day cruise. Departures are June 25, July 9
and 23, Aug. 13 and 20, and Sept. 24. Prices start at $4,490 per
person, double occupancy, plus air fare.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise-only prices start at $1,555 per person, double occupancy.
Air fare, gratuities and shore excursions, which begin at about $50
for a half-day city tour, are extra. Excursions may be booked in
advance or aboard the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, contact a travel agent or call the company
at (800) 348-8287, www.deilmann-cruises.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting Aug. 30 you won't have to be a high roller to eyeball a
roomful of jewels in Las Vegas. That's when the Bellagio Gallery of
Fine Art at the casino-resort opens "Faberge and the Age of Imperial
Russia," with scores of the master jeweler's works. Tickets go on
sale today.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit, drawing on the Kremlin State Museum and two private
collections, includes three of the 50 imperial Easter eggs that Peter
Carl Faberge fashioned for the czars' wives and the dowager empress.
They are the 1900 Trans-Siberian Railway Egg, which took nine years
to create and which contains a miniature locomotive and five train
cars; the 1906 Moscow Kremlin Egg, the largest one, with a music box
and a model of Uspenski Cathedral; and the 1908 Alexander Palace Egg,
made of jade and rubies, with portraits of the five children of Czar
Nicholas II.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the more than 100 exhibit items, including cigarette
cases, handbags, jewelry and prayer books, were designed by Faberge,
gallery president Andrea Bundonis said last week. But there will also
be period costumes, including the coronation uniform worn by Nicholas
II.</LD>
<TE>   The show runs through Jan. 26. Advance purchase of tickets is
recommended. Call (877) 957-9777. Prices are $15 for adults, $12 for
students and children 12 and younger. Starting Aug. 30, the gallery
will have expanded hours, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, Bundonis said.</TE>

<TE>   Jungle Luxury and Jaguars at Beach Resort in Belize</TE>
<TE>   A small, exclusive beachside eco-resort has opened in Belize near
the Cockscomb Basin National Park jaguar preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The Kanantik Reef &amp; Jungle Resort, under development for five
years, consists of 25 thatch-roofed, air-conditioned cabanas on a
private Caribbean beach 18 miles south of the town of Dangriga
(formerly Stann Creek) and about 100 miles south of Belize City. Its
name is derived from a Mayan word meaning "to take care," the owners
say.</TE>
<TE>   All-inclusive rates of $300 per person per day, double occupancy,
include all meals (with Belizean beers and local rum); water sports
such as snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking and sailing on catamarans;
and daily guided tours such as bird-watching, canoeing, jungle hiking
and visits to Mayan ruins and the jaguar preserve (four miles north
of the resort). Fishing excursions are available at extra cost.</TE>
<TE>   Guests can fly from Belize City to the resort's private airstrip
or to Dangriga, where a resort driver will meet them, or they can
drive about 2 1/2 hours from Belize City. Contact the resort for
details.</TE>
<TE>   The resort is owned by a private investment group whose principals
include Italians Roberto Fabbri, a former custom yacht salesman, and
financier Francesco Moscatelli. It is their first hotel venture, a
spokeswoman said. (800) 965-9689, www.kanantik.com.</TE>

<TE>   Discount Air Ticket Seller Fined Over Surcharges</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Transportation has fined discount air
ticket seller Cheap Tickets Inc. $30,000 for failing to include fuel
surcharges when it displayed air fares on the Internet and in
newspaper advertisements. The company said it is now in compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Omitting the surcharges, typically $20 each way, makes the fares
appear less expensive.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent consent order, the DOT stated that Cheap Tickets
omitted the surcharges in newspaper advertisements in 2000 and from
its online "Power Search" feature at www.cheaptickets.com. Company
spokeswoman Dawn Lyon said the print ads were corrected in 2000 and
the Web site in June 2001. She said the full price was always
displayed before online visitors bought tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The DOT has been cracking down on Internet sites. In March it
fined Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) and Site59 (www.site59.com)
on charges similar to those in the Cheap Tickets order. Earlier this
month, it issued a notice reminding Internet travel sellers to avoid
putting up banner ads that promote specific discounts, such as "Save
up to 50%," without indicating which air fares the discounts apply
to.</TE>

<TE>   Historic N.Y. Hotel Has New Name, New Look</TE>
<TE>   The landmark Barbizon Hotel on New York's Upper East Side, which
opened in the 1920s as a women's residence, is now the Melrose Hotel,
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia-based Melrose Hotel Co., which bought the property
last year, has finished a $40-million renovation begun by its
previous owners, Mark Lahood, senior vice president of operations,
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel has added the Landmark Restaurant, which serves
breakfast only, and the Library Bar, which serves lunch and dinner.
The lobby now has a coffered ceiling, the 306 guest rooms have
high-speed Internet access, and $1 million in tuck-pointing was
finished, Lahood said. "There were tons of technology updates," he
added. The hotel also has a four-story health club and spa, dating to
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Special summer rates start at $169; regular published rates are
$229 to $329. The hotel is at 140 E. 63rd St. at Lexington Avenue.

<TE>   Traveler's Notes ...</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela has recently begun requiring citizens of the U.S. and
some other countries to have at least six months' validity remaining
on their passports to enter the country, the State Department advised
last week. It said some Americans were denied entry. The department
continues to advise caution while traveling to Venezuela because of
the "unstable political environment and unpredictable security
situation." ... The 463-room Embassy Suites Hotel New York City,
which was damaged in the Sept. 11 attacks and served as a triage and
rest area, reopened last month with a redesigned and renamed
restaurant, Unity. The hotel is at 102 North End Ave.... The 15th
century crown of Margaret of York, sister of England's King Edward
IV, is among rare items on loan through Sept. 29 for the "Castle and
the Crown" exhibit at the Tower of London. (The crown is usually kept
in a German cathedral.) Using artifacts, paintings and documents, the
show explores the Tower's role in coronations and the history of the
Crown Jewels. 011-44-870-756-6060, www.hrp.org.uk. ... Up to four
children younger than 12 can ride free with an adult in first class
from July 15 to Aug. 31 on many of the high-speed Thalys trains in
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Contact Rail Europe,

<HD>Variation on a Theme Park in Gilroy</HD>
<DH>Bonfante Gardens reopens, with lush landscapes providing
the amusement</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>Robert Smaus, formerly the garden editor at The Times,
is the author of "Answers for California Gardeners" (Los Angeles
Times Books, 2002).</BD>
<DL>GILROY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Bonfante Gardens is a new amusement park with an unusual theme:
trees. But not just your average trees. Amazing trees--the creations
of an eccentric gardener named Axel Erlandson, who began training
them into fanciful shapes in the 1920s.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1950s he moved his collection to what he called the Tree
Circus, near Santa Cruz. After his death in 1964, they languished in
a field until businessman and tree fancier Michael Bonfante bought
the collection. In 1984 he managed to move 25 of the trees to his
nursery in Gilroy, where he was determined to make them the
centerpiece of a new amusement park geared for garden lovers and
families with young children. Forget death-defying thrill rides; this
was to be a kinder, gentler place.</LD>
<LD>   Bonfante Gardens Family Theme Park opened in June 2001, and after
closing three months later to resolve financial problems, it reopened
in May. The Circus Trees are the highlight, but other beautiful
specimens and no fewer than five special gardens surround rides,
restaurants and shopping spots in a lushly landscaped park.</LD>
<TE>   The plants are so important that the park has scheduled "gardens
only" days--usually on a Friday--when most of the rides and shops are
closed, making it easier to walk around and look at the plantings.
Last month I used one of these garden days as a springboard to a
weekend in Gilroy, just over the hill from Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   I like to zoom around and see things when I travel, while my wife,
Iris, prefers to relax by a beach. So when I suggested a visit to
Bonfante Gardens, I quickly added that a new B&amp;B called the Pleasure
Point Inn had opened in Santa Cruz. It boasts of having "the best
ocean view," as voted by travelers surveyed by a trade journal. The
inn's large and protected rooftop deck has a big hot tub for relaxing
and sunning. That convinced her.</TE>
<TE>   Early one Friday we flew to San Jose and drove south on U.S. 101,
then west on California 152 (Hecker Pass Highway) to Bonfante
Gardens. The park usually opens at 10 a.m., but on garden days it
doesn't open until noon. We accidentally arrived early, but that was
no problem, with Garlic City Coffee and Tea awaiting in town and lots
of antiques shops on Monterey Street. We killed a couple of hours,
then returned to the park.</TE>
<TE>   On garden days, the standard $29.95 adult admission ($19.95 for
children 3 to 12) is reduced to $10.95. Parking is $2 instead of the
regular $7.</TE>
<TE>   As we drove in, a huge topiary on the hillside spelled out what
was in store: TREESSS. Crossing a wide wood-plank bridge where
sycamores grow up through cutouts, we first spotted a restored 1927
Illions Supreme carousel and another one of the rides, spinning carts
shaped like oversized strawberries. This is an amusement park, after
all, and most of the 22 rides are aimed at the younger set, though a
few are a little wilder.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will see the bright red Strawberry Sundae, Artichoke Dip,
Garlic Twirl, Banana Split, Mushroom Swing, Apple and Worm, and so
on. Everything is bright, colorful and clean, and it looked like
great fun for little kids. I found myself wishing my grown children
were small again, so I could come back and go on the rides with them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On this garden day, mostly adults were in attendance, wearing big
straw gardening hats. A few young children came in tow, and they kept
asking their parents about the rides. "No, dear, they're closed," was
the response, though they could hop on a train that circles the park
or on boats that float though the Rainbow Garden.</TE>
<TE>   The train is a good way to see the 28-acre park. It goes though
the Monarch Garden, a tall greenhouse filled with tropical plants,
waterfalls and monarch butterflies. The Rainbow Garden uses annual
flowers such as blood-red begonias, dahlias and sunny marigolds to
dramatic effect, and floating through it on a slowly turning circular
boat is an especially relaxing way to see the blooms. We went around
three times, our favorite part coming right after the begonias, when
we plunged through a bank of fine mist.</TE>
<TE>   It can get hot in Gilroy, so the park uses water to keep people
feeling cool. At one end are dramatic waterfalls that visitors can
run under, getting good and wet. A big lake sits in the middle, and
some lower cascades run by Claudia's Garden, which is filled with
wild and wacky topiary conifers.</TE>
<TE>   You enter this garden by walking under one of the Circus
Trees--two trees fused together to make a living arch. The Basket
Tree up by the Balloon Flight is the most amazing and intricate
Circus Tree: six sycamores woven together to make one big mesh-like
trunk. It's difficult to figure out how Erlandson did it. Knots,
hearts, spiral staircases and his other amazing tree shapes can be
seen near the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The park has seven eating spots, but on garden days only two are
open. We chose a buffet of roasted chicken and pasta, which was
tasty. After a couple of hours touring the gardens, we headed back to
the car.</TE>
<TE>   On the way is the Gifted Gardener, which sells plants, gear and
other appropriate souvenirs. Plants we had just admired were for sale
here, including a handsome dark-red ground-cover rose that had been
trained into a "standard," or tree shape--one of Iris' favorites. Too
bad it was too big for the plane home.</TE>
<TE>   Highway 152 took us over Hecker Pass to Watsonville and Santa
Cruz. It's a scenic route through the redwoods and past wineries and
nurseries. The Mt. Madonna Inn Restaurant at the top is getting a
mite musty but has a panoramic view of the coast, so we tried it for
dinner. The menu seemed pretty ordinary, so I was surprised when a
side of vegetables turned out to be a delicious broccoli frittata.
The deep-fried artichoke hearts were good too, and my wife enjoyed
her mostaccioli.</TE>
<TE>   After the heat of the day, Santa Cruz felt good--even chilly--and
we were glad our room at the year-old Pleasure Point Inn had a gas
fireplace. Before we had even unpacked, we were up on the roof
unwinding in the hot tub and admiring the expanse of Monterey Bay and
the distant, foggy peninsula. Our room had an ocean view and was
comfortable, with a crisp, modern design. No froufrou, no cutesy, no
country curtains. I learned the next morning that our innkeeper was a
semiretired interior decorator.</TE>
<TE>   He laid out a classy breakfast too, with a centerpiece of melons,
mangoes, kiwi and fresh berries. Delicious breads and pastries from
local bakeries, homemade jam, excellent coffees and teas--we got so
full that we ended up skipping lunch. (Breakfast is included in the
nightly rate, which starts at $160; we paid $211.50 plus tax.)</TE>
<TE>   Both our boys live up north, so they joined us Saturday. While my
wife did her relaxing on the rooftop deck, my sons and I went for a
long walk on the beach, exploring pools at low tide, picking up
shells and watching the surfers. Pleasure Point is considered one of
the best surf spots on the coast, with sweet, shapely swells made
glassy by kelp beds.</TE>
<TE>   After the tide came in, we walked back along a bike path on the
bluff. We were tempted to rent bikes around the corner on 41st
Avenue, because this is such a cycling town. Instead we all took a
boardwalk that runs through wildly overgrown Neary Lagoon, with
entrances off Bay and Blackburn streets. Yard-long carp live in these
cloudy waters. It's a fun, though virtually unknown, outing near the
center of Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, our sons suggested El Palomar downtown on Pacific
Avenue. The restaurant fills the huge, vaulted lobby of an old hotel.
I had enchiladas de cangrejo, with some of the freshest crab I've
tasted. My wife found a favorite, pozole. After dinner we returned to
our inn for a moonlight soak, looking at the stars and the string of
lights circling Monterey Bay. Ahhh.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday we lazed the morning away, went for another walk along the
beach and drove to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center
(www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter) in Santa Cruz, perched on a point above
Natural Bridges State Beach. Like Bonfante, this place would be fun
with little kids. We learned that decorator crabs change their
seaweed camouflage to match their surroundings, that sunflower stars
can move 2 centimeters in six seconds (pretty fast) and that sealskin
is really soft.</TE>
<TE>   Outside sits the fantastic 87-foot skeleton of a blue whale, the
largest on display anywhere, according to the center. Here we said
our goodbyes to Santa Cruz and headed back over the hill, our faces
stinging from a good three-day dose of sun, wind and salt water.</TE>

<HD>Skip the Peak and Take a Dip at 200-Foot Chambers Creek
Falls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lunch alfresco by Chambers Creek Falls is an excellent proposition.
Getting there, however, is no picnic.</LD>
<LD>   To reach the dramatic 200-foot falls and the viewpoints beyond
requires a vigorous ascent over many a switchback. The climb, which
starts about 100 miles north of Sacramento, rewards hikers with great
views of the Chambers Creek and Feather River watersheds.</LD>
<LD>   Three oak species--live, canyon and black--cover lower canyon
slopes. Higher up, look for conifers such as Douglas fir, ponderosa
pine and incense cedar. Higher still are white fir and pine.</LD>
<TE>   Although there are trees aplenty in the canyon, don't expect to
find many next to the trail. The path crosses an exposed slope with
little shade for the first two miles, so you should start in the cool
morning.</TE>
<TE>   If you are particularly ambitious (and fit), you can continue past
the falls on the brutal ascent to Chambers Peak. Most hikers,
however, forsake this ridiculously difficult climb, preferring
instead to take a dip in the nearby creek.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From Sacramento follow California 70
north to Oroville, where the highway trends northeast. Midway between
Oroville and Quincy--about 40 miles--look for a small dirt parking
area and the signed Chambers Creek Trail on the north side of the
highway. (On the south side lie a school and a closed campground.)</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The trail takes the form of a dirt road for 100 yards
before narrowing to cross Granite Creek and ascending parallel to the
North Fork of the Feather River. After half a mile, the trail
switchbacks away from the river and begins a steep climb.
Half-a-dozen challenging, manzanita-lined switchbacks lead hikers to
Chambers Creek Canyon and some shade.</TE>
<TE>   At the two-mile mark you will see a footbridge over Chambers
Creek. The handsome structure was built by the Civilian Conservation
Corps in the 1930s. Enjoy the view of the falls, then walk farther
above the bridge and chill out by the water.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers Creek Trail continues with its punishing climb toward
Chambers Peak.</TE>

<HD>Luggage That Fits Into the Post-Sept. 11 World</HD>
<DH>Tightened security calls for new kinds of packing gear to
ease passage through X-ray lines and hand inspections</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting through airport security these days can resemble the "I Love
Lucy" episode in which Lucy and Ethel frantically chase down candies
on a fast-moving factory line. Juggling carry-on bag or laptop,
purse, airline ticket, shoes, jacket and ID, we fling our belongings
on the conveyor belt and race to the other side of the X-ray machine,
hoping to catch up with them before some stranger does.</LD>
<LD>   "Lucy" was funny. This is not. Especially, as happened to me
recently at LAX, when you're called aside for a more thorough
security check while your belongings (including a tiny wallet-purse)
pile up on the belt.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's luggage makers are churning out new products to try
to ease our passage through the post-Sept. 11 world. Many were
designed in a flurry after the attacks; others were already under
development but took on new value after Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of what's out there now or will be soon:</TE>
<TE>   Double-duty carry-ons: Most airline travelers are confined to one
carry-on plus a personal item such as purse or briefcase. What if you
also have a laptop or other items?</TE>
<TE>   The Dual-Access Rolling Computer Case ($95) from Magellan's, a
mail-order company, is a carry-on with a compartment for overnight
clothes plus a computer-carrying sleeve that you can open from either
the top or side. It lets you show your laptop to security guards
without showing off your underwear too. (800) 962-4943,
www.magellans.com.</TE>
<TE>   Magellan's was developing the case before Sept. 11, says
spokeswoman Lynn Staneff. But industry giant Samsonite had to
scramble to produce its 700 Series Silhouette 7 Instant View
Professional Carry-On ($250), which made its debut this month with an
overnight-clothes compartment and a computer sleeve. A version with a
side-loading computer compartment ($400, 835 Series) will enter the
marketplace in August. (800) 262-8282, www.samsonite.com.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sept. 12, the design team sat down with the product manager,
and they began coming up with ideas," recalls Nora Alonso, Samsonite
marketing coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann, a luxury-luggage maker based in Lebanon, Tenn., has a
new Overnight Business Traveler ($525) with separate sections for
clothes and business materials, plus a computer sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   By fall, Hartmann plans to market a line of totes for women called
the Career Collection, offered in several sizes and priced from $195
to $435. The line has a business case plus, in most styles, a
detachable handbag inside and a padded computer sleeve that also can
be carried separately. (800) 331-0613, www.hartmann.com.</TE>
<TE>   Airport security guards often fixate on laptops, Staneff says. At
the Vancouver, Canada, airport last month, "I was even asked to say
what brand it was," she recalls. "Do I look like a terrorist?"</TE>
<TE>   Manicured for security: Many of us have been scrutinizing our
personal-care travel kits for scissors, metal files and those other
small tools that may cause big security hassles.</TE>
<TE>   Now Tweezerman, the Glen Cove, N.Y., makers of you-know-what,
offers the Airline Security Carry-On ($10), stripped of forbidden
items. It comes with a fingernail clipper, toenail clipper, grooming
brush, hand sanitizer (to be replaced in August by a small
flashlight), nonmetal nail file, a Tweezerette with smooth tips--and
a money-back guarantee if the kit is seized by airline security.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the company has sold about 12,000 kits, of which only four
have been confiscated, says spokeswoman Jeanine M. Boiko. (888)
647-7377, www.tweezerman.com.</TE>
<TE>   Magellan's offers a similar item in a leather travel pouch, called
the Travel-Safe Security Friendly Manicure Set ($19.85), containing a
chrome-plated plastic file, a nail clipper and rounded-tip
tweezers--"less threatening than a pen," its catalog boasts.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing to hide: Vista, Calif.-based Eagle Creek Inc. was ahead of
the game with its prescient Pack-It System of mesh-fronted envelopes
and cubes that contain clothes and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   The mesh lets inspectors peek at your belongings in tidy packages
nestled inside your suitcase instead of "strewn across the counter,"
says spokeswoman Jenny Finney. Despite the travel slump, sales of
Pack-Its have increased at least 15% since Sept. 11, she estimates.
Prices vary by size; the 18-by-12-inch Pack-It Folder 18 is $28.
(800) 874-1048, www.eagle creek.com.</TE>
<TE>   Other luggage makers are also going transparent. Travelpro, the
Boca Raton, Fla., company that pioneered wheeled carry-ons, is
switching from opaque to clear vinyl for luggage compartments and
adding mesh panels as part of a "running change" to its full line,
says Marcy Schackne, vice president of marketing. (800) 741-7471,
www.travelpro.com.</TE>
<TE>   Samsonite's 700 Series Silhouette 7 Instant View Bi-Fold Tote
($130) touts "clear and mesh dividers that provide easier view at
security checkpoints."</TE>
<TE>   Show me ID: Keeping a perpetual grip on your driver's license,
ticket and boarding pass while running the inspection gantlet can be
challenging.</TE>
<TE>   Magellan's new Leather ID Holder ($12.85) is a pouch that is worn
around your neck. One side holds your license, with a Velcro-secured
cover that hides it until you need to show it. Your boarding pass
slips into a slot in the back. "It went out the door like nobody's
business," spokeswoman Staneff says of this item. "We were scrambling
just to keep them in stock."</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann has a similar item, the Travel ID Case ($50 to $70,
depending on the leather), which adds slots for credit or
frequent-flier cards and a zip pocket for money and receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Travelpro, where Schackne says the staff "worked a
lot of overtime" to get out the new products, the company noticed a
bump in sales of larger bags after Sept. 11. "The leisure traveler is
carrying a bigger bag and not carrying on as much," she says. By
contrast, business travelers are typically "trying to pack everything
into their 22-inch carry-on," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Vacationers may be trying to avoid extra security hassles that
come with carry-ons. On a recent trip between Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and Washington, D.C., Schackne says she overheard an airline agent at
the gate instruct an inspector to "pick out someone with luggage" for
a more detailed search.</TE>
<TE>   Also, with all the other delays, "people don't get as ruffled if
it takes an extra five minutes to get their luggage," Schackne says.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the rhyme or reason, there's plenty in the new world of
airport security to keep luggage makers working overtime.</TE>

<HD>Rules of the Road to Keep the Whole Family Safe--and Sane</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The kids are transfixed by the passing scenery. Dad willingly asks
directions so that he doesn't get hopelessly lost. No one fights over
the radio station, the middle seat or the last piece of bubble gum.
The car is pristine--not a smashed pretzel or spilled drink in sight.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, a real family road trip is rarely as pleasant.
We're never prepared for the reality--the preschooler who wails as
soon as he's buckled into his car seat, the motion-sick 10-year-old,
the sullen teen, the never-ending chorus of "I'm hungry," "I have to
go to the bathroom," "How much longer?"</LD>
<LD>   If you want to see real shellshock, check out any traveling family
as they stagger into their fifth fast-food restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   The good news is that these trips give us plenty to laugh about,
often for years and years. (If you have any good road tales, send
them to me, and I'll use them in an upcoming column.)</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the kids will take off their headphones and talk to you more
than they have in months. Maybe, without as many distractions, you
can focus on what's really going on with them. Being trapped together
in an automobile can be just the thing to remind you of what you love
about one another.</TE>
<TE>   Whether we adore road trips or dread them, we're all going to have
plenty of company on highways, interstates and country lanes this
summer. Most upcoming vacations in America (close to 85%) will take
place by auto, truck or RV, the Travel Industry Assn. reports.
Twenty-five percent of leisure travelers say they'll travel more by
car this summer than last.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how we're going to survive:</TE>
<TE>   * Safety. No matter how much they protest, make sure the kids are
properly buckled into safety seats, booster seats (for children 40 to
80 pounds) and seat belts. In 1998, 1,765 children 14 and younger
died in motor vehicle crashes, and in 1999 an estimated 272,000 were
injured, according to the National Safe Kids Campaign. Set a good
example by always buckling up yourself. Don't let kids younger than
12 ride in the front seat. More than 100 children (including infants
in safety seats) have been killed and many others injured by deployed
air bags. And, of course, never leave the children alone in a hot
car. For more child auto-safety tips, visit the National Safe Kids
Campaign Web site at www.safe kids.org. And check the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration Web site at www.nhtsa.org for
advice on buying and using safety seats.</TE>
<TE>   * Offer rewards. That might mean the promise of time at the hotel
pool, a visit to the next town's big playground or the chance to
choose tonight's restaurant. If the going gets really rough, offer to
buy the kids a souvenir at the next stop. If you stay at certain
hotels, the souvenirs come free with the room. At Embassy Suites, for
example, kids get a Jimmy Neutron (an animated movie character) pack
with a rocket-shaped camera, two-way sunglasses and a toy version of
Jimmy's robot dog, among other items. Rates for two-room suites,
including breakfast, range from $79 in Phoenix to $289 in Puerto
Rico; call (800) 362-2779 or visit www.embassysuites.com. Radisson
Hotels offer a giveaway for parents and kids: Parents get a room
upgrade and free breakfast for four, and kids get a "Spy Kids 2" pack
that includes snacks, a "How to Be a Spy" activity book, colored
pencils, a camera and more. Rates start at just under $100 in some
parts of the country; book online at www.radisson.com/gosk2 and save
an extra 10%, or call (800) 333-3333.</TE>
<TE>   * Take the pets. The kids will focus on their furry friends rather
than on how much longer the trip will take. The newly revised
"Traveling With Your Pet: The AAA Pet Book" lists more than 10,000
properties that welcome pets. That number represents about a third of
all AAA-rated lodgings.</TE>
<TE>   * Find boredom busters. This is a must. Younger kids will stop
whining if they can choose a new, wrapped (and inexpensive) toy, book
or game from a big grab bag. My husband and I used to dole them out
to our kids during cross-country trips whenever we entered a new
state. Part of the fun for the kids is trying to figure out which
package to grab.</TE>
<TE>   * Find electronic boredom busters. Older kids enjoy hand-held
electronic games. Or surprise the gang by renting a VCR for the trip
so the kids can watch their favorite movies. Survive the Drive will
deliver one to your door; call (800) 573-6018 or visit
www.survivethedrive.com. (The company is sold out through July 4 but
will take reservations for rentals after that.) Ten-day rentals are
$99. Portable DVD players are also available. Just be careful about
where the kids try to use them in the hotel. I know one kid who broke
a hotel TV while trying to hook up a DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a travel diary. Just don't force the kids to fill one. "That
will feel too much like school," says author Carol Westin, whose
latest book, "Melanie Martin Goes Dutch," is a funny fictional diary
of a 10-year-old's adventures in Holland with her family. Older kids
could turn their adventures into fiction too. Ask your local
children's librarian to suggest other books about traveling families
or books that are set in the region you plan to visit.</TE>
<TE>   * Exercise. One dad I know insists that the kids run around the
minivan several times whenever they stop. Another looks for miniature
golf courses. I stash a soccer ball, football, baseball gloves and
balls within reach. A pickup game at a park is guaranteed to help
your gang meet some other vacationing kids--and improve everyone's
mood after hours in the car.</TE>
<TE>   See you at the highway rest stop. I'll be the one chasing the fly

<HD>Long Beach Airport: The Secret's Out</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You just ruined it for those of us who know the secret about Long
Beach Airport ("Outlying Airports' Fates Tell a Tale of Two Cities,"
Travel Insider, May 26). I live in northern Orange County and use
Ontario or Long Beach whenever possible to avoid LAX.</LD>
<LD>   I have never used John Wayne Airport and probably never will. I
would rather drive to Ontario or Long Beach and avoid the freeway
crush. At Long Beach I can park close to the terminal for next to
nothing, and have, at most, a five-minute wait through security. And
I have found the fares, on average, to be less than at the other
local airports, especially John Wayne.</LD>

<LD>I read Jerry Haines' delightfully informative article ("Celebrating
Lisbon's Sweet, Sad Soul," April 28) a few days before we left for
Lisbon. The city was wonderful, much nicer than I expected.</LD>
<LD>   We went to eat and hear fado at the Adega do Ribatejo, recommended
in the article. When the bill came, each item was charged at several
euros more than was listed on the menu. We didn't have this problem
at any other place in Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   Also, we learned quickly that the many appetizers that are brought
to the table at most restaurants are neither on the house nor
included with the price of the meal.</LD>
<TE>   While I enjoyed every place we went in southern Portugal, my
favorite was the charming village of Monsaraz, which is worth a
visit.</TE>

<LD>Your travel editor may have thought the photo of a ramp employee
lying in an engine inlet was cute ("My Best Shot," June 9), but I saw
a potential disaster because one coin fallen from his pocket could
cause catastrophic engine failure. Mechanics and cockpit crew inspect
the inlets before each flight, but a small coin would be hard to spot
on the silver/gray background.</LD>

<LD>In 1959 my family visited Segovia, Spain, and had lunch in the
building shown below the aqueduct in your photograph ("History Colors
the Canvas of Segovia," June 2). On the bar counter were two heaping
bowls of snacks: deep-fried sheep heads, split (lengthwise), and
deep-fried sparrows--all shiny with olive oil (or grease). We didn't
sample them.</LD>

<LD>As a native of San Diego and a former resident of the Hillcrest area,
I particularly enjoyed your Weekend Escape ("Baby Steps in the Wilds
of San Diego," June 2).</LD>
<LD>   But I was disappointed that author Mary McNamara and her children
missed the bird show at the Wild Animal Park. I think it is
exceptional. Also, if you visit in the fall, you can view its
thousands of chrysanthemums.</LD>
<LD>   We join the San Diego Zoological Society every year; the savings
on admissions and guest passes are worth it when we entertain
out-of-town visitors.</LD>

countryside a year ago when he came upon this "shellabration" in
Seosan, about 100 miles southwest of Seoul. A high school marching
band in traditional costumes and equipped with old-fashioned
instruments lent their colors to a local festival. It was an
intriguing sight for Hahm, who was born in Korea during World War II,
escaped to the south when communists came to power and moved to
Kentucky to attend the University of Louisville. He returns to his

<HD>Around the Globe, Cafes Offer Up a Cup of Camaraderie and
Repose</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every place, from Venice's Piazza San Marco to L.A.'s Venice
Beach, has a cafe where tourists go to talk, rest, look at their maps
and drink coffee. The elixir knows no borders, which partly explains
the special relationship between the cafe and the traveler.</LD>
<LD>   Coffee is a natural for travelers, energizing and uplifting after
too many flights of steps and museums full of Old Masters. It can be
warming or cooling, depending on whether it's hot or iced. It makes
some people loquacious, which encourages travelers and locals to
socialize when they meet in cafes. Others turn ruminative under its
influence, pondering the wonders of the wider world.</LD>
<LD>   "Cafes are the best places in the world to be alone in company.
Strangers can either people-watch or get involved in a conversation,"
says Stewart Allen, author of "The Devil's Cup: Coffee, the Driving
Force in History" (Soho Press, 1999).</LD>
<TE>   Coffee drinking and the rituals one can observe in coffeehouses
reflect much about culture and lifestyle. Turks like it thick and
sugary. Italians drink espresso standing up. The English used to live
in coffeehouses, until they discovered tea. Americans come from the
land of the bottomless cup.</TE>
<TE>   Thus a good cafe serves more than good coffee, says Sherri Johns,
a Portland-based coffee consultant. "It should represent the place
where it's located," she says. "I want the exact opposite of
Starbucks." She prefers cafes with strong character, such as San
Francisco Coffee in Kuala Lumpur, where the people-watching never
grows dull, and the Pierre Loti Cafe, perched above the Bosporus in
Istanbul, with spectacular views and memorable Turkish coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Johns says that people all over the world "associate coffee
with comfort and familiarity," which can make Starbucks an attractive
option in even the most far-flung places. Though I tend to avoid
Starbucks when I travel, I can see the appeal. After all, it is
reliable and everywhere. The coffee company that started in 1971 with
a shop in Seattle's Pike Place Market now has 1,100 stores in such
countries as Kuwait, South Korea, Indonesia and Switzerland. The
company says there will be Starbucks coffee shops in Greece by the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But Mark Pendergrast, the author of "Uncommon Grounds: The History
of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World" (Basic Books, 1999),
doesn't think travelers will be lingering any time soon over
Starbucks coffee beverages in Italy, the bastion of espresso.</TE>
<TE>   Italians seem to me the world's most stylish and addicted java
drinkers, stopping half a dozen times a day at coffee and sandwich
bars. I love to see them leaning casually there, stirring sugar into
a demitasse and downing the contents in two gulps. Most of these
cafes also have table service, but you pay dearly for it, which is
why you can usually tell the tourists from the locals by who's
standing and who's sitting.</TE>
<TE>   The Illy cafe in the northern Italian town of Trieste is revered
for espresso, and Tazza d'Oro near the Pantheon in Rome serves a
nonpareil granita di caffe, or coffee ice with whipped cream.</TE>
<TE>   You can't always predict where you'll find a good cup of coffee.
Connoisseurs like Richard Healy, owner of the Coffee Roaster in
Sherman Oaks, think the French drink some of the world's worst
coffee, despite the reputation of the French cafe. Author Pendergrast
contends that, until recently, it was hard to find a decent cup in
such producer countries as Brazil and Costa Rica because the best
beans were exported.</TE>
<TE>   I love the coffee at Bewley's in downtown Dublin and used to
frequent a Latin American restaurant called El Viejo Yayo in Brooklyn
with an old, encrusted and fuming espresso machine that made a caffe
latte I can still taste.</TE>
<TE>   For flavor, Healy advises travelers to go to Northern Europe,
which has had a lock on high-grade coffee importing since the Middle
Ages. Some say the European-style coffeehouse was born in Vienna, and
the coffee in Northern Europe is "lightly roasted, more complex and
chemically stronger," Healy says. Come to think of it, I've had some
of my favorite cups at cafes in Amsterdam, Brussels and Copenhagen.</TE>
<TE>   Other Northern European locales even have coffee museums, such as
the Speicherstadtmuseum in the northern German city of Hamburg,
devoted to coffee, tea and other imports from former European
colonies. Butlers Wharf on the south side of the Thames River in
central London is the site of the Bramah Museum of Tea and Coffee.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just about the taste of the coffee, as most travelers
know. Some cafes, like Les Deux Magots, where Ernest Hemingway drank
in Paris, and the Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum in the French
town of Arles, the model for the "night cafe" painted by Van Gogh in
1888, are tourist sites in themselves and are thus hard to avoid,
even if they serve despicable brew.</TE>
<TE>   Others are in the places tourists want to see, like Gambrinus on
the Piazza Trieste e Trento in Naples, just across from the Palazzo
Reale. The central squares in Marrakech and Oaxaca, Mexico, and
Central Park South in New York are lined with cafes serving
indifferent coffee but offering a seat at the center of the action
for premium prices.</TE>
<TE>   I usually start out at such places, but as my stay in a city
unfolds, I seek smaller, less expensive, more idiosyncratic cafes. My
current favorites are Kost Bar in Copenhagen for great coffee and
serious-looking Danes, Scaturchio on the Piazza San Domenico Maggiore
in Naples for baba au rhum, and Patisserie Claude in Greenwich
Village for brioche and eavesdropping. I could go back to Copenhagen,
Naples or New York just for these places. It makes me jittery just to
think about it.</TE>

<HD>Coasting British Columbia</HD>
<DH>On a road trip along Canada's 'Sunshine Coast,' two sisters
enjoy breathtaking beauty, quirky villages, native totems and sibling
companionship--but little luck catching fish</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGO PFEIFF</AU>
<BD>Margo Pfeiff is a freelance writer in Montreal.</BD>
<DL>LUND, Canada</DL>
<LD>"Be at one with your herring," my sister Linda said, mocking me as
she slipped a wriggling silver sliver onto her hook. I had foolishly
asked her secret to catching fish. Even when we were imps in the
early '60s, sitting side by side on the banks of the Chilliwack River
in British Columbia using $1.99 fishing rods, she would haul in
buckets full of trout. Then she'd mince back to Grandma, who'd fry
them up in butter. I never caught a single one.</LD>
<LD>   When she grew up and married a commercial fisherman no one was
surprised; we knew it was because she brought him luck.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the '80s she and her husband, Pat, fished for salmon
and prawns up and down the Sunshine Coast north of Vancouver on an
old 30-foot double-ender called the Star King. In 1992 the boat went
down at its marina mooring. The marriage sank soon after.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I had moved to Montreal and become a journalist. Though
my sister and I don't share a common lifestyle, we both love a road
trip. Last summer I asked whether she'd like to drive the Sunshine
Coast to visit her old haunts. "I'll bring the beer," she said, "and
we'll go fishing."</TE>
<TE>   Technically part of mainland British Columbia, the Sunshine Coast
is a peninsula north of Vancouver that can be reached only by ferry.
Long beaches line lush forests of red cedar and Douglas fir that
descend from the Coast Mountains to the sea. Cottages and lodges add
to the island-lifestyle feel. The "Sunshine Coast" name is based on
weather service logs that show an average 2,400 hours of sun a year.
That adds up to 200 days, making the area sunnier and drier than
anywhere else along the soggy coast of British Columbia. The driest
time of year--and my favorite time to visit--is late summer and
through September, when the days are still warm and crowds have
departed.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of spectacular wilderness scenery and good weather
makes this a popular destination for outdoor activities. The region
is known for its hiking and horseback riding trails, and the many
lakes make it excellent canoe country. The coastline's sheltered
fiords are perfect for kayaking, and the waters are among the best on
the coast for scuba diving. And, of course, there is fishing, in the
lakes and on the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We hopped the Langdale Ferry from West Vancouver's Horseshoe Bay
for a 40-minute trip across Howe Sound, past heavily wooded islets.
In Gibsons Landing we headed for the funky Flying Cow, known for
all-day breakfasts. The cafe, like the town and this whole coast, is
a mixture of millworkers in pickup trucks and alternative-lifestyle
folks, often heavily pierced and with Technicolor hair.
Flower-covered houseboats brighten the marina. Several art outlets,
including the Gibsons Landing Gallery, are owned and operated by
local artists who work from rural studios marked on a map we've
picked up. The region has a thriving cultural scene and is home to
one of the highest per-capita ratios of artists and craftsmen in
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "Every road trip needs a mission," said Linda. "Ours is to stop at
every single gallery."</TE>
<TE>   We set off along winding coastal Highway 101; eventually the road
would take us 110 miles north along Georgia Strait. But by the time
we'd gone the 14 miles to Sechelt, the coast's main town, we'd
already visited potters, painters, glassblowers and artists who
sculpt with iron. Sechelt takes its name from the Sechelt Band, part
of the Coast Salish group of Indians. In the area are ancient
pictographs and seashell mounds, a cultural center and excellent
native art galleries like the Tsain-Ko.</TE>
<TE>   We prowled galleries in houses along Trail Bay. The sign outside
one artist's home said, "Two old crows live here"; inside we smelled
the aroma of fresh cedar from the traditional baskets the artist
wove. Totem poles lined Trail Bay, and we stretched out on the rocky
beach with a picnic lunch.</TE>
<TE>   On the waterfront north of Sechelt we stopped at one of Linda's
haunts, the old Wakefield Inn. "I love this place, it's so cheesy,"
she said as we passed through carved wooden doors into a log-lined
pub that featured a moose head above the fireplace. It was a sunny
afternoon, and we took a table on the deck overlooking the sea. We
sipped beer and discussed former cooking practices aboard the Star
King. "The best thing was 'brown bombers'--ocean perch. We'd wrap
them in foil with salt, pepper and sliced onions," she recalled,
"then slap the package on the engine for 2 1/2 hours as we motored
along. Just delicious."</TE>
<TE>   We began driving north again. Alongside the 60-year-old Halfmoon
Bay General Store we dropped into the Anchor Rocks Gift and Gallery
and bought handmade merino lambskin slippers, a Sunshine Coast
tradition from the local Slipper Factory. By late afternoon we were
saddled up at the waterfront Malaspina Ranch Resort at Madeira Park.
In the late afternoon light we rode into the hills and spotted herds
of elk.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner we drove a few miles north to Ruby Lake Resort. It is a
birder's paradise: two lakeside suites and 10 cottages on a private
lagoon within a bird sanctuary. There are more than 90 species of
birds here, including wood ducks and blue herons. As we nibbled
appetizers at dusk, bald eagles soared in to feed on the shore of the
lake. Although far from civilization, the resort's Milanese
restaurant was a pleasant surprise. Giorgio Cogrossi explained: "In
Milan I modeled for Armani and arranged parties for Prince and David
Bowie." Then he visited the Sunshine Coast, fell in love with the
area, went home and convinced his family to move to Ruby Lake, B.C.
They bought and restored the old resort. Now brother Aldo runs the
kitchen in the woods, which is one of the region's best-kept secrets.</TE>
<TE>   A sudden breeze popped up. Linda paused, a forkful of cherry
wood-smoked sockeye salmon in midair. "Blowing southeast," she said.
"We won't be fishing tomorrow." It was an omen. "You mark my words,"
I replied, waving a steaming chunk of cedar plank-smoked sockeye in
my little sister's face, "this is as close as we get to a fish on
this trip."</TE>
<TE>   We awakened to the rhythm of howling wind, but because the skies
were clear we decided to head on with our tour and try our luck at
fishing on the return. We puttered around Pender Harbour and Garden
Bay, seaside and lakeside holiday spots that haven't changed since we
vacationed here 35 years ago. At 10 a.m. we checked our tide tables
and headed toward Skookumchuck Narrows Park, where the incoming and
outgoing tides squeeze through narrows at up to 20 mph, creating
spectacular white water. Giant waves and whirlpools suck down logs
and spit them straight into the air. On the one-hour hike to the
narrows, Linda remembered meeting a fisherman who was sucked backward
into a 30-foot whirlpool, nearly losing his boat. On this day the
rapids were gentler, yet raucous enough to provide a pair of
white-water kayakers with some challenging surf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a short drive north to Earl's Cove, where we caught our
second ferry of the trip, this one to Saltery Bay. This northern part
of the coast is quieter, wilder and much less traveled. We poked
among tidal pools at Saltery Bay Provincial Park, finding purple
shore crabs, blue mussels, green and pink anemones, and red and
orange sea stars. Some of British Columbia's best scuba diving is
found in the deeper waters around here because of their clarity:
Divers can count on 100 to 150 feet of visibility on a good day. We
hiked around Inland Lake on a trail through forests dripping with
moss. The lake trail is part of two longer excursions, the 55-mile
Powell Forest Canoe Route and the 115-mile Sunshine Coast Trail
through old-growth woods.</TE>
<TE>   In Powell River we met a friend of Linda's named Rianne at La
Casita Mexican cafe. The restaurant's Mexico City-born owner, Lola,
is a skilled stained-glass window artist who also makes a terrific
sopa de lima. Rianne took us into the old section of Powell River, a
paper mill company town of tidy homes and solid commercial structures
that has become a Historical District. The former Bank of Montreal
building is now a gallery with excellent works from local artists.</TE>
<TE>   Then Rianne introduced us to the "goat lady." Lori Kemp is a
native Newfoundlander who now lives in a forest home with her four
goats: Ginger, Cosmos, Echo and Marble. "I'm the first commercial
pack-goat outfitter in Canada," she said proudly as she strapped onto
Cosmos a soft saddle holding two buckets. "We take people day hiking,
mushroom picking or overnight camping," she said, "and the goats can
carry up to 50 pounds of gear." She also runs a simple
bed-and-breakfast out of her home.</TE>
<TE>   Just 20 minutes north of Powell River we checked into a seaside
cedar chalet at Desolation Sound Resort. Our two-story chalet had a
fireplace and a bedroom in the wooden turret. Then we were off to the
nearby Laughing Oyster Restaurant, a bistro specializing in local
seafood. From our table on the deck we overlooked a panorama of
wooded mountain ridges receding in ever paler hues of pink and purple
post-sunset light. We downed spicy "Gunpowder" prawns and
bouillabaisse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The weather stayed sunny, and just after dawn the next morning we
squeezed into a couple of kayaks with our guide, Adam Vallance.
Ospreys soared overhead as we paddled along Okeover Inlet. In the
distance, seals rippled the glassy waters. Adam pointed out oyster
leases where the shellfish are commercially grown. A spectacular
bright pink sunflower star shimmered in the clear water. "It's the
biggest sea star in the world and has 24 arms," Adam said. "It's also
the fastest--it zips along at 9 feet a minute."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, in search of breakfast, we reached the village of Lund,
the end of the road. There's even a sign to prove it. "Highway 101,"
it said, "15,020 kilometers to Puerto Montt, Chile." We celebrated
this auspicious location with softball-size cinnamon buns and coffee
from Nancy's Bakery as we sat overlooking an island recently
purchased by Bill Gates. Lund is on the traditional lands of the
Sliammon, who offer insights into their culture and way of life with
trips in their 30-foot dugout-style canoes. Boat trips travel to
Princess Louisa Inlet, where snow-tipped mountains rise sharply from
the water's edge to more than 7,000 feet. Chatterbox Falls at the
head of the inlet tumbles 120 feet into the water.</TE>
<TE>   Many people visit the Sunshine Coast as part of the Circle Route,
starting out in Vancouver, then crossing from Powell River to Comox
on northern Vancouver Island, a 75-minute ferry trip. From there it's
a lovely drive south toward Victoria for another ferry trip back to
Vancouver. But we had fish to catch and would head down the coast the
way we had come.</TE>
<TE>   I was awakened the next morning with the "zzzz ... zzzz ... "
sound in my ear of fishing line being let out. "Fishies are waiting,"
whispered my annoying sibling. In Rob Metcalfe's 32-foot Chris Craft
we set off to fish at Quarry Bay near Pender Harbour. Above the
banter of Rob and Linda's fish stories and Bob Marley's wailing I
could hear loons calling. It was a beautiful day during which many
herring were impaled, many beers downed and the view enjoyed, but
salmon--as I had predicted--eluded us.</TE>
<TE>   In the end Rob motored into the shallows, quickly catching a rock
cod near shore. He instructed me to pitch it into the air. Two bald
eagles swooped from a nearby tree and scuffled briefly in midair,
with the victor grabbing the doomed cod in its talons before it hit
the water. I was happy. At least someone had gotten a fish that day.</TE>

<HD>Just a Visitor Here</HD>
<DH>USA Network hopes to stir the summer doldrums with 'The
Dead Zone,' about a man hurtled into others' lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because broadcast networks rely mainly on repeats during the summer
months, cable programmers regard June, July and August as the perfect
opportunity to showcase new and returning series. USA Network, for
example, is offering two new series this summer for repeat-weary
viewers: "Monk," premiering in July, and "The Dead Zone," arriving
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the Stephen King novel and the 1983 film of the same
name, "The Dead Zone" stars former John Hughes regular Anthony
Michael Hall ("Sixteen Candles," "The Breakfast Club") as Johnny
Smith, a high school science teacher whose near-perfect life--a
loving mother, a beautiful girlfriend and a good job--is ruined by a
near-fatal crash. He awakens from a six-year coma to discover that
his girlfriend, Sarah (Nicole deBoer), is married to the local
sheriff (Chris Bruno), his mother has died and his legal guardian is
his mysterious stepfather, a televangelist (David Ogden Stiers).</LD>
<LD>   This being Stephen King, it doesn't end there. Not only does
Johnny have to adjust to an entirely new life, he must cope with the
fact he now possesses "second sight": by a simple touch from someone,
he is catapulted into the past or future of that person. In the first
two episodes, he saves a baby from a fire, helps a doctor reunite
with his mother and stops a serial killer from striking again.</LD>
<TE>   But the series definitely isn't "Touched by a Psychic," Hall
insists. "There have been a variety of scripts," the actor reports.
"It is like we are taking the core ensemble of actors and
transferring them into different situations each week. This is the
greatest role I've ever been given to play. It's really dynamic."</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Michael Piller ("Star Trek: The Next
Generation," "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and "Star Trek: Voyager")
created the series with his son, Shawn, who is a producer and writer
on the series, at the request of UPN.</TE>
<TE>   "I read the book and watched the movie and said, "You know, I
think I can do something with this,' " says Piller. "The kind of
thing I am looking for in series work is anything that will allow me
to do what I think I do well, and that is to explore the life we live
in--and 'The Dead Zone,' as a novel, is really about that. You put
yourself as a writer and a viewer into the personality of a guy whose
whole life that he knew is gone and he has a new life. How does he
adjust to this extraordinary expectation of him? How does that world
treat him? That is fodder for seven years of television."</TE>
<TE>   UPN didn't think so. It passed on the project. USA snapped it up.
"We were surprised UPN didn't pick this up, because we thought it was
one of the best pilots of last year," says USA's Jeff Wachtel,
executive vice president of series and long-form projects at the
cable outlet. "It met our goals of creating series that have
traditional franchises with unexpected or controversial twists."</TE>
<TE>   He believes the series has the potential to reach beyond the
traditional sci-fi audience.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife ... after two minutes she was completely hooked," Wachtel
says. "Unexpectedly, what you might think should be a supernatural
show actually has a much broader reach because it is, at its core,
about a guy who had a perfect life and lost it. Now, ironically, he
has a gift where he can help just about everybody but himself. We are
not one of the niche networks like MTV or Lifetime. We have a very
broad and adult audience and this has a real broad and adult appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Johnny won't be helping the cops solve a murder each week, Hall
says. "One of the things that really is interesting is that Michael
Piller's intent, as well as Shawn's, was to draw on classic films. We
finished an episode a few weeks back that is a homage to '12 Angry
Men.' It's a courtroom drama and I become a member of a jury. The one
we are working on now is a homage to 'Dog Day Afternoon.' It's about
a bank robbery gone awry. These episodes are really challenging for
me and really have an emotional impact."</TE>
<TE>   "The Dead Zone" can be seen Sundays at 10 p.m. on USA. The network
has rated the premiere episode TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<HD>Antiabortion Group Takes Its Message to Skies Above Beaches</HD>
<DH>Protest: Airplane tows a giant banner with graphic
photographs said to be of an aborted fetus, prompting complaints,
confusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An antiabortion group took to the skies above Southland beaches this
weekend, using an airplane to tow a giant banner depicting what the
Orange County-based organization says are two photos of a 10-week-old
aborted fetus.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-by-100-foot banner was almost impossible to ignore Saturday
as it passed back and forth over Santa Monica's beaches for almost 30
minutes, a surprising sight compared to the typical fish taco, beer
company and suntan oil advertisements that usually fly over the
shores.</LD>
<LD>   Gregg Cunningham, executive director of the Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform, which financed the ad, said both photos were of the same
aborted fetus. The banner, with a message reading "10-Week Abortion"
and a 714 phone number, will continue to be flown over beaches as far
south as San Diego today.</LD>
<TE>   The group opted for the bold strategy after being turned down by
the mainstream media, Cunningham said. "We are committed to
unfalsifying abortion," he said, "and we think we can do that best
visually."</TE>
<TE>   The aerial campaign is part of a national marketing drive that has
included displays on college campuses and billboards pulled by trucks
during rush hour. The towing of banners began Memorial Day weekend in
the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area of Florida and moved to the
Boston-Cape Cod area of Massachusetts the next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But many Santa Monica beachgoers said that they didn't understand
the message.</TE>
<TE>   David Nelson, 19, of Lancaster said he thought the banner was
advertising for an abortion provider. "I think it's stupid," he said,
adding that he considers himself antiabortion. "It's like, call this
number and get an abortion."</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed it, I looked at it, but I didn't understand what it
meant," said Elaine Fleming, who was visiting from Minnesota. "I
thought it was odd to be sitting at the beach and to see this big
banner about abortion going by."</TE>
<TE>   David Boman, 17, who was in town from Las Vegas for his sister's
graduation from UCLA, said he couldn't make out the banner's
pictures. "But I thought it was an abortion protest," he said. "I can
sympathize with the cause, in some ways, but I don't agree with their
tactics, which are inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Others who saw the banner were shocked by their graphic nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was pretty nasty-looking," said Melva Stuart of
Monterey Park, who was visiting the beach with her daughter and
grandchildren. "I'm sitting on the beach, trying to relax, and having
to look at something like that. The kids are looking at the water,
not the sky, thank goodness."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said the group raised the $2,500 per day to rent the
plane for banner-towing from private individuals and hopes it can
gather enough money to regularly fly banners over Dodger and Angel
games, local college campuses and "any time there is a large
assemblage of people."</TE>
<TE>   He said abortion clinics were paid to allow the photos of the
fetuses to be taken, but declined to say how much was paid or where
the photos were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Mueller, director of public policy for the National
Abortion Federation, which supports abortion rights, said her
organization received calls from people who had seen the aerial
billboards in Massachusetts. "The public does not want to see this
kind of protest," she said. "These people have the right to voice
their opinion, but they need to do it in a way that's respectful of
others."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Sasaki, president of the Los Angeles chapter of Planned
Parenthood, had a similar objection to the campaign. She accused the
Center for Bio-Ethical Reform of turning "what should be a private
matter into a media circus" and said she doubted the authenticity of
the photos used in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham admitted that in other cities the calls of outrage
outnumbered those of support by almost 20 to 1. "People were saying
they were denied relaxation," he said. "But when Americans are
killing children, they don't deserve a day at the beach."</TE>
<TE>   For Marvin McLellan, the banner did not serve to diminish a day of
reverie. The 25-year-old radio personality from Buffalo, N.Y., was on
the last day of a late spring vacation in the California sun. The ad
campaign, he said, was "a little confusing."</TE>
<TE>   "But it's definitely gritty," he added.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest Man Who Allegedly Kidnapped 3</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted spousal abuser who allegedly kidnapped his ex-girlfriend
and two children in March was arrested Saturday at a house in Venice,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies arrested Jose Delacruz, 40, just before 5 p.m.
in the 500 block of Vernon Avenue after a SWAT team flooded the house
with tear gas and sent a police dog in to locate him.</LD>
<LD>   When deputies reached Delacruz, he was holding a knife and had
what are believed to be self-inflicted knife wounds, Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Kaono said.</LD>
<TE>   He also appeared to be breaking a window and attempting to escape,
Kaono added.</TE>
<TE>   Delacruz was taken to a nearby hospital, where he had surgery and
was being guarded by sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Kaono said Delacruz would be transported to the jail ward of
County-USC Medical Center after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that Delacruz, his son and another man took
Adriana Galindo, 27, and daughters Gypsy, 3, and Ariane, 1, on March
6 from a Lomita home. Delacruz had just been convicted of beating
Galindo, and a judge had ordered him to serve six months in Los
Angeles County jail. Family members have said that Galindo left
Delacruz several times and that she had once moved into battered
women's shelter with the children.</TE>
<TE>   Delacruz faces charges of kidnapping, making terrorist threats and
spousal abuse, and is being held on $1-million bail, Kaono said. His
son, Alejo Delacruz, was arrested March 18 in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Delacruz fled to Mexico after the alleged kidnapping but had
returned to the United States recently, authorities said. Sheriff's
detectives received a tip he was planning to go to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles detectives passed on the information to Texas
authorities, who located the children and took them into protective
custody. Galindo is believed to be in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, sheriff's deputies learned Delacruz was in
Venice. They called the house and advised the family to evacuate
before obtaining a warrant, surrounding the residence and entering.</TE>
<TE>   Kaono said the arrest comes after months of following Delacruz.
"We've been trying to track this guy down since March," he said.</TE>

<HD>Artists Are Facing Brushoff</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Landlord is evicting the Arc group, but Santa Ana
offers to help it stay in village.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana has stepped into the fray between a landlord and a group of
artists who are being evicted from a building on the edge of Artists
Village, the district of galleries, shops and restaurants the city is
banking on to revive its downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The Arc, a loosely knit group of 15 artists based in a historic
commercial building across from the federal courthouse on West 4th
Street, regularly offers a funky mix of art exhibits, jazz concerts
and youth events. But the group might disband after a bitter dispute
with its landlord, Wan Cha.</LD>
<LD>   "The city has to walk a fine line in a dispute between landlords
and tenants, but we do want to see if we can help them stay in the
Artists Village," said Matthew Lamb, the city's manager for downtown
development.</LD>
<TE>   The artists say the landlord will let them stay if they promise
not to have social gatherings, a stipulation that would ban art shows
and concerts, and that there be no art displays in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   "We are Santa Ana natives and we want to stay in the city," said
J.J. Martin, a painter, sculptor and Arc organizer. "We are
struggling artists and we want to do what we do best here."</TE>
<TE>   Cha met with city officials last week, but no resolution was
reached. In a separate meeting with Arc representatives, Martin said
city officials encouraged them to look for space elsewhere in the
artists district while they explore other options.</TE>
<TE>   Cha said the tenants, who must leave by June 30, have dirtied the
interior of the 1880 two-story commercial building. He said they live
in the studios, keep pets--including a dog, cats and a duck--and play
live music, all in violation of the lease.</TE>
<TE>   "The building owner must take care of the building, and to do
that, these people cannot stay in the building," Cha said. The
tenants, who have been subletting their units from a previous tenant,
counter that they have cared for the building by painting walls,
installing lighting and cleaning carpets. They deny Cha's other
complaints and say they weren't given adequate notice of a 15% rent
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Cha said the artists, who paid the previous leaseholder rents
ranging from $120 to $950 a month, have not paid rent since he took
back the building May 1. He said he gave them eviction notices that
require them to vacate by the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Lamb said the tenants and Cha are unlikely to come to an
agreement, so he is trying to help the artists find another home. He
has looked at smaller spaces on 4th Street, but Martin and the other
artists say it will be difficult to find a space big enough. They
currently work in a total of 7,000 square feet in one building,
including one 1,100-square-foot space.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has spent years working to develop an artists center in
a part of downtown that has struggled with boarded-up buildings and
blight. Since the mid-1990s, city officials have invested more than
$11 million in several cornerstone projects: $6.5 million to renovate
the Grand Central Art Center, a complex of galleries and studios that
also houses a small theater; $350,000 to renovate a building that is
the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art; $1.7 million in seed
money for the establishment of the acclaimed Orange County High
School of the Performing Arts, and $450,000 to help remodel a
restaurant in the Santora Arts Building, home to more than 20
galleries and studios.</TE>
<TE>   "Every downtown needs a revitalization engine, and we want ours to
be an arts and cultural center," Lamb said, adding that he is
examining approaches taken in Minneapolis and San Francisco, where
city officials work with nonprofit groups that get grants and raise
funds to create artist-friendly spaces in downtown areas.</TE>
<TE>   Open houses at the galleries in the district on the first Saturday
of each month attract as many as 2,000 people, city officials say.
But some artists doubt the district will thrive, in part because
escalating rents will force them out.</TE>
<TE>   Lamb said the evictions involving the Arc group are not evidence
of increasing gentrification that ultimately will force artists out.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no trend here yet," he said. "But the city is concerned
how it grows and what we can do to protect what we have grown
already."</TE>

<HD>'Humbled' Tech Execs Fire Up Needy Students</HD>
<DH>Education: Pupils in Santa Ana get college-level
instruction from computer firm that aims to make a difference in
their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first, the techies across the street from Santa Ana's Century High
School wanted only a captive audience--give a few tours, talk up
education and wow youngsters with tech lingo.</LD>
<LD>   But with each tour, they found themselves asking, "Is it really
making a difference?"</LD>
<LD>   "We came to the conclusion that we wanted to create a
relationship. We could have sent a check through our company's
foundation, but we didn't want to," said Mike Sinkinson, a vice
president of Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services, which handles
Orange County's information technology at the county data center on
Grand Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, with help from school administrators, they created an
innovative, hands-on program that has bridged a cultural divide
between high technology and a school in a city with the nation's
highest concentration of Spanish-speaking residents.</TE>
<TE>   When the company volunteers sat down to think about developing
their program, Sinkinson recalled his experience serving on a Century
High review panel for awarding scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   One of the girls who had plenty of promise was accepted to UCLA
but had to decline.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't have the money to go," Sinkinson said. "Her father
wasn't working, and her mother was holding two jobs to pay the family
bills. When you hear of that, it just breaks your heart.... And we
started thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Sinkinson shared the scholarship applications with other ACS
workers, who began to realize that life across the street at Century,
which they drove by every day, was very different from their own.</TE>
<TE>   Pupils Play Many Roles</TE>
<TE>   In their applications, students described hardships faced by
family members, many of them Mexican immigrants and first-generation
Mexican Americans occupying the lowest rungs of the economic ladder.
Parents work one, two or three jobs while students care for siblings
or find part-time jobs to help with finances.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Ely, ACS program director for Santa Ana, said reading the
applications "humbled me."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the company volunteers launched STEP--Student
Technology Education Partnership--and now ACS techies visit Century
High regularly to help teach computer classes. Two ACS supervisors,
Steve Stawski and Wesley Kanamori, have helped students configure
their own new computer network lab. Sinkinson got into the act as
principal for a day.</TE>
<TE>   Tours continue, but they're hands-on: no virtual networking here.</TE>
<TE>   "They teach how to configure routers and do networking, which for
a high school is unheard of. These students are getting an extremely
worthwhile experience. It's absolutely college-level," said Leo
Crawford, the county's chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   When ACS bought Lockheed Martin IMSA two years ago, it assumed the
county's 10-year, $260-million data processing contract. Lockheed had
promised to create a community program but never mentioned specifics.
ACS wasn't obligated to fulfill Lockheed's promise, Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the company handed out $1,000 scholarships to four
students headed to four-year colleges and $500 scholarships to four
students bound for community colleges. The winning students are Yaran
Yoth, Ivan Ninichuck, Judith Arroyo, Yanet Aguilar, Guadalupe
Barrera, Sopheap Mao, Claudia Lopez-Guillen and Veronica Elias.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, four students will win larger plums: paid summer
internships across the street. Guadalupe, who will graduate in a
week, and Miguel Martinez, a junior, have been chosen so far.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Cordova and Miguel were Century's first to work as
interns last summer, earning from $8.50 to more than $10 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Students are required to fill out an application, go through
interviews and pass a drug test, providing them with a taste of
reality.</TE>
<TE>   ACS is considering hiring the young men full time after they
graduate from high school next year, giving them a foothold with a
Fortune 1,000 company to launch their college careers.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't just want to create an environment for internships ...
and tours," Sinkinson said. "We also wanted, if possible, the
opportunity to have them grow into the company. They live in the
community, they have a vested interest; and we will have a dedicated
employee."</TE>
<TE>   Miguel's 2.5 grade-point average wouldn't garner much notice from
a college recruiter. But Century computer instructor Alan Gersten and
ACS executives know he is special.</TE>
<TE>   "Miguel is just one of those students who's a natural around
computers," said Gersten, the 17-year-old's favorite teacher. "Even
as a freshman he would complete class projects way ahead of the other
students."</TE>
<TE>   Motivation Shows</TE>
<TE>   It's Miguel's enthusiasm that has put him over the top. He
commutes 26 miles each day from Corona to attend classes at Century.
His parents--Miguel Sr., a landscaper, and Guadalupe, a
housecleaner--moved to Corona more than two years ago to buy a home
that could accommodate their family of six.</TE>
<TE>   The other scholarship recipients are no less enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica's high school years might have been packed with more
academic achievements, even athletics, the 17-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   But each day she takes the bus after school and hurries home so
her father, a bartender, and her mother, a janitor, can work; she
then baby-sits a 6-year-old sister and cares for a 16-year-old
brother, Jose, who is mentally handicapped.</TE>
<TE>   "He can feed himself," she said, "but he can't read or write, and
we need to take care of him."</TE>
<TE>   Ivan, 18, one of the academic standouts with a 3.5 grade-point
average, also needed a financial boost. A third-generation Russian
American, he and his family have been struggling since his father was
diagnosed with cancer last year.</TE>
<TE>   His father's illness came after he was laid off from his job as an
electronics technician. He had been working as a security guard
before going on disability. "It's changed things a lot at our house,"
the young man said. "We have to do things now to help our dad."</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe, 19, is graduating with a 2.4 grade-point average. Her
goal is to continue studies in computer technology at Santa Ana
College. She is thankful for the scholarship; money has been tight in
her family.</TE>
<TE>   She took a job last summer working as a mailroom clerk and used
part of her wages to help with family finances. Her mother is
unemployed, and her father is a cook at McDonald's. "I played soccer
for four years, and it helped keep me going," she said quietly. "My
dad always tells me to do something with my life. To do something
better than what he did. To keep going and go to college."</TE>

<HD>Blythe Spirit Is Gone</HD>
<DH>Town's Lone Cabby Was a Sympathetic Ear</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLYTHE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>This desert town is so small, you can spit from one end clear to the
other. At least, that's how the locals tell it.</LD>
<LD>   Snuggled up against the Arizona border, Blythe is a dusty and
sweltering patch of modest homes, motels and saloons. Slow living
turns still slower in summer, when temperatures climb to 110 and
above.</LD>
<LD>   It's a town so steeped in heat and inertia that it can't afford to
lose its air-conditioners, beer coolers or, evidently, its cabby.</LD>
<TE>   Blythe's one and only taxi driver, 81-year-old Arthur "Toby"
Morelock, died in December. He has not been replaced. Folks here
aren't sure he ever will be, really.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock was more than just a ride about town. He was a delivery
service, a sympathetic ear, a lifeline.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock's Taxi Service schlepped the city's residents from the
grocery to home, from bar to bar, just about anywhere they wanted,
for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he didn't serve a great magnitude of people," said Blythe
Mayor Robert Crane, "but there are people here who really needed him.
He was a safety net for people."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's still the Dial-a-Ride service, though the
locals don't seem to care much for it because patrons have to make an
appointment the day before. Its drivers won't wait while riders run
into the grocery store, and they just aren't around at 2 a.m. when
you need a ride home from, say, Jim Dandy's bar.</TE>
<TE>   And Morelock did so much more. He would pick up a prescription, a
pizza, or, if you were really in need, the occasional six-pack.</TE>
<TE>   A soft touch, he had a reputation for picking up pedestrians at no
charge just to get them out of the blistering heat.</TE>
<TE>   From his barstool at the Horny Toad Saloon, David Anderson
recalled that sometimes when he called Toby at closing time, he
didn't have a dime in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "And he'd just say, 'That's OK. Just pay me when your money
comes,' " said Anderson, who gets by on Social Security. "That's the
kind of guy he was."</TE>
<TE>   Before Morelock, it was hard to keep a good, honest cabby in town.
Most were flaky, sometimes answering calls, sometimes not. One would
arrive with liquor on his breath.</TE>
<TE>   No one would have guessed that Toby Morelock would become the sole
cabdriver here. Until 1976, he owned a tractor repair shop in
downtown Blythe.</TE>
<TE>   But that was hard, back-breaking work, and business had slowed in
the once-bustling agricultural community.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock simply came home one day and said he was starting a taxi
business, as his widow, Leona Morelock, remembers it. She never
questioned the wisdom of opening a taxi service in their tiny town,
where half of the 23,000 residents are inmates at Blythe's two
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Toby had a certain charisma that inspired even those who hardly
knew him.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Leona married him back in 1943 after just a four-day
courtship, breaking her engagement with another man.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just, wow!" Leona Morelock, 81, says today, sounding every
bit like a girl with a schoolyard crush.</TE>
<TE>   In old family photos, he stands out, even as one of 11 siblings.
He wasn't just handsome. He was movie-star handsome, tall with a
square jaw, held high.</TE>
<TE>   He was cocky but kind, and people just flocked to him, his wife
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Blythe's cabby had a dedicated group of patrons: Alpha Beta
Bill, AAA Joe, Murdock (just Murdock) and the Naked Guy, named for
his habit of stripping down to nothing in the fields around Blythe
for no particular reason.</TE>
<TE>   Morelock became such a staple in the town that businesses relied
on him to run packages into Los Angeles in the days before Blythe had
a Federal Express office. He transported lab work for the hospital.
And when the first of two prisons was built in 1989, he delivered
anxious wives and teary-eyed moms on visiting day.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Crow, 54, met Morelock as she walked home from errands one
day back in 1997. It was 115 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too hot to be walking on a day like this," he called to her,
waving off her protestations that she couldn't afford a cab. "I'm
taking you home."</TE>
<TE>   Morelock would see 64-year-old Fred Banke, who lost a leg years
ago, walking to the grocery store. The cab driver would insist that
he was headed there anyway. Then he'd be waiting when Banke was ready
to go home.</TE>
<TE>   "That was Toby," Banke said. "I sure miss that guy a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Morelock, a World War II Army veteran, was a pushover.
This was a man who in his 70s cold-cocked a twentysomething punk who
demanded a late-night ride and, in the process, cursed Leona
Morelock.</TE>
<TE>   Around town, though, most people remember Morelock's softer side.
Especially the town's bar patrons, now caught with no ride home in
the wee hours--or sometimes in the middle of the afternoon--or for
the regulars swatting flies and drinking on the stoop outside the B&amp;B
Bait shop</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie Blythe, the Horny Toad's owner and barkeep, feels the
void keenly. Blythe, whose ex-husband was related to town founder
Thomas Blythe, kept Morelock's phone number over her bar for 20
years. Now, she's reduced to driving the drunkest customers home
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to get them home somehow so they don't get arrested," said
Blythe, 74, standing with her hands on her hips one evening behind
her bar.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly irritated, she said it's the city's responsibility to find
a new cabby. "I tell you, everybody's getting pretty mad about it."</TE>
<TE>   Morelock, relatives said, knew it would be hard to find someone
who cared about his riders as much as he did. That's why--even after
he got the cancer diagnosis, even after the chemotherapy made him so
weak that he could hardly stand--he tried to pick up fares. Pain shot
through his left shoulder so badly, customers remember, that he
winced just reaching for the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   When loved ones begged him to quit, he would respond simply: "I
can't let customers wait."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until April 2001, just eight months before his death,
that he finally cut the phone line to Morelock's Taxi.</TE>
<TE>   A few people have called City Hall, wondering how to get a taxi
license. But no one has applied. Mayor Crane doesn't expect that
anyone will with the city expanding its bus service later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Leona Morelock said that every now and then her private line still
rings with someone looking for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame," she said. "He'd hate to think people were still
out there waiting for him. And if he could get there, he still would.
I just know it."</TE>

<HD>Prank Leaves Students Seeing Orange and Blue</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A suspected senior prank at Chatsworth High School that left the
campus looking like a kindergarten finger-painting party is no
laughing matter to police, who are pursuing the case as a felony and
will seek restitution from parents for the $10,000 cleanup costs.</LD>
<LD>   Students arriving for classes Friday found exterior classroom
walls, doors, sidewalks and planters plastered with handprints and
footprints in orange and blue, the school colors. "CHS 2002" was
painted in 2-foot-high letters in at least two areas.</LD>
<LD>   Officers believe the vandalism was a senior prank, Sgt. Robert
Carlsborg of the Los Angeles Unified School District police said. The
senior class is scheduled to graduate Friday.No arrests have been
made.</LD>
<TE>   Empty paint cans left at the sites are being analyzed for
fingerprints, and police technicians photographed the handprints for
similar analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "The district will press charges, and then they'll go after the
parents for restitution. That's standard operating procedure,"
Carlsborg said.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Dan Wyatt spoke to the student body about the incident
on Friday and asked the perpetrators to turn themselves in, according
to parents. Wyatt could not be reached Saturday for comment. Cleanup
is expected to take a week.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the vandalism occurred between 3 and 5:30 a.m.
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup crews began removing the graffiti Friday. But on Saturday
afternoon, handprints, sneaker prints and paint streaks still
blanketed the quad, an open-air area about the size of a football
field at the center of the school. In the quad, a brick marquee
proclaims the campus is the home of "Chancellor Pride and Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "I think senior pranks are all part of graduation, but I'm afraid
this one went a little too far," said Kim Krivis, whose daughter is
in the junior class.</TE>
<TE>   "If they'd just done a few handprints and footprints to say, 'We
were here,' it might have been cute," she said. "I hope they learn a
lesson from this."</TE>
<TE>   Carlsborg is urging anyone with information on the vandalism to
call school police at (213) 625-6631.</TE>

<DH>Technology: Recent violence near game centers translates to
tighter restrictions.</DH>

<LD>The portal to Calvin Williams' world, at least the one where he
spends most of his waking hours, is tucked into a nondescript
storefront in a Garden Grove strip mall.</LD>
<LD>   Inside iNET, one of several cyber cafes in the city, the lanky
Anaheim teenager can be found 10 hours a day, most days of the week,
slouched in a chair, his fingers a blur of motion over a computer
keyboard and mouse.</LD>
<LD>   He wears headphones to better immerse himself in the virtual
reality on the screen.</LD>
<TE>   "This," the 19-year-old said, "is my second home."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is playing Counter-Strike, a cyber version of cowboys and
Indians in which terrorists and counter-terrorists armed to the teeth
score points by blowing each other away.</TE>
<TE>   Like Williams, countless teenagers and young men around the globe
spend an extraordinary amount of time playing the game. Thanks to
computer networking technology, several players can connect to a
single machine and test their skills against each other, sometimes
across continents.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of Counter-Strike and other interactive computer
games is credited with sparking the recent growth of cyber cafes
around the country, also called PC rooms or Internet cafes.</TE>
<TE>   But some officials are becoming increasingly concerned that the
violence on the screen is spilling into the real world.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of June 8, Edward Fernandez, 14, was followed
from a Garden Grove Internet cafe and shot to death. Four suspects
have been arrested. There is no word yet on a motive, but the crime
has prompted the City Council to consider putting more restrictions
on cyber cafes.</TE>
<TE>   New Security Measures</TE>
<TE>   Several cities in the state, fearing that cyber cafes are magnets
for troublemaking youth, have begun limiting the number of hours such
businesses can stay open, usually until 2 a.m. Some require security
measures such as video surveillance and guards. In Garden Grove,
Diamond Bar and Lakewood, minors are not allowed in PC rooms during
school hours or late at night.</TE>
<TE>   Many Internet cafes do operate safely, officials say, and in some
places parents and their children often play together. The Costa Mesa
City Council declined to pass cyber cafe restrictions this month,
saying the two businesses in that city have had no such problems.</TE>
<TE>   But the mix of violent interactive games and youthful bravado
concerns law enforcement. Disputes that arise within the games,
between players, are sometimes settled with real fists and more
dangerous weapons. Officials are also concerned because cyber cafes
attract minors who will play into the night if allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "They lose track of time and reality," said Tim Kovacs, a Garden
Grove Police Department gang unit officer. "It seems almost feverish,
the level of anxiety inside some of these places. When you have so
many locations open at late hours catering to juveniles, you are
bound to have problems."</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove, with 23 cyber cafes, has had more than its share of
crimes associated with such businesses. In November, a dispute
between gamers escalated into a baseball bat-swinging melee.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside the same establishment a month later, a 20-year-old
was stabbed to death. Kovacs said many of the customers inside were
not even aware there had been a murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only were they oblivious," he said, "they continued to play
after they were told. They seemed more annoyed by the inconvenience."</TE>
<TE>   The young men and boys--and they are overwhelmingly young men and
boys--who become engrossed in this digital world say the amount of
violence is overblown by a handful of highly publicized cases.</TE>
<TE>   At iNET, Jorge, a 16-year-old, echoes other players when he says
cyber cafe confrontations are no different from scuffles at a pickup
game of basketball. Wherever boys and competition meet, he said,
there is always some amount of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who take it over the limit have no business playing," he
said while puffing on a cigar outside. "It is just a game."</TE>
<TE>   It is 11 p.m., three hours past city curfew for minors on a
weeknight, but Jorge says his parents would rather see him inside an
Internet cafe than on the streets. No one in the cafe has bothered to
check his age.</TE>
<TE>   Inside iNET, a handful of players are busy conquering virtual
worlds and killing off video terrorists and counter-terrorists. In
the dim light of the cafe, with about 35 computers, players' faces
glow in patterns of multicolored flashes.</TE>
<TE>   On the wall, a white board announces the top players in the house,
with monikers such as BomBerMaN and NerD. Four of the top five
players belong to a group calling itself the TS clan. Clans are teams
of players that circulate among Internet cafes challenging other
players for cyber supremacy.</TE>
<TE>   Playing All Day, Cheap</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who practically lives at iNET, is ranked eighth, Mr.
FIXIT. He belongs to no clan, preferring to fly solo. He said he took
a year off after graduating from high school. Most of his time has
been spent at cyber cafes. With rates ranging from $1.50 to $2 an
hour to play, it's a low-cost pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "My girlfriend hates that I spend so much time here," he said
during a recent session of Counter-Strike. He is busy typing instant
messages to other players while firing a virtual AK-47.</TE>
<TE>   "Isaac, you newbie," he teases a friend. Messages pop up instantly
to all the other players amid flash bombs and gunfire. Some are
profanity-laced. "I can type 85 words a minute," Williams boasts.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacs, the gang unit officer, worries about those messages.
Sometimes, players can take offense, and given how computers are
interconnected, anyone with a little savvy can find a player by
tracing the Internet connection.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, an iNET customer was stabbed after being
rushed by a group of suspected gang members who tracked him down from
another cyber cafe, Kovacs said, though it's not known if that was
prompted by a computer message.</TE>
<TE>   Williams seems unfazed by the real violence. He is interested only
in the mayhem on his screen. He barely shifts his eyes from the
screen while ordering chicken nuggets for dinner when a friend and
fellow player calls from the road to check if anyone is hungry.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Reich, 24, an iNET employee, points to that camaraderie as
one of the reasons so many flock to the cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a family atmosphere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the mood is quickly soured when Kovacs and his partner pay a
surprise visit shortly after 10 p.m. They cite three 17-year-olds for
violating the curfew, which is 8 p.m. during weekdays and 10 p.m. on
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   They also give a ticket to Thuc Ho, 22, an employee sitting behind
the counter, for allowing the minors to stay.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Pham, 24, the store's part-owner, is sitting at one of the
computers playing a game himself, but Ho points him out to the
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacs warns Pham, "If I come back here and you are still
violating the ordinance, I am going to arrest you."</TE>
<TE>   When officers enter some Internet cafes, Kovacs explains, it can
be hard to tell who's the customer and who's in charge because
everyone is playing games. So they ticket whoever is behind the
counter.</TE>
<TE>   The officer later said police have cracked down on curfew
violations since the killing of 14-year-old Edward Fernandez. Pham,
who had assured a reporter earlier that his business allows no minors
after the curfew hours, does an about-face.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the responsibility of the employees," he said, to check for
age. But isn't he in charge of the employees? "I am not the partner
in charge of employee relations," he responds.</TE>
<TE>   That infuriates Ho, who now has a $200 ticket. He accuses Pham of
letting him, an employee, take the rap for something that is the
management's responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't even on the clock," he said. "He never told us about the
curfew. He never told us we had to enforce anything."</TE>
<TE>   Another employee said, "He was a friend; now he is just a
businessman."</TE>
<TE>   Voting With Their Feet</TE>
<TE>   The group, including the employees and some customers, decide they
will desert Pham, at least for the evening.</TE>
<TE>   It's shortly before midnight, and they head to I.C.E. Internet
Cafe, the last place visited by the 14-year-old Edward Fernandez
before he was shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   When they arrive, I.C.E. part-owner Quang Nguyen looks despondent.
Since the killing, which happened blocks away after the youth and his
friends had left the cafe, business has dropped by half, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really sad," he said. "They think it happened in here. It
didn't happen inside. That kid could have been anywhere and
followed."</TE>
<TE>   Williams arrives shortly afterward. The group surveys the nearly
empty place. Nguyen tells them he will close early tonight because
it's slow.</TE>
<TE>   The group heads on out, to an Internet cafe in Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>Devoted Dads Honored at Compton Celebration</HD>
<DH>Fatherhood: A retired educator receives a commendation from
the city for his years of personal sacrifice and dedication to his
family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>January Prince says her dad has been her best friend and inspiration,
even through his toughest times.</LD>
<LD>   Despite an eight-year struggle with leukemia, during which Dwight
Prince underwent bouts of exhausting cancer therapy, he still
attended his daughter's school plays and his son's soccer games.</LD>
<LD>   He dropped 50 pounds in a few months, but never missed a
parent-teacher conference.</LD>
<TE>   And when he was weak and tired, the retired Compton Unified School
District principal still worked two jobs to help pay for medical
bills, college tuition and family vacations to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how to say thank you for what he has done for us,"
said January, 18. "He never let us down. He never turned his back on
us. He never complained while he was sick. He deserves it."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, January's nomination resulted in a special
commendation for Prince, 55, a 27-year Compton school district
employee.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Compton named him Father of the Year, the first such
award in this city, where positive works are commonly overshadowed in
the media by political scandals and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Prince is a former principal of Robert E. Lee Elementary School.
He has taught classes at Compton Community College, and regularly
volunteers helping to organize school athletic clubs and events "when
he should be in the bed," his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped pay for the college tuition for three of his four
children and stepchildren. He wakes up early every morning to take
his 16-year-old son to school, and gives the teenager driving
lessons.</TE>
<TE>   He takes January, his only daughter, to breakfast once a week and
always helped her with English papers when she was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "He cares for his family," said his wife, Melanie Prince, who has
been married to him for 19 years. "He wants us to be comfortable. He
wants us to make sure we have what we need."</TE>
<TE>   Compton resident Charles Lockett came up with the idea to honor
fathers because he was disappointed by the lack of appreciation for
dads and the city's poor image.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200 people turned out for the event, which was held at
Compton City Hall and sponsored by Compton Mayor Pro Tem Yvonne
Arceneaux.</TE>
<TE>   The Father of the Year was chosen by a panel of citizens and city
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We get such bad publicity in Compton, but we have great men, we
have a great community," Arceneaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Prince ran unsuccessfully for the Compton school board in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he wanted to make a difference in the city's schools,
which were plagued with problems. Prince was diagnosed with leukemia
in 1994, an ordeal that would have made school board service
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the state seized control of Compton's schools because of
the district's poor financial management and plummeting test scores.</TE>
<TE>   The board's power was recently restored, although it continues to
be a subject of political controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The city has also seen its share of drama, most notably its recent
months-long legal dispute over who should rightfully serve as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   January said her father never let his family or community down. It
hurts to watch him struggle with his illness, but he remains
determined that life will go on without change, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Prince said he was shocked that he won.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids were right there, and I tried to be right there for
them, even though I wasn't feeling as well I should be," he said. "It
kind of affirms that maybe something I am doing is right."</TE>
<TE>   Prince said that he never expected to get recognized for taking
care of his family. The duties, he said, come with the title. "I am
just a dad."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the Father's Day event say the men who were honored
Saturday, like Prince, are proof that Compton is not the disgraced
city that many have painted it to be.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the contenders, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Ulysses Terry, a former Parent Teacher Assn. member in Compton who
was involved with his daughter's talent shows and Camp Fire group,
took second place. And in third place was Derrick White, who attends
karate classes and football games with his son and is the boy's
primarily caregiver.</TE>
<TE>   The other nominees for Father of the Year were Samuel Sherrod Jr.,
a religious man who enjoys reading to youths; Robert Berry Withers,
an active church member and single father of three who raised them
since they were infants; Jay Conedy, a dedicated father who takes his
3-year-old daughter, who was born prematurely, to regular doctor
appointments; Milton L. McDaniel III, a single parent who raised his
daughter and saved money to buy her a basketball uniform when he was
laid off from work; and Timothy D. Polk, a hard-working father of
three who also cares for his wife, who has multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   Three other men were honored at the event, including Walter
Crawford, who was named Stepfather of the Year; Curtie Williams, who
was named Grandfather of the Year; and Dr. Donald Ray Evans Sr., who
was named Male Role Model of the Year.</TE>

<HD>Fee Waivers Violate City Procedures</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Officials say excessive discounts have cost the
Convention Center $1.8 million since June 2001. Visitors bureau
defends practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the year since an audit criticized the Los Angeles Convention and
Visitors Bureau for excessive waivers of rental fees at the city
Convention Center, nine more conferences held there have received
bureau discounts that violated city policy.</LD>
<LD>   All rental fees were waived for the nine events, costing the
Convention Center more than $1.8 million.</LD>
<LD>   The city allows discounts to lure business to the sprawling
facility, but the amounts cannot exceed the hotel bed tax generated
by each event. For the nine events held since June 2001, the
discounts exceeded bed taxes by $667,000.</LD>
<TE>   The size of discounts has been the subject of a long-running
dispute between the bureau, which has a contract with the city to
book conventions, and the management of the city-owned Convention
Center, which is supposed to oversee and approve discounts offered by
the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   George Rakis, general manager of the Los Angeles Convention
Center, said sometimes rents must be waived or discounted to make Los
Angeles more competitive with other cities. But he said some
discounts have been excessive and have been approved without his full
input.</TE>
<TE>   Rakis also said the bureau has given large discounts to trade
shows that had been booked for years by the Convention Center's own
staff and had paid full rent. The bureau offered the discounts if the
shows would book as bureau accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The Convention Center manager wrote a letter in July protesting
the bureau's practice of raiding the center's "house accounts" to
help the bureau meet its booking goals.</TE>
<TE>   "These events have never required discounts and, in some cases,
are now having portions of their rental reduced by your sales staff,"
Rakis wrote to Bureau President George Kirkland. "We strongly
disagree with offering discounts to these groups since the discounts
are not necessary, and having these events listed as bureau
accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Bureau Vice President Michael Collins said this week that those
discounts were only offered after other cities stepped up to compete
for the shows.</TE>
<TE>   "In each case, the clients are committing to a number of years in
the future and in each case there are other West Coast cities that
would offer the moon and the stars to have them meet somewhere other
than L.A.," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials say that discounts are necessary to counter Los
Angeles' competitive disadvantage with other cities caused by a lack
of hotel rooms and other amenities close to the Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say discounts have sometimes been given out
without enough thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned because it impacts the operating profit of the
center," said Peter Zen, chairman of the city Convention Center
Commission, which is conducting a wide-ranging review of the bureau's
performance and business practices. "It means less revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Zen said he would be less concerned if the discounts were bringing
in a lot of business, but he said few conventions are being booked by
the bureau these days.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer conventions coming to town, less money is available to
pay down the $525-million debt incurred to expand the Convention
Center in 1993, forcing the city to dip deeper each year into the
general fund to pay off the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   In an audit completed last June, the city controller found that
the bureau and Convention Center had waived $25 million in rental
fees in the six-year period ending June 30, 2000. The controller
noted that $5.8 million in waivers were provided in violation of the
policy limiting them to the hotel bed tax generated for the events.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, a review of Convention Center records shows that nine
more events received discounts that exceeded hotel bed taxes. The
shows include:</TE>
<TE>   * The American Assn. of Health Plans received a waiver of $89,701
but only generated $77,060 in hotel bed taxes.</TE>
<TE>   * The American Society of Health System Pharmacists received a
rental waiver of $216,000 while generating hotel bed tax of $132,213.</TE>
<TE>   * Digital Consulting Inc. had all $118,995 in Convention Center
rents waived for its event last December but only generated $13,800
in hotel bed taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials said there is a difference of opinion over the
intent of city discounting policies and who is ultimately
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "The bureau has no authority to unilaterally authorize discounts
to conventions," the bureau said in a statement, noting that the city
administrative officer and Convention Center must approve all
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   However, Rakis said many of the discounts were agreed to by the
bureau and convention organizers and approved by City Administrative
Officer William T. Fujioka as "done deals" by the time they reached
his desk for consent, potentially resulting in liability if he said
no.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement, bureau officials said the "collective
understanding" of city officials and others was that the aggregate
sum of the discounts annually should not exceed the total hotel bed
taxes generated in that year by all events.</TE>
<TE>   However, the city administrative code prohibits rent discounts
that exceed the amount of hotel bed tax generated by the event
discounted. The city controller's office confirmed that was the
policy in last year's audit.</TE>
<TE>   Interpreting Findings</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials said they have been operating since the audit
basing discounts on the controller's interpretation of the policy.</TE>
<TE>   They also said the nine conventions in question were booked years
before Controller Laura Chick raised the objection. However, in some
cases, Convention Center records show the events were booked knowing
the hotel bed tax would not cover the discount.</TE>
<TE>   The Convention Center audit was completed in June 2001 during Rick
Tuttle's term. Chick took office July 1 and made it public with her
own additional analysis in September.</TE>
<TE>   Chick challenged the amount of discounting and said lax policies
appear to have resulted in unwarranted financial losses by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of a comprehensive discount policy may have resulted in
unnecessary and / or excessive discounting by the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau," the audit concluded.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Los Angeles has the lowest rental revenue per square
foot of five comparable convention centers. Los Angeles received
$9.72 per square foot in rent in 1999, lower than San Francisco, New
Orleans, Atlanta and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said the Convention Center management and the city
administrative officer "did not adequately monitor space rental
discounting by the bureau to ensure compliance with guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   But Rakis said the problems go beyond what was uncovered in the
audit.</TE>
<TE>   Events such as the Western Restaurant Show and Audio Engineering
Society had been held for more than two decades at the Convention
Center and paid full rent, before switching from center accounts to
bureau accounts, Rakis said.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau has provided the California Restaurant Assn. with
$271,000 in discounts for its last five shows, including $49,222 for
its convention last year.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the bureau offered a discount to the restaurant show
after Anaheim put in a bid to take the show. The amount of discount,
he said, is minor compared to the show's gross of $876,000 at the
Convention Center and the $249,000 in hotel bed tax it generated.</TE>
<TE>   After two decades of paying full rent to the Convention Center,
Audio Engineering Society has received $224,000 in discounts for its
last three conventions, including $101,985 of the $113,750 rental for
its show this year.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the bureau offered a discount after the society went
to San Francisco one year, but Rakis said that change of location was
only a temporary move because the Convention Center was under
construction that year.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Colona, a spokeswoman for the society, said the discounts
were not decisive factors in the group continuing to come to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "While discounted rates are appealing to the AES, they neither
make nor break our decision to return. Holding our event there is
based strictly on the success of past shows," she said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   More important is that, along with New York City, Los Angeles is
one of the audio industry's two hubs, "thus making it a natural
choice for the convention."</TE>
<TE>   The group rotates between Los Angeles and New York and has done so
for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Considering New Policy</TE>
<TE>   Fujioka's office is drafting a new policy that Rakis said will
give him the chance to consent to discounts ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that will take care of the problem," Rakis said.</TE>
<TE>   The city administrative officer, however, is likely to recommend a
policy requested by the bureau--that discounts be allowed as long as
the total amount in a year does not exceed total hotel bed taxes by
all events.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Mercer, the consultant drafting the new policy, said it is
only fair that all the conventions in a year be added up to see if
the city got more in hotel bed taxes than it paid out in discounts.</TE>

<CX>   Convention Center--A June 16 article about the Los Angeles Convention
&amp; Visitors Bureau incorrectly stated that the agency waived rental
fees for Digital Consulting Inc. for an event staged in December at
the Los Angeles Convention Center. The company received a discount of
rental fees for a convention held in 2000, before an audit by the
city controller criticized the practice of providing discounts that
exceeded hotel bed taxes generated by the event. In the same story, a
photo caption misrepresented the statements of George Rakis, general
manager of the Convention Center. Rakis said he approved all the
rental discounts but complained that they were "done deals" by the
time they reached his desk.</CX>

<HD>Teenager's Dare Leads to Jewish Rite of Passage</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: 73-year-old woman meets her granddaughter's
challenge, and the two share a bat mitzvah, delighting girl's father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It all started with a dare. Ever since she was 12, Chiara Greene's
father had pleaded with her to have a bat mitzvah. Each year, the
outspoken, spunky teenager refused.</LD>
<LD>   Please, her father urged. It's an important part of our culture.</LD>
<LD>   "It just wasn't something I was into," Chiara, 16, said, adding
that she wasn't a "religion-oriented" type of person.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, in April 2001, she threw out a dare--partly joking, but
mainly to get her father off her back. "I said, 'Grandma, I'll do it
if you do it,' fully expecting her to say no."</TE>
<TE>   Her grandmother, 73-year-old Eileen Greene, grew up during a time
when it wasn't common for girls to take part in the age-old Jewish
coming-of-age rite of passage. Having such a ceremony was something
she watched others take part in, always curious about having one for
herself.</TE>
<TE>   There have been lots of other dares in her life--including jumping
off a 50-foot telephone pole and walking on hot coals. Going through
a bat mitzvah was another one she couldn't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   So on Saturday, Chiara and her grandmother, who share the same June 3
birthday, took the ritual step together at Temple Isaiah on the Westside,
and her father breathed a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fabulous Father's Day gift," said Chiara's persistent
father, Richard Greene. After years of struggling with how to make
his only child do something he believed was important, he watched his
daughter and mother stand together and read from the Torah in Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Cantor Monty Turner said Saturday's ceremony was unique to him.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience, I've never had a granddaughter and grandmother
celebrate at the same time," Turner said. "It's quite a statement."</TE>
<TE>   Greene had tried bribes, sweet talk, Jewish camp, a trip to
Israel. Nothing convinced the strong-willed Chiara. Nothing until
Grandma accepted the dare.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was about a year of Hebrew classes and tutoring for
the pair in preparation for the ceremony. But with Chiara living in
New Mexico with her mother, and her grandmother living in Brentwood,
the logistics were sometimes trying.</TE>
<TE>   What started as a dare and ended coincidentally as a Father's Day
tribute, however, became much more.</TE>
<TE>   Chiara's parents divorced when she was 6, and she lived with her
mother, who had converted to Judaism from her nondenominational
Christian faith when she married Richard Greene, who still lives in
Malibu. Their Santa Fe community wasn't a strong Jewish one, and
Chiara grew up with little exposure to the religion and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Her father's pleas were daunting. "I really didn't want to put in
the time," she said. "It didn't mean anything to me."</TE>
<TE>   Reluctantly, Chiara took the classes and found, with a bit of
difficulty, a Hebrew tutor in Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day, it clicked. Chiara remembers the day the
once-strange, loopy Hebrew characters she struggled to grasp became
familiar. "I thought, 'Wow, this is really cool. I can actually
understand it,' " Chiara said. "It was a great feeling to know I
could read another language."</TE>
<TE>   That moment opened her mind. She thought of Holocaust victim Anne
Frank. "I knew about her and what her story was," Chiara said.</TE>
<TE>   The story became personal. Anne had died right before her 16th
birthday. Chiara's grandmother is the same age Anne would have been
if she were alive.</TE>
<TE>   Chiara realized that the process she was participating in wasn't
just a way to stop her father's nagging. It wasn't just a dare.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her grandmother threw herself full force into learning
the language late in life. "I thought, 'It's going to be a
challenge,' but challenges are part of my life," Eileen Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   She found creative ways to learn.  To remember the names of the five
books of the Torah, she used an acronym: "Grandma Eats Latkes Not
Doughnuts," for Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the ceremony, an excited Chiara was
giggling with her friends and munching on chocolates in her
grandparents' home. She blushed and hid her face when her dad asked
her to sing.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to read Hebrew, she fluidly rambled off a few
lines from the story of Balaam, Balak and the talking donkey, while
playfully doing a hip-hop move with her upper body.</TE>
<TE>   Chiara doesn't regret not having had her bat mitzvah at 13, the
typical age for the ceremony. "I wouldn't have thoroughly understood
or enjoyed it," she said. "I would have done it just to get it over
with."</TE>
<TE>   And the time she has spent learning about her family's faith and
culture has led her to another realization: She wants to move back to
Los Angeles--not as a dare, but to be closer to her grandmother and
father.</TE>

<HD>Golf Course Prostitution Raid in Norco Leads to 6 Arrests</HD>
<DH>Police: Owner of the site says a tournament sponsor brought
in the women and his employees 'had no connection' to events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities arrested six people early Saturday morning, hours after
raiding a Norco golf tournament that allegedly offered romps with
prostitutes inside tents set up on the greens.</LD>
<LD>   Riverside County sheriff's deputies, some of whom hid in trees to
conduct surveillance, interviewed more than 100 golfers and course
employees during the Friday afternoon raid. About 19 women were also
interviewed.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests were the talk of the course, with some male golfers
saying it was already difficult enough getting their wives to OK a
round.</LD>
<TE>   "Now what am I supposed to say?" asked one golfer at Hidden Valley
Golf Club, who asked not to be identified. " 'Hey honey, I'm going to
the prostitution club.' Give me a break!"</TE>
<TE>   Hidden Valley managers Jason Wood, 36, and Darren Bollinger, 28,
both of Temecula, were arrested on suspicion of pimping and
pandering. Sandy Juarez, 37, of Lancaster, was booked on the same
charges and is believed to have provided the prostitutes for the
players, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Angie Peraza, 34, of Victorville was arrested on suspicion of
prostitution and child endangerment because she brought her child to
the course, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Mitchell, 38, of Newport Beach was arrested on suspicion of
possessing a controlled substance, and Allan Flemming, 34, of Laguna
Niguel was taken into custody on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute
and resisting arrest, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   'Very Embarrassing'</TE>
<TE>   Course owner Henry Cox said the sponsor of Friday's tournament,
which he would identify only as a Los Angeles restaurant, was
responsible for bringing in the prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted his employees knew nothing about it until the raid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very embarrassing," said Cox, adding that his employees
shouldn't have been arrested. "These are clean-cut guys, and I can
tell you we had no connection whatsoever to what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Cox said the tents where the encounters occurred were far from the
clubhouse and out of sight from course employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of tournaments set up tents where drinks and prizes are
handed out," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, not prizes like this."</TE>
<TE>   The same restaurant sponsored at least one other tournament at
Hidden Valley, Cox said. Authorities suspect sexual favors were also
offered then.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the scandal, Hidden Valley wasn't hurting for golfers
Saturday morning. Employees scrambled to keep up with customers
streaming in the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it is a very nice day to play golf," said Ron Rodriguez
after dropping a putt on the sixth hole.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and his friends said they watched the television news in
shock Friday night as detectives swarmed the course, but most
wouldn't be deterred.</TE>
<TE>   If the club was open, they would play.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're scheduled to play, you're scheduled to play," said
one man, who identified himself only as Scott.</TE>
<TE>   He was just thankful his wife fell asleep before the nightly news
came on.</TE>

<HD>Dose of Nature Gives Severely Disabled Kids Joy,
Self-Esteem</HD>
<DH>Usually unresponsive children come to life as they pet a
miniature horse or hold a furry bunny at Ramirez Canyon Park, thanks
to the Happy Trails group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennie Marie Fockens usually spends her days in a motionless,
catatonic haze, drifting in and out of slumber in her purple
dragon-print stroller.</LD>
<LD>   But when the 6-year-old's world expanded for a day to include 15
bunnies, a knee-high sheep and a brown miniature horse named
Chocolate, Jennie emerged from her shell. She ran her fingers through
the horse's dark mane, giggling and smiling.</LD>
<LD>   The animals' playtime with Jennie was organized through Happy
Trails, a nonprofit organization that matches fuzzy creatures with
disabled children for three-hour sessions at Ramirez Canyon Park in
Malibu, a 22 1/2-acre park that singer Barbra Streisand donated to
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</LD>
<TE>   Happy Trails started partnering with the conservancy this year to
provide a permanent home for the program, founded in 1993, to help
disabled children feel accepted and successful.</TE>
<TE>   About four groups from public and private schools around Los
Angeles County visit the park each week, walking or rolling their
wheelchairs down red brick paths built especially for the program.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times these kids feel like they're the least important
children at school because they're the last ones to be included in
anything," said Happy Trails founder Pepper Edmiston of Pacific
Palisades. "Here, kids with special needs can feel celebrated and
included in their own little sanctuaries of happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Pushing Jennie's stroller under the park's leafy canopy and
stroking the girl's froth of blond curls, her mother said the girl's
eagerness to pet Chocolate amazed her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's usually so lethargic," said Connie Summerfield of Venice,
who said her daughter has been severely brain-damaged since birth.
"For her to reach out her hand and touch something, it's breaking a
barrier."</TE>
<TE>   The other five children from Jennie's school, the Bellagio Road
Newcomer Center Elementary School in Bel-Air, smiled and laughed as
they cuddled the bunnies, including Maple, a brown lop the size of a
small dog, and Cocoa, a velvety white rabbit flecked with brown.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they couldn't speak, you could feel their pride and
sense of achievement when they were playing with the animals," said
volunteer Ben Chou of Westwood. "Everybody's always taking care of
them, so it's really great for them to get a chance to take care of
something else."</TE>
<TE>   Program coordinators bring the animals in for each session from
their homes in Malibu and Pacific Palisades. Before collaborating
with the conservancy, the program moved among five ranches.</TE>
<TE>   Edmiston created the organization to give children like her son,
David, a place to shine in the outdoors. David, a 25-year-old who was
left retarded and epileptic after a bout of cancer in childhood,
plays with the animals alongside the children during Happy Trails
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and siblings of the disabled children are also invited to
accompany the groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Trails brings some balance to the helplessness I feel being
David's mom," Edmiston said. "It's very lonesome to be the parent of
a child with a disability. With this program I can give people like
me such a fun, low-key way to network."</TE>
<TE>   As parents and teachers chatted quietly during lunch, some of the
students continued their interaction with nature. One small boy in a
baseball hat with Batman-like ears jumped around in a pile of oak
leaves while a girl from the Village Glen School in Sherman Oaks,
which sent eight autistic high school students, communed with a shiny
black beetle crawling up her arm.</TE>
<TE>   "Animals seem to have this magical effect," said Jan Wolterstorff,
Ramirez Canyon Park's outreach coordinator. "All these unmeasured
things--socialization, communication, feelings of self-worth--come
out of this interaction."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Devereaux, a 6-year-old from Brentwood with cerebral palsy,
grinned happily as he stroked Maple, the furry ball of bunny sitting
on his lap. Before meeting Maple, the boy had sat expressionless, his
hands limp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great they had some smaller animals," said his father, Peter
Devereaux, "since I think the horse is a little big for Jason."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the older students preferred to take advantage of the
sun-dappled meadow next to the garden to play games with foam
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheep was so cute, but ring toss and baseball were great,"
said Stepen Davoodian, 16, of Tujunga. "It's nice to be away from
school for a while and be somewhere so beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   The creamy-coated sheep, Chelsea, lost some of her appeal when she
broke away from the fence where she was tied and jumped over a wall
into a muddy stream. Volunteers and park officials lifted the baying
creature from the muck as the teachers tried to herd the excited
children back to the other activities.</TE>
<TE>   Village Glen teacher Agasthi Ranasinghe smiled as he watched the
students fuss over Chelsea, picking the leaves from her muddy coat.
"City kids have no connection to these kinds of animals normally,"
Ranasinghe said.</TE>
<TE>   Within the next few months, Edmiston hopes to introduce miniature
donkeys, goats, cows and pot-bellied pigs.</TE>
<TE>   "These animals can tell the kids need some love, and it's so
reciprocal," Edmiston said.</TE>
<TE>   "They need affection as much as the kids. But when the kids get a
chance to hold and pet these little creatures and feel their hearts
beating, they're transported to a different place."</TE>

<HD>Valley Secession Is a Hair-Trigger Topic at Barbershop</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By now you've heard the squawking from Valley folk who can't wait to
walk out on Los Angeles, and you've heard from the mayor who thinks
they've been out in the sun too long.</LD>
<LD>   But you have not yet heard from the gang at the most politically
astute barbershop in all of Los Angeles. So here we go with the
question of the day at Lawrence Tolliver's clip joint on Florence
near Western, where I'm the only pale face in the room:</LD>
<LD>   Does anyone care if the Valley secedes?</LD>
<TE>   Well, if it's about a lack of services, Tony Wafford says while
waiting for a trim, what do Valley folk know about getting stiffed?
He leads me outside, where scrubby weeds sprout from cracks and the
sidewalk is a roller coaster ride.</TE>
<TE>   "You see this tree?" Wafford asks. "We paid to trim it ourselves.
People around here haven't seen a city tree-trimming crew in 10
years."</TE>
<TE>   "We got parents scared to let their kids go to the store," says
Drew Palmer, who's getting his head landscaped by Mr. Tolliver and
can't believe it's the Valleyites who are moaning about police
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver, in my experience, is a patient man. He tends to
listen quietly, shaping his thoughts as artfully as he shapes heads.
But when he lets loose, no one crowds his stage.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Rams left Los Angeles to go to Anaheim, they left me,"
he bellows, waving comb and scissors menacingly. "Then they left me
again and went to St. Louis. Well, if you don't want me, then I don't
want you! I love no one who doesn't love me back."</TE>
<TE>   A chorus of howls and amens spurs him on.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Rams played the Ku Klux Klan," Tolliver wails, "I'd root
for the Ku Klux Klan. So I say if the Valley wants to go, let 'em go.
We'll be fine on our own. And don't sit up in that Valley and claim
the Lakers, and don't come to the L.A. Philharmonic. Get yourself a
Valley Philharmonic. I say we put up a toll booth on the 405 and
charge them to come down here."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's Tony Wafford's turn to riff, and he cranks up the volume
as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd make them stay," he says, mischief in his eyes. "Make them
stay and deal with problems like I've got to. That's the thing with
white people. They can't be uncomfortable for five minutes. I say
take an Advil, because you know they got a pill in their medicine
cabinet for every little thing that bothers them."</TE>
<TE>   I point out that the Valley no longer looks like Utah. It's as
diverse as the rest of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen one [dang] Negro stand up at a secession meeting
in the Valley and say let's go," Wafford booms. Besides, he says, if
you live in the Valley, it doesn't matter what color your skin is.</TE>
<TE>   "You wake up in the morning and want to be treated like white
people. You look out the window and say why didn't someone trim my
tree? Why's my sidewalk cracked? Running is a cop-out. I say we keep
them and let them see the world like other people see it."</TE>
<TE>   There's a question on the table, Mr. Tolliver reminds everyone:
What's your vote on secession?</TE>
<TE>   He casts his ballot for, and Wafford nullifies him. Now Mr.
Tolliver begins taking votes by phone, as customers call to book
tonsorial appointments. We're deadlocked at 2-2 when Kevin Hooks, a
marketing consultant and national trustee with the Urban League,
walks in for his haircut.</TE>
<TE>   Make it 3-2 for one Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Splitting the city in three means a loss of prestige, political
clout, and business, Hooks tells the gang. A lot of the marketing
deals he puts together are based on being able to pitch L.A. as the
second largest city in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a right to be upset about services in Hollywood and
the Valley, but the solution is to get the leadership to make it
better," says Hooks. "If they secede, it doesn't benefit us down
here."</TE>
<TE>   Hooks glances around the room and makes a sharp observation. The
vote is breaking down along generational lines, same as the
barbershop vote for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The same elders who voted for Jim Hahn because they liked his late
father, county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, are voting emotionally once
again, telling the Valley to take a hike even if it means a loss of
tax revenue in the 'hood.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says Wafford, pointing outside the shop. "There's Negroes
out there with shovels, still trying to dig up Ken Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver admits that voting for Jim Hahn was the mistake of
his life. "I want a DNA test on him," he insists. "That's not Ken
Hahn's son."</TE>
<TE>   And now, into the shop comes Rodney Taylor, who lives in
Northridge and can't wait to cast his vote for secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay for a lot of goods and services we don't get," Taylor
claims. He says he's tired of the Valley being the cash cow for the
rest of the city's grazing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a defector Negro," Wafford says.</TE>
<TE>   The final votes are cast, and when the polls close, the tally can
be no closer.</TE>
<TE>   By a single vote, secession loses, and the city remains whole.</TE>
<TE>   But Mr. Tolliver refuses to give in. Those Valley folks are no
better than the Rams, he repeats. He grills his own son, Bernard,
asking why he didn't vote to send the Valley on its way.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are on TV now in the final game of the NBA finals, and
Tolliver is waving a finger as he shouts up at the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Turn this game off in the Valley!" he says. If they don't love
L.A., "let them watch it on pay per view."</TE>

<HD>Watergate Revisited With More Than the Expletives Deleted</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>When foreign terrorists are beheading hostages and flying airplanes
into American buildings, Watergate almost seems like a pleasant
diversion--the political equivalent of baseball fans discussing some
ancient World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Invoking the names of Nixon, Mitchell, Liddy and Dean--not to
mention Deep Throat--has the same cocktail-party levity to it as
would dropping the names of Mantle, Berra, Reese and Campanella.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, remember when Liddy told his handlers he'd stand on the
street corner if they wanted to whack him?"</LD>
<TE>   "Sure. Or, when Dean said Nixon knew about the break-in?"</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, young people (those of you under 30), that kind
of talk is comforting nostalgia for many of your elders.</TE>
<TE>   Come Monday, don't be surprised to see lots of it on TV when we
celebrate (is there any other word?) the 30th anniversary of the
Watergate break-in, from which the countdown began to the end of the
Richard Nixon presidency in August 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Given the state of the world today, it'll be hard to remember that
Watergate was a pulse-pounding saga that at times had many Americans
worrying about the state of the Republic. That sounds like a comic
statement today, except to those who remember coming home late on a
Saturday night in 1973 and hearing about the "Saturday Night
Massacre," when the U.S. attorney general and his No. 2 man quit,
instead of following Nixon's orders to fire the Watergate special
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Library's Perspective</TE>
<TE>   That Watergate has become cultural shtick is nowhere more evident
than at the Nixon Library in Orange County, which will never be
confused with the Smithsonian. At the library in Yorba Linda,
officials decided last week to get a jump on the upcoming festivities
by alerting the news media to a group of people who would talk about
Watergate.</TE>
<TE>   The intent was to put Watergate in perspective, says John Taylor,
the executive director of the Nixon Foundation that runs the library.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor says the Watergate scandal, which began when political
operatives broke into Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate
building in Washington, D.C., should be seen in the context of
anti-Vietnam War elements that were leaking information to the press.</TE>
<TE>   "President Nixon was trying to end the war he had inherited as
well as transform the balance of power in the world through his
visionary foreign policy," says Taylor, who once served as Nixon's
personal assistant. "Then, as now, a president fighting a war can't
do his job with maximum effectiveness if his government can't keep
secrets."</TE>
<TE>   That virtually nobody--not even most of Nixon's political
allies--eventually bought that version in 1974 doesn't seem to matter
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Even many Nixon supporters who recite the statement about the
poisonous atmosphere in the Vietnam War era came to realize back then
that Nixon was protecting himself, not the presidency, as he
orchestrated his downfall.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, who cares?</TE>
<TE>   Revising History</TE>
<TE>   Nobody died at Watergate, and 30 years is a long, long time. With
our attention focused on the real dangers in the world, what better
time to slip in a little historical revisionism?</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be the thinking at the Nixon Library, which was
pretty much designed from the get-go to polish the old man's
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   I will give them this: Watergate is a big party compared with
threats of nuclear attack and wars of civilizations. Compared to
Osama bin Laden, Richard Nixon is one of the most sympathetic and
misunderstood figures America has ever produced.</TE>
<TE>   So, to the Nixon Library folks, I say: Have at it. Tell it like it
is.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon himself always said history depends on who's writing it.</TE>
<TE>   And when you're through with Watergate, how about branching out
with a documentary on how Custer led his troops to a resounding
victory at Little Bighorn?</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Struggles to Quell Gangs</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police seek reinforcements as poverty and
delinquency continue to push local youths toward crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tipped off that two rival gangs were planning a combined attack on
their downtown headquarters, Santa Paula police went on tactical
alert, hunkered down and waited for what might come.</LD>
<LD>   An informant told police that gangs wanted to firebomb the city's
small station and spray it with machine-gun fire--an act of revenge
for the shooting of one of their own by federal agents during a drug
bust.</LD>
<LD>   "I wouldn't put it past them to come by in the curtain of darkness
and crank off some rounds," said Police Chief Bob Gonzales,
explaining his decision to declare an alert and request the help of
10 sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<TE>   "Had I not taken the threats seriously I wouldn't have been doing
my job."</TE>
<TE>   There was no attack that April night. But the fact that the threat
was taken seriously underscores the magnitude of Santa Paula's gang
problems and its inability to break the cycle of poverty and
delinquency that has stalked this city for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula, a farming town of 30,000, was once a thriving
business and cultural center, but the city fell on hard times after
the oil industry pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   And repeated efforts by city leaders to recapture past glories
have failed. The city's picturesque Main Street, still used as a
backdrop for Hollywood movies, is now lined with thrift shops and
noisy bars.</TE>
<TE>   Crime surged nearly 13% last year because of sharp increases in
robbery and theft. So far this year, there have been two homicides
and three drive-by shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime is starting to take over, and if we don't get ahold of it,
it will be out of hand," Det. Daryl Koranda said. "We're at the
border right now.... If people would help us out in Santa Paula, we
could change things a lot. Eighty percent of the people who [witness
crimes] will say nothing because of gang retaliation."</TE>
<TE>   The city has five street gangs and about 200 members. With 22
patrol officers, there is only so much that law enforcement can do to
stem the tide of violence, Det. Jamey Maclellan said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough officers," said Maclellan, a seven-year
veteran of the department. "Six more officers would be ideal."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the city received assistance from a special
team of agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration,
whose mission is to assist police in drug-plagued communities.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen agents participated in a joint undercover operation with
police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities announced the results last month: 21 people
arrested--most from three local gangs--and several pounds of drugs
and nearly a dozen stolen guns were seized during the four-month
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But not everything went smoothly. On April 17, agents went to
arrest 22-year-old Edward Barron on suspicion of selling drugs out of
his home. When authorities arrived at his residence on Santa Barbara
Street, Barron allegedly pointed a revolver at a DEA agent, who then
shot Barron in the head. Barron, who police said had well-known gang
ties, remains paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said police will continue working with federal and state
authorities to combat crime and drugs. Still, he acknowledged that he
needs more patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   With a department budget of $3.5 million, the chief said he has
managed to hire additional officers by tapping into revolving federal
and state grants.</TE>
<TE>   But he notes that this is a temporary solution and that his
officers remain among the lowest paid in the county.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Donald Johnson said the city is struggling
financially and doesn't have the resources to hire additional
officers. Besides, Johnson said, Santa Paula's crime "is not out of
the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to look at it over the long haul," said Johnson,
who is also publisher of the town's newspaper. "This is a pretty safe
city. I'm not afraid to walk in this community. I tell people to look
at the community overall, and don't take the issue and paint it with
a broad brush. We need to look at ways to generate dollars for the
city."</TE>
<TE>   One way to do that is with new development, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   He is among those who support a plan to expand the city's
boundaries to allow for more residential and commercial development
in Adams Canyon, northwest of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   In November, voters will be asked to approve an initiative that
calls for construction of 1,980 single-family homes, 180
condominiums, 90 apartments, two schools, hotels and a retail
shopping complex on the canyon floor and along its hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and other supporters say the project would bring much
needed tax revenue, jobs and amenities to help pay the city's police
officers, maintain its roads and keep businesses alive.</TE>
<TE>   They say it may be the best chance at securing a strong economic
future for the cash-starved city.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we can clean up our town visually and have enough fire and
police to protect our citizens, [investors] are not going to come,"
Councilman Rick Cook said earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents say the new development would bring more traffic,
stretch city services and change Santa Paula's rural character.</TE>
<TE>   They say a mix of commercial and residential development should be
encouraged on vacant and underutilized lots around Main Street and in
neighboring Fagan Canyon, which is smaller than Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Adams Canyon deal is all empty promises," said Robert
Borrego, a Santa Paula activist and former planning commission
member. "It's a bad deal for Santa Paula." Regardless of the outcome
in November, officials agree that more needs to be done to help
redirect the city's troubled and poverty-stricken youths who are
attracted to gang life.</TE>
<TE>   Of the county's 10 cities, Santa Paula students rank among the
most likely to commit an alcohol- or drug-related crime, according to
a recent study. And fewer than one in four Santa Paula High School
freshmen in the heavily Spanish-speaking city passed a test last year
that they will need to pass in order to graduate in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Expulsions from Santa Paula's public schools jumped from 11 last
year to 21 so far in the 2001-2002 school year, said William Brand,
superintendent of the high school district. Most of the expulsions
were the result of drugs or weapons in school, Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Brand and other city and police officials have formed
a task force to prevent low-scoring and problem students from getting
kicked out of school. The task force, which includes parents,
community leaders and law enforcement officials, began meeting in
February.</TE>
<TE>   The group will unveil a four-point strategy in August. The
bilingual plan will include recommendations for keeping kids in
school and off drugs. It will also suggest methods for parents to get
more closely involved in their children's education and for students
to avoid violent confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get the students through the 10th grade, we can
graduate them," Brand said. "It's a challenge. We have a generation
cycle of kids going into gangs looking for identity and a comfort
level."</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't motivate students early to value education, then
those students can become at risk for choosing another lifestyle," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gonzales said his department is doing all it can to
stem gang violence. He said he expects to create the city's
first-ever two-officer unit assigned to gangs and narcotics detail in
July. He also plans to apply for more federal money next month to
hire more officers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a deputy district attorney is expected to be stationed part
time in Santa Paula early next year to assist officers and better
prepare cases for court, said Greg Totten, chief assistant district
attorney. Oxnard is the only other city in the county assigned a
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   But despite such moves, Gonzales said Santa Paula's problems go
far beyond anything law enforcement can accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   "It is also an economic issue," he said. "Even if we had a police
officer on every street, you would still have crime."</TE>
<TE>   Calla Dominguez, who works at the Police Department's community
center at Las Piedras Park, said it's time residents and city
officials woke up to the notion that their small town is plagued with
some big-city problems.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first step necessary in dealing with the tough issues
confronting this city, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime is so widespread and everyone has always thought it will
not happen in this little town," Dominguez said. "People are wrong,
it is happening."</TE>

<HD>Breakup Pitched to South L.A.</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Jeff Brain tells a gathering that race isn't the
motive for Valley and Hollywood secession. Not all in the audience
are convinced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With visions of a smaller, more responsive and sensitive local
government, proponents of breaking up Los Angeles on Saturday
targeted African Americans in South Los Angeles as part of their
campaign to increase support for dividing the nation's second-largest
city into three parts.</LD>
<LD>   Should the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood form independent
cities, residents in a downsized Los Angeles would benefit from
improved public services, eased access to City Council members and
increased political power in their ethnic communities, secession
advocates told the two dozen African Americans attending a breakfast
forum at Farmer's Restaurant in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   "This city has turned an arrogant ear to all of us," said Jeff
Brain, president of the pro-secession group Valley Vote. Those in the
audience were divided over that appeal: Some said they were
persuaded, but others expressed skepticism that breaking the Valley
off from L.A. would have benefits for the city it left behind.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles voters will decide Nov. 5 whether the Valley and
Hollywood--which together account for about 40% of the city's
population--should secede.</TE>
<TE>   The polite, two-hour discussion was hosted by Earl Ofari
Hutchinson, a secession opponent, South-Central author and president
of the nonprofit National Alliance for Positive Action.</TE>
<TE>   He said more forums are needed to educate ethnic minorities about
the breakup movement.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know much about the issue," Hutchinson
said. "It's not like O.J. Simpson, where every day there's a story in
the media."</TE>
<TE>   Despite pitches for separate cities, skepticism dominated talk at
the family diner on La Brea Avenue, where waitresses served strong
coffee and grits and knew customers by name.</TE>
<TE>   "Our instinct is to be suspicious," said Karen Bass, a
South-Central community activist and a City Council candidate in the
8th District. "But I'm just not convinced there is anything good
about secession."</TE>
<TE>   Other participants complained that racism is a driving force
behind the Valley secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I think people want to see black people powerless,"
said Pearl Jr., a Van Nuys homeowner and author whose comments
Saturday received applause. " ... Many white people seem to want to
maintain their wealth and power."</TE>
<TE>   However, secessionists argued that the Valley, once a white
bedroom community of stucco homes with pools, is ethnically diverse,
if somewhat less so than the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The new city's population would be 43% Latino, 41% white, 9%
Asian/Pacific Islander and 4% black.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think race has anything to do with secession," Brain
said.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Dove, an African American management consultant who lives
in southwest Los Angeles, said he supports the municipal division.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in self-determination," he said. "If the Valley and
Hollywood want to go, then that's good."</TE>
<TE>   He said African Americans and Latinos remaining in Los Angeles
would increase their political clout and representation on the City
Council. "I think ethnic groups could benefit," said Dove, president
of the California Congress for Racial Equality.</TE>
<TE>   But Lucille Saunders told the diners she feared the consequences
of a smaller Los Angeles. "It would further divide and disintegrate
the city," said Saunders, who lives within the proposed boundaries
for an independent Hollywood. " ... I'm here because I'm scared."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists said Saturday that they plan to continue reaching
out to ethnic minorities in an effort to build alliances with the
African American and Latino communities across the rest of the city
of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Today," Brain said, "we planted a seed."</TE>

<HD>Jail Suicides Reach Record Pace in State</HD>
<DH>Incarceration: Last year, 38 inmates killed themselves.
Some experts blame the recent surge on forcing more of the mentally
ill behind bars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More California jail inmates are killing themselves than ever before,
and some experts believe it's because mentally ill people are
inappropriately landing in jail.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 38 inmates committed suicide, most by strangulation,
usually with jail bedding but sometimes with socks or even shoelaces.
One inmate managed to hold a plastic bag over his head until he
suffocated.</LD>
<LD>   The death total was a sharp rise over the 23 suicides recorded in
2000. It also surpassed the previous high of 37, recorded nearly 20
years ago before sweeping reforms were adopted to identify suicidal
arrestees and keep them under close supervision.</LD>
<TE>   If this year's pace of 10 suicides in the first quarter holds up,
another record will be set.</TE>
<TE>   One of the state's leading experts in jail medical care expressed
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there should be an in-depth look at these instances
statewide to see if anyone can find a pattern," said Rebecca Craig of
San Francisco's Institute for Medical Quality, a California Medical
Assn. subsidiary that independently reviews jail medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "The surge is a concern to us," said Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman
for state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard "for people on the outside to have sympathy" for a jail
inmate who commits suicide, said Lindsay M. Hayes, assistant director
of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue is a public concern, if only for coldly financial
reasons: Victims' families often file suit, potentially costing
taxpayers millions of dollars if jailers are found to have failed in
their duties.</TE>
<TE>   Also, of the 38 suicide cases in 2001, the vast majority of
inmates had not been convicted but were awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   Records filed with the state Department of Justice by the counties
where the suicides occurred showed that the victims were young and
old, educated and unemployed, and accused of a gamut of crimes from
petty theft to murder. A number suffered from mental problems that
raised, or could have raised, a red flag to jailers.</TE>
<TE>   There were high-profile inmates such as accused Sacramento
multiple murderer Nikolay Soltys, who killed himself earlier this
year despite being watched constantly by a surveillance camera.</TE>
<TE>   Most, however, were little more than footnotes in the local paper,
such as James Riberal, a 33-year-old construction worker with a
drinking problem who hanged himself after being placed in a Stockton
jail on a charge of petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   Several were placed in special suicide-watch holding cells after
their arrests, only to be moved to the general jail population, where
they finally killed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there are suicides occurring," said William J. Crout,
deputy director of the state Board of Corrections. "It's not
surprising [that the numbers are going up] given the number of
individuals in county jails identified as mentally ill."</TE>
<TE>   The board's latest survey of county jail conditions statewide
shows that the number of inmates getting mental health treatment has
more than doubled in just five years.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people in jail who should be in mental
institutions," said Jordan, the Lockyer spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But Craig said the surge in jail suicides may also indicate that
the profile of a suicidal inmate is changing, making it harder to
spot those thinking of ending their lives. It has long been accepted
wisdom, she said, that the best way to find out if an inmate is
suicidal is to ask him or her. But in every case she was aware of,
"the inmate is denying any suicide ideation."</TE>
<TE>   Although 38 suicides in one year may not seem like a large number,
one way to put it into perspective is to compare the county jail
totals with California's 33 state prisons, where criminals are sent
once they have been convicted of felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Out of a prison population of 157,493 inmates last year, 21 killed
themselves. That amounts to 13 per 100,000, comparable to the rate in
the general population, Crout said. The suicide rate for the 73,000
county jail inmates serving time for misdemeanor offenses or awaiting
trial on felony charges is 52 per 100,000--four times higher.</TE>
<TE>   Counties contacted said they could not talk about individual
cases. In several instances, lawsuits have been filed by victims'
families.</TE>
<TE>   Other causes of death in jail besides suicide include accidents,
illnesses and homicide at the hands of another inmate. But suicide
has been a leading cause for many years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, when the previous peak was reached, inmate suicides
accounted for nearly half the total of 85 deaths in California jails.
After a wave of wrongful death lawsuits, local jurisdictions took
steps to bring down the number of inmates killing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Special suicide-watch cells were opened, jailers were instructed
in how to spot a despondent inmate and bureaucratic red tape was
snipped to give inmates easier access to doctors and medication.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to the late '70s and early '80s, jails are more
professionally operated," Crout said.</TE>
<TE>   That new focus on inmate suicide brought quick results. While the
jail population as a whole was exploding in California from about
30,000 to 70,000 between 1980 and 1990, the number of suicides was
falling. By 1989, they had been cut in half, to 14, out of 68 jail
deaths. In 1995, the numbers began moving upward again.</TE>
<TE>   County jail inmates are different from state prisoners. Many are
first-timers who may have more fragile personalities that can snap in
a confined environment.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Patrick Covarrubias, 18, had been in the Contra Costa County
jail three weeks awaiting trial on drug and vehicle code charges when
he hanged himself with a bedsheet. The trigger? Possibly missing a
visit from his girlfriend, jailers noted.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Frampton, an accused 35-year-old child molester, killed
himself after reportedly telling his cellmate he was frightened
because a video of his victim was about to be shown in court.</TE>
<TE>   In several instances, jailers appear to have had indications that
the inmates might harm themselves, yet nothing seemed to have been
done to prevent it.</TE>
<TE>   Parents File Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Covarrubias' parents have filed suit, accusing jail personnel of
giving him only a "superficial mental examination."</TE>
<TE>   He was not on suicide watch, even though he had previously been
declared disabled by the state, suffering from depression and
delusions.</TE>
<TE>   The family of Joshua Daniel Lee also filed suit, accusing Los
Angeles County authorities of "deliberate indifference" toward the
severe mental problems that led to his suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, 22, of Hawthorne was hospitalized after exhibiting psychotic
behavior. Yet his family was unable to convince the hospital to keep
him.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Jan. 30, 2001, Lee allegedly stabbed and killed a woman
while trying to take her car at a Redondo Beach shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Lee was at first placed in the mental ward of
the Twin Towers jail complex in downtown Los Angeles. But after a few
days, he was moved into the general jail population, according to
reports. On Feb. 9, 2001, he was found hanging in his cell, with a
bedsheet around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Hoffman, 18, a senior at Granite Hills High School in El
Cajon, had no criminal record, but was in San Diego County jail
facing a 27-year sentence for shooting up his high school campus last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The product of divorce, he had been troubled for years. The
teenager apparently had taken two guns to school after being turned
down by the Navy, which he saw as a last chance to put some order in
his life.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hoffman wounded five people, an attorney for the family,
Burton Jacobson, characterized the shooting as a cry for help from a
very disturbed young man. According to Jacobson, Hoffman had
attempted suicide at least once before succeeding in hanging himself
Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Though he'd been on suicide watch, Hoffman was returned to the
general jail population shortly before his death. "For some
unexplained reason, they took him off suicide watch," said Jacobson,
who has filed a $10-million claim against San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most-publicized, and one of the most hotly debated,
suicides was that of Soltys, a 28-year-old Ukrainian immigrant
accused of killing six members of his family in the Sacramento area.</TE>
<TE>   Soltys' suicide occurred despite the fact he was under the
tightest security available. He was housed in the same cell and
monitored by the same 24-hour camera that had watched mail-bomber Ted
Kaczynski, said Soltys' attorney, Tommy Clinkenbeard. Yet Soltys
managed to fashion a hangman's rope from a plastic bag and strips of
cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Difficult to Prevent</TE>
<TE>   To some in law enforcement, Soltys' death shows the folly of
trying to prevent all jail suicides.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what we do, if someone is intent on killing themselves,
they're going to do it," said Sheriff's Capt. Jim Cooper, who
oversees the Sacramento County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Clinkenbeard doesn't buy it. "They had plenty of warning and
notice as to the suicide risk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento County Jail is now taking steps to make future
suicides less likely by redesigning bunks from which inmates were
often hanging themselves. Soltys' suicide was the ninth in the jail
in less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of Soltys' mental problems were not known until after
his death, but experts say more and more people with known
psychiatric conditions are winding up in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Crout said, the number of inmates across the state
needing mental health attention has more than tripled--from 1,191 to
4,300.</TE>
<TE>   "Only in the past five years have we seen such a dramatic increase
in mentally ill [people] coming into jails," said Hayes, a nationally
recognized authority on jail suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Even 4,300 is probably a low figure, said Rod Gottula, a jail
suicide expert in Colorado. "You're finally identifying them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say there are two reasons that more mentally ill
people are landing in jail: The tough law-and-order mentality of
recent years has made authorities less tolerant of quality-of-life
crimes such as aggressive panhandling and public drunkenness. At the
same time, many county mental health treatment institutions have
closed, leaving police no alternatives to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Some plaintiff lawyers say jail medical care has gotten worse in
recent years as more and more counties have hired outside
contractors. The largest contractor in California is Monterey-based
California Forensic Medical Group.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials declined to talk about specific cases, but
frankly described the difficulties of working with mentally ill
inmates. "It's a terrible business," said Dr. Taylor Fithian, the
company's medical director.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the "huge influx of people with major mental health
problems," Fithian estimated that 10% to 15% of the jail population
has an "Axis One" diagnosis. That includes serious conditions such as
major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Anywhere from
10% to 35% of inmates are on psychotropic medication--"the most ever,
ever, ever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, it would be nice to divest ourselves from this
business," Fithian said.</TE>
<TE>   Spotting a suicidal inmate is made harder by the fact that some
lie to avoid being placed in isolated suicide-watch cells.</TE>
<TE>   Gottula said he overheard a jail nurse once asking an inmate if he
felt suicidal. When the inmate answered yes, the nurse replied, "If
you say yes, they're going to strip you and put you in a bare cell."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, then I'm not," the inmate said.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said he cannot be sure what is behind the current situation.
"Sometimes there's a reason for these things, and sometimes you just
scratch your head," he said.</TE>

<HD>Zzyzx: An Unlikely Home of Hucksterism and Miracle Cures</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The way to Zzyzx, Calif.--marked by green and white signs pointing to
a road off a desolate stretch of Interstate 15 southwest of Las
Vegas--is a road less traveled these days.</LD>
<LD>   This 4 1/2-mile byway with a name like a word on a Scrabble board
shoots off seemingly to nowhere, offering travelers glimpses of
Mojave Desert history and the days of a radio evangelist-health food
huckster and his "Boulevard of Dreams."</LD>
<LD>   Zzyzx (pronounced Zy-Zix, to rhyme with Isaacs) Mineral Springs
and Health Resort was a town created out of nothing in 1944 by one of
the Mojave Desert's most fabled characters, Curtis Howe Springer.</LD>
<TE>   In a region devoted to health and fitness fads, Springer was an
early master, coupling religion with the marketing of "miraculous"
health food and water cures. His enduring inspiration, though, was to
name his headquarters Zzyzx, figuring that by having the last word in
the phone book, he'd have the last word in his business.</TE>
<TE>   The self-proclaimed "old-time medicine man" and self-ordained
preacher gained notoriety in the 1940s and '50s not only for Zzyzx,
but also for his special line of health foods. He claimed curative
powers could be derived from concoctions of carrots, celery, turnips,
parsley and brown sugar.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 years, believers, health seekers and the just
plain curious were drawn to Zzyzx by Springer's promises and the
products he pitched on half-hour radio broadcasts carried by 221
radio stations in the United States and 102 overseas.</TE>
<TE>   He hawked such curative wonders as Manna, a "Hollywood Pep
Cocktail"; Antediluvian, a peppermint-flavored desert herb tea; and a
$25 cure-it-yourself hemorrhoid kit, along with enthusiastic
testimonials from their users. Interspersed with all this was gospel
music and a homespun philosophy all his own.</TE>
<TE>   Springer claimed that his success began in 1924, after he sang a
solo for the Pittsburgh experimental radio station that evolved into
KDKA, the nation's first commercial radio station. Over the next two
decades he preached, sang and managed resorts in six states before
coming to California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, when he and his fiancee, Helen, arrived at Soda Springs,
along with his daughter, Marilou, they filed a mining claim on
federal land they described as a "mosquito swamp," a patch of 12,000
acres 8 miles long and 3 miles wide south of Baker.</TE>
<TE>   All that was left of an old 1860 Army post and a railroad station
were a few abandoned buildings, so on the promise of food and
showers, Springer recruited cheap labor from Los Angeles' skid row
and built a two-story, 60-room hotel he called the Castle on the
"Boulevard of Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   The bed-and-board labor arrangement, he said later, "proved to the
government that I am helping humanity; that is why my foundation is
tax-exempt."</TE>
<TE>   Over a very few years, he created food-processing and printing
plants, a recording studio, a dining hall, a chapel, a cross-shaped
swimming pool, his own private airstrip called Zyport, and a man-made
lake called Lake Tuendae, which he said was an Indian word that means
"where the waters come together."</TE>
<TE>   Then Springer opened the doors of Zzyzx, a Christian resort
espousing the curative powers of its mineral waters, the evils of
drink and the destructive nature of arguing. Smoking was acceptable:
"Smoke anyplace on our 12,000 acres," the rules read, "except our
dining room, bathhouse, sun deck or pools. It's not pleasant to step
on a hot cigarette 'butt' in one's bare feet."</TE>
<TE>   He advised users of Zy-Pac, the mineral salts he collected from
the lake bed, to rub them over their scalps, then bend over and hold
their breath as long as possible. The resulting flush on the cheeks
and scalp, he claimed, was proof of the salts' beneficial action.</TE>
<TE>   In return for an "appropriate" donation to the Springer
Foundation, guests could partake of Springer's spiritual and physical
regimen. Permanent residents, mostly elderly and disabled, listened
to Springer's booming voice through two sermons daily, soaked in
mineral water and mud, basked in the sun and followed an eclectic
diet that included rabbit meat, fruit and homemade ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   And all this he advertised in newspapers, magazines and brochures
distributed across America. He spent three days a week in Los Angeles
to promote his regimen.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed in a suite at the Alexandria Hotel, where he ordered
ingredients for his food products, mailed out his weekly radio tapes
to myriad stations, and returned listeners' phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   He offered free bus rides every Wednesday morning from the
Figueroa Hotel at Olympic Boulevard to his desert resort.</TE>
<TE>   Many curiosity seekers, elderly and homeless people rode out just
for a free meal.</TE>
<TE>   Those who dialed Springer's Los Angeles number heard a cheerful
recorded greeting: "Hello, this is your old friend Curtis Springer
coming to you from Zzyzx Mineral Springs out in the heart of the
great Mojave Desert."</TE>
<TE>   Zzyzx was a thriving commercial enterprise by the 1950s, but by
the late 1960s, state and federal authorities had begun to complain
when Springer started marking lots and letting people who donated
large sums build houses on them.</TE>
<TE>   It was still public land, and Springer had merely staked a mining
claim; he didn't own it.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, in 1969 Springer was called the "King of Quacks"
by the American Medical Assn., which led to his arrest for making
fraudulent claims for his products. He was convicted of falsely
advertising such products as Mo-Hair, which he claimed was a cure for
baldness.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime colorful criminal attorney Gladys Towles Root, who wowed
juries with get-ups and hats like Cruella De Vil's, represented
Springer.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Murray Zimmerman of Whittier, who testified as an expert
witness, said recently: "After I testified against Springer on his
baldness cure, he reached into his pocket and paid his $2,500 fine
like it was a $2 traffic ticket. He was on the radio again that night
conning and charming his listeners."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, after several appeals, Springer served 49 days of
a 60-day jail sentence. In 1974, after a years-long legal battle with
the U.S. government over his mining claim, Springer was found guilty
of squatting on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   Although he offered to pay the Bureau of Land Management $34,187
in back rent, the government refused and evicted him and his
followers, of whom a few hundred remained.</TE>
<TE>   Springer and his wife then moved to Las Vegas, where he died in
1986 at age 90.</TE>
<TE>   Like Walter "Death Valley Scotty" Scott, who helped make Scotty's
Castle in nearby Death Valley famous, Springer's Zzyzx Mineral
Springs is a testament to the man who helped bring fame to his
scorched corner of the Mojave National Preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Springer's end-of-the-road recreational resort is now an
educational retreat, home to the California Desert Studies Center, a
California State University field station in the heart of the nature
preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists from all over the world conduct desert research there,
and students and educators use the resort's chapel as a classroom and
Springer's private office as a library. Lake Tuendae is home to a
tiny endangered fish called the Mojave tui chub.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As dozens of people waiting at an Irvine train platform watched in
horror, a 23-year-old man jumped in front of an approaching passenger
train Saturday morning and was killed.</LD>
<LD>   The man had been waiting with about 30 people at the Irvine
Transportation Center when he suddenly stood and jumped in front of
the San Diego-bound Amtrak Surfliner, said Irvine Police Sgt. Denny
Jenner.</LD>
<LD>   The train was slowing, traveling about 35 mph, but was unable to
stop.</LD>
<TE>   It took more than an hour to recover the man's body, and he was
pronounced dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   None of the 130 passengers aboard the train was injured, although
they were forced to wait on the train for three hours while the track
was cleared and the investigation was wrapped up.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they confirmed that the man had jumped, not fallen,
after viewing a video of the event.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was recorded by a woman who was taping her children
playing on the platform moments before the man jumped.</TE>
<TE>   Police provided crisis counseling to some passengers. The incident
did not delay other train traffic.</TE>

<HD>Coad Threat to Base's Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad to drop her ill-advised bid
to generate funds for parks in north Orange County by holding hostage
Irvine's plan to annex the former El Toro Marine base. Coad wrongly
has tied her support for the annexation to a demand that the city
turn over up to $800,000 a year for 100 years to help fund park
improvements in the north.</LD>
<LD>   Coad is threatening to rescind her April vote supporting
annexation if Irvine doesn't deliver a funding proposal by June 25.
Coad's demand jeopardizes the already complex process of turning El
Toro from an abandoned military base into a community asset.</LD>
<LD>   Coad's desire to improve the quality and quantity of parks in
north Orange County is laudable. The supervisor understandably wants
to pull something from the wreckage of the El Toro debate, and what
better way to solidify her legacy than by providing a free source of
funding for badly needed parks and open space? Hanging the
park-improvement tab on Irvine, though, is troublesome on several
levels. It's also symptomatic of withdrawal pains evident in some
quarters as a county gradually lays down its arms after the lengthy
pitched battle over the base's future.</LD>
<TE>   Coad argues that the swap--her vote in exchange for an outside
source of park funding--is justified because south Orange County
residents stand to benefit more from the promised Great Park than
residents who live in the north. Voters, though, have had their
say--several times--on El Toro, and after eight years of arguing and
$54 million spent on El Toro-related planning, it's important that
the debate doesn't again stray into the quicksand of regional
politics.</TE>
<TE>   There are sound reasons why Irvine, whose city limits eventually
will surround the base, should annex El Toro and supervise the
redevelopment. Should Coad stick to her threat to rescind her swing
vote, the base would remain under county control. Supervisors
approved Irvine's annexation plans by a 3-2 vote in April. If Irvine
can't annex the land, the county would be charged with developing the
former base under the guidelines of the voter-passed Measure W, as
well as be on the hook for attendant expenses, including potentially
significant environmental cleanup costs.</TE>
<TE>   If Coad won't back down, supervisors Chuck Smith and Jim Silva
should reverse their votes--or start explaining where the county will
get the funds to develop the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front, it's questionable whether Coad's funding
scheme would survive past January, when the veteran supervisor will
turn over her seat to newcomer Chris Norby. And, even if the
park-funding deal were to be struck, it's hard to imagine a future,
cash-strapped board not being tempted to use the park fund for more
immediate needs.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine also needs to step back and review its role in the
parks-funding gambit. Now that a commercial airport has been
rejected, the city should be in the lead when it comes to El Toro's
future. Its proximity to the base and expertise at land-use planning
in the environs give it sound credentials as redevelopment authority
under federal base reuse guidelines. But the city in April hurriedly
agreed to Coad's park-funding demand, apparently in an effort to
provide a united front during negotiations with the U.S. Navy. Irvine
has said it would use property taxes to generate the payments, but
the Navy is exempt from property taxes, and it could take years
before development reaches the level needed to spin off enough
property taxes for Irvine to shift into Coad's parks fund.</TE>

<HD>Disneyland Signals Shift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disneyland has a less than stellar record of providing information to
the public on accidents at "The Happiest Place on Earth." In recent
years, there have been several high-profile cases involving the
sailing ship Columbia, the Indiana Jones Adventure and the Roger
Rabbit Car Toon Spin, all of which raised questions about the theme
park's disclosure of data.</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Co.'s recent pledge to let the public in on its
safety plans for theme parks should be welcomed as an important step.
Its new "Report on Safety" is a slick publication, but it contains
welcome evidence of the company's recognition of the paramount
importance of safety at theme parks. But if past is prologue it also
must be greeted with a healthy "wait-and-see" attitude. Disney's
willingness to be more forthcoming than in the past is certainly a
plus, but it is also true that there has been plenty of room for
improvement over the record of recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The company now has a comprehensive safety plan and a chief safety
officer. The report also includes a commitment to comply with state
inspection and accident reporting guidelines. More information is
available on safety operations and guidelines. These all can be good
things if indeed there is a lasting cultural shift in the Disneyland
operation to openness about safety records and procedures.</LD>
<TE>   Accidents at Disneyland in recent years have produced anything but
full disclosure. Last year, a judge accused Disneyland of bad faith
in its stonewalling on the release of brain injury records involving
an accident on the Indiana Jones Adventure ride. There was a cleanup
of a fatal accident scene at the Columbia ride in December 1998 and
removal of evidence before police got to the site. In an accident
that severely injured a 4-year-old on Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin,
the company at first implied rider error. State officials stepped in
and provided needed oversight of remedial work at the ride before it
could reopen.</TE>
<TE>   Generally the attitude at Disneyland has been to disclose as
little as possible and only under duress.</TE>
<TE>   But the Walt Disney Co. is nothing if not conscious of its public
image, and after years of dramatic news the public is also much
better informed. A host of accidents at theme parks around the
country awakened consumer consciousness about safety. Some good
things in the new report include new warning signs for passengers and
improved child restraints, automated safety gates and new training
for company employees.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer and congressional watchdogs have been applying steady
pressure, even as the industry has tried to deal with accidents that
have been well publicized. A shift in corporate culture to more
openness may be possible now precisely because the public is looking
at ride safety differently.</TE>
<TE>   The test will be whether good corporate intentions make a
difference in cooperation with regulators and the release of
important safety information when accidents do happen.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you wanted to send a video postcard that illustrates the wave of
change that continues to reshape Orange County, set up the cameras
along Main Street and Newport Avenue in Tustin. The streets provide
an insight into where Southern California has been and where it is
going.</LD>
<LD>   The video could open with scratchy black-and-white celluloid
memories of half a century ago, when omnipresent orange trees far
outnumbered people in Tustin, and the sleepy agricultural town
revolved around Main Street's tiny business district. Tustin was home
to just 1,143 people in 1950. Fewer than a third lived in what
census-takers defined as a city setting; the rest lived a rural life.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin's population has swelled to 67,504, according to the 2000
census, and remaining orange groves are giving way to developers'
bulldozers. Main Street, which needs a face-lift, has ceded its
center-of-town role to Newport Avenue, a busy artery lined with
automobile-friendly strip malls where residents spend their time and
money.</LD>
<TE>   Growth isn't the only story line, though, as evident in recent
census data. Diversity also is playing a central role in the city's
continuing evolution. Tustin's population has soared in recent years,
but the number of white residents has slipped, dropping them to
minority status. In contrast, the Latino population more than doubled
during the last decade, and Tustin now is home to 10,194 Asians.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin's growth also underscores troubling gaps in education and
income. The number of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher
increased, but so did the number of those who've never finished high
school. Both the number of families earning more than $150,000 and
the number of households in poverty have increased dramatically in
the last decade. That divide also is evident in where people live;
the city's old downtown is home largely to immigrants and the poor,
while areas closer to the coast and the foothills are reserved for
the well-to-do.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin's story should interest residents in neighboring cities
because the intricate web being created by rapidly changing
demographics underscores changes felt across the county. Tustin's
ability to embrace change and turn its increasing diversity into a
strength could signal how the rest of the county fares. Community
leaders and residents all have a stake in working together to make
their community a thriving melting pot in the 21st century.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Conundrum: People vs. Farmland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Irvine Debates Growth Plan," June 5:</LD>
<LD>   Let me get this straight: The city of Irvine is planning to
destroy thousands of acres of prime agricultural land to make way for
more development. Traffic and community character are important
issues, but not more important than the loss of precious farmland.</LD>
<LD>   It is true that Orange County is experiencing a housing crisis,
especially when it comes to affordable housing. It seems to me that
the county does not need any more extravagant $500,000 tract homes
only the wealthy can afford. I question what the social implications
are of continuing to plan in ways that are not only socially unjust
but that also devour our prime food-producing lands.</LD>
<TE>   There are better ways to plan our communities that include
retaining scale and character. Planning can let people live close to
where they work to reduce the need for vehicle trips and improve air
quality. Planning can protect and preserve precious agricultural and
wildlife lands. Planning can provide affordable housing and access to
the amenities that families need.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, politics often blinds public officials and holds
back good planning practices.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Leishman</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A pet owner recently reported that his California king snake tried
to swallow its own tail; it was not pretty to watch. Nor will it be
pretty to watch farmland being swallowed by the Irvine Co., with the
approval of the Irvine City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The additional vehicles, the resulting pollution and general
infrastructure burdens are dismissed simply by referring to what is
known as "the Plan." But plans change, as did the plan to build a
school for students whose families were lured to new housing recently
developed by the Irvine Co. Some might call that bait and switch, but
the fact is we don't have the money to build the infrastructure. In
the case of the promised school, it is clear that the burden will
fall on the existing infrastructure, which will in turn result in a
lowering of the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "The Plan" is not scripture to be blindly followed. Growth is not
a necessity; we have seen it, and we know its limits. Instead of
numerical growth we ought to be working on stability, the maintenance
and improvement of the present infrastructure. "The Plan," after all,
was a vision of some people in the context of their time. Times
change. It appears that the time has come to leave the sacred plan on
the shelf and to work on the quality-of-life issues now before us.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Irvine 'Sub-City' Plan Attacked," June 10:</TE>
<TE>   Anyone reading your article on Irvine's decision to annex land in
its Northern Sphere would have absolutely no idea that over the last
two years, more than 350 Irvine residents participated in 55 public
workshops, town halls and other meetings organized by Irvine to help
shape the plan.</TE>
<TE>   This input from citizens resulted in more than 50 changes to the
plan. Though the annexation would add significant land to Irvine's
existing city limits, the project will not result in a net increase
to the city's previously planned targets for housing units or
population.</TE>
<TE>   The annexation was initiated by Irvine so it could control land
use in its Northern Sphere. The project allows Irvine to address the
critical shortage of housing and restore the city's balance between
jobs and housing. Affordable housing advocates and representatives
from the business community spoke in support of the plan at the City
Council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A comprehensive, scientific traffic analysis by outside experts
found that the project would add only between 2% and 4% to the
traffic on that portion of Interstate 5 over the next 20 years.
Additionally, the Irvine Co. has agreed to provide its fair share of
funding for infrastructure improvements to ensure that any traffic
impacts are mitigated to the city's performance standards.</TE>
<TE>   The project will have more of its land dedicated to permanent open
space than any other village in Irvine, a city that has more open
space than any other city in Orange County--another important fact
left out of the article.</TE>

<TE>   Senior vice president</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here's the real picture of what is motivating Irvine regarding
development of its Northern Sphere--an estimated annual sales-tax
revenue of $5.7 million. Here's the other picture: an estimated
influx of 35,000 residents and 250,000 daily automobile trips. This
picture may be a little brighter since the City Council said it is
willing to work with Caltrans to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Zane W. de Arakal</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The question is not simply whether the number of homes can be fit
into the area with a density no higher than other areas of the city,
but also whether existing roads are able to handle added traffic
without creating congestion in existing communities.</TE>
<TE>   The Northern Sphere is bounded by hills on the north and by
Interstate 5 and the former El Toro base on the other sides. There is
only one major exit road, Irvine Boulevard. No new major roads are
planned to the south or west, and the only new road heading
north--Jeffrey Road--was already on the drawing board with the land
retained as agriculture. The development instead relies heavily on
uncommitted "improvements" to Interstate 5 east and west of Jamboree
and the State Route 133, R-133 Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Is it realistic to anticipate more lanes being added to the
interstate? Increased congestion on the interstate would translate
directly into increased traffic on Irvine Boulevard, the only
realistic alternate route.</TE>
<TE>   The city has given the green light to the development without
simultaneously resolving the anticipated traffic congestion problems.
It is simply assumed that it will be worked out. It is based on a
conclusion that the benefit to the city as a whole outweighs the
disadvantage--negative impacts on the north Irvine community.</TE>
<TE>   David Melvold</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is a "balanced community," like "jumbo shrimp" and "airline food,"
an oxymoron? Is it possible to preserve a community's quality of life
and still provide sorely needed housing in Orange County? Can a city
be an economically vibrant employment center without having a
high-rise on every corner?</TE>
<TE>   Because history is one of the best predictors of the future, a
closer look at a city's past community planning process seems like a
good place to start. In most independent assessments of quality of
life, Irvine, where I have lived since 1990, gets very high marks for
its parks, safe neighborhoods, diverse population, community services
and job generation.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are very satisfied living here. As chair of Irvine's
community services commission and the owner of an Irvine business, my
neighbors and customers share stories about how much their families
value our high quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   A hallmark of Irvine's reputation is extensive community input
that goes into city planning. Contrary to your article, residents are
strongly encouraged to actively participate in the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   The Northern Sphere project has been in the works since the
mid-1980s. It is the most analyzed and planned project in the city's
history. The city hosted many forums to gather community input and
constructive recommendations; one of the results is that the
development will include 170 acres of parkland and open space.</TE>
<TE>   So what is the result of all this community input? A village that
will have more land dedicated as permanent open space (60%) than to
development, a network of neighborhood parks, plus a huge Gateway
Park providing needed sports fields. There will be a variety of
housing close to jobs, including much-needed affordable housing that
is in such short supply in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive public input helped shape this plan. As residents
throughout the county look for ways to balance the seemingly
paradoxical goals of housing, open space and jobs, Irvine is a model
for providing the best solution. And we just did again.</TE>

<LD>Re "Wilderness as Legacy," Editorial, May 25:</LD>
<LD>   I take exception to The Times' editorial in support of Sen.
Barbara Boxer's proposed California Wild Heritage Wilderness Act of
2002. The editorial belies the facts of California's wilderness space
and the needs of the state's people.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal resource statistics suggest that California is
composed of roughly 100 million acres. Just 5%, or 5 million acres,
is dedicated to commercial, industrial and residential development.
This minuscule percentage is supposed to provide for the needs of
about 35 million people.</LD>
<TE>   If Boxer wants to limit public access to more wilderness areas,
she should offer companion legislation to designate additional land
for the use by our state's people. That would help provide needed
housing opportunities for families who are now doubling and tripling
up to buy homes. Maybe then we all wouldn't be so crammed into
artificial "growth boundaries" created to protect the wilderness she
is trying to save.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Ex-O.C. Priest Is Removed," May 28:</LD>
<LD>   It was with great interest and surprise that I read your article
on the resignation of Father Gus Krumm from active parochial ministry
at Ascension parish in Portland, Ore. Unfortunately, several relevant
facts were not stated.</LD>
<LD>   First, the article said "officials from the Franciscan order did
not return phone calls." This may have been factually true, but when
one calls an office on Memorial Day, is it realistic to expect an
answer? Later on Memorial Day, The Times did call my residence, but
the reporter left neither his name nor a return phone number. A pity,
really, as I would have loved to help him with this story.</LD>
<TE>   As to the situation around Father Krumm, there was an allegation
about him from the early 1990s in connection with his tenure at St.
Anthony's Junior Seminary in Santa Barbara. This incident was fully
investigated twice and found to be unsubstantiated. Subsequently,
Father Krumm served at Saints Simon and Jude Parish in Huntington
Beach and then at Ascension Parish in Portland. There have been no
complaints, allegations or reports of sexual misconduct about Father
Krumm at either of these parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, the Franciscan Province of Santa Barbara has
used a rather extensive system that allows anyone to use a toll-free
number to report incidents to an Independent Response Team. The team
is composed of professional therapists and provides therapy and care
to victims and a rigorous system of treatment with internal and
external monitors to accused perpetrators. This system also complies
with laws mandating the reporting of cases to the police.</TE>
<TE>   To date, no calls have been received regarding Father Krumm. Last
Tuesday, however, he reported incidents unrelated to this earlier
accusation. Based upon this new information, the provincial relieved
Father Krumm of active ministry and is having him undergo treatment
under the IRT. The province has acted in the past and in the present
based upon available information to protect the people of God and our
brother.</TE>
<TE>   As a Franciscan, I am saddened by past incidents of sexual abuse
because of the damage done to the innocent. We are called to live as
witnesses of Jesus Christ's peace and reconciliation in a world full
of senseless violence. Nonetheless, I am very proud of how the
Franciscan Province of Santa Barbara has dedicated substantial
resources to assisting the healing of victims as well as treatment
and monitoring to those accused. The IRT Web site is
www.responseteam.org.</TE>

<LD>Re "CenterLine Would Be a Track Star, Study Says," May 31:</LD>
<LD>   Many of us would have loved to see a CenterLine extending beyond
Fullerton to connect us directly to our regional airports. Political
reality, however, has forced us to accept a compromised rail project
that will not be as successful as one offering more coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The sad thing is that opponents will likely end up using this
argument against extending the project because the cost-benefit ratio
will likely be less obvious. They won't, however, acknowledge that
the limited success is mostly due to the roadblocks they have
erected. We deserve a comprehensive answer to our transportation
needs, and we want it now.</LD>

kidney dialysis three times a week is not hatching a scheme. She is
concerned with her health and seeing her loved ones again.</LD>
<LD>   Prisoners who are so old and physically ill that they are
burdening the penal system should be put on house arrest with a
child, relative or friend to aid them.</LD>
<TE>   There is no good reason to keep these men and women in prison. It

<LD>Re "Laguna Beach Unified Pushes PE Into New Age of Lifelong Fitness,"
June 8:</LD>
<LD>   Your article was misleading, but it points out that the district,
however well-intentioned, failed to do its homework or to set clearly
defined goals and objectives before launching this program.</LD>
<LD>   The sedentary "kickball-type" program is long gone at El Morro
Elementary School, where I've been a physical education specialist
since 1990.</LD>
<TE>   It was replaced more than a decade ago by a rigorous,
health-related physical fitness curriculum. Students participate
regularly in aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises that promote
lifelong fitness concepts.</TE>
<TE>   State-mandated fitness test scores for our fifth-graders are among
the highest in California. The district should take pride in this
success because it reflects a continued financial commitment toward
physical education at the elementary level.</TE>
<TE>   School site support for equipment purchases has also played a
critical role at El Morro. I have attended several of the
district-sponsored yoga classes and found them to be relaxing and
informative. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that children
need to "breathe deeply" or "train their nervous system" or that this
type of workout promotes lifelong fitness where others do not.
Indeed, most of the exercises are too complex for children to perform
effectively, and some are simply inappropriate for school-age
children.</TE>
<TE>   Our students' lowest fitness test scores for 2001 were in the
category that measures healthy body weight. Our results reflect the
nationwide trend toward childhood obesity.</TE>
<TE>   This data should be considered before making changes or
improvements to PE curriculum. If the district is serious about
improving the fitness of its students, it should reduce the amount of
high-fat and empty-calorie food items sold on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Continued support of health-related physical education and a focus
on a more nutritious food service menu should be the district's
priorities.</TE>

<LD>Re "Did Young Richard Nixon Romp Here?," June 3:</LD>
<LD>   Your article misleads readers about the Yorba Linda Historical
Conservancy's quest to preserve the 90-year-old Park Place house in
the city where the distinguished American writer Jessamyn West
allegedly lived for a while with her family. Your article rightly
asserts that the allegation's strongest evidence of her residency is
a 1979 Yorba Linda Star letter to the editor from West responding to
an earlier Star story accompanied by a photo of the house in
question.</LD>
<LD>   However, your article recklessly paraphrases her letter as having
stated that "she believed it was the house where she lived during her
college years."</LD>
<TE>   It would have been far more truthful and just to have instead
quoted West's precise language: "Thank you for sending the 'Star'
with the picture of the house in which I lived through college days
and from which I was married."</TE>

behind gates. People should be able to be left alone in their homes.</LD>

<LD>Re "Atonement for the Violence," opinion, June 9:</LD>
<LD>   I applaud Bishop Tod Brown's zero-tolerance policy for clergy and
lay diocesan employees who abuse children, and hope that all U.S.
bishops will follow his lead at their meeting in Dallas. As a Jewish
member of the Catholic-Jewish dialogue sponsored by the Diocese of
Orange and the American Jewish Committee, I have met a number of
outstanding priests and lay Catholics and have been inspired by their
integrity and their commitment to interfaith understanding.</LD>

<LD>Re "Dot-Coms' Bust Is a Boon to Classrooms," June 3:</LD>
<LD>   We are facing a teacher shortage, so what does the state do? It
looks for laid-off people in the technology world. I guess there is
still the myth that anyone can teach. This is not their career
choice; it's just a path of convenience. I guess if we had a shortage
of doctors, we would look at the unemployment lines to find some
replacements. If we can put unlicensed people in the classroom, why
not the doctor's office?</LD>
<LD>   Oh, but this is different. It is just kids. Well, not my child.
She will not have a non-credentialed teacher in her classroom.
Teaching is a passion, a chosen field, not a "Well, why not?" career.
What a disservice, again, to the career of teaching and to the
children who will have these untrained, laid-off people in their
classrooms.</LD>

<LD>Re "Ruling on Magnet School Gets F From Parents," June 4:</LD>
<LD>   Your article describing the Orange County Board of Education's
denial of a petition to allow about 22 students to transfer to Troy
High School revolved around several families who wanted children who
live in one school district to be allowed to transfer to another. The
state education code allows families and children to petition county
boards of education when their requests are denied.</LD>
<LD>   The board was split, 2 to 2, on this decision (one trustee was
absent), with Felix Rocha and myself voting in favor of allowing the
petitioners and families to transfer from Placentia-Yorba Linda
Unified School District to the Fullerton School District. State code
requires a majority vote to overturn Placentia-Yorba Linda's earlier
denial.</LD>
<TE>   My vote was based on the inalienable right of parents to direct
the upbringing of their children. It is my philosophy that parents
have the vested and far greater interest in their children's
well-being than any government institution.</TE>

<LD>Re "Clean Needles' Big Payoff," Editorial, May 29:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial on the passage of SB 1785 by the state Senate was
right on. I was disappointed but not surprised to see that state
senators from Orange County voted against it. People confuse making
syringes available with encouraging injection of illicit drugs. As a
retired nurse who worked in infection control for years, I have seen
the ravages of HIV and hepatitis B and C. Making needles available is
good public health policy. I would like to see the local health
departments educate our elected officials regarding the lives that
could be saved by this bill and the introduction of needle exchange
programs.</LD>
<LD>   I hope your readers will let their Assembly representatives know
that they want them to support SB 1785.</LD>
<TE>   They also should encourage Gov. Gray Davis to sign this bill.</TE>

<HD>Book Lover Wills Fortune to Library</HD>
<DH>Reading: Joyce Lyon, 92, who lived modestly in an
apartment, leaves funds from a $1-million estate to Ventura facility
in her late husband's name.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She died in her husband's favorite chair with a stack of books at her
side, which was no surprise to those who knew 92-year-old Joyce Lyon.
Reading was her passion.</LD>
<LD>   So it was also no surprise when friends learned that Lyon, a
childless widow who lived in a two-bedroom apartment near the ocean,
had earmarked money in her will for the downtown Ventura library
where she and her late husband, George, used to check out books.</LD>
<LD>   It was the amount of her gift--$1.2 million--that came as the
shocker.</LD>
<TE>   Lyon left most of her estate to the county library system with
instructions that interest on the money be used to buy books for E.P.
Foster Library. And in a plot twist that could have been lifted from
a romance novel, she specified that the endowment be known as the
George D. Lyon Book Fund, in honor of her late husband.</TE>
<TE>   "She really wanted to do something in memory of George," said
attorney Bruce Johnston, who met the couple a decade ago through a
group of library supporters and served as executor of Lyon's will.</TE>
<TE>   "The libraries have been cut so much," Johnston said. "The book
budget really suffered. This was just a natural for her."</TE>
<TE>   Although a final accounting is ongoing, the estate is expected to
generate about $60,000 annually for the historic Main Street library,
tripling its existing books and materials budget. It is by far the
largest donation by an individual to the county library system, said
Ventura County Library Director Starrett Kreissman.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very significant," said Kreissman, who never met Lyon. "I
was amazed. It is a lovely, lovely remembrance, and a wonderful thing
for her to do. It makes you wish you had known her."</TE>
<TE>   Those who did know Lyon, who died of heart failure in November,
described her as a discreet woman, a fashionable British expatriate
who spoke several languages and lived modestly in an apartment along
the Ventura Promenade.</TE>
<TE>   Lyon was civic-minded and practical, friends said. She instructed
in her will that her furniture, appliances and clothes go to the
Salvation Army. She left $50,000 to public TV station KCET and
$20,000 and a collection of jewelry to her husband's daughter from a
previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said she enjoyed reading, playing bridge and watching her
investments grow. Probate records show that Lyon's money was held in
various stocks, bonds, mutual funds and money-market accounts.
Friends suspect that her fortune came from her husband, a prior
marriage and possibly a family inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   "She enjoyed playing the stock market quite a bit," said Walter
Voris, an 83-year-old Ventura resident who with his wife, Frances,
met the Lyons at a senior center Spanish class about 15 years ago.
The couples met for lunch once a week, a routine Lyon continued after
her husband died in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she came over from England before the war," Voris said.
"She never talked about it much."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon told one friend she moved from England to New York City with
an aunt who tailored clothes for fashionable women. She later moved
to California and was married to a Los Angeles lawyer. After he died,
she married George Lyon, who owned a restaurant supply business. They
moved to Ventura in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Their apartment overlooks the ocean, and Joyce Lyon once told a
friend that it reminded her of a family home in England where as a
child she would look out at the sea. After her husband's death, Lyon
had his ashes scattered off the California coast and instructed that
her ashes be scattered at sea as well.</TE>
<TE>   "She would sit in that window seat and watch the ships come and
go," said 82-year-old Arlene Kirman, a friend and neighbor. "She
missed him greatly."</TE>
<TE>   When George Lyon died, Kirman said, his wife discovered a series
of envelopes he had left her in a bank deposit box. Some of the
envelopes contained poems and cards. One envelope held money and a
note describing a gold necklace he wanted her to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Other notes suggested books she should read.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a very devoted couple," Kirman said, describing the
endowment as a fitting tribute to both their lives. "Joyce was
extremely fond of books and reading, both she and George. She was
reading clear to the end."</TE>

<HD>Marty Lipstein, 82; Ran 119 Marathons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marty Lipstein, a longtime resident of Santa Monica who said he ran
119 marathons after taking up the sport in his late 40s, has died. He
was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Lipstein, called "Marathon Marty" by his friends and admirers,
died June 9 of heart failure at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the Bronx, N.Y., Lipstein served in the Army Air Corps
during World War II.</LD>
<TE>   After the war he graduated from USC with a degree in physical
education, but didn't take to the life of a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a barber instead.</TE>
<TE>   A devoted swimmer before he took up running, Lipstein ventured
into the cold waters off the Venice Beach pier each Jan. 1 for 35
years as a member of the Penguin Club.</TE>
<TE>   He was a man of modest tastes who tried to heed Henry David
Thoreau's admonition: Simplify, simplify. To that end he lived in a
van near the beach for 14 years and didn't own a telephone until he
had some health problems in 2000 and friends begged him to get one.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you know, the less you need," he often said.</TE>
<TE>   His running career ended after he collapsed in April 2000 and had
a pacemaker installed to control his heartbeat. His final marathon
was the Los Angeles event in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica-based environmental group Alliance for Survival
will sponsor a summer solstice memorial tribute for Lipstein at noon
Friday at Palisades Park's "Tree of Life," at Ocean and Colorado
avenues in Santa Monica.</TE>

<LD>Farm worker Arturo Magana, who picks lemons, oranges and avocados in

<LD>   But last year, the 46-year-old Magana's employer sent him to
Hawaii to pick coffee beans. There, he tested positive for
tuberculosis, and he now takes medication to manage the condition.</LD>
<LD>   Magana is one of the lucky ones with an employer who provides
medical coverage. Most of the 1 million agricultural workers in
California have no health insurance and cannot afford a doctor,
leaving them oblivious to pressing health issues or to suffer in
silence.</LD>
<TE>   Uninsured and underserved by the medical industry, migrant workers
can be unwitting carriers of communicable diseases, such as
gonorrhea, chlamydia and all three types of hepatitis. Often
unaccompanied by early symptoms, infectious diseases can be spread
unknowingly through sexual contact, drug use and other high-risk
behaviors, health officials said.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce that possibility in Ventura County, a private agency and
four rural health clinics run by Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and
Ventura County Medical Center won a two-year, $500,000 grant from a
health-care foundation and $30,000 more in tobacco settlement money
to steer agricultural workers and their families to inexpensive
health care.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Medical Resource Foundation and the rural
health centers will hold free screenings this week at a migrant camp
in Fillmore and another in Piru, specifically to detect and treat
infectious diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Known as La Familia Sana, or the Healthy Family, the program aims
to reach male agricultural workers in rural Ventura County and help
them find services that can provide long-term health care, said Kathy
Kramer, grant project manager for the Ventura County Medical Resource
Foundation, which helps find money for medical programs for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   La Familia Sana will use the tobacco money to conduct the
screenings and the grant from California Endowments to pay for
follow-up visits by outreach workers.</TE>
<TE>   Specially trained social workers, or los promotores, will talk
with the estimated 110 residents of each camp about their health
concerns and tell them about services such as Healthy Family or rural
health clinics in Fillmore, Santa Paula and Piru, Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   The outreach specialists will visit churches, schools, Laundromats
and other locations to speak with families of agricultural workers,
Kramer said. They will carry the message that preventive health care
and regular checkups are important--and are, in fact, available at
little or no cost. The goal is to talk to 15,000 people in each of
the program's two years and convince at least 7,000 of them to take
the next step and seek health care.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say programs such as La Familia Sana are crucial to
dealing with the spread of infectious diseases. In Ventura County,
the most troubling communicable diseases are chlamydia and hepatitis
C and B. The number of cases of chlamydia, a sexually transmitted
disease, rose to 1,206 in 2000, up from 983 in 1999, according to the
Ventura County Public Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   La Familia Sana will focus on men because they are the least
likely to seek medical attention for a variety of reasons, including
long hours toiling in the fields and a fear of deportation if they
illegally entered the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of health care among California's agricultural workers
was found to be so acute in a 1999 survey commissioned by California
Endowment that the agency set aside $50 million over five years to
address the issue. La Familia Sana is a beneficiary of that
endowment.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw severe deterioration of these men in the prime of their
lives, from 22 to 40 years old," said Mario Gutierrez, who manages
the agricultural worker grant program for Cal Endowment. "The
conditions under which they work are extremely hard. Being away from
their families and being isolated from home and their communities, it
leads to all kinds of problems--alcohol abuse, drug abuse, infectious
disease, tuberculosis, hypertension and obesity."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Noriega, 23, said that some of the men at the Fillmore
housing camp believe that drinking a beer on an empty stomach helps
keeps them healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time that I haven't seen a doctor," Noriega
said. "I don't even know how long. We live in the fields. If we're
getting a cold, we just pick up an orange and bite into it. And
lemons, too. You can take care of yourself with orange juice. And you
drink a lot of water.</TE>
<TE>   "And beer helps, too," he said, only half-jokingly.</TE>
<TE>   Noriega used to get a checkup every six months through his former
employer in Mexico. He made sure to get one before leaving 3 1/2
months ago. He does not get sick, he said, but likes knowing he is
healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to get a checkup often," he said. "That way you know what
you have. It would be good to have medical services. Yes, that would
be good."</TE>

<HD>R.W.B. Lewis, 84; Literary Critic Won Pulitzer for
Biography</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>R.W.B. Lewis, 84, a literary critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning
biographer of Edith Wharton, died Thursday of natural causes at his
home in Bethany, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Warrington Baldwin Lewis was educated at Harvard and the
University of Chicago and served in Army intelligence during World
War II, earning the rank of major. He taught at Bennington and Smith
Colleges and Rutgers University before moving to Yale, where he was a
campus fixture from 1959 to 1988.</LD>
<LD>   But he established his larger reputation as a writer. His doctoral
dissertation turned into his scholarly first book, "The American
Adam: Innocence, Tragedy and Tradition in the 19th Century,"
published in 1955 and considered a landmark in defining the emerging
field of American studies. Among his other books are "The Picaresque
Saint" in 1959, "Trials of the Word" in 1965, "The Poetry of Hart
Crane" in 1967, "American Characters" in 1999 and "Dante," published
last year.</LD>
<TE>   He achieved his greatest honors in biography, notably with the
1975 "Edith Wharton: A Biography" which received the Pulitzer, the
Bancroft Prize for American history and the first National Book
Critics Circle Award for nonfiction. His 1991 "The Jameses: A Family
Narrative" about Henry, William and Alice James, also was well
received. Lewis earned the gold medal for biography by the American
Academy of Arts and Letters two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Vote Will Give 74,000 Creditors a Say on PG&amp;E Payment Plans</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Federal jurist will use the 74,000 ballots to
help him decide whether to use the utility's restructuring plan for
$13.5 billion in claims or the one devised by state regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a vote that will help chart the future of California's largest
utility, 74,000 creditors of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. will be sent
ballots this week asking them whether they favor PG&amp;E's blueprint for
repaying $13.5 billion in claims or a competing plan from state
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The balloting, which ends Aug. 12, will be used by a federal
bankruptcy judge in San Francisco as he decides whether to adopt
PG&amp;E's plan to restructure itself, the California Public Utilities
Commission's plan or neither proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The voting comes more than a year after PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors and sets the stage for the final battles of
one of the nation's biggest and most bitterly contested bankruptcy
cases. The case's outcome could determine how quickly PG&amp;E can emerge
from bankruptcy and resume buying power for its millions of customers
in Northern and Central California.</LD>
<TE>   The PUC and PG&amp;E have attacked each other's plans in court and in
public. Not even a mediation effort ordered by the judge resolved
their disputes. Each side has threatened legal action if the other's
plan is adopted. And each has courted the official committee of PG&amp;E
creditors, hoping to win support for its plan.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the committee of representatives from various creditor
classes took a middle ground. It is recommending that creditors,
ranging from large financial institutions to PG&amp;E vendors, vote for
both plans because each promises to fully repay the utility's debts
with interest and enable PG&amp;E to emerge from bankruptcy with its
financial health.</TE>
<TE>   The committee concluded that both plans are better than other
alternatives, such as liquidating PG&amp;E's assets.</TE>
<TE>   But concerns prevented the panel from recommending that creditors
express a preference for either plan.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's plan calls for splitting the utility into four separate
entities and moving its hydroelectric and nuclear facilities to a new
subsidiary of its parent company, PG&amp;E Corp. The plan also requires
preemption of dozens of state laws and shifts parts of the company
outside the reach of the PUC, which branded the plan a regulatory
"jailbreak."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC plan would keep PG&amp;E under state regulatory control and
would use about $3.6 billion of PG&amp;E's cash on hand and some
financial restructuring to repay the claims in full.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC proposes to pay off creditors entirely in cash, while PG&amp;E
plans to satisfy 60% of the debt with cash and 40% with notes.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors committee said PG&amp;E's plan carries significant
regulatory hurdles and risks of litigation that could delay payment
to creditors. The Public Utility Commission's plan, they said, has
fewer legal barriers and is simpler but "faces uncertainties over its
financial feasibility."</TE>
<TE>   Without creditor acceptance, a plan is doomed. The creditors can
vote for either plan--or both. If they vote for both, they can
express a preference.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's attorney, Robert Moore of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp;
McCloy in Los Angeles, said voting for both plans is the safest
course. "All this is saying to a creditor is that you should leave
those options open because [both plans] are attempting to give you
the same result," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the next stage of the bankruptcy--a confirmation hearing in the
fall--Judge Dennis Montali will consider the voting results as he
decides whether to confirm PG&amp;E's plan, the PUC's plan or neither.
Among other things, he will assess whether PG&amp;E can legally preempt
state laws, whether the PUC's plan is financially viable and whether
either plan would require a rate increase.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, it is the judge who determines which plan
gets confirmed, not creditors," said Brian Hermann, outside
bankruptcy counsel for the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   A private contractor is sending out 600-page packets containing
ballots, the creditors committee recommendation and copies of both
plans.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E asked the judge for permission to hire another contractor to
solicit the support of creditors in person, by e-mail, letter and
other means--and to answer questions about the PG&amp;E plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to reach out to as many creditors as possible," said
company spokesman Ron Low. "We are confident that our plan will be
confirmed, [and] we believe that the commission's alternate plan
cannot be confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   Hermann, the PUC's lawyer, said the committee recommendation was a
good omen for the PUC's plan. "A tie goes to the PUC because we
started [developing a plan] seven months behind PG&amp;E," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of PG&amp;E's creditors is its longtime nemesis, the Utility
Reform Network. The PUC awarded tens of thousands of dollars in
intervenor compensation for legal work TURN has performed in
connection with PG&amp;E cases before the regulatory body.</TE>
<TE>   TURN has argued that neither plan is good for consumers. The PG&amp;E
plan allows the utility to move generation assets to a PG&amp;E Corp.
subsidiary and to sell the power into the California market under a
12-year contract at a price that TURN contends is much higher than
the current rate. The PUC plan allows the utility to help reduce its
debts by having con- sumers continue to pay what TURN says are
excessive electricity rates.</TE>
<TE>   So how will TURN vote?</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we will vote against PG&amp;E's plan, and the only question
is whether we will vote for the lesser of two evils--the PUC plan,"
said Mike Florio, senior attorney for TURN.</TE>

<HD>It's Birds vs. Bathers on Remote Beach</HD>
<DH>Lompoc: A favorite summer haunt will probably be closed
again to protect plovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SURF BEACH, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Lompoc residents have for decades driven eight miles due west of town
with their kids and kites and fishing poles to enjoy a windy and wild
stretch of kelp-covered sand, a world apart from the raked and sunny
beaches of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   But Surf Beach enjoys another distinction beyond being the only
nearby beach for the 43,000-plus residents of the northern Santa
Barbara County community. Surf Beach is also prime nesting ground for
a tiny endangered bird called the western snowy plover.</LD>
<LD>   So this wind-blown stretch of shore within the boundaries of
Vandenberg Air Force Base is experiencing a countdown to closure once
again, just like it did last summer. That's angering some residents,
who decry the federal government's purported preference for birds
over people.</LD>
<TE>   It's all to protect a six-inch-tall bird that hunkers down in
footprints to hide and likes to nest on open sand during the same
season humans prefer the beach, from late March until the end of
September.</TE>
<TE>   Surf Beach is unusual in that it can be closed to the public with
relative ease. Public access has been granted by the Air Force, which
controls Surf Beach, as well as the surrounding 99,000 acres and 35
miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service approached the base in 1999 about
closing down the beach to protect what biologists believe is prime
nesting ground for the plovers. The base instead negotiated a
compromise that limits public access.</TE>
<TE>   That was considered inadequate by wildlife officials, so a new
agreement was struck allowing one-half mile of the beach to be open
each year until the public was judged to have invaded the birds'
breeding ground, which remains off-limits to the public, too often.
Once officials count 25 incursions on the plover preserve for the
season, they close the beach. Last year, that meant Surf Beach was
off limits by mid-summer.</TE>
<TE>   Since April 1, there have already been 16 violations, although no
eggs or birds were harmed, base officials report. People on all sides
of the issue believe it is just a matter of time before the incursion
limit is reached and the beach is closed.</TE>
<TE>   What miffs many locals is that Lompoc residents committed only
three of the 16 violations. Many appear to have been caused by
outsiders, some of whom may not have been aware of the potential
penalty for walking on the wrong part of the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not fair that we might get our beach closed because of
people from somewhere else," said MaryAnna Navarro, who works as a
docent on weekends, explaining to people at the Surf Beach gate why
the plovers must be left alone.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the Air Force opens the beach only Friday through
Monday, and it is patrolled by Air Force security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the anger expressed at wildlife officials over the issue
at community meetings, biologists stressed that Vandenberg is crucial
to the recovery of the snowy plover.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henry, a senior biologist with the wildlife service, said
the plover nests on 12 miles of the 35 miles of the Vandenberg coast.</TE>
<TE>   At various times in the past, Vandenberg has accounted for 20% of
the statewide population of plovers. Last year, 135 plovers were
counted at Vandenberg out of an estimated 1,000 in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We've looked at what has and hasn't worked at Vandenberg for
years," said Henry. "In areas that are closed to recreation
activities, plovers do better in their breeding success."</TE>
<TE>   The federal wildlife service does not have the power to close
beaches, biologists stressed, but it does require agencies that
manage beaches to produce habitat protection plans when plover nests
are found. If there is an illegal "taking" of a bird or an egg, fines
up to $25,000 can be levied.</TE>
<TE>   Lompoc is the most contentious locale in a growing debate over
efforts to save snowy plovers along the coast. Dotting the Central
Coast are pockets of marked plover habitat, where humans are
prohibited from treading.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit was filed in early May in federal court in Eugene, Ore.,
against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying it failed to
consider the economic impact of protecting hundreds of miles of
coastline for snowy plover habitat in California, Oregon and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Lompoc has been picked on. Let them try to do that at
Huntington or Venice," said Jim Suty, president of Friends of Oceano
Dunes, an off-roading group which is a plaintiff in the lawsuit along
with Coos County, Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   At Oceano, Suty's organization is fighting efforts by
environmental groups to limit or end beach access for off-roaders to
help the snowy plover.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force, as a federal agency, has stricter rules than states
or counties for adhering to the Endangered Species Act, said
Vandenberg spokeswoman Staff Sgt. Rebecca Bonilla. The snowy plover
is listed as "threatened" under that act.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem isn't really the people of Lompoc, but it doesn't
matter. A violation is a violation no matter who causes it," Bonilla
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although somewhat ironic, two Santa Barbara-based volunteers for a
private group dedicated to saving sea otters accounted for two
violations of snowy plover habitat. The pair had come to Surf Beach
last month to count otters.</TE>
<TE>   Bonilla said the base is committed to aiding the bird's recovery,
but also committed to trying to let the community have some access.</TE>
<TE>   Many local leaders have been resigned to the loss of the use of
Surf Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "As an organization, we recognize the legalities," said Carly
Neubert, executive assistant for the Lompoc Valley Chamber of
Commerce. "Surf Beach is on Vandenberg. I guess we should say, 'Thank
you for letting us use it for so long.' "</TE>
<TE>   But for a mom like Elizabeth Dopp-Johnson, who had driven out to
the beach in the middle of the week with her two children only to
find it closed, the beach is a recreation safety valve that might be
lost.</TE>
<TE>   The family was dressed in swimsuits, but the gates were locked for
the standard midweek closure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all for nature. I recycle. I have a compost pile,"

<LD>The Mexican government is investigating allegations by undocumented
immigrants that their vehicle was fired upon by Mexican soldiers in
an incident that left eight wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The eight were among 23 Mexicans and El Salvadorans packed in a
GMC Suburban attempting to enter the U.S. by using a roadless area 25
miles west of this Imperial Valley border town, the U.S. Border
Patrol said.</LD>
<LD>   Someone opened fire on the vehicle with a high-powered rifle
shortly after midnight Thursday as it approached the U.S.-Mexico
border. Three of the eight remain hospitalized, all in stable
condition.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the immigrants alleged that the vehicle that opened fire
belonged to the Mexican army, which often trains in the area and
apprehends suspected immigrant smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   All 23 are being held by the Border Patrol for investigation.</TE>

penalize businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Ruben Barrales, the president's deputy assistant and director of
intergovernmental affairs, said businesses will expand, "and we need
to deal with air quality. But I don't have the solution."</LD>

<LD>A Muslim village near this Sierra Nevada foothill community has been
disbanded, with residents leaving behind homes, a troubled charter
school and a reported total of about $470,000 in back taxes and
penalties. The village drew attention from local authorities after
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Displayed at the deserted village of Baladullah, which means "City
of God" in Arabic, on Thursday was a handwritten yard sale sign that
read: "Everything must go."</LD>
<LD>   The yard sale was near Gateway Academy, a school closed earlier
this year after the Fresno Unified School District yanked its charter
in January because of what officials called questionable operating
practices and $1.3 million in debt.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The police chief in the border city of Tijuana has resigned his post,
saying political pressure made it impossible for him to do his job.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Carlos Otal Namur handed in his letter of resignation
Friday to the mayor of the city that is plagued by drug violence,
kidnappings and car theft.</LD>
<LD>   In April, Otal and 40 other officials and police officers in Baja
California were detained by federal authorities and taken to Mexico
City for questioning on allegations involving the protection of the
Tijuana-based Arellano Felix drug-smuggling organization. The chief
was later released.</LD>
<TE>   Otal, who became chief in December, told reporters he felt
compelled to resign because of the pressure of constant rumors that
he was about to be fired by Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes and the City
Council.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rabbi Max Vorspan, scholar, historian, educator and major leader in
the Los Angeles Jewish community, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Vorspan died Thursday in Los Angeles of causes associated with
aging.</LD>
<LD>   An instructor in American Jewish history at the University of
Judaism since 1953, he helped develop the school from a small
teachers college and adult school into a nationally recognized
undergraduate and graduate institution.</LD>
<TE>   Besides teaching, Vorspan served in several administrative posts,
including registrar, executive dean and provost, and held the title
senior vice president. He helped create the university's department
of continuing education and helped found Camp Ramah.</TE>
<TE>   With Lloyd P. Gartner, Vorspan co-wrote "The History of the Jews
of Los Angeles," jointly published by the Jewish Publication Society
and Huntington Library. For 18 years, Vorspan hosted "Commitment,"
the university's weekly public affairs program on KCBS-TV Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   He also founded and directed the Pacific Southwest Region of the
United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. He was associate director
of the Brandeis-Bardin Camp Institute and a member of the Jewish
Federation Council board.</TE>
<TE>   Born in St. Paul, Minn., Vorspan earned a bachelor's degree from
the University of Minnesota and a doctorate from the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York. He was ordained at the seminary.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, the former Sandy Robinson; a son,
Rabbi David Vorspan; a daughter, Dr. Rachel Vorspan; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday in Gindi
Auditorium at the university, 15600 Mulholland Drive. Burial will be
at Mount Sinai Memorial Park at noon, and the campus will host a meal
of condolence from 1 to 3 p.m.</TE>

<AU>DENNY FREIDENRICH</AU>
<BD> Denny Freidenrich has lived in Orange County since
1970. He writes from Laguna Beach. He can be reached at
first.strategies@verizon.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the hundreds of articles I have read since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, none has haunted me as much as a recent piece by Michael
Kelly in the Washington Post.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly blames Republicans Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader;
and Dick Armey, House majority leader; along with Democrats Tom
Daschle, Senate minority leader; and Richard A. Gephardt, House
minority leader, not only for speaking in cliches about Sept. 11 and
its aftermath, but for speaking from another time. In a nutshell, he
says they are speaking "a dead language." I agree. That said, what
does this say about the media, career politicians and the political
process itself? Are they dead too?</LD>
<LD>   Before you paint me as some out-of-his-mind, fringe politico, let
me assure you I am not. I was Bill Honig's Orange County fund-raiser
in 1982 and 1986, when he was elected (and reelected) state
superintendent of public instruction. During that time, I worked for
Irvine's Larry Agran, who's now mayor, as well as the Board of
Supervisors and four beach cities in their fight against offshore oil
drilling along the county's coastline. Today, the company I
co-founded represents the nearly 300 families living in El Morro
Village so they don't have to suffer the same fate as those who once
lived in Crystal Cove.</LD>
<TE>   I think it is time to rethink the national
Demopublican-Republocratic agenda. The way I see it, virtually no one
in Washington speaks for me any longer. To go one step further, I'm
not sure anyone there really speaks for my generation either.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, my generation. We are the baby boomers. We were supposed to be
about peace and love. We were supposed to make the world a better
place. It would seem, even to the most casual observer, we have done
a pretty lousy job.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of peace, we are at war. Instead of love, there is hatred
everywhere. In a sense, boomers didn't create the most difficult
issues confronting us today (like the battles in the Middle East and
South Asia, the bombings in Northern Ireland and the instability in
Latin America); still, we can't ignore them, can we?</TE>
<TE>   One way to deal with these problems is by conventional means. This
is why Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and U.S. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell have taken their shows on the road. They are
hoping their words of wisdom sink in. They have in the past, so
everyone, including me, hopes they will now.</TE>
<TE>   Herein lies the dilemma--and the essence of speaking "a dead
language" on the world stage. If the old words hardly resonate with
my generation at home, then it is time to admit that some people
can't hear them at all. If Sept. 11 proved one thing, it is this:
Terrorists speak another language altogether. Their message is about
death and weapons of mass genocide, but their language is far from
dead.</TE>
<TE>   This is what truly haunts me about what Kelly said in his column
and what I hear (or don't hear) our political leaders saying today.
On the one hand, I see their lips moving. On the other hand, I hardly
can understand a word they are saying.</TE>

<LD>There's an eerie uncertainty among Orange County beachgoers,
government regulators and city officials after spring surf brought a
monthlong closure to half a mile of Huntington State Beach. Despite
five years of study and the expenditure of more than $8 million, the
question that remains unanswered is "Why are our beaches so filthy?"</LD>
<LD>   After passage of a 1997 law that required regular testing of water
at state beaches, officials quickly found all was not well in Surf
City.</LD>
<LD>   Five miles of beaches between Newport Beach and Huntington Beach
were closed to swimming in the summer of 1999, and the impact of the
closures on beach-related business was disastrous.</LD>
<TE>   Research in progress by economists at USC and UC Berkeley shows
that beach-related spending at Huntington state and Huntington city
beaches was down more than $15 million in 1999 and almost $19 million
in 2000 compared with 1998. As this summer quickly approaches, we
must act to restore clean water and avoid further economic losses and
damage to Orange County's image.</TE>
<TE>   What we know is that beach closures and chronic warnings may stem
from two sources: urban runoff, a catchall phrase to describe water
that flows across our cityscape to the ocean, and the discharge of
sewage from the Orange County Sanitation District offshore at the
Newport Beach/Huntington Beach bound- ary.</TE>
<TE>   On top of these problems, the beaches are periodically closed when
roots and grease clog pipes and sewage spills into waterways that
lead to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Action has been taken on urban runoff issues under new,
wide-ranging and rigorous permits recently adopted by the state.
Cities will be implementing measures with residents and businesses
that will affect how driveways are cleaned and landscapes are
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   A similar commitment to improving the treatment of Orange County
sewage has not been made. Orange County is one of only a handful of
sanitation districts nationwide to be granted a federal waiver that
allows the district to dump partially treated sewage into the ocean.
District officials have justified their waiver based on the belief
that their outfall pipe was sufficiently far offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Now, these same officials cannot be so sure. In February, Blake
Anderson, district general manager, wrote in a news release that the
plume of waste water came "uncomfortably close" to the shoreline at
Newport Beach--within half a mile. Coincidently, a paper was
published in an academic journal in March that showed how the plume
potentially could move to within half a mile of the shore and to
depths as shallow as 65 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Orange County closed a half-mile stretch of beach at
Magnolia Street to swimming because of high bacteria counts and
uncertainty about their source. The closure remained in effect for
one month.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the district has committed to disinfecting its waste
water, and we support this decision. This will finally bring the
district in line with the minimum disinfection efforts of every other
ocean sewage discharger in California.</TE>
<TE>   To avert beach closures and continuing erosion in public
confidence, we urge regulators to expedite the permitting and
environmental review process. We must take action now to ensure our
beaches are not closed again.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this quick fix, we are asking the district to invest in the
infrastructure that will treat sewage to secondary standards, in line
with other major facilities, such as the Hyperion sewage treatment
plant in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   With secondary treatment, we can ensure more complete destruction
of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. If the district goes forward
this fall with an application for renewal of the waiver, we urge the
Environmental Protection Agency, the California Regional Water Board
and the California Coastal Commission to reject it.</TE>
<TE>   While many argue that secondary treatment is too costly, we
believe the public wants clean beaches and is willing to pay for
them. USC and UC Berkeley researchers found that more than 66% of
Southern Californian households with at least one beachgoer would be
willing to pay $100 annually to prevent beach closures resulting from
sewage discharge.</TE>
<TE>   The willingness of the public to pay for clean beaches is well in
excess of what the district estimates it will cost to go to secondary
treatment. Anderson recently stated that the cost for the district to
upgrade treatment facilities would cost residents 5 cents per day or
less than $20 per year.</TE>
<TE>   With more than half of all households in the region claiming at
least one beachgoer, there should be plenty of public support for the
district to increase its protection of our valuable beaches. After
all, what are Huntington Beach and Newport Beach without beaches that
are safe for swimming and surfing?</TE>

<HD>Burkett Can't Match Maddux in Braves' Win</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux won his fifth consecutive decision as the Atlanta Braves
beat former teammate John Burkett and the Boston Red Sox, 4-2,
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Rafael Furcal had three hits for the Braves, who won for the 10th
time in 11 games.</LD>
<LD>   Burkett (7-2) lost his second straight start, just as Pedro
Martinez did the night before. Burkett, who spent the last two years
with Atlanta before signing with Boston as a free agent in the
off-season, gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings.</LD>
<TE>   Maddux (7-2) pitched six scoreless innings before running into
trouble in the seventh. He gave up four consecutive hits and two runs
to start the inning before leaving with a strained left calf. He said
he does not expect to miss his next start.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hammond relieved with two on and got out of the inning with
no further damage. John Smoltz worked the ninth for his 21st save in
24 chances, getting Carlos Baerga to ground into a game-ending double
play with two on.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux cruised through six innings, retiring 15 of 17 batters. He
yielded only three hits and threw 71 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burkett said Friday he'll boycott the All-Star game in Milwaukee
if selected because of Commissioner Bud Selig's handling of labor
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go to Milwaukee and play in an All-Star game that
would benefit him," Burkett told the Boston Globe. "It's something I
feel strongly about, and I'm willing to stand up and make that
decision."</TE>

<HD>It's 30 for Castillo, and Marlins Beat Devil Rays</HD>
<DH>Interleague: Infield single extends his hitting streak and
Burnett is overpowering in 3-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Luis Castillo beat out a grounder to short and A.J. Burnett fired a
flurry of 98-mph fastballs as the Florida Marlins won with speed
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo extended his hitting streak to 30 games with an infield
single in the sixth inning, then scored the first run to help Burnett
beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 3-0.</LD>
<LD>   Burnett pitched a three-hitter and struck out a career-high 11.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo was hitless in two at-bats before reaching to start the
sixth. He hit a high hopper to shortstop Chris Gomez, who charged and
bounced a hurried throw to first that was late.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to use my speed," Castillo said. "I tried to run hard."</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a clean throw, he's out, but Gomez had to throw it right
away," Tampa Bay Manager Hal McRae said. "Castillo's a fast runner,
and it wasn't an easy play."</TE>
<TE>   It's the 39th time a player has hit in 30 consecutive games.
Castillo is the first to do it since Vladimir Guerrero had a 31-game
streak for the Montreal Expos in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I feel I can get a hit every time," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett (7-5) looked strong from the start, breaking two of Steve
Cox's bats in the first inning. He was even tougher at the finish and
retired the last 12 batters, including Brent Abernathy, whose bat
sailed toward the dugout as he missed one final 98-mph fastball to
end it.</TE>
<TE>   "That pretty much summed up the night," Abernathy said. "Fastball
after fastball after fastball. That's all he pitched, but it was all
good."</TE>
<TE>   Burnett needed only two hours 22 minutes to beat the Devil Rays,
who were shut out for the eighth time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander pitched his third complete game this season and
his third career shutout. He improved to 5-0 in interleague play with
a 3.04 earned-run average.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Wins 10th With 13 Strikeouts</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Randy Johnson struck out 13 in seven innings and earned his 10th
victory Saturday night as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Detroit
Tigers, 3-1.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Grace, pinch-hitting for Johnson, singled in the go-ahead run
with two out in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   With a fastball regularly hitting 98 mph, Johnson (10-2) scattered
seven hits, walked two and hit a batter. The only run he gave up was
unearned, due to his own fielding error.</LD>
<TE>   "If I had that all the time, yeah, the game would be a lot easier,
but I don't have it all the time," Johnson said of his slider.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Bernero matched Johnson through six innings but left for a
pinch-hitter to start the seventh after throwing only 71 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Bernero, called up earlier this season from triple-A Toledo,
yielded four hits, struck out four and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's only run against him came on a wild pitch. His strong
performance came one night after Mark Maroth, in his second big
league start, outpitched Curt Schilling in Detroit's 6-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley doubled off reliever Julio Santana (3-1) with one out
in the seventh. After Tony Womack flew out, the Tigers intentionally
walked Alex Cintron to bring up Grace and make sure Johnson left the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Grace lined a 3-1 pitch to center, scoring Finley from second.
Byung-Hyun Kim pitched the last two innings for his 18th save in 20
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson reached double-digit strikeouts for the sixth time this
season and 177th of his career, second only to Nolan Ryan's 215.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger hitting coach Merv Rettenmund was ejected in the fifth
inning for arguing balls and strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Robert Fick had three hits to extend his hitting streak
to 17 games.</TE>

<LD>The Seattle Mariners didn't have to travel to Southern California for
an interleague weekend series with the Padres to hear the Angel
footsteps more clearly.</LD>
<LD>   After all, as Lou Piniella tells it in the visiting manager's
office here, he had insisted all spring that the Angels were the
American League West's most improved team, that his team knew it was
unlikely to play at a 116-win pace again and that the division shaped
up to be the tough race it has become, which is "the way it should be
and is great for baseball."</LD>
<LD>   How great it is for Piniella's blood pressure is another matter.</LD>
<TE>   The mid-June reality is that the Angels, 41 games behind the
Mariners last year, were only one behind through Friday and already
had Piniella thinking about his strategy when the teams next meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you this," the Seattle manager said, "if that David
Eckstein comes up with the bases loaded, he'll get walked
intentionally. I'll give up the run and go to the next guy."</TE>
<TE>   Piniella laughed, but who knows?</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-8 Angel shortstop has three home runs and a triple when
batting with the bases loaded this season, growing in size, strength
and stature.</TE>
<TE>   His team was 10 1/2 games behind the Mariners on April 23, and it
looked like a sequel to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were 6-14, the Mariners 17-4.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Angels began the weekend having played at a .744
pace, the Mariners .511, and roaring up behind the Angels were the
Oakland A's, who were five games behind Seattle after winning eight
in a row through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Footsteps?</TE>
<TE>   "If you're hearing footsteps in June, you've got a problem,"
veteran Mariner Mark McLemore said. "The only thing that matters is
where you are on Sept. 30. They don't hand out trophies in June, and
everybody on this team knows that.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, last year was last year and this year is this year. We're
not surprised that it's a two- or three-team race, and we're not
disappointed. We'd like to be playing a little better, but it's not
like we're 10 games behind and looking up."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   As torrid as the Angels have been, the Mariners were still in
first place as they arrived in San Diego, boasted the league's
third-best record and were on a pace to win 100 games, which might
not be 116 but still represents a challenge to the Angels and A's.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Mariners have had to battle through the extended
absences of three key players--Hall of Fame-caliber designated hitter
Edgar Martinez, who was activated Friday after having surgery for a
ruptured knee tendon on April 13; starting pitcher Paul Abbott, who
was 17-4 last year and should be activated next week after going on
the disabled list May 5 for a shoulder inflammation, and right-handed
set-up man Jeff Nelson, who is also about a week away after having
elbow surgery on May 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at it realistically," said Piniella, "we've lost more
valuable pieces than any team in the division, and not just for short
periods, either.</TE>
<TE>   "We said going into the season that one thing we had to do was
stay healthy. We don't have the depth we've had at some points in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, ours and the Angel statistics mirror each other, but the
one difference is they've stayed healthy and we haven't."</TE>
<TE>   The Friday mirror showed that the Angels and Mariners had the same
fielding percentage, the same earned-run average and were virtually
tied or in close proximity in virtually every offensive category.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the return of Martinez ("you feel guilty when you're
sitting and watching and your team is losing," the DH said) should
bolster what Piniella, forced to juggle, described as the "crossword
puzzle" of a lineup.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lineup in which Ichiro Suzuki is on his way to a second
straight batting title but  Bret Boone (on pace for 20 homers and 100
runs batted in after hitting 37 with 141 RBI last year), Mike Cameron
(despite those four homers in one game) and Jeff Cirillo have all
been inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Abbott's return should bolster a rotation in which
Freddy Garcia and Jamie Moyer are a combined 15-6 and Joel Pineiro,
in his first full season, is 5-3 with a 3.10 ERA, but the Mariners
have otherwise struggled trying to replace the 32 wins and 379
innings that Abbott and Aaron Sele, now with the Angels, produced
last season.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Pat Gillick has been scouring the market for a
starting pitcher--he would settle for a hitter--but teams are
reluctant to give up a front-line player this early in the season,
and Gillick, who has said he would trade anyone except Suzuki ("it
would also take a hell of a deal to get Garcia"), can't take his
$90-million payroll much higher, although the Mariners are expected
to draw more than 3.5 million fans.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella reflected on the status of the race in the West and said
he is convinced that the Mariners, Angels and A's can reach the
playoffs only by winning the division because the New York Yankees
and Boston Red Sox are both likely to compile better records in the
less competitive East, the runner-up capturing the wild card.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as last year's pace," he said of the Mariners' 116 wins,
"we knew that wouldn't happen again. I mean, it happens ... what,
once every century? Our objective was to get off to a good start, and
we did. Since then, we've been treading water, but we should be at
full strength again by the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "I made the point in the spring that it would be a tough race and
the Angels were the most improved team in the division. They added
two veteran starting pitchers and a full-time DH and we knew Tim
Salmon and Darin Erstad wouldn't have two off years in a row. Look at
their personnel. They probably have the deepest starting pitching in
the division, a legitimate closer and an offense that can beat you
with both power and creativity."</TE>
<TE>   They also have that slugging shortstop Piniella is fearful of
pitching to with the bases loaded.</TE>

<HD>Suzuki Has .400 Reasons to Improve</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views ...</LD>
<LD>   News: Ichiro Suzuki, trying for his second straight American
League batting title, lifts his average to .371 before the Seattle
Mariners' series finale against the San Diego Padres today.</LD>
<LD>   Views: Ho hum. Suzuki has a lead of more than 30 points on Johnny
Damon. The batting title is his. The only question is, can he hit
.400 in the process?</LD>
<TE>   "If any player in baseball can, he's it," Manager Lou Piniella
said. "He doesn't strike out, he puts the ball in play, he spreads
the defense, he runs exceptionally well and now he's begun to bunt
more. The only negative as far as hitting .400 is that he doesn't
walk that much. How many at-bats did he have last year ... 650? It's
harder to maintain a higher percentage with that many at-bats."</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to walk Suzuki, who actually had 692 at-bats,
because he can do just about anything he wants with any pitch--strike
or otherwise--but he is walking more. He drew 30 walks last year
while batting .350 and had 33 through Friday, including 14
intentional walks. His on-base percentage is more than 60 points
higher than last year and he was on pace through Friday for 252 hits
compared to 242 last year.</TE>
<TE>   As a hitter, Piniella was a pro's pro. In his view, hitting .400
for the first time since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941 would be a
bigger story than Barry Bonds or some other muscular slugger
eclipsing the home run record again, especially, he said, since
defenses are better, gloves are larger and the strike zone is bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Roger Maris and his then-record 61 homers, Piniella
said: "Once Roger was passed, it's been done a few times. It's been a
long time since Williams, so you have to say that .400 is the next
frontier. It would be the equivalent of a heavyweight title fight
with a middleweight or lightweight winning it."</TE>
<TE>   News: The New York Mets beat Roger Clemens and the New York
Yankees, 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Call Saturday's knockout the best retaliation of all. Now,
can the underachieving Mets sustain that production under new hitting
coach Chris Chambliss, the former Yankee hitting coach who was hired
Thursday to replace the fired Dave Engle?</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Mets fired their pitching, hitting and bullpen
coaches in midseason, and promptly blazed into the playoffs. Whether
Chambliss can invigorate all of those new and struggling hitters--Mo
Vaughn, Jeromy Burnitz, Roger Cedeno and Roberto Alomar--remains to
be seen. But it's curious that the Mets never interviewed Vaughn's
private tutor, Mike Easler, and that Chambliss, who was serving as a
roving instructor with the Pittsburgh Pirates, made a point of saying
he would prefer that his hitters get their information "from one
source."</TE>
<TE>   "The player shouldn't be hearing from five or six different
people," Chambliss said.</TE>
<TE>   News: The Chicago Cubs' bullpen blows Mark Prior's 4-2 lead in a
5-4 loss to the Houston Astros on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The Cubs, remembering the elbow injury suffered by Kerry
Wood after he made nine starts of 120 or more pitches as a 1998
rookie, are going to be more cautious with Prior, the former USC star
and their No. 1 draft choice of last year. The right-hander has shown
a tendency to get stronger the longer he pitches, but he chose his
words carefully when lifted after 119 pitches and six innings against
the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel like I get stronger when I start hitting that 90- to
110-pitch mark," he said. "I feel like I'm in good shape and can
handle it with no problem, but they're obviously not going to push me
much further than 120, and I don't think any pitcher should really go
that far unless it's a must-win game."</TE>
<TE>   News: The players' union has a $108-million strike fund that is
almost $100 million less than their $198-million war chest before the
1994 work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The money comes from dues and licensing revenue, and is
normally distributed to the membership on an annual basis except when
a stoppage looms. In this case, percentages of the last three years'
distributions have been retained.</TE>
<TE>   Union sources insist that the smaller fund--the result of a
decrease in licensing income--will not prevent them from doing what
they need to do, but others believe it could be a consideration in
the event of a prolonged stoppage. The owners, who did not have a
reserve fund in 1994, now have about $210 million, mostly from
licensing and national TV and radio revenue that was not distributed
over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, compared to recent stagnancy, there was a degree
of movement in the bargaining negotiations last week. The owners made
minor changes in their tax and revenue-sharing proposals, and also
reduced the proposed discretionary fund that Commissioner Bud Selig
would have at his disposal from $100 million to $85 million.</TE>
<TE>   That pool would be generated from payroll tax proceeds and central
fund revenue, including national TV and licensing, and would be
used--beyond the proposed revenue sharing package--to help clubs
whose revenue still lagged behind the wealthier clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent meeting with reporters and editors of The Times, Selig
insisted he would no longer prop up clubs in financial trouble, but
that message seems at odds with the proposed discretionary fund.</TE>
<TE>   The union believes that $85 million is still far too much to be
left at Selig's or anyone's discretion and has proposed that $30
million be taken from the central fund for supplemental sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators are scheduled to meet again Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Tiger Not Only Beating Field, He's Holding Off the Law of
Averages</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>

<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>To hear it told around here, Tiger Woods is unbeatable. And that was
Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody who knew a golf ball was round was talking about it.
Those poor players, just turn in the courtesy cars, hop on the
highway, head for the airport. Thank you for playing our game and see
you at the Hartford Open.</LD>
<LD>   Common knowledge--and there's a dangerous phrase in golf--was that
the Open was so far over, you couldn't even see it anymore. All you
had to do was think about Tiger's game, yes, that would be the
ultimate validation. He hits it higher, farther, straighter, softer,
harder and better than anyone else. They should have engraved his
name on the trophy before the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The truth is, Tiger is the greatest closer in golf, a trait that
ought to come in handy for him today, because he might actually need
it.</TE>
<TE>   The record shows he has been the 54-hole leader 25 other times in
PGA Tour events and won 23. He has been in the lead four times at the
halfway point of majors and won them all. He has been the leader
seven times going into the last round of a major and won them all.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger might even do it an eighth time today at Bethpage Black,
where they're playing the People's Open and the place where the
People's Champion is winning again.</TE>
<TE>   His excellence is not so monotonous as simply understood. A Woods
victory is implied every time he shows up. What's more, no one has
risen up from the masses, stood right there with him on the tee and
then knocked him off his perch.</TE>
<TE>   Because he has won five of the last eight majors, Woods makes
winning them look so easy that there is now a clear notion that he's
destined to win every time. That's probably why so many people felt
comfortable declaring the Open closed for everyone but Woods so
early.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was far from Woods' greatest day in the third round at
the Black Course, where he struggled to an even-par 70 yet still
managed to increase his lead. Woods is four shots ahead of Sergio
Garcia (he was three ahead of Padraig Harrington after 36 holes), but
the margin could have been doubled if Tiger had put the ball closer
to the hole and made a few putts that were begging to go in and
stayed out instead.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods somehow doesn't close the deal, he's going to remember
what happened Saturday at the par-five 13th--and Tiger eats par-fives
for snacks. At the 13th, Woods stood over a long eagle putt and wound
up having to steer in a three-footer just to save par.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if there weren't any birdies out there, because the
guys chasing him had no trouble finding them. Maybe they were just
hiding from Woods, who has bagged his limit so many times before.</TE>
<TE>   Woods knew he didn't play his best, saying he simply hung around,
fought as hard as he could and maintained his cool.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, what's the big deal when he plays only so-so and still
manages to increase his lead from three shots to four?</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe nothing. Then again, golf has shown us that even the
greatest players of their generation don't always win every major.
History is full of assorted tales of tragedy for some of golf's
biggest heroes.</TE>
<TE>   All you have to do is remember that one of the greatest of them
all, Ben Hogan, lost the 1955 U.S. Open to Jack Fleck in an 18-hole
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that Arnold Palmer lost the U.S. Open three times in
playoffs. He lost to Jack Nicklaus in 1962 at Oakmont, he lost to
Julius Boros in 1963 at the Country Club and he lost to Billy Casper
in 1966 at the Olympic Club. In that one, Palmer blew a six-shot lead
with six holes to go.</TE>
<TE>   We know that Tiger's idol is Nicklaus, largely for his 18 major
championship titles, more than anyone who ever played golf. But
Nicklaus endured his share of heartbreak. He was second in 18 other
majors. One of them was in the 1971 U.S. Open at Merion, where Lee
Trevino beat him in a playoff. Eleven years later at the U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach, Tom Watson chipped in at the 71st hole and birdied the
72nd hole to beat him by two shots.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, even the greatest are simply outplayed, which is what
happened to Nicklaus in the 1977 British Open at Turnberry. Watson,
paired with Nicklaus the last two days, turned in rounds of 65-65 and
beat Jack by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   If it happened to the greatest players of their generations, it's
going to happen to Woods too. But first, somebody is going to have to
step up and challenge him, and that hasn't happened yet. It certainly
didn't happen at the Masters, where Woods all but coasted on the last
day when no one put enough heat on him to wilt his swoosh.</TE>
<TE>   No, Woods isn't going to win every major, no matter what the
consensus is, even after what happened at Bethpage Black after only
the first day. Everyone should back off, appreciate Tiger's skills
and applaud the players trying to have the same kind of day that he
already has enjoyed so many times.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger is the best player in the world, but he's going to lose a
major, one that he should have had locked up ... maybe not today, but
sometime. All the great ones do.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Monday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Kobe, Japan
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m. Monday
How they got here: Brazil finished first in Group B at 3-0-0,
outscoring Turkey, Costa Rica and China by an aggregate 11-3. Belgium
took second in Group H with a 1-0-2 record
Brazil update: France is gone, Argentina is gone, Italy nearly went
with them, but Brazil continues to thrive. The 3-0 record is somewhat
flattering; Brazil pounded China and Costa Rica by a combined 9-2,
but struggled to turn back Turkey. The most notable development in
group play was Ronaldo's return to fitness and goal-scoring form--he
scored four times in the three games. But Brazil has some nagging
defensive and goalkeeping problems, which Costa Rica exploited for
two goals and numerous quality opportunities. That shouldn't unhinge
the Brazilians here, but England waiting in the quarterfinals is
another story altogether
Belgium update: The Belgians made history Friday by finally winning a
World Cup match, over Russia, ending an eight-game winless streak
that included five consecutive ties. Oh, and they also qualified for
the second round. Belgium plays a methodical style that could trouble
Brazil--one way to frustrate the Brazilians is to bore them--and has
just enough flash in striker Wesley Sonck and captain Marc Wilmots to
sneak a goal or two. But will that be enough? "We have to do
something special," Coach Robert Waseige said. "If we are at our best
and we work very hard, we can achieve something."
Outlook: Ronaldo reports that he and his teammates watched Belgium's
3-2 victory over Russia and says, "We have nothing to fear from this
team and there's no cause for alarm." What else needs to be said,
except: He's probably right</TE>

<LD>Phil Jackson and Red Auerbach have more in common than the record for
most NBA titles by a coach, says Fran Blinebury of the Houston
Chronicle:</LD>
<LD>   "Neither Red nor Phil must have mirrors on his walls, because a
casual glimpse by one would show a reflection of the other.</LD>
<LD>   "At nine championships apiece, they deserve to be listed on the
same page of the record books. Jackson is the height of haughtiness.
Auerbach is an artist of arrogance.</LD>
<TE>   "But at the moment, nobody can touch Red and Phil, who don't own
an ounce of humility between them."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which Laker great was the first commissioner of the
old American Basketball Assn.?</TE>
<TE>   Tuning out: Ron Rapoport of the Chicago Sun-Times, commenting on
the NBA Finals:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to overstate the importance of this--give us a
competitive, seven-game series next season, and the fans will be
back--but we someday might look back at the end of NBC's long
affiliation with the NBA as the beginning of the end of the golden
age of sports television.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent days, two of the most powerful executives in sports TV
have said out loud what industry insiders have been telling
themselves and each other for quite some time: The golden goose might
be laying her final eggs."</TE>
<TE>   Pre-peat: John Kundla, who coached the Minneapolis Lakers to three
consecutive NBA titles from 1952 to '54, says the feat wasn't
appreciated then as it is now.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't call it a 'three-peat' then," Kundla told Newsday.
"We didn't think anything about it. We didn't realize until much
later what we had accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Hall injustice: Lacy Banks of the Chicago Sun-Times says the
Basketball Hall of Fame blew it again by denying induction to
80-year-old Tex Winter, a Laker assistant who is expected to retire
after a 55-year coaching career in the college and pro ranks:</TE>
<TE>   "Of the 246 individuals in the Hall of Fame, I don't think any of
them, including Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Red Auerbach, Larry
Bird or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, is more deserving than Tex Winter.</TE>
<TE>   "Longevity and seniority aren't the reasons Winter should be
inducted into the Hall. Those 55 years are rich with pioneering
accomplishments, unselfish service and coaching involvement in more
than 1,000 victories."</TE>
<TE>   Short memory: A New York writer called Jason Kidd the biggest
acquisition in the history of the New Jersey Nets' franchise, but
Eric Corwin of Sportspages.com begs to differ:</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go with a fellow by the name of Julius Erving, acquired from
the Virginia Squires when the Nets called Long Island home and the
league they played in bounced red, white and blue basketballs."</TE>
<TE>   For those too young to remember, that would be the old American
Basketball Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: George Mikan.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Nearly 40,000 fans attended the Tampa Bay Buccaneers'
"FanFest," and perhaps no one was more excited than a woman quoted by
the Orlando Sentinel. After getting Coach Jon Gruden's autograph, she
said it ranked "right up there with getting married and having
children."</TE>
<TE>   To which Tom Fitzgerald of the San Francisco Chronicle replied,
"That's not the way Al Davis sees it."</TE>

<HD>Another Good Start for Stanford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Stanford always seems to have plenty of pitching in the College World
Series, and it was no different Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal won its fifth consecutive Series opener, beating
Notre Dame, 4-3, before a crowd of 21,919 at Rosenblatt Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "We usually have a pretty good No. 1 starter and that's really
what it falls to," said Coach Mark Marquess.</LD>
<TE>   That's true of the program that has produced pitchers such as Jack
McDowell, Mike Mussina and the latest, Jeremy Guthrie, who pitched a
complete game Saturday for his 13th win of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians' first-round draft pick yielded 10 hits and
struck out five. Other than shaky seventh and eighth innings, Guthrie
(13-1) was dominant after the Cardinal took a 2-0 lead in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're able to swing the bats as well as we did early it
helps everybody settle in," said Guthrie, who pitched 13 innings in a
regional win two weeks ago over Cal State Fullerton. "I know it helps
me every time."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Fuld homered for the Cardinal (46-16), which lost in the last
two CWS championship games.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford extended its overall winning streak to 10 games and
improved to 10-4 in the opening round.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is making its fourth consecutive CWS appearance and 14th
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal last lost an opening-round game in 1995 to Cal State
Fullerton, which went on to win the title.</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie walked only one in his sixth complete game this season.</TE>
<TE>   "That Guthrie kid is really good. He threw three different pitches
for strikes and he threw really hard," said Notre Dame Coach Paul
Mainieri.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know the stats, but I'm sure Guthrie hasn't given up 10
hits in a game very often."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's Grant Johnson (9-5) kept the Irish in the game
despite hitting three batters.</TE>
<TE>   He limited Stanford to four runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 2, Rice 1--Despite warm, humid conditions with little or no
wind in the usually hitter-friendly ballpark, the second game was a
pitcher's duel rarely seen in the College World Series.</TE>
<TE>   It was the lowest-scoring game since Louisiana State beat Florida,
2-1, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Simmons (15-1) pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings, yielding one
run and five hits.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out three and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Owl starter Steven Herce (13-3) was almost as effective, giving up
two runs and eight hits while striking out eight in 7 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Longhorns (54-15), who beat Rice (52-13) twice during the
regular season, won the opener of their 29th CWS and will play
Stanford on Monday in a winners' bracket game.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame and Rice, ranked No. 1 in the major polls, will play
Monday in an elimination game.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Ontiveros' single in the third inning drove in the game's
only run until the eighth, when Dustin Majewski doubled to drive in
Tim Moss and give the Longhorns a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Arnold broke up the shutout in the eighth with a towering
homer over the 30-foot batter's screen in center, where it is 408
feet to the wall.</TE>

<KH>DODGER-ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Salmon to Karros: Sorry About That</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna and Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel right fielder Tim Salmon apologized to Eric Karros on Saturday
for the awkward collision that knocked the wind out of the Dodger
first baseman Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   As Salmon ran toward first on a sixth-inning foul popup between
home and first and Karros rushed in to make the play, Salmon collided
with Karros, sending the Dodger sprawling to the turf. Karros, who
suffered chronic back problems in 2001, absorbed a nasty jolt but got
up after a few moments and remained in the game.</LD>
<LD>   "Salmon tried to ask if I was all right, but I really couldn't
talk; I was just trying to get some air," Karros said. "It was one of
those freak things. I was thinking how hard I worked this winter to
get back on the field and how it would have been a shame to break a
few ribs on a play like that."</LD>
<TE>   Though the collision was clearly Salmon's fault--the fielder has
the right of way on such a play--Karros did not fault Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he do it on purpose? Absolutely not," Karros said. "He had
his head down. He was probably frustrated he popped up and wasn't
looking where he was going."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said he would have understood if Karros were upset.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to let him know that it was one of those things,"
Salmon said. "I was running hard with my head down and he was running
hard with his head up. It's fortunate. It could have been a lot
worse."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre, who was demoted from the
second to seventh spot in the order on June 1, was dropped to the
eighth spot Saturday night. Beltre's average has slipped from .286 on
May 16 to .248, and he leads the Dodgers with 10 errors.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to give him an opportunity to get himself going
offensively," said Manager Jim Tracy, who met privately with Beltre
on Friday night. "You do what you can to create the best environment
to get himself out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he has not considered benching Beltre. Of course, the
Dodgers don't have many attractive options at third, so they have
little choice but to stick with Beltre. "I'm not a guy who goes to
the panic button too quickly," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The swelling in Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown's surgically repaired
right elbow is "minimal to nonexistent," Tracy said Saturday. The
right-hander is also recovering from back surgery for a herniated
disk and will be sidelined for at least a month and probably more....
Catcher Paul Lo Duca took a Kazuhisa Ishii wild pitch on the left
forearm Friday night, the same spot he was hit by a bat on a swing in
Atlanta in May, but the bruise did not prevent him from playing
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Appier, who has labored his last four starts, put in
some extra work this weekend, trying to get back to the form that
made him the Angels' most effective starter earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Appier is 0-4 with a 6.41 earned-run average in his last four
starts. His ERA has climbed from 2.96 to 3.87 in that time. Appier
threw off the mound, trying to correct a flaw in his delivery, on
Friday and did his regular bullpen work Saturday. He is scheduled to
start Tuesday in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to fix what has gone awry in his delivery," pitching
coach Bud Black said. "He threw off flat ground [Friday] to try to
get things worked out."</TE>

<HD>Green Running Deep Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Latest home run binge reaches four in a row, and
Dodgers even series against Angels with 10-5 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first home run, a towering solo shot to center field, came in the
first inning, and the second homer, a two-run laser to the same spot,
came in the second.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday night's Dodger-Angel game was a mere two innings old,
Shawn Green had two home runs in the bank, and heads in the Dodger
Stadium sellout crowd of 52,165, as well as those in the home dugout,
began spinning with possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   Green tied a major league record with four home runs in a game in
Milwaukee on May 23; could the Dodger right fielder do it again? Even
more outrageous: Could he hit five?</LD>
<TE>   Green settled for a smaller chunk of history, becoming the 22nd
major league player to homer in four consecutive at-bats over two
games, and the Dodgers parlayed that, another strong Odalis Perez
start and several other significant offensive contributions into a
10-5 interleague victory over the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who homered in his last two at-bats Friday night, walked in
the fifth inning and struck out in the sixth and eighth innings
Saturday, concluding a seven-game stretch in which he hit .333 (nine
for 27) with seven home runs and 11 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he was swinging the bat, I thought we had the makings of
something we visited in Milwaukee not too long ago," Dodger Manager
Jim Tracy said. "That's the impression you got watching him. He was
as locked in as much as he was that week [of May 21-26, when he
homered nine times].</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the prettiest swings in the game. It's the type of
swing where if he gets extended and his bat gets centered, the
ballpark is not going to hold the ball. That's all there is to it."</TE>
<TE>   It was Green's 21st multiple-homer game of his career and fifth of
the season, and he became the first player to homer in four
consecutive at-bats over two games since San Francisco's Barry Bonds
on May 19-20, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Every club has a guy on it who, before you go out there, you hope
isn't going to beat you," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's
locked in right now. It's difficult to pitch around him without
flat-out intentionally walking him. This is not a fluke. When great
players get hot, this is what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger shortstop Cesar Izturis snapped an 0-for-12 skid with a
career-high four hits, two runs and two RBIs, and Paul Lo Duca and
Brian Jordan also homered, giving the Dodgers 37 homers in the last
20 games. They hit 22 homers in the their first 40 games.</TE>
<TE>   Perez gave up two runs on six hits in seven innings, striking out
six and walking none, to improve to 7-3 and keep his earned-run
average at 2.62. The left-hander threw first-pitch strikes to 19 of
27 batters, and of his 95 pitches, 68 were strikes. He has not walked
a batter in seven of his 14 starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absence of [injured] Kevin Brown, if you wanted to make an
argument about who the ace of our staff is, this young man makes a
strong case for himself," Tracy said. "He's throwing the ball like he
did earlier in the season, when he was on a roll."</TE>
<TE>   Perez was perfect through 4 1/3 innings before Tim Salmon lined a
home run to left with one out in the fifth, a shot that gave him 846
career RBIs to tie Brian Downing for first place on the Angels'
all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Benji Gil doubled to lead of the sixth, David Eckstein hit an RBI
single, and Darin Erstad added a milestone hit, a sixth-inning single
that gave him 1,000 career hits, but the Angels were unable to
inflict further damage on Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Scott Schoeneweis (5-5) took batting practice before
the game, a novelty of sorts for an American League pitcher, but he
didn't hang around long enough to get a plate appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander who was 4-0 with a 3.10 ERA in his past six
starts, his last loss coming on May 4, was bombed for six runs on six
hits in two innings and was pulled for a pinch hitter in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca homered to left in the first inning and Green homered to
center, extending the Dodgers' string of consecutive solo home runs
against the Angels to six--all four of their hits in the Dodgers' 8-4
loss Friday night were solo homers.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers adopted a more-the-merrier approach in the ensuing
innings. After a walk, an Adrian Beltre single and Perez's sacrifice
bunt in the second, Izturis fisted a two-run single to center and
Green lined a two-run homer to center--giving him 20 home runs and 52
RBIs on the season--for a 6-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis doubled and scored on Lo Duca's RBI single off reliever
Scot Shields in the fourth, and Jordan followed Green's fifth-inning
walk--which was greeted with boos--with his 11th homer of the season,
a two-run shot to left that made it 9-1.</TE>

<HD>England Has Danish Feast</HD>
<DH>Round of 16: 3-0 victory in rain advances England to a
quarterfinal game for first time in 12 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it rains, England scores.</LD>
<LD>   After an entire first round spent searching the desert for a goal
in open play, somehow wringing a second-round berth out of a corner
kick and a penalty, England's arid offense left the sweltering heat
of Osaka for a British-style downpour in northwestern Japan on
Saturday against Denmark.</LD>
<LD>   The dark clouds that opened over Niigata's Big Swan Stadium left
fans drenched, Danish defenders soggy and the Denmark goal swamped as
England poured in goals by Michael Owen, Emile Heskey and Rio
Ferdinand in a 3-0 victory that moved England into the World Cup
quarterfinals for the first time in 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   Owen, the fast-paced striker who hadn't scored in the first 270
minutes of the tournament, finally broke through in the 22nd minute,
converting a flick-on from midfielder Nicky Butt.</TE>
<TE>   Heskey, Owen's hulking Liverpool teammate, who had scored only
once in 16 appearances for England, latched on to a long feed from
David Beckham and hammered the ball under the late-reacting
goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen in the 44th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, it took a defender to kick-start the England attack and
possibly shame the forwards into following suit.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand, pushing up on an early corner, headed Beckham's service
into Sorensen's flailing arms in the fifth minute.</TE>
<TE>   Twisting and falling, Sorensen couldn't hold the ball, letting it
slip from his grasp and cross the goal line before he could belatedly
knock it away.</TE>
<TE>   The three goals were the most England has scored in a World Cup
match since 1990, when the English team defeated Cameroon, 3-2, en
route to the semifinals. Saturday's outburst sends England into the
quarterfinals, where it will meet the winner of Monday's
Belgium-Brazil match.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we deserved 3-0," England Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson
said, "but anyhow, we scored three times and had some other
opportunities as well. So I think we deserved to win but maybe not by
that scoreline.... Maybe we were a little bit lucky. Maybe 3-0 was
too much, but we won it and we are in the quarterfinals."</TE>
<TE>   Owen played only the first half before leaving with a groin injury
Eriksson dismissed as relatively minor.</TE>
<TE>   "He did well, he did a lot of work in the first half and he scored
with the [wrong] foot," Eriksson said. "He had a small groin problem,
so at 2-0 it was not worth risking him. But I think he will be
available for the next game."</TE>
<TE>   For Denmark, the undefeated winner of Group A, the defensive lapse
was uncharacteristic of the Danes' normally physical, disciplined
back line.</TE>
<TE>   "But I thought we reacted very well, we played some good football
and had some chances," Denmark Coach Morten Olson said. "However, we
didn't [convert] our chances and then just before halftime we made
[another] mistake and then the game was over. Because to score three
goals against England is nearly impossible."</TE>
<TE>   With a quarterfinal confrontation with Brazil looming, Eriksson
said "it will not make any difference" who wins the Belgium-Brazil
match.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who is going to win--there are two different schools
of football, one is samba football, the other is European football,
of course," Eriksson said. "I shall sit in front of the TV and watch
it very carefully."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Mamadou Diallo scored four goals and Andy Williams had three assists
to lead the New York/New Jersey MetroStars to a 5-0 victory over the
Galaxy on Saturday in front of 22,071 at Giants Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The MetroStars acquired Diallo, known as "Big Mama," and Williams
on May 24 from the New England Revolution in the biggest trade in MLS
history.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time Diallo has scored four goals in a game
against the Galaxy. He also did it while playing for the Tampa Bay
Mutiny in a 4-4 tie on May 9, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's loss was the most lopsided in Galaxy history. The
Galaxy (5-5-2) had never lost by more than three goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bad game," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. "I thought we
gave them a couple of counter-attacking goals. We had four or five
opportunities, but the difference was that they finished their
opportunities and we didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get any points whether you lose 3-0 or 5-0, so you have
to try to get back in the game, and we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Diallo scored the first goal for the MetroStars (4-5-2) in the
27th minute, off a 45-yard pass from Williams. Diallo unleashed a low
liner from 16 yards out that eluded Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   Diallo scored again nine minutes later, helped in part by Galaxy
defender Alexi Lalas, who inadvertently knocked the ball of him.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Diallo got the fourth hat trick of his career,
on a brilliant pass from Williams, who led Diallo perfectly to the
left corner of the net in the 58th minute. He scored his fourth goal
on a penalty kick in injury time after he was fouled in the box.</TE>
<TE>   MetroStar goalkeeper Tim Howard stopped six shots for the shutout,
the ninth of his career and his first this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy had eight corner kicks, but only four shots on goal.</TE>

<HD>Neuville Rescues Germany, 1-0</HD>
<DH>Round of 16: Goal in 88th minute beats Paraguay for spot in
quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter whether the United States or Mexico wins Monday's showdown
in Jeonju, South Korea, both teams now know who the winner will face
in the quarterfinals Friday--three-time world champion Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Rudi Voeller's team made hard work of defeating Paraguay on
Saturday, but a late goal by Oliver Neuville gave it a 1-0 victory
before 25,176 at Jeju World Cup Stadium at Seogwipo, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   "We deserved to win," Voeller said, adding that he was not at all
pleased with the team's dreary performance in the first 45 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "I was a bit annoyed at halftime because we were playing exactly
the opposite of the game we had planned, at times blindly kicking the
ball forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing unsightly about Neuville's 88th-minute strike,
however. The 29-year-old Bayer Leverkusen forward spun around to
volley Bernd Schneider's cross from the right past goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert from six yards to seal the South Americans' fate.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think everything is possible," Neuville said. "We have
proven once again that we are able to score when we need to. That
will give us a lot of self-confidence for the rest of the
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   After watching his team come within minutes of forcing overtime
and perhaps reaching the quarterfinals, Paraguay Coach Cesare Maldini
announced his retirement. He was philosophical about the defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the game took place in midfield and suddenly there was a
beautiful run on the right [by Schneider] and a beautiful goal by
Neuville," he said. The 70-year-old former Italy national team coach
will return to AC Milan as a scout.</TE>
<TE>   Chilavert said the match might have gone either way.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Germany's lucky day today," he said. "We lost but we
played well. Germany didn't play better than us. We matched them all
the way."</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, Paraguay did little to trouble goalkeeper Oliver
Kahn, who had his own odd take on the game when it was all over.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a disaster to lose and exit the tournament on
my birthday," he said. "It would have been really stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn turned 33 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller said he is not concerned whether Germany plays Mexico or
the United States next.</TE>
<TE>   "Both are very good teams and I do not mind who we play," he said.
"We came here knowing we're not a team that can put other teams up
against the wall."</TE>

<LD>Annika Sorenstam shot a three-under-par 69 Saturday at
Evian-Les-Bains, France, to win her second Evian Masters championship
and sixth title of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam finished with a four-round total of 19-under 269, four
strokes ahead of Maria Hjorth and Mi Hyun Kim, who tied for second
place at 273.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam had four birdies and one bogey in the final round and
won $315,000 for her fifth LPGA Tour victory of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam, the 2000 Evian Masters winner, has earned $1,354,054 in
11 starts this year. She also won a season-opening event in
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't feel better," Sorenstam said. "This is the
second-biggest purse on the tour. A beautiful setting, a top-class
field and a first-class event. It was my goal to come over and win
the Evian and I've done it."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam also collected 80 Solheim Cup points to clinch a berth
on the 12-woman European squad, which will defend the trophy against
the United States at Interlaken in Minneapolis, Sept. 20-22.</TE>

<TE>   Local history favors Jay Sigel. Now if he can only figure out the

<TE>   Sigel shot a two-under 70 to take a one-stroke lead over Fuzzy
Zoeller and Gil Morgan after two rounds of the BellSouth Senior
Classic at Nashville as he tries to become the eighth second-round
leader to win the event in its nine-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel, who opened with a 64, might have a bigger lead if he hadn't
struggled with his speed on the greens.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time U.S. Amateur champion had four birdies and two bogeys
for a 10-under 134 total.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a little slow for me," he said. "I hit a lot of good
putts, had good lies, but I didn't have the right speed. I've got to
try to figure that out."</TE>
<TE>   Zoeller, coming off a victory last week in the Senior PGA
Championship in Akron, Ohio, matched Morgan with a 68.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel added two more graded stakes to his
ever-increasing resume Saturday at Hollywood Park and neither came
easily.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, less than an eighth of a mile from the wire in both
races, the hall of famer looked as if he would have to settle for
second.</LD>
<LD>   About 90 minutes after 7-1 shot Denon rallied to beat 16-1
pacesetter Night Patrol in the $500,000 Charlie Whittingham Memorial
Handicap, 17-10 favorite Milwaukee Brew surged late to beat 10-1 shot
Bosque Redondo by a head in the $500,000 Californian.</LD>
<TE>   Making his first start since his authoritative victory in the
Santa Anita Handicap on March 2 in his first race in California,
Milwaukee Brew was closer to the pace than he had been at the Arcadia
track, but his task still seemed difficult nearing the finish.</TE>
<TE>   In position to give jockey Chris McCarron his sixth Californian
victory on the day he made his impending retirement official with a
news conference before the races, Bosque Redondo had drawn clear and
appeared headed to victory.</TE>
<TE>   However, jockey Kent Desormeaux and Milwaukee Brew, a 5-year-old
Wild Again horse, prevailed in 1:48 for the 1 1/8 miles. It was the
first time since Spectacular Bid in 1980 that the Big 'Cap winner had
come back to win the Californian.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Frank Stronach, Milwaukee Brew earned his sixth victory
in 16 starts and he'll try for a sweep of Hollywood Park's two
biggest races for older horses when he returns in the $750,000
Hollywood Gold Cup on July 14.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good horse," said Frankel, who had also won the
Californian the year before with Skimming. "[Desormeaux] kept him a
little closer because it's hard to make up ground on this track. He
made up about two lengths in the last sixteenth of a mile."</TE>
<TE>   In the Whittingham, Denon, who had failed twice in longer races at
Santa Anita, wound up winning by a bit more than a length. Ridden by
Garrett Gomez, Denon completed the 1 1/4 miles on turf in 2:01 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Flaxman Holdings Ltd. and Ed Gann, the 4-year-old
Pleasant Colony colt won for the second time in as many starts at
Hollywood Park and the victory was his fourth in 10 races. He had won
the Hollywood Derby in his U.S. debut here Nov. 25.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks after becoming a stakes winner on the turf, Adoration
proved her versatility by winning the $266,800 Hollywood Breeders'
Cup Oaks on the dirt by a length over 29-1 shot Sister Girl Blues. .</TE>
<TE>   It was the third victory in six starts for Adoration, the 3-1
third choice in the Grade II race.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Girl Blues, the longest shot in the seven-horse field,
finished a nose in front of 2-1 favorite Saint Bernadette.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What was supposed to be a showdown between Congaree and Street Cry
in the $833,250 Stephen Foster Handicap turned out to be no contest.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since his easy victory in the Dubai World
Cup on March 23, Street Cry, the 2-1 second choice, rolled to a 6
1/2-length victory at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Jerry Bailey, who won three of the four stakes the track
offered, the 4-year-old Machiavellian colt completed the 1 1/8 miles
in the Grade I race in 1:47 4/5. Dollar Bill, the 6-1 third choice,
was second and Tenpins was third.</TE>
<TE>   Making his second start of the year after beating a weak field in
the Lone Star Park Handicap on May 27 in Texas, Congaree faded to
sixth as the 13-10 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey's other victories came with Danthebluegrassman, a 9-2 shot
who beat 13-10 favorite Stephentown by 2 1/2 lengths in the $109,500
Northern Dancer and with 7-2 shot Distant Valley, who beat Peace
River Lady and seven others in the $169,050 Regret. It was
Danthebluegrassman's first race since he was scratched the day before
the Kentucky Derby.</TE>

<KH>HORSE RACING BILL CHRISTINE</KH>
<HD>He Wants Free Rein</HD>
<DH>His passion gone, McCarron says he has no second thoughts
about retiring</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Saturday's midday news conference, called to confirm that Chris
McCarron would indeed be riding the last race of an Olympian career a
week from today at Hollywood Park, McCarron's eyes welled up as he
struggled to finish each sentence. Choking up is not something
endemic to McCarron, especially when he's on the back of an
1,100-pound thoroughbred in the final strides of a million-dollar
race.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess I need a blindfold," McCarron was saying at Hollywood
Park, where a makeshift interview area was set up in a tunnel just
off the jockeys' quarters. "Because every time I look toward the
back, I see Judy standing there, and that gets to me."</LD>
<LD>   Judy McCarron, the mother of their three daughters, was at
Churchill Downs last month for her husband's 18th ride in a Kentucky
Derby. Instead of winning a third Derby, McCarron finished sixth with
Came Home, the horse he had ridden to a Santa Anita Derby victory
just a month before. The next day, the McCarrons were going in
different directions, Judy to Lexington, Ky., where as a technical
consultant she was to inspect locations for a movie on the life of
Seabiscuit, and Chris to Hollywood Park, where he was scheduled to
ride in three races.</LD>
<TE>   Before heading for the Louisville airport, McCarron stopped by
Came Home's barn at Churchill Downs to make sure the colt had come
out of the Derby unscathed. But then, instead of catching his plane,
McCarron turned back and rejoined his wife at the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to say something that might still get me in trouble,"
McCarron said, finishing the story. "Maybe there's a statute of
limitations to this. But I called the stewards at Hollywood Park and
told them I couldn't make it."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Pedersen, one of those three stewards, can't recall the
excuse McCarron gave them.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably just told us the truth," Pedersen said. "We could
fine a rider for not having a good excuse, but with Chris you have to
allow some leeway. Over many years, his show-up record is pretty
good."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron might not have been able to explain fully why he did what
he did, but part of it was that traveling about 2,000 miles to honor
a few mounts was suddenly not the most important thing in his life.
Later that Sunday, at Keeneland, where the 1938 Seabiscuit-War
Admiral match race will be re-created for the film, McCarron watched
on television as Eddie Delahoussaye, his replacement at Hollywood in
the Inglewood Handicap, rode Seinne to a third-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ashamed to admit this," said McCarron, sobbing a little, "but
I had no guilty feelings about not being there. Something was wrong,
because I should have felt guilty. But there was no longer a big
bright flame burning. It was down to a little flicker. I could feel
that that big flame had been extinguished."</TE>
<TE>   More than a month later, this confused feeling hadn't gone away
and McCarron decided it was time to act. He discussed a possible
retirement with his wife and Gregg McCarron, his older brother, who
retired from riding years ago. Then on Wednesday night, he invited
himself over to the home of Scott McClellan, his agent since 1981. At
halftime of the Laker-Net game, McCarron and McClellan walked into
the agent's backyard and McCarron told him that it was over.</TE>
<TE>   The agent-jockey relationship starts with a handshake and many
times ends almost as quickly. The really long partnerships, like the
ones between Harry Silbert and Bill Shoemaker and between Vic Gilardi
and Jorge Velasquez, can be counted on a single hand. McCarron, who
began riding in 1974, en route to 7,137 wins and $264 million in
purses, had four agents before McClellan. The last was Vince
DeGregory, one of the best but for McCarron too much of a
high-pressure operative. After a couple of years, he turned to
McClellan, who in the beginning promised that "you'll never need
anybody but me."</TE>
<TE>   Recalling his years with McCarron, McClellan said Saturday that
there was never a harsh word.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can remember is that Chris didn't show up one
time to work a horse," McClellan said. "One time out of all those
years, mind you. But the horse's owners were there, and I needed to
call Chris for an explanation. 'Hey, Scotty,' he said. 'What can I
tell you? I just forgot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Longden, another Hall of Fame jockey, was 61, 14 years
older than McCarron, when he told a banquet audience that he was
quitting, won the 1966 San Juan Capistrano Handicap with George Royal
two days later and never returned. Gary Stevens, who's also in the
Hall of Fame, retired on opening day at Santa Anita in 1999 but
couldn't stay away. McCarron said Saturday that he won't have second
thoughts about quitting. For him, the flame cannot be rekindled.</TE>
<TE>   He's not likely to turn to training, either. "That would be like
going from the frying pan into the fire," he said. "The way the game
is today, it's too tough of a go."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, as early as next month in Alaska, he's going to try some
things he's not particularly good at, like fishing for trout.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm terrible at it," he said. "There's a place in
Azusa where you put dough on the end of a hook attached to a bamboo
stick, and pay by the weight for what you catch. You could reach down
and grab the fish. But I can't hook even one."</TE>
<TE>   Riding icons such as Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay and Delahoussaye
were shocked by McCarron's retirement announcement. Delahoussaye, 50,
might retire in a year or so.</TE>
<TE>   "What the hell are you doing?" Delahoussaye said as he joked with
McCarron in the jockeys' room. "You can't do this to me."</TE>
<TE>   Recalling that conversation, McCarron chuckled. There will be more
tears by next Sunday, but not now.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I'm trying to beat Delahoussaye in races," he said.
"Now I'm beating him going out the door."</TE>

<HD>Tommy Davis Was Her Thank You</HD>
<DH>Remembrance: Former Dodger's Christmas Eve visit in
father's final days is fitting memory for daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYANN HUDSON HARVEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The romantic aura of an emptied baseball stadium is a tender memory.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting next to my dad, I was never in a hurry to leave. We waited
out traffic in many of them, at Dodger Stadium, the L.A. Coliseum, in
our hometown park in Ontario.</LD>
<LD>   We would watch as the players left the field, as the crowds
crammed the tunnels and stairs. I could feel the lights as they
shined on the green grass and absorbed into the red dirt.</LD>
<TE>   I would listen to my dad discuss the game, usually with a friend,
his transistor radio lodged behind his pen protector in the pocket of
his white, short-sleeve shirt; the beige cord dangling from the
earplug.</TE>
<TE>   He would say some great things, as when he marveled at the "Moon
Shots" of Wally Moon and at the bat of Tommy Davis, and some stupid
things, as when he opined that Sandy Koufax's wildness would be his
end. I reminded him of that comment many times.</TE>
<TE>   All that noise, all those people, and then, silence. How I loved
the certainty of that contrast, the sudden peace; and then the warmth
of my father's hand when the usher finally asked us to leave.</TE>
<TE>   I would walk next to him up the stairs, my tiny legs struggling to
keep up. Halfway to the car, he would look down and smile. "C'mon
baby," my dad would say as he cradled me, "you must be tired."</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, as I walked alone out of stadiums across the
country while working for the Dodgers and, subsequently, covering the
Dodgers for The Times, I often longed for those tender arms, for that
mellow sweetness.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Hudson was proud that his daughter worked for the Dodgers,
even though, for me, it was a way to get closer to the game while I
worked myself through college. I didn't want to work for the team, I
wanted to write about it. My father didn't live long enough to see me
do the latter.</TE>
<TE>   About a month before my dad died, I was preparing to leave my
office at Dodger Stadium when Tommy Davis stopped by. I knew Tommy
because I scheduled the Dodgers' speakers' bureau, a roster of team
legends the club paid to make public appearances. "Merry Christmas,
Maryann," Tommy said, smiling. "Will you be at your dad's house for
the holidays?"</TE>
<TE>   My dad had recently been diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and given
a few months to live. "Why don't I stop by on Christmas Eve?" Tommy
asked.</TE>
<TE>   He lived near my father, in Alta Loma, so I gave him the address
and phone number but didn't give it another thought. Players were
always saying nice things like that. Their intentions were good.</TE>
<TE>   The phone rang about 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Tommy had gone to
the west side of Sixth Street, rather than to the east, but when he
got to the door of the wrong house the people who lived there
recognized him and asked him in for a drink. "So when I finish
talking with these nice people, I'll be right down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   My father sat on a stool at the portable bar at the end of the
narrow living room, his slipper-clad feet hugging the rail. He wore
his powder-blue pajamas under his navy-blue robe. His eyes, still so
sweet, squinted humbly through the falling tears.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of him, Tommy Davis was holding court, laughing,
talking, moving his hands around, swinging a bat. Many times I have
tried to remember what Tommy talked about that night, but the sound
of his voice is but a mood, like fog.</TE>
<TE>   In my dad's lap was a plastic dispenser filled with peanuts--a
gift, from Tommy. At one point, Dad reached down and touched it. And
I remember thinking how appropriate it all seemed. Eating peanuts.
Watching Tommy.</TE>
<TE>   Still.</TE>

<LD>Three races into his career, Crowned Dancer can become the first
double stakes winner among local 2-year-olds this afternoon at
Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by a partnership that includes Charles Cono and Eastern Sky
Unlimited Trust and trained by Chris Paasch, the son of Tactical
Advantage will try for his second victory in three weeks in the
$75,000 Haggin Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Crowned Dancer, who was purchased for $225,000 earlier this year
in Florida, was a troubled second in his debut on May 8. He dominated
his six rivals in the Willard Proctor Memorial on May 26, winning by
five lengths and completing the five furlongs in 57 4/5seconds.</LD>
<TE>   The chestnut colt is the 3-5 morning line choice in the Haggin,
which is 5 1/2 furlongs. He will break from post four in the field of
six after the scratch of Maui Wish. Alex Solis, who rode him for the
first time in the Proctor, has the mount again today.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Mike Harrington, who has unleased a slew of 2-year-old
winners by sire Swiss Yodeler at the meet, will send out two of those
horses in the Haggin--Luzern and Oberwald.</TE>
<TE>   Because both are owned by Heinz Steinmann, Luzern and Oberwald
will race coupled in the wagering. The entry is the 3-1 second on
Russ Hudak's line.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bay Meadows will conclude its meet and there is a
mandatory payout in the pick six, which has a carryover of $90,181.</TE>
<TE>   The main event is also a stakes for 2-year-olds. Banshee King, an
eight-length winner in his first start over the track on May 27, is
the likely favorite in the $55,000 Malcolm Anderson at five furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park offers a well-matched
field of older California-bred fillies and mares going 1 1/16 miles
on the turf. There are few throwouts in the field of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Marcelo Polanco. The trainer, who had only one winner
through the first six months plus of the year, had two victories
Friday night. He won with maidens Lillie Lane and Special Willy.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jim Chapman. The trainer, who will send out 2-1
favorite Stormented in the fourth, is three of 53 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exacta boxes in the sixth keying Jim's
Relaunch with Mr. Reed, Jack's Ole' and Crafty Dutchman.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/104. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17/$596.40. Total money bet: $672.</TE>

<HD>Giants, Sanders Play Long Ball Against A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the minors, Aaron Harang might have gotten away with the mistakes
he made Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But at Pacific Bell Park against veteran slugger Reggie Sanders,
the Oakland Athletics' heralded rookie learned the price of making
two bad pitches in the big leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Sanders hit a grand slam and a solo homer as the San Francisco
Giants ended the Athletics' eight-game winning streak with a 6-2
victory.</LD>
<TE>   Harang's rise from the Texas League into the starting rotation has
been one of the team's most exciting developments this season. But in
an otherwise solid outing, Harang (2-2) grooved two pitches to
Sanders, who helped hand Oakland a rare interleague loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have pitches that you just know when you let them
go, you wish you could have them back before he swings," Harang said.
"I've got to learn from it and not take it into my next start."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders' slam highlighted the eighth victory in 12 games for the
Giants, who evened the Bay Bridge series after Oakland's 3-2 victory
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland set a franchise record by playing its 12th consecutive
game without an error, but the A's became the last team to lose an
interleague game this season after winning their first seven. At
57-37, the A's have baseball's best interleague record.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cubs 7, Chicago White Sox 3--Sammy Sosa drove in two runs
with a broken-bat double during a five-run sixth inning, leading the
Cubs to their second consecutive win over the White Sox at Wrigley
Field.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Lieber (5-4) gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings
for his second win in a row after going seven starts without a
victory.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Kansas City 3--Jason Simontacchi kept his impressive
rookie run going, pitching into the seventh inning at St. Louis and
also driving in a run for his fifth consecutive victory. Simontacchi
(5-0) has a 2.45 ERA in seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. He also went
two for three and his RBI single in the sixth inning gave the
Cardinals a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Texas 0--Wade Miller, the Astros' opening-day starter,
improved to 2-0 in four starts since coming off the disabled list. He
sat out nearly three weeks because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He
yielded only three hits in seven innings at Houston, striking out
seven and walking one in his strongest outing of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 9, Toronto 3--Zach Day pitched three hitless innings of
relief to win in his major league debut, and Fernando Tatis homered
and drove in five runs at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Day (1-0), who celebrated his 24th birthday, came in during the
fourth after the Blue Jays took a 3-0 lead. Day was recalled from
triple-A Ottawa Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Milwaukee 2--Eric Milton retired the first nine
batters before Eric Young beat out a bunt to start the bottom of the
fourth inning after the Twins had taken a 4-0 lead. Milton (8-5), who
yielded five hits in eight innings, didn't allow a runner past first
base until Richie Sexson hit his 17th home run in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Baltimore 3--Scott Rolen's single drove in the
winning run in the bottom of the 10th inning. With two out, Pat
Burrell singled off Buddy Groom (2-2) and went to third on a single
by Doug Glanville. Rolen followed with a liner to right-center,
scoring Burrell.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Cleveland 4--Larry Walker hit a two-run homer to cap a
four-run seventh inning at Coors Field as the Rockies won for only
the third time in 12 games overall and the second time in seven
interleague games this season.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 3, Seattle 1--The Padres, who had won only four of their
last 15 games, ended an eight-game losing streak. Bobby Jones pitched
6 2/3 strong innings and the Padres won despite the top third of the
order going 0 for 12.</TE>

<LD>Victories have not been hard to come by for the six 3-year-old
geldings who will be getting together in tonight's feature, a $12,300
allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Between them, they have combined for 17 victories and 32
on-the-board finishes in 56 starts.</LD>
<LD>   The leader in victories is Watch This Injun, a Texas-bred son of
Invisible Injun who has won five of nine. Trained by Jaime Gomez,
Watch This Injun enters on a three-race roll. He began his streak
with a 14-1 upset on March 9, continued at 6-1 on April 7, then won
again at 3-1 on May 17. Rodrigo Aceves has been the jockey all along
and he remains tonight.</LD>
<TE>   After failing in his first two races, BW Old Smokey has rattled
off four consecutive victories for owner Rutilo Romero and trainer
Paul Jones. Ramon Sanchez will again ride the son of Pritzi Dash, who
will leave from post two.</TE>
<TE>   The other four entrants--Silent Dasher, Prouduino, Fly Home First
and One Dashing Mother--all have won twice.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Red Hot Racer. 2. BCR Grab The Cash. 3. Wired To
Win. 4. Wynhurst. 5. Truly Tia. 6. Malibu Princess. 7. KR Sir
Lopesalot. 8. Fly Home First. 9. Kacy Red.</TE>

<HD>Estes and Piazza Get In Their Shots</HD>
<DH>Interleague: Clemens doesn't get hit by a pitch in
anticipated matchup, but he gives up two homers and the Mets win,
8-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>About the only task the New York Mets didn't accomplish Saturday was
what should have been the easiest of all: hitting Roger Clemens with
a pitch.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Estes and Mike Piazza homered in successive innings as the
Mets paid back Clemens with long balls instead of beanballs, beating
the Yankees, 8-0, before a sellout crowd of 54,347 at Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "Hopefully, we can now just get down to playing baseball and we
can stop talking about the hype surrounding Clemens and Piazza," said
Estes, who wasn't even a Met when this feud began with Piazza getting
hit in the head nearly two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Estes (3-5) made only one mistake--if it was a mistake--throwing a
ball about a foot behind Clemens in his first at-bat, when many were
hoping he would get hit.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Mets starting the day in fourth place, getting a
needed win was as important as settling the score with Clemens.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what closure is," Piazza said. "We just wanted to go
out and win. We need to get back in the race."</TE>
<TE>   Estes struck out 11 in seven scoreless innings and answered the
question about whether he would help resolve a dispute that began
when he was with the San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   With the fans standing in anticipation of the showdown, Estes made
his intent clear on the first pitch--an 87-mph fastball that was
about a foot behind Clemens.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed my spot. I didn't execute my pitch," Estes deadpanned.
"You can draw your own conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Piazza could barely get a glove on the pitch that wasn't close to
its intended target, whether it was Clemens or the strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I never doubted Shawn being a good teammate," Piazza said. "Read
into that what you want. We protect each other."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens stepped out of the batter's box, smirked and touched the
bill of his helmet as he looked out toward Estes. Clemens, who struck
out, refused to talk about the pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees didn't retaliate, but whether that was because of the
umpires' warning or an effort to end the whole saga was unclear. What
was clear was the intent of the pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was intentional," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "If that was
what they felt they needed to do, then so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Plate umpire Wally Bell immediately issued a warning to both
teams. Met Manager Bobby Valentine looked frustrated over the missed
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody in the ballpark knew what was going on," Bell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Estes found a better way to hurt Clemens (8-3), hitting a two-run
homer in the fifth inning, setting off a loud roar from the crowd and
derisive chants of "Ro-ger! Ro-ger!"</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to gear up for a fastball," Estes said. "He throws
pretty hard. I just tried to catch up to it. I was pretty numb after
that."</TE>

<HD>Why They'll Win</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Superior coaching and defense are an unbeatable
combination this time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>There are reasons Mexico should beat the United States in Monday's
second-round World Cup encounter. Good reasons. Sound reasons.
Reasons that include history, tradition, momentum, motivation, form
and reputation.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, none of that has meant a plugged yen at this World
Cup--don't wave goodbye, Argentina--so forget all that. We need to
restart, retrench, scale back and return to the basics. At least
until the dart board clears customs.</LD>
<LD>   At this stage of a World Cup, when one mistake or one poor
decision can be the difference between advancement and elimination,
games usually hinge on three fundamentals: defense, coaching and
goalkeeping.</LD>
<TE>   Score it Mexico 2, USA 1.</TE>
<TE>   As good as Mexican goalkeeper Oscar Perez has been--he was the
most valuable player of the Croatia match and his off-the-line
scrambles left Italy muttering long into the Oita night--Brad Friedel
has ranked somewhere between savior and saint for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the Friedel highlight show has been a direct result of the
turnstile defense in front of him--this way, please, sir--and has
U.S. soccer fans now reassessing the national team careers of Alexi
Lalas and Mike Burns.</TE>
<TE>   To put it another way: Mexico has Rafael Marquez at the center of
its defense, the United States went with Jeff Agoos the first three
games until a calf injury sustained against Poland sidelined him for
the rest of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, the Mexican captain, plays professionally for the French
club Monaco, but not for much longer. Barcelona has been pursuing his
services for more than a year and, after his sterling performance in
the 1-1 draw against Italy, Serie A clubs figure to be lining up as
well.</TE>
<TE>   In three World Cup games, the Mexican defense has yielded only two
goals--as many as the Americans coughed up to Poland in the first
five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   As a tactician, Mexican Coach Javier Aguirre has proved to be more
adaptable and less stubborn than U.S. Coach Bruce Arena, who has done
well in prodding his flawed squad this far. But Arena's loyalty to
the outclassed Agoos has been indefensible, nearly costing the
Americans the second round with that one decision.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing Aguirre, he'd have switched to a different center back
long ago. Probably after the first day of training camp.</TE>

<HD>Papis Can't Defend Title in Portland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Max Papis will not defend his G.I. Joe's 200 title and will try to
catch on with another team if struggling employer Sigma Autosport
can't come up with adequate funding.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very frustrated, because I'm a professional person and I'm
very precise in what I do," he said Saturday. "I have not committed
myself to end up in this situation, and this is what upsets me."</LD>
<LD>   Sigma's withdrawal leaves CART with a season-low 18 cars for
today's race in Portland, Ore. It's another public embarrassment for
the series, which has lost TV ratings and sponsorship dollars to the
rival Indy Racing League.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course we're not happy about it," CART spokesman Adam Saal
said. "I don't think there's any way you can put a positive light on
this, other than to say the season's not over, and we're going to do
what we can to help get this team back on track."</TE>
<TE>   Papis said team owner Tom Wieringa has "promised us that he's
going to try to put things back together" for the Grand Prix of
Chicago on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   But Papis said that if Sigma cannot remain viable, he would try to
drive for someone else, as Scott Dixon did when PWR Championship
Racing folded earlier this year and Dixon was hired by Chip Ganassi.</TE>
<TE>   Wieringa said he's seeking more sponsorship money and plans on
competing in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Papis is seventh in the series standings despite Sigma's
season-long troubles. The team has only one car, with no backup, and
limited spare parts.</TE>
<TE>   Papis knew before the season began that he was signing on with a
low-budget team, but said he didn't realize Sigma was so deeply in
debt. The team reportedly owes several manufacturers, but the most
prominent is Cosworth Racing, which leases engines to Sigma. The
bills were so high that Cosworth pulled the plug.</TE>
<TE>   CART has been helping where it can, asking vendors to cut Sigma
some slack. But as a public company, CART says it's not in a position
to lend financial assistance to one of its teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't turn on the faucet of funding for every team," Saal
said. "We've known that Sigma's been struggling financially all year,
and it eventually caught up with them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Cristiano da Matta went the first 64 races of his CART
career without a pole, he'll start from the top spot for the second
time in eight days.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who won last week's Monterey Grand Prix from the pole,
turned the fastest lap in qualifying for the G.I. Joe's 200. His
Toyota-powered Lola circled the Portland International Raceway road
course in 58.679 seconds at 120.8 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Brack will start second, followed by his Ganassi teammate
Bruno Junqueira. Alex Tagliani vastly improved his position during
the session, going from 10th-fastest to seventh and finally fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gil de Ferran edged Penske teammate Helio Castroneves to win the
pole position for the Radisson 225 Indy Racing League event at
Fountain, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran, one of only four drivers to win consecutive CART
championships, turned a qualifying lap of 177.998 mph to earn his
second pole of the season. Castroneves, winner of the last two Indy
500s and the IRL's season points leader, was second at 177.950 mph,
followed by Felipe Giaffone at 177.938.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rain forced the suspension of the NASCAR Busch Series Kroger
300 race with Greg Biffle leading after 86 of 200 laps. The race was
scheduled to resume this morning at 10 a.m. PDT.</TE>
<TE>   The event was delayed at 6:10 p.m. PDT as a 20-minute downpour and
lightning descended on Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, sending most of
the track-record crowd of 71,299 fans scurrying for shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Officials worked for more than 90 minutes to dry the track, but
another lengthy shower forced the suspension of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Bodine, who qualified to run in today's Winston Cup race at
Michigan Speedway, will stay and finish the race in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Compton and Joe Nemechek will head to Michigan as planned,
with David Reutimann taking over for Compton and Mark Green subbing
for Nemechek.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle, looking for his second victory of the season, passed Jason
Keller on the backstretch on lap 74 to take his first lead of the
race. Keller was second when the race was stopped, followed by
brothers Jay and Tim Sauter.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Scott Riggs led the first 35 laps, but gradually dropped
back and was 14th at the time of the suspension.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Boy, that was fun, around here, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   It was OK everywhere else, too, until the final eight days, which
was all the time it took the Lakers to close out the New Jersey Nets
in what looked like, and turned out to be, the annual Foregone
Conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   Positives included a thrilling postseason (until then) and robust
TV ratings (ditto), which suggested David Stern's league was back (or
half of it, anyway).</LD>
<TE>   Also, a worthy challenger to the Lakers arose. Unfortunately for
Stern, it was in the West, too.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, East-West imbalances are cyclical, Stern noted last
week for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen it before, whether it's the Celtics or the Bulls,"
he said. " ... I think that these things have a way of evening
themselves out over time. I think over the last 20 years, I think
we're 10-10, East and West. So see us in 20 years and we'll see how
it works out."</TE>
<TE>   Trust me, in 20 years, I'll have better things to worry about,
like seeing what else is on TV if the NBA Finals are still only
ceremonial.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the East leads the West, 11-9, over the last 20 years,
but we haven't seen anything this one-sided since the Boston Celtics
were plowing the Lakers under annually in the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls won five titles in a row
from 1989 to 1993, losing only six postseason games during that run.
However, the '89 series went four games after Byron Scott and Magic
Johnson went out with hamstring pulls.</TE>
<TE>   The '92 series was 2-2 before the Bulls won Game 5 in Portland.
Then the Trail Blazers took a 15-point lead into the fourth quarter
of Game 6, looking as if they would force a Game 7, until the Bulls
rallied.</TE>
<TE>   In '93, the Bulls' Jim Paxson had to make a dramatic,
series-winning three-point basket with three seconds left to keep the
Phoenix Suns from forcing a Game 7 on their court.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four Finals, the West is 16-4 with East teams winning
1-2-1-0. The only East team to win two was the Indiana Pacers in
2000, after the Lakers went up, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't the numbers, however. The problem is that most
of the best big men have gone West and more may follow soon.</TE>
<TE>   More and more, East general managers say they don't need much size
since no one else in the conference has much, either, and if they can
make the Finals, anything can happen, etc ...</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that winds up happening is Shaquille O'Neal
stepping on their champion, not that that seems to be deterring them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the two best East centers are available and may be snatched
up by desperate West teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia 76ers are open to moving Dikembe Mutombo, who's
36 and makes $17 million a year through 2005, when he'll be 39. The
Miami Heat is shopping Alonzo Mourning, a 2003 free agent. The
likeliest takers may be Portland's Paul Allen and Dallas' Mark Cuban,
who have beaucoup money and nada concerns about the luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, as East GMs also note, that Shaq, who casts a huge
shadow over the West, as well as the East, distorts the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille, he's a whole other ball game," Kobe Bryant said last
week. "He's a whole other problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, if you're talking about [the East finding] big guys to
contend with some of the other players that we have in the Western
Conference, that's one thing. I think that will happen. But if you're
talking about Shaquille, you're not going to find players in the
West, East, North or South. Doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Says Celtic GM Chris Wallace: "I don't know who out there can
compete with him. He's sort of like a weather phenomenon. You have to
wait until it passes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, who says the Big Storm won't last two or three more
Finals?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see what becomes possible (reseed the final four, anyone?)
if ABC gets stuck with another walkover with a 10.2 rating next
spring.</TE>
<TE>   (Oh, Minnesota, which finished fifth in the West, has applied to
go East for the 2003-04 season when New Orleans is expected to join
the West. The Timberwolves had a .714 winning percentage, compared to
the Nets' .648, against common opponents in the East this season,
suggesting they are as good as anyone over there.)</TE>
<TE>   Not that a bad Finals rating is all-important now, since Stern
just sold his TV rights for six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   There were rumbles his owners were unhappy (with the old and new
deals back-loaded, TV revenue goes down next season) but coming off
down seasons in the midst of an advertising drought, Stern did some
amazing sleight of hand to keep from taking a major cut, let alone
get a raise.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a bad Finals rating shapes insiders' perceptions,
which spread in a ripple effect.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if Steve Grubbs of the PHD ad agency is telling
USA Today's Rudy Martzke, "NBC is saying we made a good decision to
get out," that probably isn't very good for your league.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the NBA is doing OK. The collective bargaining agreement
has three years to run and looks better all the time as unrest mounts
in baseball and hockey, where owners won few salary constraints the
last time.</TE>
<TE>   Stern went through rain and fire to get his contract, which looks
as though it will remain the basis of future deals, even if the union
leadership keeps acting as if it wants to rumble, going to
arbitration on one thing after another.</TE>
<TE>   However, the union members seem fine with a system that gives
stars $100-million deals and veterans $1-million minimums. Compared
to the NFL's hard cap, the NBA deal is player-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   The union now rumbles about collusion as owners pull up at the
projected $52.5-million luxury tax threshold, but that's $10 million
over the agreed-to salary cap. Add in the fact the Trail Blazers and
New York Knicks have $80 million-plus payrolls and good luck in
court. Of course, it's not easy being commish. Stern's pet project,
the WNBA, just bit his hand, threatening labor action with union head
Pam Wheeler insisting her players want their "fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, their league has been in the red from day one, so their
fair share is zero.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I've got anything against the WNBA. It's just that
neither Stern nor the players can accept it for what the market says
it is.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt and second-seeded Tim Henman will meet in
the final of the Queen's Club grass-court championship at London for
the second year in a row after overcoming stubborn opposition
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt advanced with a 7-6 (5), 6-3 victory over Sjeng Schalken,
and Henman defeated Raemon Sluiter, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, the defending champion, is the first player since John
McEnroe to reach the Queen's final for three consecutive years.
McEnroe reached five consecutive finals between 1979 and 1983,
winning the first three.</LD>
<TE>   Hewitt failed to convert two break points in the second game of
the second set, but a netted forehand gave him the only break of the
match for a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't bad," Hewitt said. "There's still room for improvement,
but I haven't dropped a set all week so far so I can't complain. He
was hitting well from the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a perfect preparation for Wimbledon for me. I've had four
tough matches so far and I'm going to have to play even better if I'm
going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Henman was forced to fight back from a set and a break down to
overcome the 81st-ranked Sluiter, who troubled him with big service
returns and winning volleys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Kiefer charged back in the third set to beat Roger Federer
and advance to the final of the Gerry Weber Open at Halle, Germany.
Kiefer, who also beat Pete Sampras at the Wimbledon warmup, rallied
to win, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very unhappy with my performance, I know I can play a lot
better," Federer said.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer will play Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who reached his first final
of the year by defeating Kenneth Carlsen, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer, ranked fourth in the world two years ago before he dropped
to 66th, has struggled to a 4-16 record this year before the
grass-court event.</TE>
<TE>   "I beat two of the best grass-court players, I think," Kiefer
said. "I think I'm on the best way to get back to where I once was."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jelena Dokic beat Lisa Raymond, 6-1, 7-5, to advance to
the final of the DFS Classic grass-court tournament at Birmingham,
England.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic will face Anastasia Myskina, who advanced with a 6-3, 7-5
victory over Nicole Pratt.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic lost to the 20-year-old Myskina on clay in Rome earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed with the way I played against Myskina in
Rome. I wasn't physically or mentally as good as I am now, so I am
looking forward to the final," Dokic said. "It is very important for
me to win this final and go to Eastbourne next week before Wimbledon.
It would be a good time to get my first tournament win on grass."</TE>

<TE>   Anna Smashnova beat local favorite Patricia Wartusch, 6-3, 6-2, to
reach the final of the WTA Wien Energie Grand Prix at Vienna,
rallying from an 0-3 deficit in the first set and winning 12 of the
match's final 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Smashnova will face defending champion Iroda Tulyaganova in the
final. Tulyaganova beat Petra Mandula, 6-0, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   Defensive end Regan Upshaw, the Oakland Raiders' sacks leader last
season, will sit out the season after tearing a ligament in his right
knee during a mini-camp.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam of Upshaw's knee revealed the tear in his anterior
cruciate ligament, Coach Bill Callahan said Saturday at the close of
the Raiders' three-day camp. Upshaw, a seven-year veteran in his
third season with Oakland, was injured during a drill Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Eighth-seeded Mike Lambert of Honolulu and Lee LeGrande of Hermosa
Beach upset the top-seeded team of Stein Metzger of Honolulu and
Kevin Wong of Hermosa Beach, 21-15, 23-21, 15-13, in the
quarterfinals of the AVP Michelob Light Santa Barbara Open.</TE>
<TE>   In another upset, Albert Hanneman of Torrance and Jeff Nygaard of
Los Angeles, who won last week's AVP event at Hermosa Beach, were
eliminated from the tournament after losing to Karch Kiraly of San
Clemente and Brent Doble of Capistrano Beach, 21-10, 21-13.</TE>
<TE>   In other quarterfinal matches, sixth-seeded Eduardo Bacil of El
Segundo and Frederico Souza of Rio de Janiero defeated third-seeded

25-23, 21-18, and second-seeded Eric Fonoimoana of Hermosa Beach and
Dax Holdren of Santa Barbara beat 10th-seeded Adam Jewell of San Juan
Capistrano and Colin Smith of Hermosa Beach, 21-16, 21-9.</TE>

quarterfinals of second-seeded Barbra Fontana of Manhattan Beach and

<TE>   The paper said Olausson, who won the Stanley Cup for the first
time with the Red Wings last week, will sign a two-year contract with
Farjestad on July 1.</TE>

<LD>Adam Dunn hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning as the
Cincinnati Reds played long ball and rallied to beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 4-3, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Giles and Craig Wilson hit solo shots that put the Pirates
ahead before a long rain delay in the fifth inning, but Dunn's homer
completed a four-run rally that allowed the Reds to extend their
50-day hold on first place.</LD>
<LD>   In each of the first two games of the series, the NL Central
leaders have relied on home runs to come from behind and retain their
one-game lead over St. Louis. They've been in first place since April

<HD>Saarloos Begins Major Transitions, On and Off the Field</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Saarloos is about to complete a significant double play. Today,
the former Cal State Fullerton right-hander gets married in Seattle.
On Tuesday, he makes his major league debut for the Houston Astros in
Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   A whirlwind couple of days to be sure. But that's par for the
course for Saarloos, who has sprinted through the minor leagues after
being taken in the third round of the 2001 amateur draft.</LD>
<LD>   After working out of the bullpen to begin his college and
professional careers, Saarloos has emerged as a top-notch starter
this season. He won his 10th straight decision Tuesday for double-A
Round Rock (Texas), yielding two runs--one earned--while striking out
six in eight innings in a 5-2 victory over Shreveport.</LD>
<TE>   The outing ended Saarloos' consecutive scoreless innings streak at
48 1/3--the longest streak in the minors since 1995--but earned him a
promotion to triple-A New Orleans. Or so he thought.</TE>
<TE>   Plans changed Thursday when Houston pitcher Shane Reynolds had
surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his lower back and learned he
would sit out the rest of the season. Saarloos was tabbed to replace
Reynolds after going 10-1 with a 1.40 earned-run average in 13 starts
for Round Rock.</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos, 23, will join a "Twentysomething" Astro rotation that
includes Wade Miller, 25; Roy Oswalt, 24; Tim Redding, 24, and Carlos
Hernandez, 22. Hernandez, like Saarloos, is a rookie, and Oswalt and
Redding are in their first full seasons in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Astro fans may be surprised to learn that Saarloos' fastball tops
out in the mid-80s. He gets outs by locating his fastball, changing
speeds and keeping hitters off balance.</TE>
<TE>   In other news from around the nation:</TE>
<TE>   * Doctors treating Tampa Bay Devil Ray prospect Nick Bierbrodt's
gunshot wounds say the former Long Beach Millikan standout was lucky
to survive an altercation last week outside a restaurant in
Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The two bullets missed Bierbrodt's aorta by millimeters and failed
to damage any major organs or blood vessels. The Charleston RiverDog
pitcher was released from the hospital Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the possibilities, [the bullets] missed a lot of important
structures that could have killed him or put him in a
not-even-reach-the-hospital situation," David Cole, chief of general
surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina, told Tampa
Bay-area reporters. "If he was hit in the aorta, his chances of
survival would have been significantly less."</TE>
<TE>   Bierbrodt was shot June 7 while sitting in a taxicab in the
drive-through line at a fast-food restaurant. Witnesses said a young
man on a bicycle shot Bierbrodt after a verbal exchange about the
bicyclist's rap music. No arrest has been made.</TE>
<TE>   Bierbrodt, 24, is expected to resume his career as early as next
season.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Burbank High and College of the Canyons shortstop Freddy
Sanchez extended his hitting streak to 24 games, the longest in the
minors this season, by going two for three Wednesday for Trenton
(N.J.) of the double-A Eastern League. Sanchez, 24, is batting .336
with a league-leading 82 hits in his third pro season. He took
consecutive nights off Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Angels' System</TE>
<TE>   Joe Saunders, selected 12th overall in last week's draft, stopped
by Edison Field on Monday to take in the Angels' interleague game
against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-year-old left-hander from Virginia Tech received a warm
ovation when he was shown on the giant television screen in right
field during an interview with Fox Sports Net, but he later said he
preferred to stay out of the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really nerve-racking," said Saunders, who signed for
$1.825 million. "I'm one of the shy types. But this is the fun part.
I'll get to the work a little later."</TE>
<TE>   Saunders is expected to report this weekend to the Angels'
rookie-level club in Provo, Utah, where he will attempt to add
velocity to two-seam and four-seam fastballs that have been clocked
as high as 94 mph. Saunders, 9-2 this season with a 2.86 ERA and 102
strikeouts in 97 2/3 innings, also throws a changeup and a slider.</TE>
<TE>   * Mike Kibler, the "Mr. Shucks" mascot for the Angels' Class A
affiliate in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has resigned in the wake of a May 31
altercation with Kernel Manager Todd Claus.</TE>
<TE>   After a victory over South Bend that completed a four-game sweep,
Kibler, dressed as the corncob mascot, danced onto the field waving a
broom. Claus, offended that the mascot was exhibiting poor
sportsmanship, demanded that Kibler hand over the broom. When Kibler
refused, Claus reportedly put him in a headlock, snatched the broom
and snapped it in half.</TE>
<TE>   Kibler resigned two days later, telling the Cedar Rapids Gazette
that he was already thinking about leaving because of time
constraints with his regular job and his family. The following day,
Kibler and Claus exchanged apologies.</TE>
<TE>   * Francisco Rodriguez struck out a combined six of seven batters
he faced in saving one-run wins on consecutive nights earlier this
week for double-A Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers' System</TE>
<TE>   Vero Beach right-hander Ben Diggins struck out a season-high 10 in
six scoreless relief innings Tuesday in a 5-3 victory over Class A
Florida State League rival Sarasota. The Dodgers' first-round pick in
2000, Diggins is 5-2 with a 1.20 ERA in his last seven appearances.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   Now that the league's first-half titles have been clinched--San
Bernardino has wrapped up the Southern Division, Stockton the
Northern Division--players can focus on more leisurely pursuits, such
as the impending four-day All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   But there will be little rest for the league's elite players, who
will travel to Wilmington, Del., for an All-Star game Tuesday between
the California and Carolina leagues. The series is tied at 2-2-1 (the
inaugural game, in 1996, was called after 10 innings with the score
tied). The California League won last year's game, 7-5, in Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield has five players on the California League roster, more
than any other team. Three players who were selected to appear by the
league's managers and general managers have already been promoted,
including Stockton left-hander John Koronka. The Cincinnati Red
prospect is now pitching for double-A Chattanooga (Tenn.), where he
is 1-1 with a 3.65 ERA in two starts.</TE>
<TE>   * Bakersfield right-hander Evan Rust converted his 15th
consecutive save opportunity Thursday and has 22 saves on the season,
most in the minors. Rust's set-up man, John Benedetti, has thrown 27
1/3 consecutive scoreless innings, the longest streak in the league
this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Lake Elsinore third baseman Danny Bravo became the fifth minor
leaguer to hit for the cycle this season when he went four for four
with a walk Sunday in a 16-6 win over Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   * Lancaster ended a 19-game losing streak against North Division
opponents June 5 with a victory over Stockton.</TE>

<HD>Leading Question</HD>
<DH>Golf: Woods sees his margin trimmed to two shots before two
late birdies give him a four-shot edge over Garcia, who will be his
playing partner today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods started Saturday's third round of the 102nd U.S. Open
with a three-shot lead and pushed the lead to four by day's end.</LD>
<LD>   So how come it felt as though Woods had given others hope as he
gave away shots?</LD>
<LD>   Here's why:</LD>
<TE>   On a day when Woods might have closed escrow on his eighth major
deal, a day when 44-year-old Nick Faldo shot a four-under-par 66 and
a day when Bethpage Black turned from foreboding to forgiving, Woods
only slightly improved what had seemed a choke-hold and needed two
fist-pumping birdies late in his round to keep the wheels on his bus.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say he didn't answer the call when he needed to.</TE>
<TE>   As a gaggle of golfers put red scores on the leaderboard,
shrinking a legendary leader's lead to two shots at one point, Woods
responded with his only birdies of the day at Nos. 15 and 17 to put
some space between himself and the field.</TE>
<TE>   After shooting par 70, Woods starts play today at five under with
a 54-hole total of 205, four shots ahead of Sergio Garcia, who shot
67 and stands at 209.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson, who crept to within two shots of Woods at one
point after trailing by 10 on the front nine, finished with a 67. He
and Jeff Maggert, who also shot 67, are five shots behind Woods at
210.</TE>
<TE>   Three players, Robert Allenby, Billy Mayfair and Padraig
Harrington, stand six shots back at 211.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Woods began the third round with a three-shot lead
over Harrington and seven shots over four other players.</TE>
<TE>   Amazing what can happen when it stops raining.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson trailed Woods by eight shots after 36 holes; now he's
down by only five.</TE>
<TE>   A word of caution to those who think they made up some ground on
Woods, if only psychologically. He has seven times taken the lead
into the final round of a major championship and won all seven.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that you have to hang around," he said. "Even though I was
two over for most of the day, I still had the lead. They had to come
and get me."</TE>
<TE>   The chase continues.</TE>
<TE>   After Woods finally sank a birdie putt on the par-four 15th, he
slammed his putter into his golf bag.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' emotions?</TE>
<TE>   "Finally," he related later. "It took me 15 holes to make a
birdie. When I threw the putter down in the bag, I was kind of
celebrating there."</TE>
<TE>   Today's final round won't be without drama. Garcia made up three
shots on Woods with his 67 and ended the day in second place, meaning
he will be paired with Woods for the final 18 holes.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia and Woods are not what you would call fast friends, and
Garcia did not endear himself further by making New York tabloid
headlines with his suggestions that Woods is a lucky golfer and that
the USGA would have stopped play Friday had Woods been forced to play
in the monsoon conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he regretted the comments and tried to make amends.</TE>
<TE>   "I left a note this morning on his locker, just telling him that I
didn't mean anything bad about him," Garcia said of Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he had not yet received Garcia's note but does not
anticipate playing with the Spaniard will be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awfully nice for him to do that, first of all, for him to
leave a note like that," Woods said. "That shows me a lot. Tomorrow
is going to be a lot of fun. I'm excited about going out there and
playing with him."</TE>
<TE>   Was Woods upset at Garcia's comments?</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't angry at all," he said. "Because I knew that Sergio is a
very emotional player and he was obviously frustrated at the way he
played. And on top of that, the conditions weren't exactly easy
either."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect much conversation between the players on the course
today, although both anticipate a raucous reception from the loudest
galleries anyone can remember at a golf major.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia took the brunt of catcalls Friday, at one point making an
obscene gesture at a fan who had screamed at him.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, it was Woods who backed off of a shot on the 16th
fairway and shouted "Come on!" to one heckler.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with fans showing enthusiasm, just as long
as they're respectful," Woods said. "And sometimes the fans have
crossed the line, and that's unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, today's final round isn't only the Sergio vs. Tiger
Show.</TE>
<TE>   After starting with three bogeys on his first five holes,
Mickelson went on a strong run, making three consecutive birdies on
the front nine to go out in 34 and then shooting 33 on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Woods and Garcia, Mickelson seemed to pick up energy from
the crowd as he mounted his charge.</TE>
<TE>   When Mickelson drained a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-three 17th
to go one under and pull within two shots of Woods, the crowd had
clearly thrown its support for the underdog.</TE>
<TE>   "When that one went in, there seemed to be a lot of people around
the 17th green," said Mickelson, who turns 32 today. "It was a really
cool feeling."</TE>
<TE>   When Mickelson, still searching for his first major title, rolled
in his putt on 17, Woods was still two over for the day, muddling
along three holes behind at the par-three 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Woods would make par there to remain at three under at about the
same time Garcia had moved to one under with a birdie putt on No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Woods sensed the momentum swing and knew players were gaining on
him.</TE>
<TE>   Like a good fighter, he answered a punch with a counterpunch. He
made birdie on the par-four 15th, the most difficult hole at Bethpage
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the other players made a run and played some great
rounds of golf out there in the U.S. Open, I look at the leaderboard
and actually increased my lead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson let a shot get away when he closed with bogey at No. 18,
the result of hitting his tee shot, a two-iron, into the rough.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of three rounds, no one has tamed Tiger yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I thoroughly enjoy it," he said. "I love to compete. And being in
the final group in the final round of a major championship that's
where you want to be, that's the thrill of it."</TE>

<HD>Faldo Turns Back Clock With Best Open Round: 66</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A day after shooting six over par and grousing about this year's U.S.
Open course conditions, Nick Faldo answered Saturday with a 66.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a 44-year-old man who got into the tournament on an
exemption, huh?</LD>
<LD>   "That was as good as my heyday, that really was," said Faldo, who
has won six major titles, three Masters and three British Opens. "I
hit so many solid shots, that was as good as 10 years ago."</LD>
<TE>   The 66 was the lowest round Faldo has ever shot at the U.S. Open
and it left him with a 54-hole total of 212, seven shots behind
leader Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Faldo's best finish at a U.S. Open was second, in 1988. He
finished tied for 72nd last year.</TE>
<TE>   Faldo's day was in stark contrast to Friday's rain-soaked second
round, when he shot 76 at Bethpage Black.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to keep reminding myself: I am a golfer," Faldo said
Friday. "This is golf. This is not fighting in the jungle. If we had
a 15th club, it would be a machete or a grenade launcher."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia suggested Friday the U.S. Golf Assn. would have
stopped second-round play on the rain-drenched fields of Bethpage
Black had Woods been on the course.</TE>
<TE>   Woods played through a steady rain in the morning, shot two-under
68, and got out before the course really started to get waterlogged.</TE>
<TE>   So, does Garcia's favoritism argument about Woods hold water?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I can assure you, that's not true," Tom Meeks, the USGA
Senior Director of Rules and Competitions, said.</TE>
<TE>   Meeks did say he was very concerned about casual water on the
course and said that play was almost suspended after he was told
puddles of water had gathered close to the 17th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first time I heard it," Meeks said. "Right then I did
feel like we might be close to shutting it down for a while. No
sooner was that said than the squeegee crew was over cleaning it up,
and all of a sudden I don't hear any more calls from that area."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More spillover from Friday, with the emphasis on spill: Several
golfers were upset the USGA did not move forward tee boxes on the
10th and 12th, the two longest par-four holes at Bethpage.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the rain, golfers were getting almost no roll on the
fairway.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour will often adjust tee boxes, but that is not the
policy of the USGA, which has jurisdiction at the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done that," Meeks said. "I hope
we never do. Because we set the golf course up for a U.S. Open the
way we thought it should be played to test the best players in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   The par-four 10th hole is 492 yards, while the 12th, at 499 yards,
is the longest par-four in U.S. Open history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite the complaints, neither of those holes played the
most difficult Saturday. That distinction went to the par-four 15th,
at 479 yards, which yielded an average score of 4.781.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th hole ranked fourth most difficult at 4.619 while the 12th
was fifth at 4.594.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's scoring average ended up at 76.47.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Saturday's scoring average was 72.06.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA, in fact, did alter some tee boxes slightly for
Saturday's round, but Meeks said, "It wasn't anything out of the
ordinary. It was insignificant."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh, who made Friday's cut by one shot, showed up Saturday
and massaged a 67 out of Bethpage Black, indicating it would be a
good day to shoot a low score.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said the second round was one of the worst weather days he
has experienced on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought that plus-10 was going to make it, really, but
I'm glad I made it and I'm glad I played today," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the course was not nearly as difficult Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like it never rained," he said. "The greens are very,
very receptive."</TE>
<TE>   The forecast for today is cloudy with scattered showers and a
chance of thunderstorms late in the day, which isn't the best
possible news. The reason is that the USGA is shooting for a 7:40
p.m. EDT finish--the latest ever--to satisfy NBC, which wants as much
of the golf as possible to inch closer to prime time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Headline news: The New York Daily News and the New York Post had
the same headline in Saturday's editions: Reign Man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Qualifier Andy Miller, the son of NBC commentator Johnny Miller,
shot a five-over 75 and said that wasn't too bad.</TE>
<TE>   "You can shoot five over so fast on this golf course, it's not
even funny," he said. "Five over is not a terrible score."</TE>

<HD>Aguirre Fast Becomes Mexico's Miracle Cure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>There was Javier Aguirre, surrounded by Americans again.</LD>
<LD>   They were peppering him with questions, armed with their notepads
and tape recorders, waiting impatiently for Aguirre's thoughts on
Mexico's surprising 1-1 draw with Italy to be translated into
English.</LD>
<LD>   Long before Aguirre became coach of Mexico's World Cup team, he
played for the Los Angeles Aztecs of the old North American Soccer
League. He knows his way around an English phrasebook. He can speak
the language, seasoning it with nuances and a sense of humor, but he
goes out of his way to avoid it. To Aguirre, the native tongue is a
point of Mexican pride, so he sits back and keeps the Spanish
flowing.</LD>
<TE>   He was in a good mood, having watched his team, underappreciated
by the international media, come within five minutes of toppling
mighty Italy. Spotting a familiar face in the audience, an American
writer who has been following the Mexican team across Japan, Aguirre
interrupted the interview to hustle over from the microphone and
playfully poke the press credential hanging from the reporter's neck.</TE>
<TE>   "See," Aguirre said, in English, with a mischievous smile, "it is
important now to know how to speak Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: Mexico's soccer team has become a very big story. See
you Yanks in the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre's toothy grin has become the new face of Mexican soccer.
On the job for barely a year, Aguirre inherited a team in disarray
and a fan base in despair, and has turned everything around.</TE>
<TE>   On the fields of Niigata and Miyagi and Oita, Mexicans are
outworking Croatians, outscoring Ecuadoreans, outplaying Italians.</TE>
<TE>   In the stadium aisles, Mexicans are singing and dancing and making
travel plans for el gran partido with the United States on Monday in
Korea, taking this Asian getaway to places previously unimagined.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre made his debut as Mexico's coach on July 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The opponent: the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre knew it was win or bust. "This game is life and death for
my future and for Mexican soccer," said Aguirre, who is given to such
melodramatic pronouncements, before the match.</TE>
<TE>   Making sure his players got the message, Aguirre spent the match
prowling the sideline, waving his arms, screaming, cursing at the
referee and players from both sides. U.S. Coach Bruce Arena called it
"the worst behavior I've ever seen from a coach--in college or
professional."</TE>
<TE>   But Aguirre had made his point, and his team had earned three.
Mexico won, 1-0, to jump-start a 4-0-1 closing run that clinched a
World Cup berth on the last day of qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre, a tenacious defensive midfielder on Mexico's 1986 World
Cup quarterfinalist, was a national hero. The team's improbable
comeback bought him two important commodities: time and leverage.
Aguirre fashions himself as something of a soccer psychologist,
motivating his players by pushing the right mental and emotional
buttons.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked a lot on the mental attitude of the Mexican players,"
Aguirre said. "Mexico has always had very good players. But sometimes
they are weak up here."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre pointed to his head.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in Japan in late May, Aguirre took his
psychological studies out in the field. He rattled the Croatians by
insulting them, calling them old and living on four-year-old
achievements. He flattered the Ecuadoreans, saying he feared them.
Against Italy, he played on his players' egos, riling them by
challenging them not to settle for a good-enough tie--to try instead
to steal an unprecedented victory from the Italians, who had
emotional and psychological issues of their own.</TE>
<TE>   For two games, Aguirre worked the room to perfection. But after
victories over Croatia and Ecuador, Aguirre gained a new insight into
the mind of the Mexican soccer player.</TE>
<TE>   With his team a surprising 2-0, on top of the group and gathering
momentum, Aguirre spent the last two days before the Italy match
holding news conferences to refute claims in the Mexican media of
player unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Cuauhtemoc Blanco, the team's offensive catalyst and
high-maintenance forward, stormed off the field and refused to join
his teammates' post-victory celebration because Aguirre had replaced
him with a defender in the last minute of the Ecuador game.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Palencia, who, like Blanco, plays in the elite Spanish
First Division, was so upset by his lack of playing time that he
refused to wear the same warmup attire as the rest of the Mexican
team before the Ecuador game.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper Esto reported that Aguirre and Blanco recently
appeared together on Mexican television and spent the entire
interview avoiding each other's glance. When the interviewer asked
Aguirre if it were "true that you aren't speaking to each other?"
Aguirre simply replied, alluding to Blanco, "Ask him."</TE>
<TE>   Blanco: "No [we aren't] ... no."</TE>
<TE>   The most important game of Aguirre's coaching career was hours
away. Handling the media the same way he draws up a game plan,
Aguirre quickly counterattacked.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are just suspicions and none of them are correct," he said
of the talk of player dissent. He said he didn't "know if there are
unhappy players, because no one has told me anything. Everyone on
this team has a relevant role to play. There's no one who is above
any other. I'd like to give minutes to everyone if it were possible."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre's preference of Jared Borgetti, erratic during pre-Cup
tuneup matches, over the flashier Palencia did appear a curious move.
Blanco and Palencia linked well during those same buildup matches.
Yet Aguirre started Borgetti in all three group games, relegating
Palencia to minimal reserve duty.</TE>
<TE>   When Borgetti missed an open net early in the Croatia game,
Aguirre's tactic seemed all the shakier. But in the second half,
Borgetti's back-heeled pass sprung Blanco, who was taken down in the
box for the game-deciding penalty. Against Ecuador, Borgetti volleyed
in the tying goal. And against Italy, Borgetti scored the only goal
through 85 minutes--beating the revered Paolo Maldini for the header
that nearly sunk the Italians.</TE>
<TE>   "The 11 who are playing are getting results," Mexico's captain,
Rafael Marquez, noted. The point was hard to argue. "There are no
doubts about that," Marquez added. "The best thing to do is support
them."</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose Monday, Aguirre is in his final weeks as coach of the
Mexican national team. He has agreed to coach the Spanish club
Osasuna this fall, returning to the team for which he once played.</TE>
<TE>   Just don't tell him he has taken Mexico as far as it can go.</TE>
<TE>   "The players have yet to give me the performance I want," he said.
"We have come a long way in a short space of time. But I know once we
play for the full 90 minutes, we will do even better."</TE>

<DH>Staying in the background is just fine for Sam Sampras, who
never wanted to be a typical Tennis Dad</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was two years ago, as his son climbed over chairs and people to
reach him high in the stands at Wimbledon, that Sam Sampras showed
the sports world that this father knew best.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, nothing of the sort was crossing his mind. Proving
things to people, showing the world this or that, could not be
further from the intentions or personality of this quiet, shy man who
handed Pete Sampras his first tennis racket in Potomac, Md., in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   Pete was 5, and the racket mostly swatted balls against basement
walls then. Never did Sam Sampras think, or even care, that 24 years
later, he would share this moment in an international spotlight with
that now-grown little boy, who had just established himself, by the
nature of the 13th Grand Slam event title he had just won, as the
greatest male player in the history of the game.</LD>
<TE>   Nor, at that moment, was Sam Sampras even thinking about any sort
of validation for how he and wife Georgia, as parents of a
world-class tennis player, had raised their son and stayed out of his
way as he grew up and grew successful. In the world of tennis, Sam
Sampras is the antithesis of the pushy parent. When the bright lights
turn on, Sam turns away.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Pete who was playing, Pete who deserved the credit," Sam
Sampras says now.</TE>
<TE>   That Sam would say anything in a public forum is noteworthy. Never
before had he submitted to a lengthy interview on a topic about which
he seems less than comfortable. Himself.</TE>
<TE>   There was something about it being for Father's Day that made it
all right this time, just as there was something about Wimbledon in
2000 that made it all right for him to say yes to getting on a plane
and flying to England in time for the historic match against Patrick
Rafter. This wasn't the first time that Pete had invited Sam to come
see him play, but it was only the second Grand Slam final he had seen
in person, and Pete had won 11 others.</TE>
<TE>   The Sampras parental recalcitrance became legendary after Pete won
his first Grand Slam event, the U.S. Open, in 1990. Stories later
told of how Sam and Georgia had walked around a Long Beach mall while
Pete was playing and finally, unable to stand it anymore, stopped at
a bank of TVs and asked the salesman who was winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just too nervous," Sam says. "That's why we don't go and
watch much. It's just too hard. Only if you are a parent can you
really understand that. Watching is excruciating."</TE>
<TE>   But the quest for the magic 13th Grand Slam event title, topping
Roy Emerson's long-standing mark, was such tennis history that, this
time, pain of parenting took a back seat to pride of parenting. Sam
and Georgia flew to Wimbledon just in time for the final and agonized
with the rest of the sports world as their son somehow turned things
around from a set down and 1-4 in the second-set tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he was at match point on his own serve.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Pete Sampras stepped to the service line, and started
the famous rocking motion that has unleashed several thousand aces in
his 15-year career, TV analyst John McEnroe leaned to the microphone
in the broadcast booth and set it up perfectly for the millions
watching: "History, folks," McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   The serve that had battered Rafter all day kicked into him one
more time, and when the return drifted wide, Sampras raised his arms
high in joy and relief.</TE>
<TE>   And soon, with uncharacteristic emotion, Pete Sampras scanned the
crowd, found his parents and began his climb. The photographers,
ready when he got there, captured the hugs and tears. It was the most
public of private family moments, one for both the tennis history
books and the Sampras family scrapbook.</TE>
<TE>   For Sam Sampras, the thoughts and emotions ran wild.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was coming to see me," Sam says. "This was a match that
was history.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta understand the parent. Nobody knows what you go
through. I was thinking about what all those years meant, about all
those trips to the Kramer Club [in Rolling Hills Estates] with the
kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Some parents feel they are the child. They get emotional. It's
like you see in Little League baseball. I always walk away. I don't
bother my kids."</TE>
<TE>   As much as that Wimbledon experience brought joy, it also brought
pain to Sam Sampras, as only it could to a man who says he really has
no hobbies, who retired seven years ago at age 58 as a mechanical
engineer and project manager for the space shuttle program and who
derives much of his joy from the comfort zone he has built around him
in Palos Verdes, where he brought his family to live in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "Before all those TV cameras at Wimbledon, I could walk around
here, I could go to my spa and work out, and nobody would know me,"
he said. "That changed everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after we left the stadium, and we walked around the village
of Wimbledon, people kept coming up to us. They all knew me."</TE>
<TE>   One man's well-wisher is another man's intrusion, and for Sam
Sampras, painfully shy, it has taken a while for things to get back
to normal. That's why, during the interview, he shed a tear at the
memory of the immediate aftermath of Wimbledon, of people walking up
to him in the village. And that's why he drew a line at having a
picture taken to go with this story.</TE>
<TE>   Life far away from the public eye comes with the Sampras family
genes. Sam was born and raised in Chicago, and his father was a cook
who ran a restaurant. His mother was a housewife. One of Sam's goals,
even as he went off to engineering school at Iowa State and later
Missouri, was to run a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   So foreign to this family was the concept of fame and public
persona that Sam's father, who died five years ago at 96, didn't
really know his grandson was a great player until he saw him on TV
one day and asked a friend how good he really was. The friend
answered that he was pretty good. Matter of fact, he was No. 1 in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Sam married Georgia, who had been born and raised in Greece. They
met in Washington, D.C. They were poor, and when they started married
life in Chicago, the dream of running a restaurant remained. That
came to pass in McLean, Va., where Sam joined other family members in
the restaurant business for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   But Sam's engineering education brought them better chances and
sent them to Washington, where the job paid better and the family
began. First there was Gus, then Stella, Pete and Marion.</TE>
<TE>   Stella shared young Pete's passion for the game, spent a year on
the pro tour and has been UCLA's tennis coach for the last six years.
This year, her Bruins were ranked No. 4 in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember my dad taking us down to the local high school
tennis courts when we were little and lived in Maryland," Stella
says. "Pete and I loved it, Gus didn't care for it all that much and
Marion was too young.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, I beat Pete. I think I beat him longer than he is
willing to admit. You know how competitive he is. He says I stopped
beating him when he was 11. I think it was more like when he was 13.
We still argue about that."</TE>
<TE>   Pete was 7 in 1978, when Sam Sampras moved the family to Southern
California. Sam says he did so because the space industry was booming
here, meaning good jobs, and California's climate and lifestyle were,
well, California.</TE>
<TE>   Sam kept the family interest in tennis alive by first joining the
Peninsula Club, and soon, the Jack Kramer Club, the latter a hotbed
of tennis that has produced, among other stars of the game, Tracy
Austin and Lindsay Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 14 or 15, Stella was no longer beating Pete.
Matter of fact, almost nobody around Southern California was. His
coach then, Pete Fischer, would take him around to some of the better
Division I college teams, including programs such as Long Beach
State, and try to get some competition for this skinny kid with the
huge serve. Frequently, Sampras would beat the college players. Even
more frequently, they would refuse to play him.</TE>
<TE>   In the background was Sam Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete and Stella had great coaches," he says. "They were doing
well. I wanted to stay out of it. My only problem was that I had four
kids and the tennis lessons were expensive. I wanted to be fair and
do things for all four kids."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, Sam was against Pete pursuing tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I preferred he be a doctor," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, so many people were telling Sam that his son was so good
that there was no turning back.</TE>
<TE>   "Those days at the Kramer Club, that was quite some place," Sam
says. "It was right in the middle of the tennis boom, and Pete and
Stella were right there.... The parents were all over the place. That
stuff kind of turned me off.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always kind of modest, kind of pessimistic. People would
tell me how good Pete was, how he was the best player. I'd always
say, well, we'll see tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow eventually brought six years of being ranked No. 1 in the
world. It brought seven Wimbledon titles, four U.S. Opens and two
Australian Opens. It brought fame and fortune to a family, and
especially to a father, who remains uncomfortable with the invasion
of privacy that comes with it. Sometimes, it is all overwhelming to a
man who likes the simple life, who went to the doctor six years ago
for kidney stones and found out he needed double-bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that life isn't good for Sam Sampras. All his children
live in the Los Angeles area, Pete in Beverly Hills, Stella in Santa
Monica and Gus and Marion nearby in Palos Verdes. Gus runs tennis
tournaments in Scottsdale and Manhattan Beach and Marion Hodges is a
school teacher. Gus has one child and Marion has one on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days from now, Pete Sampras will be in England as Wimbledon
begins. It will be his 14th, and there has never been anybody like
him on the grass there. From 1993 through his historic moment in
2000, Sampras lost one match, a 1996 quarterfinal to Richard
Krajicek. His record in that string was 53-1.</TE>
<TE>   He is 31 now, just two months from 32, and as his career fades a
bit, and as he acquires some of the perspective that comes with the
age, he cares more about such things as Father's Day. He not only
liked the idea of a story on his dad for Father's Day, but talked Sam
into sitting for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras echoes Stella's gratitude about their father giving
them independence, giving them the space to grow and the freedom to
spread their wings. And he said that his trip into the stands in 2000
at Wimbledon said everything needed to be said about his feelings for
his parents.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he didn't need to be quoted in this story, that it
was not his day.</TE>
<TE>   It was his father's day.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dante Washington came off the bench and scored the winning goal as
the Columbus Crew defeated the San Jose Earthquakes, 2-1, on Saturday
in front of 19,085 at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's 50th career goal came off a pass from Brian
Maissoneuve as he sent a left-footed shot inside the far post past
goalkeeper Joe Cannon in the 83rd minute. Jeff Cunningham assisted on
the play. Washington had entered the game 16 minutes earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "[That was] a great No. 50 for Dante," Crew Coach Greg Andrulis
said. "Perfect for him to get the win for us."</LD>
<TE>   Washington is the 12th player in MLS history to score 50 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Driving rain and high winds kept both teams from creating chances
in the first half until Cunningham scored in the 31st minute for the
Crew (5-5-2).</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham took a pass from Maissoneuve, dribbled around a
defender and sent a right-footed shot inside the far post. Kyle
Martino also assisted on the play.</TE>
<TE>   Dwayne DeRosario tied the game in the 39th minute for the
Earthquakes (7-4-2) by dribbling around defender Chad McCarty and
sending a shot past onrushing goalkeeper Tom Presthus.</TE>
<TE>   The game was the third meeting between the two teams in six weeks.
San Jose's last loss had been on May 18 at Crew Stadium. The
Earthquakes beat the Crew, 3-2, on May 4 at Spartan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 2, Washington 0-- Stephen Armstrong scored against his
former team as the Wizards (3-4-4) defeated D.C. United (4-6-1) in
front of 9,721 at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brown scored the Wizards' first goal from outside the box in
the 34th minute, bending a pass from Diego Gutierrez past United
goalkeeper Nick Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   New England 2, Colorado 1--Taylor Twellman had a goal and an
assist as the Revolution (4-7-1) defeated the Rapids (6-5-1) in front
of 15,125 at Denver to end a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was Twellman's 10th in 10 starts for New England. Brian
Kamler scored the game-winner in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 3, Chicago 1--Jason Kreis scored two goals, both on free
kicks, to lead the Burn (5-2-5) over the Fire (5-5-2) in front of
13,117 at Naperville, Ill.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The season is not going by any script the Sparks would have written.
They would have been happy for opponents to cower and crumble at the
sight of the WNBA champions, submitting to any result Los Angeles
wanted to post that day.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, through the first eight games at least, the Sparks have
had to battle through inspired opponents and their own lapses. But
they are finding ways to win.</LD>
<LD>   The latest case study was Saturday's 72-66 overtime victory
against the Sacramento Monarchs before 11,658 at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   When it was over, Los Angeles (7-1) had won its sixth consecutive
regular-season game against Sacramento (1-5).</TE>
<TE>   But the story is what transpired before overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks endured one of their worst first halves in team
history, making only nine of 31 shots (29%) and missing all seven
three-point attempts. They had 10 turnovers against only two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Michael Cooper didn't think his team was capable of being
that hideous.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen that by them," Cooper said. "But it goes back to
that saying that our team is not made up of one player and champions
find a way to win. And that's truly what we did: We found a way to
win this game."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Sacramento's efforts to put Los Angeles away--the Monarchs
led, 51-39, with 6:14 to play and 57-48 with 3:10 remaining--the
Sparks rallied and tied the score at 57 on Tamecka Dixon's
three-point basket with 31 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika (a game-high 19 points) and DeLisha Milton (17 off
the bench) took it from there. They combined for the Sparks' first 10
points in overtime, and Los Angeles was in possession of 67-59 lead
at the 2:38 mark. Sacramento, which had 17 points from Ruthie Bolton
and 12 points from Kedra Holland-Corn, never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you gotta win them ugly to appreciate the good ones,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Milton saw enough in the first half to last the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even tell you the last time we were that bad," Milton
said. "But the thing I'm most proud of is how we responded from it.
Two years ago we would have folded."</TE>
<TE>   Mabika and Milton are examples of the embarrassment of riches the
Sparks have on a roster that can go 10 players deep in any game.</TE>
<TE>   With the Monarchs double- and triple-teaming Lisa Leslie, it was
going to take another Los Angeles player to be a difference-maker.</TE>
<TE>   Mabika is becoming that player. Although she was only one of nine
from the field in the first half, she was six of eight after
intermission, including two three-point baskets in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I really happy I stayed in Los Angeles during the off-season and
worked on my game," Mabika said. "I'm healthy, strong and feel I can
do anything out there."</TE>
<TE>   Milton made eight of 12 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming off the bench, she gets an opportunity to see the flow of
the game and how the refs are calling it," Cooper said. "She's not
going to remain [a reserve] the whole season. But we tried the same
thing for a while last year and it worked, so we're trying the same
thing now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games:</TE>
<TE>   Houston 51, Minnesota 50--The Comets (6-3) kept alive their
perfect record against the Lynx (4-4), using a 17-2 first-half run to
win before 8,774 at Houston. The Comets are 11-0 against Minnesota
since the Lynx joined the league for the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 69, Orlando 65--Sheri Sam and Betty Lennox combined for 32
points as the Sol outlasted the Miracle before 7,215 at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the second in a row for Miami (2-5) after starting
the season with five consecutive losses. Orlando (3-3) lost for the
second game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 79, Indiana 68--Merlakia Jones had career-highs of 27
points and 11 field goals as the Rockers (2-4) defeated the Fever
before 7,697 at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Tamika Catchings led Indiana (4-4) with 23 points but scored only
six in the second half. Nikki McCray had 14 for Indiana; Olympia
Scott-Richardson scored 12.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 61, Seattle 54--Margo Dydek had 14 points, 14 rebounds and
four blocks to lead the Starzz (5-3) to victory over the Storm (4-4)
before 5,852 at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Starzz guard Jennifer Azzi kept rookie Sue Bird in check for the
first half, holding her to two points, but Bird finished with 19
points.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 67, Detroit 60--DeMya Walker had 11 points and a
career-high 10 rebounds as the Fire sent the Shock to its WNBA-record
ninth consecutive loss to open the season before 6,995 at Portland,
Ore. Alisa Burras scored 14 points for the Fire (3-5).</TE>

<DH>United States: Friedel, who may be the best goalie in the
Cup, inspires teammates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The reason the United States can beat Mexico on Monday and advance to
the quarterfinals of the World Cup for the first time in 72 years is
unmistakable.</LD>
<LD>   He stands 6 feet 4, weighs a little more than 200 pounds, wears
his hair so close-cropped that at first glance he seems bald, and
speaks with an English accent even though he is from Bay Village,
Ohio, by way of UCLA and the Blackburn Rovers.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Friedel has been outstanding at this World Cup. In three
games, he has made a strong case to be considered the goalkeeper of
the tournament. Among his string of world-class saves over the last
two weeks have been two snuffed penalty kicks, one against South
Korea and one against Poland.</LD>
<TE>   DaMarcus Beasley has played well and will threaten Mexico on the
left flank, John O'Brien has played extremely well and will cause
Mexico problems at both ends of the field. But Friedel has been
exceptional.</TE>
<TE>   If he maintains that form for another 90 minutes, and if the U.S.
can somehow sneak a goal or two as it did in beating Mexico, 2-0, in
Columbus, Ohio, during World Cup qualifying play when Clint Mathis
and Josh Wolff scored, then the smile will be on American faces come
Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "What are the chances of a U.S. victory?" Friedel asked Saturday,
repeating a question posed to him. "Very, very good. There's no doubt
in my mind about that.</TE>
<TE>   "For me right now it's a great feeling to be in the second round
in a competition that's not on our home soil. It is not a small
achievement for a soccer nation, which we are. It's a very large
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been fortunate right now to be paired up with somebody
[Mexico] we know very, very well and we know that we can beat them.
We have to be very, very good to beat them, but we know that we can.
That's a bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we know that we have a legitimate chance to get to the
quarterfinals, which again would be an unbelievable achievement for
U.S. soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel's outstanding performance in the first round, including
the two penalty saves, even prompted U.S. Coach Bruce Arena to joke
about it Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on a roll right now on penalty kicks," he said. "We'd
rather give teams a penalty kick than a corner kick at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel has inspired that confidence throughout the U.S. team.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Mexico Take Rivalry to Grand Stage</HD>
<DH>World Cup: North American neighbors will play their biggest
game to date for a spot in the quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Cobi Jones and Jorge Campos always got along well when they were
teammates on the Galaxy, and their friendship continues to this day.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. national team midfielder and the Mexico national team
goalkeeper recognized in each other the same spirit of mischief and
fun. They played the game because it paid them very well but also
because they enjoyed it. That enjoyment showed in their on-field
performances and their off-field antics.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday afternoon, Jones and Campos will meet again, but no
matter what happens at Jeonju World Cup Stadium in Jeonju, South
Korea, the two will remain friends.</LD>
<TE>   If Mexico wins, Jones will be the first to congratulate Campos. If
the U.S. wins, Campos will be right there congratulating Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The most eagerly awaited match in years for U.S. and Mexican
fans--perhaps the most eagerly awaited ever--pits the two giants of
North American soccer squarely against each other, with a coveted
place in the final eight of the World Cup going to the winner.</TE>
<TE>   The game could have filled the Rose Bowl five times over. The U.S.
and Mexico have played each other 46 times since their first
encounter in 1934, but Monday's game marks the first time they have
met on such a lofty stage and with so much at stake. Hence the
widespread interest from Glendale to Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has not reached the quarterfinals since 1930. Mexico has
not done so since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   It promises to be an intense match, with neither side holding any
great advantage over the other. Mexico defeated Croatia and Ecuador
and tied Italy to get to this point. The U.S. defeated Portugal, tied
South Korea and lost to Poland.</TE>
<TE>   The soccer rivalry between the countries is legend, even if
mainstream America has been slow to pay attention. There is a special
atmosphere around the game, an electricity that sparks players and
fans alike.</TE>
<TE>   Jones tried to explain it to a reporter from Europe, who was
unfamiliar with the long soccer history between the countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a match between Holland and Germany," he ventured. "How's
that? Imagine how that would be. It's like Argentina-Brazil. It's
going to be a battle.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be a lot of antics going on on the field
because it's always very lively when it's U.S.-Mexico. I don't think
you can get any bigger match for our team or the Mexican team because
there will be a lot of bragging rights ... for someone."</TE>
<TE>   Much is made of the rivalry and sometimes things do get heated on
the field, but U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel said Saturday that there
is no real animosity between the teams, even if their fans would like
to think there is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a friendly rivalry before the game and after the game," he
said, "but on the field it's not too friendly. But it's not a hatred
or anything of that nature. I think it's more like bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both in the same region, and I think they're under big
pressure from their public and their media if they lose to us. We
always enjoy getting good results against them."</TE>
<TE>   It has only been in recent years that those results have arrived.
Mexico leads the all-time series, 28-9-9, but the U.S. has won four
of the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has looked the more settled team during group play. Coach
Javier Aguirre's team is injury-free and fully fit. The U.S., on the
other hand, will be without injured defenders Steve Cherundolo (knee)
and Jeff Agoos (calf) and suspended defender Frankie Hejduk.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of Hejduk leaves U.S. Coach Bruce Arena with the
problem of filling the spot at left back. He could move John O'Brien
there, since O'Brien has played the position with his club team, Ajax
Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   But that would limit O'Brien's ability to get forward, so it is
possible that Arena could give David Regis his first start at this
World Cup, with DaMarcus Beasley dropping back from midfield to help
him out.</TE>
<TE>   Filling in for Agoos in the center could be Carlos Llamosa, Gregg
Berhalter or Pablo Mastroeni. Arena would not tip his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico will be well aware of the defensive patch-and-fill job the
U.S. is contemplating, and forwards Cuauhtemoc Blanco, Jared Borgetti
and Francisco Palencia, not to mention midfielders Jesus Arellano and
Joahan Rodriguez, will be instructed to probe for weaknesses early
and often.</TE>
<TE>   The most influential player on Mexico's team so far has been
midfielder Gerardo Torrado, even though it is the lanky Borgetti who
has scored twice, both on headers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most every game that I've ever been involved in has been won and
lost in midfield," Friedel said. "Right now they [Mexico] look
incredibly strong in that department.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been impressed with Torrado. I really have. He has been box
to box, he wins almost every second ball that gets knocked down, and
just when you think he has gone too far forward, he breaks up the
play at the back."</TE>
<TE>   Players from both teams have been talking up their rival over the
last two days. Mexico's Blanco, for instance, has mentioned the U.S.
players' quickness, and goalkeeper Oscar Perez has remarked on how
the U.S. can "hit you hard on the counter-attack with very fast
players down the wings."</TE>
<TE>   From the U.S. side, forward Josh Wolff echoed the American line
when he said familiarity has removed most of the secrets between the
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are pretty aware of what Mexico is all about," he said
Saturday. "We've had a pretty good record against them in the past
two years. Obviously they're a tough team and they're playing very
good soccer right now, so I don't think there will be any lack of
concentration or taking these guys for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Landon Donovan, who scored against Mexico in his national
team debut in 2000, summed up his feelings in a few simple words.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to beat Mexico even if it's in my backyard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The final word, however, belongs to Campos' old friend, Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we can beat them; they know they can beat us," he said.
"We'll just have to go out and play it."</TE>

Balance of Power
U.S. and Mexico since 1990: The bitter rivalry there is now between
the U.S. and Mexico festered in the 1990s, when the teams played 19
times, after only four meetings from 1978-1990. Since 1990, the U.S.
has been narrowly on top of the rivalry, winning seven matches,
losing six and drawing six
Since 1990: 7-6-6 (GF 23, GA 18)
In United States: 7-3-4 (GF 23, GA 12)
In Mexico: 0-3-1 (GF 0, GA 6)
Neutral Site: 0-0-1 (GF 0, GA 0 U.S. wins 4-1 in penalty kicks)</TE>

<TE>   The Highlights</TE>
<TE>*--*
1934: U.S. 4, Mexico 2
The first meeting in the series took place in Rome, where qualifying
games were held for the second World Cup, meaning a very short stay
for the loser. The U.S. won behind four goals from Aldo "Buff"
Donelli, who went on to coach Pittsburgh and Cleveland in the NFL
1957: Mexico 7, U.S. 2
The first game in the series played on U.S. soil, in Long Beach, was
an anticlimax, as Mexico had already built a 6-0 lead in the first
game of a home-and-home qualifying series for the 1958 World Cup. Ed
Murphy scored both U.S. goals
1980: U.S. 2, Mexico 1
Steve Moyers' two goals helped the U.S. end a 46-year, 24-game
winless streak in the series. This World Cup qualifier in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., was little more than an exhibition, as Mexico had
already clinched first place in the pool
1991: U.S. 2, Mexico 0
In the first Gold Cup, the U.S. stunned its fellow CONCACAF rival by
going through the tournament unbeaten. This semifinal victory, made
possible by goals from John Doyle and Peter Vermes, was the first
indication that Mexico's dominance in the region would be challenged
1993: Mexico 4, U.S. 0
Payback time: In the championship game of the second Gold Cup, Mexico
exacted revenge with a decisive victory at Azteca Stadium in Mexico
City before 120,000, the largest crowd for a U.S. game
1994: U.S. 1, Mexico 0
Two weeks before the World Cup, the host U.S. team proved it was
ready by winning in the Rose Bowl before 92,405, most of whom were
rooting for Mexico. Roy Wegerle scored the game's lone goal
1995: U.S. 4, Mexico 0
The most one-sided U.S. victory in the series, this U.S. Cup game in
Washington was significant because of a breakout performance by
Claudio Reyna, who scored a goal and had two assists
1995: U.S. 0, Mexico 0
U.S. won on penalty kicks, 4-1 Invited to take part in South
America's biannual championship, the Copa America, both teams shocked
the field by advancing through pool play to meet in the
quarterfinals. After a scoreless tie, Brad Friedel saved two of three
Mexican penalty kicks, while the U.S. scored on all four of its shots
to advance to the semifinals
1996: Mexico 2, U.S. 2
Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Tom Dooley of the U.S. both scored in
the 90th minute in a U.S. Cup shootout in front of 92,216 at the Rose
Bowl. The tie gave Mexico the title
1997: Mexico 0, U.S. 0
The scoreless tie at Azteca Stadium kept the U.S. on track to qualify
for the 1998 World Cup. But perhaps of more significance, it was the
first time in 16 games in Mexico City that Mexico had failed to
defeat the U.S
1998: Mexico 1, U.S. 0
The U.S. was coming off its first victory ever over Brazil, in the
semifinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. But Mexico won in the
championship match on a goal by Luis Hernandez just before halftime,
before a crowd of 91,255 at the Coliseum
1999: Mexico 1, U.S. 0 (OT)
Cuauhtemoc Blanco's goal six minutes into sudden-death overtime at
Azteca Stadium propelled Mexico into the championship game of the
FIFA Confederations Cup, and overshadowed a standout performance in
goal by Kasey Keller of the U.S
2001: U.S. 2, Mexico 0
Goals by Josh Wolff and Earnie Stewart got the U.S. off to a good
start in the final round of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, on a
cold night in Columbus, Ohio
2001: Mexico 1, U.S. 0
On the verge of elimination, Mexico jump-started its qualification
run with a victory before 100,000 at Azteca Stadium, on Jared
Borgetti's header in the 16th minute</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mia Hamm had a goal and an assist in her second game back from her
injury and Abby Wambach scored twice to help the Washington Freedom
defeat the San Diego Spirit, 4-0, Saturday in front of 6,090 at
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Hamm, who scored the game-winning goal Thursday against Boston,
played the second half on Washington's front line. With her left knee
still bandaged, Hamm was able to make plays on offense but tested the
surgically repaired joint with some reluctance.</LD>
<LD>   Hamm scored her goal on a penalty kick in the 81st minute to give
the Freedom a 3-0 lead after Ann Cook was taken down in the box. Hamm
assisted on Anne Makinen's first goal of the season in the 79th
minute.</LD>
<TE>   The offensive star for Washington (4-4-3) was Wambach, who has now
scored in four consecutive games. Her first goal came in the 26th
minute when she outjumped a cluster of defenders to head in her fifth
goal of the season on a corner kick from Pu Wei.</TE>
<TE>   The second goal came in the 89th minute when Wambach was left
unmarked inside the box and fired a low shot behind a sprawling Jaime
Pagliarulo, who has given up two goals or more in seven of 10 games
for the Spirit (2-6-2).</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 4, New York 3--Brandi Chastain scored twice and set up
the winning penalty kick as the CyberRays (5-3-2) defeated the Power
(2-7-1) in front of 6,605 at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Tiffeny Milbrett, who had never scored a goal against
the CyberRays before Saturday, scored all three for the Power.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Atlanta 1--Unni Lehn's goal in the 58th minute led the
Courage (5-1-3) over the Beat (5-4-1) in front of 5,651 at Atlanta.
Birgit Prinz scored in the 77th minute for the final margin.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, Boston 0--Marinette Pichon scored in the fifth
minute as the Charge (6-1-2) held off the Breakers (2-5-4) in front
of 5,465 at Villanova, Pa.</TE>

<DH>Golfer Dudley Hart is more concerned about keeping up with
his newborn triplets, who arrived premature, than with going on
birdie binges</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN WINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Pro golfer Dudley Hart answers his front door holding a baby.</LD>
<LD>   Behind him, where the spotless living room looks out onto a
swimming pool, it's as quiet as a Masters gallery. But in the family
room, there are signs of life--lots of it.</LD>
<LD>   A large pile of tiny clothes covers the coffee table. There are
three car seats, three baby rockers and three clipboards for Hart's
wife, Suzanne, to record feeding times and diaper changes.</LD>
<TE>   "We have three of everything," Hart says.</TE>
<TE>   They have triplets.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is one of the top golfers on the PGA Tour, and this Father's
Day, he'll be playing with a threesome--Abigail Grace, Rachel Diane
and Ryan Dudley. Born three months premature on Dec. 6, they were
released from the hospital 11 weeks later, and the babies and mom are
doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   So is dad, who already has three top-10 finishes this year--at
Atlanta, New Orleans and Fort Worth. Going into this weekend's U.S.
Open, he ranked 31st on the PGA Tour money list with $899,542, which
will buy a lot of diapers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I played well the past few weeks--out of necessity,"
Hart jokes. "Nah, I wouldn't say there's more pressure, but there's
definitely extra motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I get more focused because I figure if I'm out there and play
well and make the best of the time, maybe I won't have to play quite
as many tournaments, so I can be home a little more."</TE>
<TE>   Genial and easygoing away from the course, Hart the golfer has
been known for a quick temper since he was a club-flinging teenager.
But his father, Chuck, says parenthood is helping Dudley's career by
teaching him patience and a new perspective.</TE>
<TE>   At the Colonial last month, he finished fourth despite three
double bogeys and a triple bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "In his past few events, what we've seen is he's not beating up on
himself quite so badly," Chuck Hart says. "A year ago, a triple bogey
in the second round would have sent him home--he would have missed
the cut. But he's taking that kind of stuff more in stride, because
all of a sudden, something is more important than golf."</TE>
<TE>   Hart, 33, admits the challenge of raising triplets is less
daunting for a successful professional golfer. The Rochester, N.Y.,
native and former Florida Gator has finished in the top 60 on the
money list each of the last six years, and his career earnings total
$6.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing I thank God for every day--it was never really a
concern about money," Hart says. "We're lucky that we don't really
have to worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   The Harts have a spacious two-story home, a daytime nanny, a
nighttime nurse and a maid once a week. Because of a marketing
relationship, they receive Similac infant formula free, a savings of
thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the transition from two Harts to a full house required an
adjustment, especially for Dudley, who had never changed a diaper.
The days can become a bit of a blur, but it helps that Suzanne keeps
copious records of diaper changes, medication and meals.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to because I forget--who did I just feed?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   The couple knew there was a chance of a multiple birth because
they used an in-vitro procedure. Hart was on the road in July when
Suzanne saw her doctor to find out how many children to expect.</TE>
<TE>   After completing the first round at the Western Open, Hart phoned
home for a report.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very anxious to know if we were going to have one, two,
three, four, five, six or however many," Hart says. "The conversation
went like this: I said, 'Honey, how many?' She said, 'We have three.'
I said, 'Oh my God. I'll call you back.' Click.</TE>
<TE>   "I was totally shocked. I played great that week, but I didn't
sleep two hours a night. I just stared at the ceiling thinking, 'I
know it's going to be three girls, because I wasn't the best boy in
the world going through college, so this will be payback. That's
three weddings, three private schools, three college educations--how
are we going to do all this?' "</TE>
<TE>   The shock subsided and Hart was delighted when tests determined
one of the babies was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Everything after that is gravy. I've got my little man
in there, and I've got two beautiful girls,' " Hart says. "Three
girls would have been serious stress."</TE>
<TE>   The triplets are fraternal, which means they don't look alike. And
their personalities are already distinct:</TE>
<TE>   Abigail, the smallest, is easygoing and such a flirt that even
Sergio Garcia has been smitten. "He came up and she smiled and he
said, 'OK, I'll take my girlfriend,' " Suzanne says.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel likes to have her head up so she can see what's going on.
"She's more maintenance," Dudley says.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan tends to get teed off. "He seems to have inherited the Hart
temper," Dudley says. "When he's hungry, he screams, and he is loud.
He's got this vein on his head that looks like it's going to pop:
'Feed me immediately. Not in 10 seconds. Now!' "</TE>
<TE>   Because they were premature, each weighing about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds
at birth, the triplets are weeks behind in their development.</TE>
<TE>   They sleep a lot, but rarely all at the same time. They go through
two dozen bottles and two dozen diapers a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much 24-7 right now," Hart says. "It only takes one
of them to be awake for you to be awake."</TE>
<TE>   Hart felt guilty leaving his family, but with so many mouths to
feed, he returned to the tour in January after a three-month layoff.</TE>
<TE>   Because the nanny works five days a week, Suzanne occasionally
finds herself the only adult in the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are long days, because it's just constant and there's no
adult interaction," she says. "You may have 20 minutes of down time,
but that's when you make a bottle or throw a load of laundry in or
try to pick up."</TE>
<TE>   She and the kids began to accompany Dudley on the road last month,
and Suzanne has already been out to the course, taking one baby at a
time while the nanny stays with the other two.</TE>
<TE>   Day care provided by the PGA Tour is an option, too, and the
family will miss only two of Hart's tournaments this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The couple adjusted so well to parenthood that Suzanne is already
talking about having another baby.</TE>
<TE>   "Not now," she adds hastily. "In a couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   First they'll celebrate Dudley's first Father's Day as a dad. He
likes the role, even if it means less sleep and more dirty laundry,
his included.</TE>
<TE>   Babe in arms, he laughs when Rachel spits up on his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "You slimed me!" Hart says to his daughter, grinning at the mess.</TE>
<TE>   He has learned that as the father of triplets, it's par for the
course.</TE>

fears of new Irish Republican Army activity, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Sectarian tensions are high in Belfast, where Protestant and Roman
Catholic mobs have clashed almost nightly in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Paramilitary groups are suspected of being behind the sectarian
trouble that has seen civilians injured by gunfire and dozens of
police officers wounded.</LD>

<HD>Czech Voters Take a Left Turn</HD>
<DH>Elections: Ruling Social Democrats win, but Communists make
a strong showing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Parties expected to form a strongly pro-European, center-left Czech
government won a razor-thin majority in parliamentary elections
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Vladimir Spidla, 51, a historian turned politician, appeared
poised to become prime minister after his Social Democratic Party
finished first.</LD>
<LD>   "We will strive to create a modern welfare state and prepare for
joining the European Union," Spidla said Saturday evening.</LD>
<TE>   In a reflection of voter anger at corruption, growing disparities
in wealth and the pain of transition to a market economy, however,
the Communist Party made by far its best showing since the 1989
collapse of a Soviet-backed dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   Although not expected to join the new administration, the
Communists finished third in the two-day election, winning a
projected 41 seats in the powerful 200-member lower house of
Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear Czech people voted left, voted for social justice and
social security," said Miroslav Grebenicek, the Communists' chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Since the establishment of democracy here nearly 13 years ago, all
major parties have ostracized the Communists and rejected any notion
of cooperation with them. But politicians from other parties will now
be forced to accept them as part of the political mainstream,
Grebenicek triumphantly predicted.</TE>
<TE>   As results came in, Spidla said he expected to form a new
government with a coalition of two centrist parties, even if that
combination fell slightly short of a parliamentary majority. Such a
government would be possible if tolerated by a few legislators from
the conservative or Communist opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But with more than 99% of the votes counted late Saturday, it
appeared that such a coalition would have a fragile majority and that
votes from opposition members of Parliament would not be needed to
put it in power.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Democrats won a projected 71 seats, while a coalition
of Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union were expected to take 31
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Spidla ruled out cooperation with the Communists or a coalition
with the center-right Civic Democratic Party of former Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus, which placed second with a projected 57 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was low at 58%, compared with 74% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A government headed by Spidla would be firmly committed to rapid
European Union entry, targeted for 2004. Spidla has been a deputy
prime minister for the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Klaus, who favored a much tougher negotiating stance in seeking EU
admission, had hoped to stage a comeback as the country's most
powerful leader. For him, Saturday's results were a stinging defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "All democratic parties lost. The only winners are the
Communists," Klaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he would resign as the Civic Democrats' leader at a
party meeting Monday, he replied: "Allow us to examine the situation
in peace."</TE>
<TE>   Klaus is widely viewed by both his critics and supporters as
brilliant but also arrogant and abrasive. A strong advocate of free
markets and low taxes, he ran a nationalistic campaign that sought in
part to play on voter doubts about joining the EU.</TE>
<TE>   President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident who was repeatedly
jailed by the Communist regime, had favored a center-left victory and
could be expected to take pleasure in the defeat of Klaus, his
longtime rival. But the strong showing by the Communists could give
him no joy as he looks toward completing his final term as president
early next year. The lower house of Parliament and the Senate will
jointly elect Havel's successor.</TE>
<TE>   Havel spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president would meet with
the leaders of all parties that won seats, except the Communists, to
discuss formation of the next government. That would continue Havel's
refusal to deal with Communists.</TE>
<TE>   But Grebenicek said such days will soon end.</TE>
<TE>   "Havel will not be president six months hence, and his successor
will have to act differently," the Communist leader said.</TE>
<TE>   In several other former Soviet-bloc states, Communist parties
changed their names, formally endorsed multiparty democracy and
market economics, and fared well politically over the last decade as
social democratic parties.</TE>
<TE>   Hungary and Poland--the two countries most frequently compared to
the Czech Republic because of their similar political pasts and
current relatively strong economic levels--both have elected
left-leaning governments in the last year that are led by former
Communists turned social democrats.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A firefight near a Jewish settlement in the northern Gaza Strip left
two Israeli soldiers and a Palestinian gunman dead Saturday, the
Israeli military said, hours after its troops rolled into the West
Bank towns of Jenin and Tulkarm.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers on patrol near the Jewish settlement of Dugit encountered
armed Palestinians, the military announced. In addition to the three
people killed, four soldiers were wounded.</LD>
<LD>   An army commander said the militants had planned to lure soldiers
to a booby-trapped car by firing mortars and then detonating
explosives when troops came to search the area.</LD>
<TE>   The attack came after Israeli troops moved into Jenin and Tulkarm
late Friday and early Saturday, searching for militant activity
before withdrawing.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks backed by helicopters shot and destroyed four small
workshops in Jenin but no one was injured, Palestinian security
officials said. The army said it was unaware of any tank fire.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli radio stations quoted security officials as saying the
troops had searched unsuccessfully for a suicide bomber planning to
carry out an attack this week.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has launched almost daily raids on Palestinian-ruled
territory, keeping up pressure on militants after an offensive
unleashed in March because of a spate of Palestinian suicide
bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, a rocket was launched from the Gaza Strip into a
nearby Israeli community, but no injuries or damage were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Israeli military officials said soldiers had found
a car full of homemade explosives near the Elei Sinai settlement in
the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   And the army reported that troops had on Friday captured a
Palestinian militant, Fadi Duwaik, in Hebron for allegedly carrying
out a shooting attack in a nearby Jewish settlement that killed four.</TE>

<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>The chief minister of India's Jammu and Kashmir state escaped an
attempt on his life Saturday when two grenades were fired at a
government building he was inaugurating in the region's main city,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate attack later in the day, two children were killed
when unidentified militants hurled a grenade and fired on a group of
Hindu devotees east of Jammu, the state's winter capital.</LD>
<LD>   The attack on Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah came as Indian and
Pakistani troops traded fresh fire across their frontier in disputed
Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   "One grenade exploded in the air, while another fell about 600
yards away from the venue of the function. No harm was caused,"
police said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah was opening a state education board building in Srinagar,
the summer capital of the state at the heart of the hostility with
Pakistan. His attendance had been kept secret for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In the later incident, at Kishtwar, about 100 miles east of Jammu,
police said a group of devotees was returning from a temple festival

<DH>Afghanistan: Violence around Mazar-i-Sharif prompts concern
about northern relief efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>As delegates to this country's grand assembly, or loya jirga, spent
Saturday brainstorming ways to solidify the peace that has taken hold
in most areas, a new outbreak of lawlessness racked the north and
threatened to shut down humanitarian relief work.</LD>
<LD>   Long rebellious, the region around Mazar-i-Sharif has been the
scene of violence in recent days as three rival commanders have been
taking part in the gathering here--and presumably supervising
incursions into their adversaries' territory on the assumption that
those rivals would let down their guard while attending the
conference.</LD>
<LD>   The incidents, including the gang rape of an international aid
worker, testify to the residual animosity and aggression that could
expose vast swaths of the country to conflict and bloodshed even as a
new government with popular endorsement seeks reconciliation after
more than two decades of war.</LD>
<TE>   The clashes and attacks in the north prompted United Nations
special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to complain to President-elect Hamid
Karzai that food and other assistance might not reach needy refugees
in the region unless the attacks cease.</TE>
<TE>   "U.N. staff are now reporting an alarming level of violence that
is affecting both personal security and the confidence of local
residents in the ability of aid workers to assist them," U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said, quoting a statement issued
by Brahimi.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi also drew Karzai's attention to attacks, robberies and
beatings carried out against aid organizations, as well as harassment
of refugees and a gun battle in the village of Sholgara that shot up
a medical clinic.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, an American aid vehicle en route to oversee bread
distribution at a refugee camp in Dehdadhi, near Mazar, was fired on,
prompting the agency to pull out of the country, Almeida said.</TE>
<TE>   Other nongovernmental organizations "are considering similar
actions because of the situation in that part of the country," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials had been informed of the gang rape only two days
before because the victim's employer, which was not identified for
her protection, wanted to relocate her to a safe place first, Almeida
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi's statement said he "regretted that U.N. intervention with
local authorities did not result in effective measures" being taken
to put an end to the violence. The U.N. envoy has therefore turned to
Karzai, who has been urging regional warlords to submit to central
authority so Afghanistan can get on with the huge task of rebuilding
itself.</TE>
<TE>   The warlords involved--Uzbek Deputy Defense Minister Abdul Rashid
Dostum, Tajik commander Atta Mohammed and Hazara leader Mohammed
Mohaqiq--strode about the loya jirga all week, prompting delegates to
complain that their presence was intimidating and a reminder that
gunmen still wield too much power over politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after voting for Karzai as head of state in a
transitional leadership that will serve until nationwide elections in
2004, the delegates spent Saturday on a steady stream of regional
laments. Long denied any voice in government affairs, the
participants have been so insistent on airing their views that the
conference is far behind schedule and unlikely to meet its deadline
for conclusion today.</TE>
<TE>   The most important task left to the gathering is assistance to
Karzai in naming a new Cabinet--a job he suggested might take longer
than the council's duration. But having been sidelined in the choice
of a president by foreign pressure on the former king and a previous
president to withdraw from the running, the delegates have made clear
that they expect to be consulted on the remaining appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "The government should create conditions so everyone trusts each
other," Said Hadi Hadi, from Ghazni province in the southeast, said.</TE>
<TE>   Others proposed seating an oversight body to work with Karzai,
which the newly selected leader agreed to. He also suggested that a
regionally representative group stay on beyond the convocation to
meet with him and discuss their constituents' concerns.</TE>
<TE>   While Karzai's attempts to include delegates in decision-making
appeased some, others have been insistent that the makeup of the
Cabinet be addressed before the council disperses.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates have been especially vocal about the need to reduce the
influence of Northern Alliance commanders, such as Dostum, in
government affairs. In the current 30-member Cabinet, warlords who
helped liberate the country from the hard-line Taliban regime hold
disproportionate power. Tajiks run the ministries of foreign affairs,
defense and the interior, as well as the national security
directorate.</TE>
<TE>   While Dostum and Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim have made
clear that they expect to remain in the power structure, Interior
Minister Younis Qanooni has said he will step down to allow the loya
jirga to decide who should be responsible for the police and civil
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Qanooni reprimanded the delegates Saturday for wasting vital time
squabbling and pontificating.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a golden opportunity for us to try to fix the problems of
the people," he said.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Crucial Game Against the U.S. Means the World to Mexicans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A sombrero-clad Mexican, praying on his knees in a cartoon in the
newspaper La Jornada, sums up the mood here on the eve of Mexico's
do-or-die World Cup soccer match against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Little Virgin," he implores the mother of Jesus. "We've already
given them California, our water, our petroleum, our economy, our
sovereignty. At least don't let them take Monday's game!"</LD>
<LD>   As if two neighbors didn't have enough to quarrel about these
days, as if their history were not burdened enough by war, fate has
cast los Yanquis onto a field in Chonju, South Korea, to challenge
Mexico at its favorite sport and current source of national pride.</LD>
<TE>   To Mexicans, whose newly democratic country is trying to throw off
a defeatist mentality and claim a place on the world stage, it's much
more than a game.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen time zones away, President Vicente Fox has summoned his
Cabinet to his official residence to watch the nationally televised
contest starting at 1:30 a.m. Mexico City time. Millions of Mexicans
plan to stay up tonight, many of them crowding around TV sets in
all-night bars and giant outdoor screens in city centers across the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "How about that triumph by our team!" Fox said Saturday, opening
his weekly radio address with a cheer for Mexico's first-place finish
in its qualifying group to reach the round of 16. "Now we face the
United States. It won't be easy, but I'm sure our players will give
their best.... Our hearts and applause will be with them."</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow ordered the U.S. Embassy closed
Monday--not so that its 500-plus employees can sleep off the game,
but so they can avoid the expected all-day post-match riot at the
nearby independence monument, a traditional gathering point for fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's a just friendly game where the players swap jerseys
afterward," said one American diplomat. "But it's hard for Mexicans
to remove this match from their complex relationship with the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   That relationship is overshadowed by 19th century wars that cost
Mexico half its territory and by the United States' superior economic
and military might. After nearly a century of resisting U.S.
"imperialism," Mexico now embraces a North American free trade zone
but is locked in prickly disputes with its neighbor over immigration
and scarce water along the border.</TE>
<TE>   Friday in the bone-dry border state of Coahuila, a Mexican
television reporter suggested that Fox bet the country's
480-billion-gallon water debt to drought-stricken Texas farms on the
outcome of Monday's match.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's keep the water issue to water," the president replied.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a back-slapping friendship between Fox and President Bush,
Mexicans complain that their own priorities--including a proposal to
legalize more than 3 million undocumented Mexicans in the United
States and expand the guest worker program--get less than
Washington's full attention.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for soccer. If anything irritates Mexicans about
going mano a mano with the U.S. team, it's that the vast American
public could not care less about a sporting event that rivals the
Olympics in worldwide popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in New York last week when the U.S. team beat Portugal, and
when I congratulated my American friends, they thought I was talking
about Martians," said Jorge Montano, a former Mexican ambassador to
the United States. "They asked, 'Did you see the Lakers?'</TE>
<TE>   "To Americans, immigration is our problem. Soccer is our problem,"
Montano said. "This is American unilateralism."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mexicans queried in TV surveys last week, before the round
of 16 shaped up, said the United States was the team they were most
eager to face. Soccer is one area in which Mexico has long felt
superior to the United States; 92% predict Mexico will win Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The gringos will lose because they don't know how to play," said
Harlan Reyes, a 14-year-old student at Public School 260 here.
"They're good at baseball and basketball, but soccer is our sport."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Mexicans recognize that a loss to the United
States would be far more painful than a loss to any other team.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose I'm going to migrate to the United States as a
hooligan," quipped Harlan's classmate, Aaron Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican sports columnists have warned against overconfidence.
Although Mexico has won 28 of 46 matches against the United States
over the years, the Americans have won four of the last five.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team has won the World Cup, so a lot is at stake just on
the field.</TE>
<TE>   A new generation of American players is struggling to match the
prowess of Latin America. And Mexico's young team is on a roaring
comeback under Coach Javier Aguirre after a humiliating record under
his predecessor nearly kept the country out of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In a country plagued by poverty, crime, drug trafficking and
periodic financial crashes, Mexicans have seized on the team as a
model for managing their affairs. Fox, a rancher who sports Mexico's
green jersey during matches, has compared the squad's performance to
that of his own political team.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer cannot really give such lessons on how to run the country,
but it can help revive our spirit," said Mexican novelist Carlos
Monsivais. In a Mexico fearful of being swallowed by globalization,
he said, soccer success has reaffirmed the national identity.</TE>
<TE>   "The contest is not against the United States," he said, "but
against our traditional self-image--the image of a defeated country."</TE>
<TE>   As Mexico defeated Croatia and Ecuador, then won its opening-round
group by tying three-time champion Italy, fiesta-style celebrations
have increasingly disrupted life across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds have been arrested for throwing fireworks and vandalizing
stores. Dozens have been injured. Airlines have delayed takeoffs so
passengers and crews could watch Mexico play. Absenteeism in schools
and workplaces is high.</TE>
<TE>   Agents of globalization have tried to accommodate national pride.
Bill Smith, vice president and general manager of Anful, a U.S.-owned
maker of fire extinguishers and hoses, has set up a TV set in his
Mexico City factory's lunchroom and allowed workers to leave the
assembly line to watch. They're supposed to make up the time later in
the shift, he said, but production has dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I'd like to see Mexico win, because it would give
them something in their life to be positive about," said Smith, an
American. "But as a manager, I'm looking forward to when Mexico gets
beat so we can get back to normal."</TE>
<TE>   Josefa Mena, a Mexico City psychologist who knows little about
soccer "except that the guys are cute and score goals," ventures the
theory that World Cup fever is highest in underdeveloped countries
such as Mexico because it offers the illusion that they can beat up
on the rich.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win, Mexicans will be going bananas and yelling all
over the place, like, 'Oh, my God, we have reconquered Texas and New
Mexico and California!' " Mena said. "It's a vicarious way of
achieving an illusion.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose, then once again, we're the losers," she said. "But it
will be worse if we win. There will be a party for days and days. It
could get very wild. We won't be able to go out on the streets."</TE>

<HD>Italy's Newest Saint Puts Town on the Map</HD>
<DH>Religion: Despite his marked past, Padre Pio has inspired
millions of pilgrimages to his home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN GIOVANNI ROTONDO, Italy</DL>
<LD>As a priest conducted midday Mass for hundreds of pilgrims, other
believers in Padre Pio crowded around his statue at the side of the
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Some lovingly caressed the bronze hands marked with stigmata for
which the controversial mystic was famous. The less reverent posed
for souvenir snapshots, oblivious to the disruption that their
flashes caused to more devout followers of the beloved Capuchin
friar.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to San Giovanni Rotondo, dubbed by some "the Las Vegas of
the faithful." Padre Pio--who will be canonized by Pope John Paul II
today,  34 years after his death--rose to fame and spent most of his
working life in this remote town in southeastern Italy.</LD>
<TE>   To his millions of followers worldwide, Padre Pio was always a
saint. Their faith is now being rewarded with the exceptionally rapid
elevation to sainthood of a figure repeatedly investigated by the
Vatican during his lifetime as a suspected fraud and a sexual
wrongdoer.</TE>
<TE>   "In our hearts, Jesus Christ holds the first place, but Padre Pio
comes second," explained Angela Bellopede, 56, a small-town Italian
who said she comes here twice a year. "All the people just want to
honor him because he grants many graces."</TE>
<TE>   Some say that with Padre Pio's canonization, San Giovanni Rotondo
might replace Lourdes, France, as Europe's premier pilgrimage
site--if it hasn't already done so in terms of sheer numbers. A
widely quoted estimate is that 7.5 million visitors a year come here,
while Lourdes claims only 5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Padre Pio, who died in 1968 at 81, drew the displeasure of several
popes but the support of others, giving a roller-coaster character to
his career. He was named Francesco Forgione at birth and later
adopted the religious name Pio.</TE>
<TE>   His fame was launched--and the suspicions against him began--in
1918, when word spread that he had been marked by stigmata--wounds on
his hands, feet and side similar to those of Jesus on the cross.</TE>
<TE>   Such marks are viewed in Roman Catholic tradition as an
extraordinary sign of holiness and are believed to have been borne by
St. Francis of Assisi, an important role model for Padre Pio.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Padre Pio was investigated for alleged sexual
misconduct; doubt was cast on the stigmata, which his followers say
he bore until his death; and he was banned at times from saying Mass
or hearing confessions.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the support of Pope John Paul, who met Padre Pio decades
ago and reputedly credits him with curing a friend of cancer through
the force of prayer, all the old concerns have been decisively swept
aside.</TE>
<TE>   His canonization comes just three years after his beatification,
the last step before becoming a saint.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief biography, the Vatican credits Padre Pio's fervent
followers with a key role in the decision to grant him sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   "In the years following his death, his reputation for sanctity and
miracles grew steadily and became established in the church all over
the world and among all kinds of people," it says. "God thus showed
the Church his desire to glorify on earth his faithful servant."</TE>
<TE>   Padre Pio's photo, showing him with a white beard and a deep gaze,
can be found all over Italy. Police even reported finding it
alongside a handgun in the pocket of accused Mafia boss Antonino
Giuffre when they arrested him in Sicily this spring.</TE>
<TE>   But the seat of his greatest glorification--and
commercialization--is San Giovanni Rotondo. Here the streets are
lined with shops selling Padre Pio statuettes, Padre Pio photos,
Padre Pio T-shirts and Padre Pio trinkets.</TE>
<TE>   On the hillside is another Padre Pio legacy: one of southern
Italy's biggest and best hospitals. Called the House for the Relief
of Suffering, it opened here in 1956 despite its hard-to-reach
location near what might be called the spur of the Italian boot.
Padre Pio made fund-raising for the hospital and details of its
organization a key focus of his work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that you can find a souvenir of Padre Pio, but I think
there's some exploitation of the phenomenon," said Carmela Lisanti, a
pilgrim from the town of Ferrandina.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy about the hospital because it has good facilities and
good doctors. But I don't like too much the souvenir trade."</TE>
<TE>   But the souvenir trade is important for San Giovanni Rotondo, for
the town of 27,000 lives on little but Padre Pio. "Beyond his
sanctity, Padre Pio brought us much work," said Antonio Russo, 40,
who works at a restaurant catering mainly to visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican investigations of Padre Pio began in 1920 under Pope
Benedict XV after the local bishop suggested that the Capuchins, a
Franciscan order known for vows of poverty, were making a spectacle
out of Padre Pio to attract contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Specialists soon suggested that his wounds were due to hysteria,
or that he was keeping them open intentionally under the guise of
treating them with antiseptic. The stigmata were rarely seen because
he almost always wore gloves to hide them in public.</TE>
<TE>   In 1923, under Pope Pius XI, the Vatican decreed that Padre Pio's
powers were not to be regarded as "of a supernatural character" and
warned against devotion to him.</TE>
<TE>   But the burgeoning ranks of his followers were not dissuaded.</TE>
<TE>   "When he used to raise his hands [while conducting Mass], many
people often saw that he was bleeding, and a few drops of blood fell
on the altar," recalled Maria Florio, 84, who knew Padre Pio for many
years. "I didn't see the blood, but I was told by the people around
me that he was bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   Believers said that he was capable of being in two places at the
same time, that he could foresee the future and that he emitted a
strange scent of roses, another sign of his sanctity.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest threat to Padre Pio's reputation came under Pope John
XXIII, who in 1960 authorized an investigation. The resulting
200-page document was never published in full. But the Italian press
reported that it contained allegations that Padre Pio had sex with
female devotees twice a week. The report was seen as an insuperable
barrier to his ever attaining sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   During Padre Pio's final years, however, Pope Paul VI looked
favorably on him and endorsed the view that he bore genuine stigmata
that were a mark of holiness.</TE>
<TE>   The official Vatican biography quotes Paul VI as saying three
years after Padre Pio's death: "Look what fame he had, what a
worldwide following gathered around him! But why?"</TE>
<TE>   Answering his own question, Paul VI continued: "Because he said
Mass humbly, heard confessions from dawn to dusk and was--it is not
easy to say it--one who bore the wounds of our Lord. He was a man of
prayer and suffering."</TE>
<TE>   After Padre Pio's death, his supporters launched a counterattack
against the sexual impropriety report and succeeded in reopening the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "In the history of the church, it happened often that people were
accused, and then there was a recognition of them being right," said
Francesco Lotti, retired head of pediatrics at the House for the
Relief of Suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Lotti said he was among 18 witnesses acquainted with Padre Pio who
were confronted with a long list of questions dealing with issues
raised by the report.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so easy to prove that ... the mental state of the people
accusing Padre Pio was not a healthy mental state," Lotti said. "You
couldn't possibly think of those people as reliable."</TE>
<TE>   That investigation demolished the "wall" that was blocking Padre
Pio from beatification and sainthood, Lotti said.</TE>
<TE>   The path was made easier still by Pope John Paul II's decades-old
belief in Padre Pio's powers.</TE>
<TE>   An oft-repeated story is that John Paul II, while he was still
Krakow Bishop Karol Wojtyla, wrote a letter to Padre Pio asking him
to pray for Wanda Poltawska, a doctor friend who was dying of
terminal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He did so, from faraway San Giovanni Rotondo, and she quickly
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview published in a magazine put out by San
Giovanni Rotondo-based Tele Radio Padre Pio, Poltawska said it was
only in 1967, several years after her cure, when she met Padre Pio
for the first and only time, that she believed he had saved her.</TE>
<TE>   "He came directly in front of me [and said], 'Is everything OK
now?' " she recalled. "It was only at that moment that I thought he
had intervened, because before that I didn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   "In reality, the doctor who saw me in the hospital told me there
was a 5% possibility that it wasn't cancer but an inflammation," she
said. "So when they told me that the operation wasn't necessary, I
thought about this 5% chance."</TE>
<TE>   For many of Padre Pio's followers, the miracles attributed to him
might not in the end really matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Padre Pio is a saint because of his life," Lotti said. "It goes
beyond his charisma, his stigmata--those are not the essence of his
sanctity. Padre Pio's essence was his virtue, his ability to suffer,
his boundless generosity and also his balance.... We can say he had
his feet on the ground but his eyes were toward heaven."</TE>

<HD>FBI Joins Probe of Bombing in Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. federal agents joined Pakistani police Saturday as the
investigation into a bombing outside the American Consulate here in
Pakistan's largest city intensified and the death toll from the
attack rose to 11.</LD>
<LD>   The upward revision of those who died in Friday's explosion came
when police recovered parts of an additional body, apparently of a
female victim. She was believed to have been riding in a driver
education car that was blown apart by the blast.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-one people were injured, including six inside the consulate
compound who were hit by flying debris.</LD>
<TE>   Although both U.S. and Pakistani officials stressed that the
investigation was in its preliminary phase, they acknowledged that
evidence gathered during the initial 24 hours had heightened the
possibility that the blast might not have been the work of a suicide
bomber but was instead detonated by someone from a safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not ruling out a suicide bomb, but we're focusing on the
possibility of a remote control device," said Mukhtar Ahmed, who as
home secretary for Sindh province has overall responsibility for law
enforcement in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed and senior police officials involved in the case said that
preliminary questioning of relatives and friends cast doubt on the
likelihood that any of those killed was a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Police said none appeared either to have had contacts with
militant extremist groups or to fit the profile of such an attacker.</TE>
<TE>   The female driving instructor and three young women traveling in
one of the two vehicles suspected of carrying the explosives were on
their way back to school from a local motor vehicles department
office, where the three students had just attained their driver's
licenses. All the occupants of the car were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The second vehicle under suspicion, a small Suzuki commercial van,
carried a man and his niece who were on their way to pick up money
and jewelry from a bank safe deposit box in advance of the young
woman's planned marriage Saturday. Both were killed, and the remains
of the van ended up as an unrecognizable twisted piece of metal
crammed by the force of the explosion into small gazebo-like
structure in a park across the street from the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Fayaz Leghari, the deputy inspector general of police charged with
leading the investigation, said Pakistani forensic experts were
seeking assistance from recently arrived FBI teams to determine which
of the two vehicles carried the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "We've asked the FBI for help in this regard, and they've promised
to have an answer for us tomorrow or the day after," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota sedan belonging to the driving school had been recently
serviced at a local garage, and the mechanic was questioned Saturday
by police and then released, Leghari said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that investigators had not ruled out the possibility that
the bomb-carrying vehicle had been hijacked before being driven to
the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Another development under investigation by police was the bizarre
behavior of a young man, apparently Pakistani, outside the consulate
a few minutes before the blast. A prominent local journalist, Kamran
Khan, who was at the consulate's main entrance minutes before the
bomb detonated, said he was approached by a young man with a mobile
telephone and some papers who asked hurriedly, first, if the large
building was the American Embassy and then, whether the offices were
on the right or left side.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said he believed at the time that the young man was acting
strangely.</TE>
<TE>   Leghari said police had yet to determine the veracity of a note
faxed to several local newspapers late Friday by a group calling
itself Al Qanoon, or the Law, that claimed responsibility for the
attack. The note also denounced the United States and its ally
Pakistan and declared that the attack was merely the first volley in
a holy war that the group has declared against the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, the note added to the confusion surrounding the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking it seriously," Leghari said. "But this is the first
time we've had a note claiming responsibility for such an attack, so
we're not certain what to make of it."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM 'SHANGRI-LA'</KH>
<HD>Paradise Found: A Chinese Town Stakes Its Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>XIANGGELILA, China</DL>
<LD>The people of this mountain town live in paradise. They know this
because the Chinese government has told them so.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a paradise of the Communist, workers-of-the-world
variety. Rather, local officials insist that this area, high up on
the Tibetan plateau, is none other than Shangri-La, land of myth and
beauty, source of the fountain of youth. It's the heaven on Earth
described by James Hilton in his classic novel "Lost Horizon" and
immortalized by Frank Capra in the movie of the same name.</LD>
<LD>   Local authorities now have the title to prove it. Last month, this
town's name was formally changed from Zhongdian to "Xiang-ge-li-la,"
the Chinese transliteration of Shangri-La. The switch was approved by
China's top leaders, whose decision laid to rest a bitter spat over
which town would be allowed to bill itself as the "real" utopia of
Hilton's novel and, as a result, watch the tourists roll in.</LD>
<TE>   Several hamlets around here vied for the honor. Zhongdian
marshaled scholars who argued that it most closely resembled the Eden
that Hilton described, a wind-swept Himalayan valley with a lamasery
set high on a ledge and a colossal, mysterious mountain towering over
monks and residents alike.</TE>
<TE>   "The book refers to certain identifying characteristics," said He
Zhenwen, a cabby used to rattling off the criteria to skeptical
visitors. "There are Tibetans there. And Buddhists. And a river that
forks into three branches. We have all of that. So it's pretty
incontrovertible that we're the real McCoy."</TE>
<TE>   Incontrovertible, no--"Lost Horizon" doesn't actually mention a
river with three forks. But possible? Yes.</TE>
<TE>   In Hilton's jolly romp of a book published in 1933, three Britons
and a fugitive American stumble into Shangri-La after their plane
gets hijacked out of India and crash-lands somewhere on the Tibetan
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   The group gets taken in by the monastery, which, it turns out, is
presided over by a 200-year-old Catholic priest who has figured out
how to slow the aging process through a combination of "drug-taking
and deep-breathing exercises," Hilton wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The inmates of the monastery spend their ever-expanding time
learning new languages, playing Chopin on the piano, thinking deep
thoughts and soaking in green porcelain bathtubs shipped in from
Akron, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The book doesn't specify exactly where this enchanted sanctuary
is. Capra chose the Ojai area to double as paradise in his 1937
Oscar-winning film.</TE>
<TE>   For many years after "Lost Horizon" was published, the only
Shangri-La most people knew was the U.S. presidential retreat, which
Franklin D. Roosevelt dubbed Shangri-La after Hilton's fictitious
wonderland. (It later became Camp David under President Eisenhower,
who thought the name Shangri-La was "just a little too fancy for a
Kansas farm boy.")</TE>
<TE>   Hilton, however, was known to have based his vision of paradise on
the real-life writings of Joseph Rock, an eccentric Austrian American
botanist who explored western China and Tibet during the 1920s and
'30s and recorded his experiences in National Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, an area resident familiar with "Lost Horizon"
told officials that this region was the inspiration for Shangri-La.
Quick to smell a marketing opportunity, the officials leaped into
action.</TE>
<TE>   Zhongdian set the pace. Local Communist cadres dubbed their town's
new airport Shangri-La Airport. They jump-started construction on
four-star hotels. They convened a conference on the identification of
Zhongdian as the utopia in Hilton's novel, and they published
coffee-table books such as "Shangri-La: A Fascinating Land," which
grandly claims that at 9:30 p.m. on Sept. 14, 1997, Shangri-La "was
discovered here." No further explanation is given.</TE>
<TE>   The rival town of Deqin struggled to keep up. It, too, began
building tourist venues. But it has no airport to compete with
Zhongdian's easy access. Travelers who want to visit Deqin--which
boasts better scenery, with jagged, snow-covered peaks stretching for
miles--must fly to Zhongdian first, then board a bus for a sometimes
perilous six-hour ride.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders barely raised a blip on the radar. One sad case
was the bucolic town of Daocheng, which sits on the Tibetan plateau
but is technically part of China's Sichuan province, across from
Tibet proper. (Zhongdian and Deqin lie in China's Yunnan province,
which also borders Tibet.)</TE>
<TE>   "Zhongdian has an airport and a highway," Gao Tianfu, Daocheng's
party secretary, told a Chinese newspaper. "What do I have? A horse,
a lantern and a tent."</TE>
<TE>   The jockeying for official status as Shangri-La continued until
late last year, when a delegation of Zhongdian officials journeyed to
Beijing to make their case--in secret, some say.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the State Council, China's Cabinet, declared
Zhongdian the winner. The town threw a party last month to celebrate
its victory; banners festooned around the city exhorted residents to
"warmly celebrate Zhongdian's name change to Shangri-La."</TE>
<TE>   Its efforts at self-promotion over the last few years have
apparently begun producing dividends--not just for Zhongdian, but
also for surrounding communities such as Deqin, which has benefited
from the influx of tourists. In 2001, a million visitors flocked to
the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of visitors is increasing every year," said Liang
Yong, an official in Zhongdian's propaganda bureau. "Of course, the
more the better."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees; some fear that the area will be spoiled by
over-commercialization and rampant tourism.</TE>
<TE>   In "Lost Horizon," Hilton, too, warned of the outside world
encroaching on his hidden paradise, although he was referring to the
more serious threat of impending war.</TE>
<TE>   Shielded from the rest of civilization, "Shangri-La was lovely
then," Hilton wrote, "touched with the mystery that lies at the core
of all loveliness."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the current fanfare, and the proliferation of hotels and
kitsch-filled souvenir shops trading on the Shangri-La name, little
of that mystery appears to be left.</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Gathering Strength in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Operatives are hiding in cities, with support from
local extremists. The nation is the terrorists' new hub, U.S.
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN, JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Al Qaeda terrorist operatives are hiding in Pakistan's
cities after forming or renewing alliances with local Muslim
extremist networks that have helped provide safe houses for
communications, training and logistics, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The result, they fear, is that America's closest ally in Central
Asia has in effect replaced Afghanistan as a command-and-control
center for at least some of the battered remnants of Osama bin
Laden's terrorist army.</LD>
<LD>   "They don't operate with impunity there like they did in
Afghanistan," a U.S. intelligence official said. "But they have lots
of supporters, and it's easy for them to blend in."</LD>
<TE>   A Justice Department official agreed, saying Al Qaeda members
appear to have gone "wherever they want" in Pakistan's teeming
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "They're hiding in plain sight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp. think tank in
Santa Monica, says Bin Laden might have viewed Pakistan as part of a
"business continuity plan to ensure survival of leadership,
financing, communications and so on" in case Al Qaeda lost its
sanctuary in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say that Al Qaeda has made similar efforts to regroup
by merging with local Muslim extremist groups in Africa, the Middle
East and Southeast Asia. These makeshift alliances are more
decentralized than the network long directed by Bin Laden, officials
say, and thus might be more difficult for outsiders to penetrate.</TE>
<TE>   Since last fall, the United States and its allies say they have
foiled more than a dozen terrorist plots around the world and
arrested more than 2,400 suspects in nearly 90 countries.</TE>
<TE>   But more than half of Al Qaeda's known leaders remain at large,
including several linked to the Sept. 11 assaults and other major
attacks. Officials are especially eager to catch Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed, an Al Qaeda operative linked to almost every attack against
the United States since the bombing of the World Trade Center in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence analysts still believe that Bin Laden and his
top aides have found refuge somewhere along Pakistan's long and
lawless border with Afghanistan. Broad pockets of local sympathizers
are said to exist in the semiautonomous tribal areas of Baluchistan
and North-West Frontier Province.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. and Pakistani officials now estimate that hundreds more
Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters who fled the war in Afghanistan have
disappeared into Pakistan. Many are thought to have linked up with
like-minded local groups opposed to secular Muslim regimes and to the
Western powers that support them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backers Mount Attacks</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda supporters appear to have been responsible for at least
two suicide attacks on Westerners in Pakistani cities this year, U.S.
officials say. Al Qaeda leaders and followers have been arrested or
tracked in nearly every major Pakistani city, including Karachi in
the south, Lahore and Faisalabad in the east, Peshawar in the west,
and Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the capital, in the north.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, U.S. officials say, Pakistani militants and even
some members of the government's Inter-Services Intelligence agency,
known as the ISI, have openly supported Al Qaeda and have used an
informal underground railroad to help fleeing terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The ISI is filled with extremists, and I don't think they're
trying very hard to find these people," said a recently retired U.S.
counter-terrorism official who is familiar with the manhunt. "In
fact, they're actively trying to hide them."</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official downplayed ISI's role, citing recent
intelligence reports. But "that doesn't rule out the possibility that
there are still links between rogue elements of ISI and Al Qaeda," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's presence in Pakistan poses a growing danger and dilemma
for both Washington and Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who visited Pakistan last
week, and other U.S. officials have offered strong public support for
President Pervez Musharraf's military regime, which has provided
airstrips, bases, fuel, intelligence and other critical help to U.S.
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, many U.S. officials are increasingly voicing
concerns that Musharraf's crackdown on local terrorist groups this
year has largely failed. Several banned groups have morphed or
spawned virulent offshoots that have launched several attacks against
Westerners this year. Authorities haven't solved Friday's car bombing
outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, which killed at least 11
Pakistanis and wounded dozens more. A previously unknown group has
claimed responsibility, but U.S. officials said the FBI is
investigating whether Al Qaeda might be linked to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials now suspect that groups linked to Al
Qaeda were responsible for a May 8 bus bombing in Karachi that killed
11 French engineers and a March 17 grenade attack in Islamabad that
killed four Protestant International Church congregants, including a
U.S. Embassy employee and her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest last month of an American-born alleged Al Qaeda
operative, Jose Padilla, after he flew to Chicago on what authorities
called a scouting mission for a possible radioactive bomb attack,
suggested just how widespread Al Qaeda may have become.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say that Padilla, who used the Muslim name Abdullah
al Muhajir, studied bomb-making early this year at an Al Qaeda safe
house in Lahore, met with senior Al Qaeda officials in March at
another safe house in Karachi and traveled elsewhere in the country.
Pakistani police arrested Padilla's alleged accomplice in Rawalpindi.</TE>
<TE>   Although Padilla's role was not known at the time, U.S. and
Pakistani officials raided the Lahore safe house where he had stayed
as well as suspected Al Qaeda compounds in several other cities March
28. Abu Zubeida, Al Qaeda's operations chief, and several of his
senior aides were captured after a shootout that night at a house in
Faisalabad.</TE>
<TE>   US. authorities say Abu Zubeida approved Padilla's proposed "dirty
bomb" plot at a meeting in December in Afghanistan and later traveled
with him in Pakistan. Abu Zubeida, U.S. officials say, had been
responsible for rebuilding the Al Qaeda network inside Pakistan
before his capture.</TE>
<TE>   A senior intelligence official said Al Qaeda "already had a
presence" in Pakistan "so they don't require other groups" for
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "They have always had loose alliances with fellow travelers with
similar goals and motives," this official added. "The memberships are
very loose. People go back and forth from one group to the other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Group's Reach Spreads</TE>
<TE>   Arrests elsewhere also point to the terrorist group's spread.
Saudi Arabia acknowledged Saturday that three men arrested in Morocco
on suspicion of planning attacks on U.S. and British ships in the
Strait of Gibraltar are Saudi citizens. Morocco said they claim to be
Al Qaeda operatives. The attacks would have been similar to the
suicide bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen--an operation
also linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   As for Pakistan, the State Department, in its annual report on
global terrorism issued last month, said Islamabad had "rendered
unprecedented levels of cooperation to support the war on terrorism."
The report noted that Islamabad broke ties with the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan after Sept. 11, froze hundreds of thousands of dollars in
suspected terrorist assets and moved to bring radical Muslim schools
that served as "breeding grounds for terrorists" into the mainstream
educational system.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government also outlawed several terrorist groups and
detained more than 2,000 domestic "extremists," the report said. But
most have now been released and might be active again.</TE>
<TE>   Questions remain, the State Department warned, about whether
"Musharraf's 'get tough' policy with local militants and his stated
pledge to oppose terrorism anywhere will be fully implemented and
sustained."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is Pakistan's history of covert support and
overt tolerance for Muslim extremist groups, starting with the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Tomsen, U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan from 1989 to
1992, said the ISI provided the "weapons, resources and intelligence"
to the Taliban as the Islamic movement rose to power, and then was
"intimately involved" as the Talibs forged ties with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   On its other border, Pakistan provided similar support for years
to Muslim zealots fighting to oust India from the disputed territory
of Kashmir. Terrorist attacks against civilians in Kashmir and in
India brought the two nuclear armed rivals to the brink of war in
recent weeks, but the crisis eased after Musharraf moved to stop
Pakistani militants from crossing into the Indian-held portion of
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, however, little attention was paid to other
Pakistani terrorist groups that share Bin Laden's doctrinaire view of
Islam and his hatred of the West. Many attended Al Qaeda training
camps in Afghanistan, or received arms and other support from Bin
Laden, even if they didn't formally join Al Qaeda. The contacts
apparently paid off after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani official said his government estimates that at least
several hundred Al Qaeda fighters slipped into Pakistan's 10 tribal
territories--mostly in the so-called Pushtun Belt that runs from
Quetta to north of Peshawar--last winter. But they were exposed to
U.S. satellites and other forces in the open desert, he said, and the
cities seemed far safer.</TE>
<TE>   Many had money to buy vehicles, supplies and guides from local
warlords, this official said. And many, he said, reached out to a
broad underground network of Bin Laden sympathizers and "fellow
travelers," mostly urban Pakistani militants.</TE>
<TE>   "The network is there. You have religious groups that were
sanctioned for years that no one was shutting down and are operating
freely," the Pakistani official said. "They are providing them with
sanctuary.... It is an ongoing problem. We are cracking down on them,
but they are still out there."</TE>
<TE>   Two Pakistani groups in particular--Lashkar-e-Taiba and
Jaish-e-Mohammed--have long espoused the jihad cause against
non-Muslims. They now appear to have provided haven or other
assistance to Al Qaeda terrorists, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Lashkar-e-Taiba was affiliated with the safe house
in Faisalabad where Abu Zubeida and his top aides were arrested. And
Jaish-e-Mohammed was linked to the January kidnapping and, later,
beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department labeled both groups as foreign terrorist
organizations in December, empowering Washington to freeze any of the
groups' assets in the United States and to urge other nations to
block their funds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Very Worrisome' Trend</TE>
<TE>   A former Clinton administration counter-terrorism official said
Pakistan's increasing tangle of terrorist groups and their spinoffs
is "very worrisome."</TE>
<TE>   "The general turmoil has made it much more attractive for all
jihadists in the region to go after American targets," he said. The
long-range danger is that local Muslim militants backed by Al Qaeda
could destabilize Pakistan, overthrow the government and set a
dangerous new course for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is entirely within the realms of possibility that Pakistan
could end up with an Islamic leadership that is a lot less
sympathetic to the United States," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tashbih Sayyed, the Pakistani-born editor of Pakistan Today,
published in Southern California, said the war in Afghanistan only
"destroyed an outpost" of terrorism. "The main infrastructure
remained intact," he said. And Pakistan, he warned, "is kind of a
meeting place now for all the radical forces in the world."</TE>

<HD>The Glue That Holds Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Government: Its peoples share a bond even though regional
loyalties intrude on central rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In a country lacking a postal system, paved roads and a telephone
network, the newly empowered authorities in this capital couldn't
exert their influence over the far-flung regions and rebellious
warlords even if they tried.</LD>
<LD>   But the patchwork of ethnic fiefdoms that, stitched together, form
Afghanistan are beyond the reach of central rule for more reasons
than poor logistics. Power-hungry regional kingpins and hidebound
local traditions provide more comforting refuge to many Afghans than
does the lofty concept of a united, multiethnic nation.</LD>
<LD>   Still, there is some nationalist mortar that holds together the
ethnic blocks and makes Afghanistan and its varied peoples one
country. Unlike Europe's failed multiethnic federations--the Yugoslav
union of Balkan peoples and Czechoslovakia's myriad Slavs--the
Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and others in this jigsaw puzzle of
a nation take pride in their shared Afghan label.</LD>
<TE>   Much as Americans can embrace being Southerners, New Yorkers,
Angelenos or Kansans and still be moved by the sight of the Stars and
Stripes, so, too, Afghans feel that more binds them than breaks them
apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the common Afghan man does see himself first as an
Afghan. Do you think this country would still be around if the
average Afghan man hadn't been so much devoted to his home country
and identity in these 23 years of disasters here?" incoming President
Hamid Karzai replies when asked what unites his disparate people.
"It's precisely because of the strength of the common Afghan's
identity with it that keeps this country together."</TE>
<TE>   The past week's loya jirga, a traditional gathering of regional
delegates to decide the nation's future, reflected this collective
will to project Afghanistan and Afghans as a single entity, says
Ashref Ghani, Karzai's chief advisor and a delegate to the
freewheeling forum.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials acknowledge that central authority doesn't
yet reach much beyond Kabul. Ethnic clashes between rival chieftains
in the north are impervious to appeals from officials here to unite
in the daunting effort to rebuild a country largely reduced to
rubble. The opium politics of the east still promise a better life
for poppy farmers than the fledgling government in Kabul. And in the
conservative south, especially around Kandahar, the ousted Taliban
still enjoys much allegiance from Afghans who reject any notion of
being ruled by leaders seen as Western puppets.</TE>
<TE>   Although Karzai acknowledges that his reach remains limited, he
blames the gaps in national reconciliation on the legacy of foreign
interventions. The 1979-89 Soviet occupation forced the fiercely
independent Afghans to wage armed resistance from the fringes, often
with the aid, arms and counsel of self-interested neighbors and
Soviet foes.</TE>
<TE>   The invasions are over and the internecine fighting that has
ravaged Afghanistan for the last decade also appears to be in check
following a six-month power-sharing agreement worked out in Germany
late last year.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now, as Karzai and his government colleagues see it,
is to rapidly repair the damage so Afghans can again trade and
travel, restoring the cultural and commercial bonds that made this
country the heart of the fabled Silk Road.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan, unlike European multiethnic states forced together by
peace treaties, emerged to unite ethnic enclaves at the behest of the
peoples guided by 18th century king Ahmad Shah Durani. Despite
subsequent invasions and resistance, it has largely retained its
original borders. United in their triumph of ousting intruders--first
the British in the 19th century, then the Soviets and most recently
the Taliban's collaborators from Al Qaeda--Afghans tend to see their
shared nationality as a geopolitical strength rather than a weakening
of their cultural identity. But with so much destruction around them,
rivalries and resentment can easily flare as aid is doled out
disproportionately. It will take as much domestic initiative as
foreign assistance to solidify Afghans' commitment to living in a
cohesive, multiethnic state.</TE>
<TE>   "I always tell my Afghan friends that they can't expect foreigners
to love their country more than they do," the U.S. special
presidential envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, says of his
former countrymen's frequent appeals abroad for more peacekeeping
troops to keep armed factions apart.</TE>
<TE>   Key advisors to the central government insist that their
dependence on foreign protection is temporary. Like the U.S.
officials providing the training for the fledgling national army,
Afghan leaders say the freshly minted domestic troops will gradually
fill the security vacuums that have allowed regional warlords to
thwart central rule.</TE>
<TE>   International relief, though slow in arriving, also aims to
enhance national cohesion through means such as mass media that can
transcend self-interested local propaganda. The U.S. Agency for
International Development, for instance, has distributed 30,000
shortwave radios to 11 provinces so foreign and national news reports
can be received even in the most remote areas, says the agency's
Kabul representative, Craig Buck.</TE>
<TE>   Even the foreign military presence in the country, the nearly
17,000 troops and special forces of the U.S.-led coalition against
terrorism, are trying to wage a hearts-and-minds campaign to steer
isolated peoples toward respect for central authority. In the
volatile southern regions, where most U.S. forces are stationed,
roving "psy-ops" vehicles blare broadcasts in the Pashto language
explaining why Kabul has invited the anti-terrorism troops here and
how ridding Afghanistan of Al Qaeda fighters will enhance security
and allow the country to mend, says coalition spokesman Col. Roger
King.</TE>
<TE>   Other foreign observers of Afghanistan's rapid transformation
agree with the government's contention that what divides Afghans
isn't ethnicity but their recent history of abuse. And what unites
them, the observers say, is a desperate desire to recover the
Afghanistan that existed before the Soviet invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, I think Afghans are committed to national unity. I think
they are proud of being recognized again as part of the international
community," says Klaus-Peter Klaiber, the European Union's special
envoy here. "There is a very strong majority in favor of a successful
political process. People want peace and unity in the place of
division and war."</TE>
<TE>   At the loya jirga, common threads emerged that show nationwide
bonds are re-forming, says Ghani, the Karzai advisor. Most notable,
he says, was the unified voice of the women delegates pushing their
male colleagues to put conflict behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "This was probably the most open exchange between groups of
political leaders and groups of citizens that this country has ever
witnessed. It was truly exciting," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Afghanistan do recognize that those who are here
represent the whole of Afghanistan--all communities, all points of
view, the diaspora, refugees, internally displaced," U.N. Special
Representative Lakhdar Brahimi says of the loya jirga, which he
describes as a positive experience in acting for the collective good.</TE>
<TE>   Although Afghans and outsiders alike insist that this is a nation
on the mend, their optimism is still shadowed by those wielding armed
power in the provinces.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, some regions that make up this country of 27
million appear so divergent and dismissive of Kabul as to be
independent countries in everything but name.</TE>
<TE>   The regional governor in Jalalabad nurtures popular support with
his defiance of central edicts to destroy the opium-producing poppy
fields, pragmatically protecting the livelihoods of local farmers
over the lives of drug-dependent Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   In the volatile north, Uzbek and Tajik commanders who fought
together against the Taliban now turn their guns on each other. And
Karzai's sole attempt at cooling the hot spots around Mazar-i-Sharif
has, in the view of some observers, made the regional confrontations
worse. Karzai alienated other minorities this spring by announcing
that Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek, was his "special
representative" in the north. Dostum is one of the most entrenched
regional chieftains in the country, able to soak travelers and
merchants for extortionate "taxes" that keep his army armed and ready
for the next conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The northern territories often function like separate countries.
The Tajik-dominated Jamiat party controls the police force in Mazar.
But as soon as visitors pass out of the city on its western edge,
Dostum's Russian-made tanks are waiting to greet them. The fiery
general, who is an influential figure in the national Defense
Ministry, also runs a virtual ministry of foreign affairs in Mazar,
issuing visas and hosting local "embassies" from Iran and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kabul has disarmed under the presence of foreign
peacekeepers, other cities and villages are still governed by the
gun. Shepherds, street cleaners and civil servants alike tote their
Kalashnikov rifles around with the easy indifference of Westerners
carrying their lunch boxes and briefcases.</TE>
<TE>   What separates Afghans in central regions like Bamian from the
capital has more to do with recent history than with ethnic
relations. The local militia, under regional strongman Mohammed Karim
Khalili, directs the distribution of food aid and liaisons with U.S.
Special Forces. Khalili's fighters have the best new boots and
equipment, while the local economy, which once prospered with a
steady flow of international tourists visiting Bamian's famed
cliff-side Buddhas, faltered under the Taliban and now has virtually
collapsed because the fundamentalists blew up the statues.</TE>
<TE>   In Herat, the unchallenged political and military boss is Ismail
Khan, a former moujahedeen commander who built a reputation as a
fierce fighter against the Soviet occupation. Khan maintains a
sizable private army and mingles regularly with U.S. Special Forces.</TE>
<TE>   Many Afghans living under such resilient warlords feel that they
are better off with the devils they know than risking a shift in
allegiance to the unfamiliar faces in far-off Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the regional warlords, Khan says he supports the
Karzai government, but he has yet to surrender any real power to the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city and
wellspring of the Taliban. A sullen, defeated place hit hard by U.S.
bombing, Kandahar is regularly papered with "night
letters"--clandestine postings urging citizens to rise up against the
Americans and the U.S.-backed local administration.</TE>
<TE>   The list of errant regions is depressingly long, but some local
chieftains have proved to be more puffed-up rhetoric than real
threats to cohesion. When eastern renegade Bacha Khan warned on the
eve of the loya jirga that failing to elect Mohammad Zaher Shah, the
former monarch, as head of state would reignite civil war, his fiery
admonitions were mostly ignored beyond his own remote region around
the city of Khowst.</TE>
<TE>   As Afghans turn to the absorbing business of rebuilding shattered
houses, schools, roads, shops and desperately needed communications,
the rewards of collective initiative might begin making themselves
felt, reminding Afghans that a prosperous multiethnic nation must be
more than the sum of its parts.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Andersen Found Guilty of Obstruction</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury says memo from firm's lawyer showed intent to
hinder a securities probe of Enron officials. Defense claims judge
offered flawed instructions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A federal jury convicted accounting firm Arthur Andersen of
obstruction of justice Saturday, sending the firm to the brink of
extinction and giving the Justice Department a crucial win in its
criminal probe of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors said the verdict arose not from Andersen's shredding of
Enron documents--the crux of the government's case--but from the
actions of an Andersen staff attorney who has not been charged and
who invoked her right not to testify at the trial.</LD>
<LD>   The jury of nine men and three women deliberated for about 72
hours over 10 days before reaching a unanimous decision. Andersen,
long ago revered as the conscience of the accounting industry,
becomes the first major auditor convicted of a felony.</LD>
<TE>   Sentencing is set for Oct. 11, when the firm could face a $500,000
fine. The Securities and Exchange Commission also was expected to bar
the 89-year-old firm from auditing public companies as a result of
the verdict, but Andersen notified the SEC on Saturday that it would
cease those audits by Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen already has lost its biggest clients, but the firm
nonetheless said it plans to appeal, citing what it called U.S.
District Judge Melinda Harmon's flawed jury instructions and evidence
rulings.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy U.S. Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson said the evidence in the
case proved that "Andersen intentionally interfered with an official
investigation concerning Andersen's client Enron Corp. when it
destroyed tons of papers, documents and a large quantity of
electronic information" last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But at a news conference after the verdict, four jurors said
document destruction was not the key factor in their decision. The
jurors said they voted to convict because they believed that Andersen
staff attorney Nancy Temple had criminal intent when she urged
Houston-based auditor David B. Duncan on Oct. 16 to revise an
internal memo regarding a damaging Enron earnings release.</TE>
<TE>   The memo documented a dispute about how Enron should classify
about $1 billion in charges against earnings that it would be
disclosing in a third-quarter press release. Enron wanted to downplay
the charges by characterizing them as nonrecurring, but Andersen
auditors believed that description could be misleading to investors
because the losses stemmed from the energy trader's core business.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, Duncan wrote that he informed Enron Chief Accounting
Officer Richard A. Causey of Andersen's concerns, but Enron used the
term nonrecurring anyway. Enron's news release disclosed for the
first time the extent of losses from its off-balance-sheet
partnerships and triggered the energy giant's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In her Oct. 16 e-mail, Temple asked Duncan to remove her name from
the list of recipients of his memo because she feared being called as
a witness in litigation, and asked him to delete language suggesting
that Andersen found the release "misleading."</TE>
<TE>   Jury foreman Oscar Criner, a computer science professor at Texas
Southern University, said the panel largely dismissed the
prosecution's evidence of document destruction and its star witness,
Duncan. Criner said jurors concluded the altered internal memo,
however, was "a smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur Andersen did not approve that [press release], and Enron
went along anyway and did it," Criner said. "Then Arthur Andersen set
about to change things, to alter documents to keep [information] away
from the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, prosecutors cited the Oct. 16 e-mail from Temple
to Duncan as evidence the firm feared an SEC inquiry and had a motive
to shred documents. But prosecutors hadn't argued that Temple's
directive was an act of obstruction. The March 7 indictment of the
firm centered on Andersen's "wholesale destruction" of documents and
makes no mention of Temple's instruction to alter the memo.</TE>
<TE>   But outside the courthouse, Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Weissmann
said the drafts of Duncan's internal memo, which reflected the
sequence of the changes, were "exactly what was intended to be
destroyed" in the firm's shredding. Weissmann said the memo was "a
terrific document" for the jury to examine in considering its
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen attorneys expressed disbelief at the jury's logic but
said it meant that jurors had rejected the prosecutors' main
argument--that Andersen shredded documents to impede the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   I take the jury's remarks [as] a complete vindication of
Andersen's position," said defense attorney Charles Rothfeld. "It's
bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers also noted that the firm didn't learn of the SEC
inquiry into Enron until Oct. 19, three days after Temple sent her
e-mail to Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lawyers further suggested that jurors acted under duress.
After seven days of deliberations, the jury told the court Wednesday
that it was deadlocked. That prompted Harmon to give them the
so-called Allen charge, urging them to continue deliberating in hopes
of avoiding a hung jury and a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin vowed to appeal but noted that
an appeal could not be filed until after Andersen's sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said the indictment of the firm raised "serious, troubling"
questions for corporations considering notifying authorities of
potential crimes committed by their own employees. Andersen had
notified the Justice Department of its destruction of Enron-related
files.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defections Leave Future of Andersen in Doubt</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's immediate future was not clear. The firm has hired a
reorganization specialist and has signed a letter of intent to sell
its consulting practice to KPMG. Most of its major clients already
have signed with other firms, and industry experts believe that
Andersen eventually will file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The company, once 26,000 strong, now is down to about 10,000
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "When clients go, the people have to follow," said Avedick
Poladian, senior managing partner of Andersen's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   C.E. Andrews, a top partner who attended much of the trial, said
outside court that the firm would "regroup and reassess" its future.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not regret going through this trial," Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the guilty verdict, accounting industry experts had
predicted Andersen's demise because it had lost too many clients and
partners to carry on as a viable major firm. But conviction was seen
as a fatal blow, because it would deny Andersen the ability to audit
its biggest customers--publicly traded companies.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials have not ruled out further action
against Andersen and its executives amid the continuing investigation
into Enron's collapse, which cost thousands of jobs and billions of
dollars in investment and retirement losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still looking at everything. We're not finished with Arthur
Andersen," Leslie Caldwell, chief of the Justice Department's Enron
task force, said in Houston on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell and others said the conviction gives the government
momentum in its Enron probe. But some observers said the trial
exposed holes in the government's case going forward.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's key witness, Duncan, vouched for much of his
firm's auditing conclusions, opening up a possible defense if
prosecutors decided to pursue accounting-fraud charges against former
Enron executives. Moreover, the length of deliberations suggested
that the Justice Department's evidence is far from overwhelming, some
legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't win a conviction in an hour in Harris County, Texas,
where Andersen and Enron teamed up to hurt a lot of people, you've
got problems," said David Berg, a veteran Houston attorney who
monitored the case. Berg added that if he were representing any
potential defendants, "I would be putting on my jury trial suit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firm Faced Uphill Battle in Courtroom</TE>
<TE>   Andersen faced tough obstacles heading into court. The undisputed
facts of the case appeared to tilt against Andersen: on Oct. 23,
after he learned of an SEC inquiry into Enron, Duncan summoned his
lieutenants and directed them to comply with Andersen's document
policy, which called for discarding drafts and other records deemed
unnecessary. Moreover, prosecutors had to prove only that a single
Andersen executive acted with criminal intent in persuading another
employee to shred documents.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors gained another edge by winning an early procedural
battle, obtaining permission to introduce previous Andersen audit
failures from clients Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. as
evidence of motive to obstruct. In court, prosecutors said the
accounting firm, on corporate probation for those earlier problems,
knew that fallout from Enron's questionable accounting might lead to
a sort of third strike against it and result in harsher sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's legal department then devised a way to shield Andersen
from regulators and investor lawsuits, prosecutors said: Temple on
Oct. 12 urged the Enron audit team to comply with the firm's
little-invoked document-retention policy. By suddenly instructing
auditors to apply the policy to their Enron files in October,
prosecutors said, the firm acted with intent to shred documents of
keen interest to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's defense team argued that no one at the firm acted with
criminal intent. The firm said the Oct. 12 e-mail from Temple was
intended to encourage accountants to properly document internal
discussions. Andersen executives in Houston, the firm said, believed
they needed to finalize and organize their files to respond to
potential accounting questions from their superiors in Chicago, or
from Enron management.</TE>
<TE>   In the minds of the jury, the two sides apparently fought to a
draw--at least initially. Jurors said they took a vote almost
immediately after deliberations began and found themselves split
about even.</TE>
<TE>   After a week of debate, they notified Harmon that they were unable
to reach a unanimous decision. Harmon then implored them to reach a
verdict "without surrendering your conscientious conviction."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jurors Sought Aid in Reaching Verdict</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the jurors sent a note asking whether they could
find the firm guilty even if they could not agree on which of
Andersen's employees had the intent to impede the SEC inquiry. After
an impassioned debate by the two sides, Harmon issued a ruling that
favored the prosecution, instructing the panel that they did not have
to agree on who the guilty executive was, as long as they all
believed that someone at Andersen was guilty.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews Saturday and in their answers on a court verdict
form, the jurors said Harmon's decision ultimately had no bearing on
their decision because they had come to agree that Temple was the one
with the required intent.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the six-week trial, Andersen had signaled that it was
gathering ammunition for a possible appeal. Hardin has said Harmon
erred by allowing prosecutors to present evidence related to its
audits of Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. He also said the
judge created "reversible error" by letting the government discuss
personal notes taken by Temple, who had invoked her 5th Amendment
right.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said they were confident the verdict would stand.</TE>
<TE>   The court record would be "extremely solid on appeal," said
Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell. He added that the verdict should
serve as warning to the accounting industry to "get their priorities
straight."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One fall day in 2000, in the midst of the California energy crisis,
S. David Freeman found himself debating by telephone with Enron's
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the then highflying Texas energy
firm.</LD>
<LD>   Freeman, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power at
the time, had joined other California officials in pushing the
federal government for price controls as a means to rein in a runaway
wholesale market.</LD>
<LD>   Government intervention, Lay warned Freeman by telephone, would
not work. Extended price caps would keep the market from correcting
itself, and frighten away future investment in power plants. Lay, as
Freeman recalls it, ended the conversation with this parting shot:</LD>
<TE>   "Well, Dave, in the final analysis, it doesn't matter what you
crazy people in California do, because I got smart guys out there who
can always figure out how to make money."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on it now, amid revelations about "Death Star" and
"Get Shorty" and other colorfully named tactics concocted by Enron
traders, Freeman figures he should have paid more attention: "What he
was telling me, in a sophisticated way, was that they were going to
game the system."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few weeks, internal memos, notes and other energy
industry materials have kept popping into public view, suggesting in
sometimes vivid detail just how the "smart guys," as Lay called them,
worked to manipulate the California energy market in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The paper flow, which began in early May with the release of a set
of so-called "smoking gun" memos from Enron, has prompted regulators,
politicians and other industry figures to begin reexamining the root
causes of the crisis and even to consider anew that most fundamental
of questions: Was there, in fact, a shortage at all?</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators, who long maintained that the mess was one of
the state's own making--and who, in turn, were maligned by California
leaders as cops asleep on the beat--seem to have executed an
about-face.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick H. Wood III, the former Texas regulator who late last year
was appointed chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by
President Bush, said that initially he considered the California
debacle the result of a flawed deregulation plan. Now he's not so
sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't walk in here thinking we needed to do a names, numbers,
times and dates and 'Who's your alibi?' investigation of the
California market, and now I do," Wood said in an interview. "That
kind of analysis is something that we really do need to do ... to get
the definitive understanding of what happened in the California
market."</TE>
<TE>   While Wood and others say the evidence on manipulation is not yet
conclusive, California officials who contended all along that the
crisis was artificial are no longer being dismissed as conspiracy
theorists. There is more at work now than sorting out the spin and
revising history.</TE>
<TE>   Although the crisis faded away a year ago, the Enron memos and
subsequent disclosures have given a push to state efforts to retrieve
some of the fortune spent to keep the lights on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to Revise Long-Term Contracts</TE>
<TE>   California officials have demanded nearly $9 billion in refunds
from power companies on the grounds that wholesale electricity rates
violated a federal requirement of "just and reasonable" prices. They
have also sought a restructuring of long-term contracts negotiated
with generators--often at steep prices--to keep electricity flowing.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, the disclosures have poked a hole or two in the
vapor of mythology that enveloped the crisis almost from the start.
Bottlenecks on the north-south transmission lines, air quality rules,
drought in the Pacific Northwest, overworked plants, the demands of
the burgeoning California computer culture--all these and more were
blamed at various times for driving California's electrical system to
the edge of collapse. Even Christmas tree lights had a moment in the
defendant's dock.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony before a U.S. Senate committee, state Sen. Joseph
Dunn (D-Santa Ana) described what he called the "evolution of
excuses" this way: "Prices skyrocket and consumers are told they are
suffering the short-term 'pain' of deregulation. Prices remain high,
and generators falsely explain that California is a victim of its own
demand--despite ranking 48th among the 50 states in per capita energy
usage and a demand growth of just 4%, year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we are told there is an outright shortage--a myth that
persists today. Next they tell us that the crisis is the result of
bad rules, the generators' and traders' way of justifying
manipulative behavior. The Enron memoranda and the recent admissions
by other market participants reveal the truth about the cause of the
energy crisis:</TE>
<TE>   "Certain market participants gamed the system to reap excess
profits on the backs of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Robert McCullough, an Oregon-based energy consultant and early
advocate of the view that market manipulation, not scarcity, was
propelling the runaway prices, cited several other myths he would
like to dispel, including:</TE>
<TE>   * A Pacific Northwest drought depleted hydroelectric supplies, an
important source of California energy in summertime peak hours. Hydro
supplies were just slightly below average in the summer of 2000, when
wholesale prices started to soar, he said. Oddly enough, when the
prices declined in mid-2001, hydro supplies were much worse than they
had been the previous summer.</TE>
<TE>   * Plants were so overworked that they kept going down for repairs
just as they were needed most. On the contrary, McCullough said,
citing Environmental Protection Agency data, power plants operated in
California by AES Corp., Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant and Reliant ran
at only 50% of capacity from May 2000 to June 2001. Plants of similar
construction and vintage outside of California, he said, were working
much harder.</TE>
<TE>   * Congested power lines caused six days of blackouts, and dozens
of near misses, in early 2001. McCullough, citing Bonneville Power
Administration reports, said that transmission lines from the Pacific
Northwest to California were never fully loaded at those times.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what was going on," McCullough said, " ... just didn't
pencil out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Energy Generators Insist No Gouging Occurred</TE>
<TE>   Experts still disagree over just how big a role manipulation
played in the crisis. Private energy generators still insist that
California dug a hole for itself by not building enough power plants
and by bungling its deregulation effort. And what Californians call
"gouging," they tend to describe as playing by the rules as the state
wrote them.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many of the so-called industry "myths," as McCullough and
others describe them, do have some basis in truth. There was a
drought in the Northwest. Plant construction did slow down for a time
in California, as it had across the West. There were clogs in the
transmission system and flaws in the electricity market design.</TE>
<TE>   "Every charlatan starts with a kernel of truth," state Sen. Steve
Peace (D-El Cajon) said in an interview. "Everything that they
pointed to had some kernel of truth to it, some credibility to it.
That was the trouble with arguing your way through this thing.
Everybody wanted a simple, philosophical, cut-and-dry answer. As
opposed to the reality, which is that all these things they point to
combine to create an environment that allows unethical, crooked
people to take advantage of the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, however, new kernels of truth kept emerging.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a state Senate committee produced a "blueprint" for
gaming the California market, a document that it said had been
developed by Perot Systems. Perot Systems denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Another industry document, produced by FERC's expanded
investigation into market manipulation, caught the attention of Wall
Street analysts last week. It contained telephone transcripts in
which traders appeared to be discussing assorted ways to manipulate
the California market and maybe even share profits.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply concerned," noted the analyst, Christopher
Ellinghaus of the Williams Capital Group, "that the unveiling of
additional documentation related to the California issue will
continue to be bombshells for this industry."</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, the most provocative discovery to come to light
has been a Dec. 6, 2000, memo from outside attorneys for Enron. It
was written after they debriefed traders in the fall of 2000 about
their conduct in the California market. In the memo, made public in
early May, the lawyers laid out a catalog of trading "strategies."
These included laundering megawatts in and out of state and the
creation of false congestion on the transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   The language can be wonderfully accessible. For example, in
describing a congestion gambit known as "Death Star," the attorneys
wrote: "The net effect of these transactions is that Enron gets paid
for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any
energy or relieving any congestion."</TE>
<TE>   And a tactic by which electricity was bought by Enron and then
exported from California to markets willing to pay even higher prices
was defended this way: "This strategy appears not to present any
problems, other than a public relations risk arising from the fact
that such exports may have contributed to California's declaration of
a Stage 2 Emergency yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   As for the colorful names attached to the tactics, it was
explained: "Enron's traders have used these nicknames with traders
from other companies to identify these strategies." In another
document, a set of a lawyer's handwritten notes from the debriefing,
a public posture for the firm is proposed should the tactics become
the subject of investigations: Answer questions, say nothing ...
finger others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only the Price of Power Changed</TE>
<TE>   Some state officials and energy experts contend that the main
value of these documents has been to popularize a point they had
attempted to make all along--that the steep increases in wholesale
prices went beyond what could be expected in the normal fluctuations
of a working market. They regret not coming up with catchy names like
"Fat Boy" and "Ricochet" themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Said Freeman, who left the DWP during the crisis to become a key
energy advisor to the governor: "For a lot of people, all of the
sudden, it just clicks. The light bulb turns on."</TE>
<TE>   However compelling the internal documents may be, many California
officials insist the best evidence that the crisis was, as Freeman
put it, "ginned up" has been there all along, simple and empirical.
Demand for electricity was not significantly higher during the crisis
period than it had been in previous years. Supply was not drastically
lower. All that changed, and changed dramatically, was the price
being paid for the electricity.</TE>
<TE>   What happened, according to their scenario, is that in the late
spring of 2000, for a variety of reasons, the market began to tighten
up. There was still enough juice--by and large the lights did stay
on--but the cushion of excess supply shrank. This gave generators and
traders what is called "market power," the ability to demand and
receive excessive prices over an extended period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Market power traditionally occurs when two or three suppliers
control vast portions of a given market.</TE>
<TE>   In California's electricity market, however, such dominance wasn't
necessary. With supply and demand curves running more closely
together, a small amount of generation offered at just the right time
also would do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist and chairman of the
market surveillance committee for the California Independent System
Operator, which runs the grid, explained: "Say 10 firms each own 1
megawatt and demand is 9.5 megawatts. There's no shortage, but you're
going to have prices at the price cap. Why? Because each firm knows
that you need half a megawatt from me no matter what my competitors
do to meet demand."</TE>
<TE>   Peace said federal regulators failed to recognize this nuance:
"You don't have to have 40% of the overall market to exercise market
power. You only need to control the right electrons at the right
time. And that's what these guys did."</TE>
<TE>   Anjali Sheffrin, director of market analysis for the independent
system operator, has churned out chart after chart tracking demand
and price for California electricity since 1998, when the state began
its transition away from a regulated energy model. The lines stay
relatively flat month after month, until May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, like the wild scratching of a polygraph machine
when the suspect begins to tell fibs, the wholesale price curve
starts to shoot upward. It peaks in December 2000, a month when
wholesale prices were running 10 times higher than they had the year
before--even though demand was virtually unchanged. The price line
finally flattens out again at what had been normal levels in June
2001--after FERC essentially rewrote the market rule book for
California and the entire Western grid, imposing price limits and
closing loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffrin has reworked her numbers many times to incorporate all
the supposed forces behind the rising prices. Each time, in examining
the price spike, she has found the same thing: "A significant portion
of it--even after you accounted for cost of production, emission,
everything--occurred because suppliers were demanding high prices."</TE>
<TE>   And getting them: "In all my reports," she said, "what I show is
that whenever supply and demand get real close, even though you're
not in a shortage situation, then suppliers can name their price.
That's what market power is."</TE>
<TE>   In this context, questions of whether plants were shut down
needlessly for "unscheduled maintenance" or traders shipped
California electricity out of state take on added importance.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing federal and state investigations are exploring whether
generators withheld supply--either by idling plants, or through
manipulations of the bidding process--to preserve their market power
and strike only when prices were at their highest.</TE>
<TE>   As the crisis unfolded, other oddities were noticed. Prices for
wholesale electricity during off-peak hours--early Sunday morning,
say--began to climb nearly as fast as those of the busiest afternoon
hours. There was a wintertime spike in natural gas prices, the fuel
needed to run many California plants; gas prices were high everywhere
in that period, but the increases in California exceeded those
registered in other states many times over.</TE>
<TE>   Of the half-dozen rolling blackouts that finally did materialize,
most occurred not in the summer, when demand for electricity tends to
be at its peak in California, but in the cooler months.</TE>
<TE>   Wolak, for one, finds this remarkable: "That says to me, these
guys figured out [they're] the only game in town. Declare enough
forced outages, and you will be able to jack the price up through the
roof."</TE>
<TE>   Traders and suppliers, of course, spun a different story
throughout. In October 2000, about the time Lay was debating price
caps with Freeman on the telephone, and energy companies were posting
huge boosts in third-quarter earnings, and Enron traders were telling
the lawyers about Death Star and Get Shorty and the rest of their
tricks, a leading Enron trader, Tim Belden, addressed his colleagues
at a conference on volatile energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was baffled by it all.</TE>
<TE>   "We sit here, we listen to everybody talk," Belden said. "Each
side is compelling. You scratch your head. You maybe say, 'I have no
idea.' Is there scarcity? Is there a smoking gun? We still don't
know. How did we get here? Well, first these complex markets were
designed by economists and engineers. If you want to trade power in
California for Enron, the minimum requirements are, you need to have
a law degree and a PhD in engineering. You need to have done
significant research in market theory and game theory."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the audience laughed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Bleak Time for Energy Industry</TE>
<TE>   Of course, laughter in the energy industry has been in short
supply of late--and not an artificial shortage either. The fortunes
of outside energy companies dealing in California tended to follow
the lines on Sheffrin's price chart. And now, seven months after the
collapse of Enron, the merchant-energy industry is suffering one of
the bleakest periods in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 123 industry groupings in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
blue-chip stock index, the Multi-Utility category--made up of Duke
Energy, Williams Cos., Dynegy, Mirant, Calpine and AES, California
players all--finished dead last for the month of May, with an
aggregate decline of nearly 23%.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, it seems, brings another damaging revelation, another
investigation launched, another executive resigned. In California,
there's talk among industry leaders about establishing voluntary
codes of conduct for traders. And even some of the best allies of the
energy generators express disappointment in the mind-set revealed by
the Enron memos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's personally offensive to me," said Jan Smutny-Jones,
executive director of the Sacramento-based Independent Energy
Producers, which represents power plant owners, "as someone who's
spent a lot of time working on markets in California ... to have
someone creating congestion in order to get paid for fixing it."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to a window in his Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   "This window doesn't have a sign on it that says do not throw a
rock through it, but most people have a common sense that you don't
throw rocks through windows. If we need to put a sign on every window
that says don't throw rocks through it, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the investigations proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, whose committee has smoked out some of the most damaging
documents, sat in his office the other day surrounded by 33 yet-to-be
explored boxes of internal Enron paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "The tip of the iceberg" is how he described what has transpired
so far. He recalled the long stretches early on when the
investigation into possible market manipulation often was dismissed
as something of an Oliver Stone production: long on conspiratorial
theory, short on the goods.</TE>
<TE>   "At some level," he said, "there's relief that what we suspected
for a long time has proven to be true. But economists said that you
can't have this sort of wealth transfer going on without something
having gone wrong in the market. They were right. When you saw the
transfer of wealth we had in so short a time, something's wrong."</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>A Test of Long-Distance Loyalty</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Tonight, many fans in L.A. will root for the team
from their native land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tonight at 11:30, when she would usually be in bed, Evangelina
Gonzalez will take a seat in the living room of her Lincoln Heights
apartment, turn on the television and watch a soccer game along with
many others in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Screaming the occasional obscenity, the 59-year-old will awkwardly
cheer against America, the nation she loves, the place she has called
home for 35 years, the country to which her husband owes his
citizenship. And she will root for the Mexican team with greater
fervor than she ever managed when she actually lived there.</LD>
<LD>   "Now that I'm here, I feel more passion," says Gonzalez, a
Guadalajara native. "Maybe because I'm so far away, because I miss my
country. If anything, I feel more Mexican than ever before."</LD>
<TE>   That passion, fueled by nostalgia and nurtured through years of
long-distance loyalty, will keep millions of others up nearly all
night.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight in South Korea, the national soccer teams of the U.S. and
Mexico will meet in the second round of the World Cup, with the
winner continuing into the quarterfinals and the loser returning
home.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the distance, it is a distinctly local contest, the soccer
version of USC tackling UCLA, Serena Williams trading ground strokes
with sister Venus or even the Clippers playing the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   For fans in Los Angeles, the Mexican team is practically a local
squad. It plays in Southern California more than the U.S. team--often
selling out the Coliseum. Men kicking up dust in Southland parks wear
the jerseys of clubs from Guadalajara and the Federal District of
Mexico. A top Mexican club has trained in Ventura County, and the
leading Mexican league has considered putting a club here.</TE>
<TE>   The game will touch off Sunday night parties, fill up bars and
arenas, and kick the initiative out of many a Monday morning. And for
some, it's a case of torn loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm caught in the middle," said 23-year-old Peter Alcantar, the
son of Mexican parents, as he watched the victory parade Friday for
the Lakers. "I love Mexico, but the U.S.A. is my home country."</TE>
<TE>   "I am Mexican American," added Guillermo Gonzalez, the 60-year-old
owner of A and Z Nut Wagon in East Los Angeles. "So my personal
opinion is that it is like watching brother against brother."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer experts make Mexico a slight favorite over the U.S., whose
advance into the second round was considered a major upset.</TE>
<TE>   But even in the glow of that unexpected success, the American side
remains the second favorite team in the nation's second-largest city.
The match gives Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants the chance
to obsess over the biggest sport of their home nation in their new
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Although legions of youth play soccer every weekend in highly
organized leagues throughout the U.S., helping to institutionalize
the phrase "soccer mom," love of the game has not reached the heights
of other sports.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still working on growing soccer in this country," said
Patrick Donnelly, a spokesman for the L.A. Galaxy, the professional
soccer team that plays at the Rose Bowl. "We're behind some of the
more established sports, like baseball, basketball and football."</TE>
<TE>   Those from overseas, and particularly Mexico, "have a little bit
more of a soccer tradition," he said. "They grew up learning about
the game from their parents, and their parents really cared. A
tradition like that is something we're working on building."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Biach is typical of those who prefer other sports.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was having a drink Saturday night at the ESPN Zone in
Downtown Disney in Anaheim, he won't be back there to watch the game
live tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll check on it later," said Biach, 39, of Bradenton, Fla.
"Soccer is too long and boring."</TE>
<TE>   But other fans have shown enough interest to persuade ESPN Zone to
stay open late tonight for those who want to watch the entire game,
said operations manager Ron Braxton. When Mexico plays, nearly
500,000 Los Angeles-area households are tuned to the World Cup, even
though it's the middle of the night. By comparison, the U.S. games
are watched by only a third that number. Even the Dodgers, whose
games are usually in prime time, typically attract half as many
households.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the pro-Mexican zeal in Los Angeles, the U.S. team
prefers to play the Mexican team in places such as Columbus, Ohio,
and Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never cheer the United States soccer team, ever," says
Hector Agredano, 30, an assistant manager at Vallarta Supermarket in
Van Nuys. "Would a USC fan cheer for UCLA?"</TE>
<TE>   Mexico fans say that nostalgia and memory--not any distaste for
the U.S.--have cemented their allegiance. In much the way that
expatriate New Yorkers seem to outnumber local fans when the Yankees
play the California Angels here, many Mexican Americans side with the
country of their birth.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here when I was a 13-year-old, and I've been living here
for 40 years," says Francisco Sanchez, 53, cooking carne asada in
Lincoln Heights. "My heart is with the Mexican team."</TE>
<TE>   Such deep feelings have led to the rapid organization of viewing
get-togethers.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples Center, the Galaxy is hosting a party for 250 fans.</TE>
<TE>   The Pico Rivera Sports Arena will open to show the game on a
big-screen television set; drums and firecrackers likely will follow
Mexican goals. Restaurants and bars, from Leonardo's in South Los
Angeles to the cantinas on 17th Street in Santa Ana, will stay open
late. As early as Saturday morning, street-level entrepreneurs who
usually sell Laker flags were already hawking Mexican banners to
passing motorists from Echo Park to Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Park police are bracing for large crowds tonight near
Pacific Boulevard and Florence Avenue. That intersection will be
closed to motorists. And the 85-man police force will be ready--with
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in reserve--if there is a
recurrence of vandalism and violence that has followed Mexican
triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Park and elsewhere, some soccer fans say they are
too torn to celebrate wildly for either team.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Villareal, a youth soccer coach in Los Alamitos, is loyal to
the U.S. team; his brother Adrian, also a coach, has been wearing
five Team Mexico T-shirts in rotation since the World Cup began.
Cirilo Vega of Santa Ana, a U.S. resident for 19 years with an
American daughter, leans slightly for Mexico; his daughter is rooting
for the U.S. Outside a bridal shop in South Gate, Veronica Martinez's
car is decorated with Mexican, American and Laker flags.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Fans Are Neutral</TE>
<TE>   In Northridge, Adan Rodriguez, 42, is flying both countries' flags
in front of his home on Roscoe Boulevard. "I am probably the only one
in my family who is 100% neutral," says Rodriguez, a native of
Jalisco, Mexico. "I'll be sad after the game, but only because one of
my teams will be eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   At the Gonzalez apartment in Lincoln Heights, the game will tear
at a marriage for at least 90 minutes of game time.</TE>
<TE>   While Evangelina Gonzalez cheers for Mexico, her husband Jose
Luis, a 57-year-old construction worker, said he will be happy with a
victory by either team. He recently became a citizen, he says, and
has grown fond of the U.S. players.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be very calm," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nuts, says his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going for, and I'm 100% sure, Mexico is going to win," says
Evangelina. "I've been here a long time, and I love this country, but
in my heart, I'm with Mexico. I could be here another 100 years, and
I'd still root for Mexico."</TE>

<HD>Muslim Charity Leader Arrested</HD>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A South Florida Muslim leader with ties to "dirty" bomb suspect Jose
Padilla has been arrested by a federal counter-terrorism task force
and is being held on an alleged immigration violation, an Immigration
and Naturalization Service spokesman said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Adham Hassoun, 40, was one of the leaders of the Al-Iman Mosque in
Broward County, which Padilla attended when he was converting to
Islam in the 1990s. Hassoun also is the founder of the Florida
chapter of a large Muslim charity, Benevolence International
Foundation. U.S. officials alleged in court documents in April that
the Illinois-based foundation has been connected to Osama bin Laden
for years and has moved large sums of money to fund the operations of
his Al Qaeda terrorist network around the world.</LD>
<LD>   FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said Hassoun was arrested Wednesday
by the South Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes the
FBI, the INS and other law enforcement agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Padilla, who took the name Abdullah al Muhajir, is being held at a
Navy brig in South Carolina. He is accused of plotting with Al Qaeda
leaders to detonate a radioactive bomb in the U.S.</TE>

<LD>   The slick is 6 feet wide and 150 yards long and drifting east,
said George Garrett, Monroe County's director of marine resources.
Work is underway to stop the leak.</LD>

<HD>Debate Over Welfare Reform Broadens to Include Fathers</HD>
<DH>Policy: Advocates urge education over punishment for
'deadbeat dads.' Many in Congress are listening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>It was a group of fathers with a lot of explaining to do.</LD>
<LD>   Child-support debts soaring into tens of thousands of dollars.
Tenuous ties to their kids. Bitter ex-wives and ex-girlfriends. Scant
evidence that lifelong behavior patterns were about to change.</LD>
<LD>   The judge could have shipped them off to county jail for failing
to support their children. Instead, he sent them to school.</LD>
<TE>   "I was mis-educated," declares Lee A. Council, 38, father of eight
children by four women, as other men murmur agreement during the
recent class in responsible fatherhood. "I'm being re-educated now."</TE>
<TE>   For six years of welfare reform, attention has focused on the
struggles of poor children and single mothers. But now, an emerging
movement says it is time to spotlight the father--that
long-overlooked family member who may be missing, estranged,
incarcerated or trying to find a way back into the lives of his kids.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 grass-roots efforts have cropped up across the
country in recent years to counsel and advocate for nonresident dads,
according to the National Fatherhood Initiative, a Maryland-based
group. And as Congress debates the next stage in welfare reform, some
lawmakers want to add hundreds of millions of dollars to spread the
responsible fatherhood message.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 million poor children live without their fathers,
according to research by Elaine Sorensen, an Urban Institute
economist. Their absence, advocates maintain, is linked to a grim
catalog of social woes: poverty, drug use, violence, teen pregnancy,
academic failure, depression and suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if fathers' financial and personal contributions could
potentially transform the lives of their children, welfare policy has
focused little on their role.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more to welfare reform than simply saying that these
mothers have to get a job," notes David Blankenhorn, author of
"Fatherless America" and president of the Institute for American
Values. "And the main 'more' is recognizing that these children have
fathers too."</TE>
<TE>   Such fathers are not just invisible in national policy. They are
villains in popular culture, scorned as "deadbeat dads," living
symbols of irresponsibility.</TE>
<TE>   But those who speak on their behalf maintain that the
traditionally punitive approach toward them often fails, and that not
every "deadbeat dad" wants to stay that way.</TE>
<TE>   The path forward can be difficult, however, particularly for those
lacking in job skills. The child-support debt rises each month;
states may charge interest on the red ink. Typically, government
safety net programs are not designed to help such men.</TE>
<TE>   "The question isn't whether they're deadbeat. The question is
whether they're dead broke," insists Jeffery M. Johnson, president of
the National Center for Strategic Nonprofit Planning and Community
Leadership, which has closely followed the issue. "The unfinished
business of welfare reform is, how do we now increase the skills and
educational levels of low-income men, so they can be contributing
financial partners of women leaving the welfare system."</TE>
<TE>   The 10 men seated around a table in the Kansas City
classroom--blue-collar workers, former athletes, hardened street
survivors--have reached the last of their 12 classroom sessions. But
the organizers do not want to let them graduate without a final round
of soul searching.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would like to be the first to share?" asks George R.
Williams, executive director of Kansas City's Urban Fathering
Project. "Involvement is what?"</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Caffrey, a bearded man in a gray carpenters union shirt,
responds in a low, deliberate voice: "Being there mentally,
physically and emotionally with my kids." Others nod approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Scott, a muscular man in sunglasses, jumps in with his own
contribution: "Spending time with children and listening to what the
children have to say."</TE>
<TE>   Instructor Amos Johnson III wants everyone to hear the message
loud and clear: "This isn't Week Three anymore," he admonishes.
"We've got to cut through the fat and get right to it. There's no
excuse for not making time to be with your child!"</TE>
<TE>   The National Center for Fathering in Kansas City launched the
urban effort four years ago in a bid to increase child-support
payments from the many dads who were paying nothing at all. Under the
program, fathers charged with criminal nonsupport may opt for
rehabilitation instead of punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Charges are dropped for men who report regularly to the judge,
attend the fathering class, begin paying their debts, stay clear of
drugs, hold on to jobs and meet other requirements. The program even
directs some of the fathers to job counseling.</TE>
<TE>   But aims reach beyond the financial. Organizers want the
nonresident fathers to establish lasting emotional bonds with their
children--an effort that may force clear-eyed reflections on the
meaning of manhood, commitment and personal responsibility. To move
forward, many of the fathers must try to break a pattern of distant,
unreliable fatherhood that has been passed down from one generation
to the next.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you can remember your father not coming to an event
that you were in?" Williams asks at one point. "What was that like?"</TE>
<TE>   For James Lewis, who has access to six of his nine children, the
memory still stings almost 20 years later: "I can remember my first
college football game. My uncle went--but my father didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Across the room, Kirk Braden, 42, a factory worker with a
child-support debt of about $30,000, recalls his military graduation
ceremony: "Nobody showed up."</TE>
<TE>   To Williams and Johnson, who teach the fatherhood classes, finding
a way to heal the old wounds is key to a fresh start, even when that
means drawing out the softer side of men who are not used to
revealing it.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the men going around the room saying, 'I love you,' "
Williams recalls of one session. The fathers preferred to tack on
words at the end, he noted, offering phrases like: "I love you, man.
I love you, brother."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a hugging exercise morphed into a series of half-hugs
and pats on the back, Williams, a marriage and family therapist,
recalls with some amusement: "We start where they're at," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Council, whose second marriage has lasted eight years, says
that he did not get to know his father until he graduated from high
school, and that he grew up "without a full understanding of a
woman's worth."</TE>
<TE>   The fatherhood course, he says, "changed the way I think about my
mother," and he vowed to work harder to establish a meaningful
relationship with all of his children, including the five he does not
live with.</TE>
<TE>   But if the men in Kansas City have explaining to do, they also
have stories to tell--of hostile, vindictive mothers who block them
from seeing their children, a practice that they said only makes the
children hurt more. "I think we need education for women and men,"
Council says.</TE>
<TE>   The Urban Fathering Project is one of a growing number of efforts
nationwide to provide support for struggling dads, with orientations
that vary from faith-based to fathers' rights to job training.</TE>
<TE>   From Los Angeles to Tampa, San Antonio to Virginia Beach, programs
have targeted Latinos, adolescents, prisoners, the poor and suburban
middle-class dads.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, there was very little activity going on," says
Wade F. Horn, a longtime fatherhood activist who is assistant
secretary for children and families at the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services. "Today there's activity all over the place. We've
come a long way in recognizing father absence as an important social
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians are debating how far the federal government should go
to underwrite such efforts.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, a major welfare bill that passed the House in
May would make responsible fatherhood an official U.S. goal. The bill
also would provide $100 million over five years to pay for such
initiatives. In addition, officials seek technical changes to the
child-support system that could get more money into the hands of
needy families. But some in the Senate, which may begin its own
welfare debate this week, would go further.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're talking about breaking the cycle of poverty, this is
one of the best things you can do," says Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), who
has sponsored a bill with Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.) that would
provide more than $350 million over five years for fatherhood
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Others contend that fatherhood initiatives may provide a more
reliable payoff for the country than efforts to promote marriage,
which have been advocated by the White House and many conservatives.
Public officials do not know how to make marriages work, they argue;
raising men's awareness about their own children--or the consequences
of having children out of wedlock--may be a more realistic goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is in favor of marriage, and should be," says Bruce
Reed, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and
senior domestic aide in the Clinton White House. "But when the
majority of poor children don't see a dime of child support every
year, we're a long way from the altar."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, government figures suggest that nonresident fathers in
2000 owed low-income, single-parent households more than $11 billion.
A survey commissioned by the Urban Institute found that, for the
minority of poor single-parent households that receive it, aid from
fathers may add up to 26% of their income.</TE>
<TE>   In the chambers of Robert M. Schieber, the "fathering court" judge
in Kansas City, the national debate seems far away.</TE>
<TE>   He deals with individuals, including a petty thief who recently
left jail for a halfway house. Schieber, whose courtroom is decorated
with posters that exalt responsible fathers, tells the man to begin
paying $5 a month "just to get him started" in the habit of regular
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Schieber says that outside the courtroom he sometimes runs into
people who argue that fathers who drift from their children deserve
no special treatment. But he takes heart that the initiative,
financed in part by a local sales tax, has yielded more than $364,000
in child-support payments that likely would not have been made
without it.</TE>
<TE>   A check of the first 29 graduates of the fatherhood program found
that 25 were paying child support; the others include two men who
moved back in with their wives and reconciled disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are against this kind of diversion, this kind of
intervention," he concedes. "But it's hard to argue with these
results."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Verdict Unlikely to Spark Industry Overhaul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the verdict against Arthur Andersen is a black eye for the
auditing industry, it is unlikely to lead to substantive reforms,
industry experts said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Major accounting firms probably will introduce internal controls
and do a better job of self-policing. At the same time, however, they
have portrayed the scandal involving energy trader Enron Corp. as an
aberration and are vowing to fight congressional efforts to impose
significant changes on the industry.</LD>
<LD>   "The other four big [accounting] firms decided to distance
themselves as far as they could from Andersen even though they aren't
that different and have the same problems," said Lynn Turner, an
accounting professor at Colorado State University's Center for
Quality Financial Reporting and a former chief accountant of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. "As far as the profession making
reforms, I don't think the verdict will have any impact."</LD>
<TE>   Andersen was found guilty of obstructing a government probe into
financial irregularities at Enron, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was accused of shredding documents related to its audit
of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The case has focused public attention on the failure of auditors
to raise red flags. But efforts in Congress to impose stricter rules
and oversight are facing stiff opposition from the industry,
particularly from the nation's four largest accounting firms and the
profession's self-regulatory organization, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Enron and Andersen disclosures, Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.) introduced legislation to create a Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board to keep tabs on auditors of public
companies. The bill also would have restricted consulting work by
accounting firms and forced lead partners to rotate on audits--two
factors that its proponents said would have helped prevent the Enron
accounting debacle.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry fought the bill on grounds it would create an
undue regulatory burden and "result in a de facto government takeover
of the accounting profession," the accountant group said last month.</TE>
<TE>   Against heavy lobbying by the industry, and with only a one-vote
majority on the 21-member Senate Banking Committee, Sarbanes pulled
his bill last month. A proposal submitted by the Republican members
of the panel is considered more likely to win approval.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative bill proposes a professional standards board but
with fewer powers. Moreover, accounting firms would not be restricted
from consulting work and forced to rotate partners on audits.</TE>
<TE>   As the Andersen case continues--the firm has vowed to
appeal--reforming the accounting industry could turn out to be a
political issue for the Nov. 5 elections, Turner predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "I do sense that this is going to be an election issue in
November," Turner said. "The little guy on the street will be able to
vote for reforming the industry, but until then concerns about the
industry are going to be overshadowed by the squabbling over
legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite uncertain prospects for reform, the verdict will alter the
way accounting professionals do business, predicted Randolph Beatty,
dean of USC's Leventhal School of Accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear individual partners will be on guard at a
significantly higher level," Beatty said. "They are going to be under
more scrutiny than ever before, and there will be a lot more risk to
auditors. The verdict makes the future in public accounting a bit
cloudy."</TE>

<HD>Outcome May Aid Prosecutors of Enron</HD>
<DH>Courts: The conviction gives the U.S. leverage. Testimony
in Andersen trial offers road map of practices by the energy trader
that its auditor considered misleading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The guilty verdict in the trial of Arthur Andersen on Saturday puts
momentum and morale back on the federal government's side in its
Enron Corp. prosecution, though a tough effort still lies ahead,
legal experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the outcome was far from the slam dunk that some had
forecast when the obstruction-of-justice indictment was handed up,
the win for prosecutors gives them important leverage in recruiting
potential witnesses against Enron, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite this being more hard-fought than expected and that it
took longer, I think it also came out better than expected for the
government," said Stephen L. Meagher, a former federal prosecutor now
representing white-collar criminal defendants at San Francisco law
firm Phillips &amp; Cohen.</LD>
<TE>   The government is expected to devote its full attention to the
prosecution of Enron, once the dominant energy trading company that
had captured the frenzy of investors in the deregulation of the
electricity and natural gas business. But last year, the company
melted down after it disclosed that some of its past profit was an
illusion. An internal report later disclosed that senior executives
had made millions of dollars in deals with partnerships that did
business with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, former Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
are under investigation by the Justice Department to determine
whether they misled investors or committed financial fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The government probably will try to maintain its momentum from the
Andersen verdict by securing an indictment against Enron within the
next six to eight weeks, said John J. Fahy, a partner in Newark,
N.J., law firm Reed Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Fahy, who previously worked as a federal prosecutor with Michael
Chertoff, the assistant attorney general overseeing the Enron
prosecution, said Chertoff's style is to be "as fast and as
streamlined as possible."</TE>
<TE>   "He will try to find a way to explain who did what as simply as
possible, and he's not going to wait a year for everything to fall
into place," Fahy said.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant benefit for the prosecution from its Andersen
conviction, in Meagher's view, is that the testimony provided "a road
map to practices that Arthur Andersen partners thought was
misleading."</TE>
<TE>   One such partner is Carl E. Bass, a member of Andersen's
Professional Standards Group, the unit that advises field auditors on
complex accounting questions.</TE>
<TE>   Bass testified that he and other members in the standards group
clashed with Andersen's Enron audit team over the propriety of some
transactions in which Enron tried to conceal debt through the use of
limited partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, testimony by David B. Duncan, the government's
star witness and leader of Andersen's Enron audit team, may make it
more difficult to prove former Enron officials conducted securities
fraud or insider trading of company stock or filed false financial
statements, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan testified he believed that some of Enron's most
controversial practices--including the use of limited partnerships to
boost Enron's profit and shift debt off its books--were legal and
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   With that opinion in their pockets, defense lawyers could rebut
charges that the official financial statements they filed with the
government contained false information of a "material"
nature--generally defined as having an impact of 5% or more on the
company's net worth, said Christopher J. Bebel of Houston law firm
Shepherd, Smith &amp; Bebel.</TE>
<TE>   But Duncan also aided the government's cause by testifying that
Enron officials concealed things from Andersen, noted Bebel, a former
federal prosecutor and securities regulator.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Duncan testified that he wasn't told about a side
deal between Enron and Fastow that essentially guaranteed Fastow
would not lose money on investments in several of the limited
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Such an arrangement would mean the partnerships were not
independent of Enron and therefore not eligible for the off-the-books
accounting treatment they were given.</TE>
<TE>   Another deal concealed from Duncan, he testified, involved a
partnership called Southampton Place.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report of a special internal investigation by
Enron's board last fall, Fastow and aide Michael J. Kopper each
turned a $25,000 Southampton investment into a $4.5-million gain in a
few months in 2000. And Enron lawyer Kristina Mordaunt made $1
million on a $5,800 investment, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors could use evidence that Enron concealed important
information from Andersen to show that Enron's management
"intentionally engaged in deceptive and deceitful practices," Bebel
said. Such behavior, if it had been brought to light, would have
threatened Enron's regulatory licenses as an energy merchant and
therefore was "material" to the firm's financial standing, he added.</TE>
<TE>   E. Lawrence Barcella, a Washington-based attorney for Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, was less sanguine about the value of the
prosecution's Andersen victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The government going in considered this an extremely strong case,
but they only won by their fingernails," Barcella said. "Seeing what
should have been a strong case take the turns it did won't embolden
them with Enron."</TE>

<HD>Deliberations Came Down to a Single Memo</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurors describe focused, diligent efforts. Defense
and prosecutors are surprised by what the panelists decided was the
'smoking gun.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>After 21 days of testimony and thousands of pages of evidence--not to
mention a ton of shredded documents--it came down to one document: an
e-mail by Arthur Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple suggesting changes to
an internal memo regarding a press release announcing Enron's
earnings. Temple's editing, the jury decided, amounted to impeding a
government investigation and made Andersen guilty of obstructing
justice.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyers and prosecutors were stunned by the revelation
that a stray memo had become the "smoking gun" that broke the panel's
deadlock and that the testimony of a high-profile prosecution witness
had no effect. But jurors were sure of the reasoning that led to
their unanimous decision to convict the once-venerable accounting
firm.</LD>
<LD>   "Arthur Andersen set about to change things, to alter documents,"
said jury foreman Oscar Criner, a computer science professor at Texas
Southern University in Houston. "It's against the law to alter the
document with the intent to impair the fact-finding ability of an
official proceeding."</LD>
<TE>   Criner was among four jurors who spoke to the media after
rendering their verdict in U.S. District Court in Houston. The panel
had been sequestered during deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said Saturday that it plans to appeal, citing what it
called the judge's flawed jury instructions and erroneous evidentiary
rulings. However, the firm notified the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it will cease auditing public companies Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days earlier, it was a subdued group that filed into the jury
room on the first day of deliberations. There were nine men and three
women from all walks of life, including an airline executive, a maker
of floor tiles and a pastry chef who during jury selection said he
didn't know what the Securities and Exchange Commission did.</TE>
<TE>   Their first job was to understand the jury instructions, 12 pages
of law meant to guide them through deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not very easy reading. All of the jury studied those
charges several times over several days. It was a complex piece of
logic that the judge gave us," Criner said. "Then we looked into our
initial opinions about what was going on. That took probably the
first week."</TE>
<TE>   The first vote showed the panel split 6 to 6. The jury sent a note
to the court asking for highlighters and Post-It Notes. They would
tackle their job with precision and order.</TE>
<TE>   On one board in the jury room they listed rules of conduct:
Respect the opinions of others, only one person talks at a time,
don't call each other names. "We tried to maintain a civil atmosphere
and worked diligently toward the end," Criner said.</TE>
<TE>   On a second board, jurors listed names of Andersen partners who
might have "corruptly persuaded" employees to impede a government
investigation. On the list were Andersen employees David B. Duncan,
Nancy Temple, Tom Bauer and Michael Odom. As the days passed, the
names were crossed off one by one.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony of Duncan, who had pleaded guilty to obstruction of
justice in return for leniency and was a witness for the prosecution,
factored little into the panel's deliberations. The former lead
auditor of Enron had little credibility, Criner said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very clear that he had a lot of baggage that came along
with him that indicated he was capable of not telling the truth," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Added juror David Schwab: "I don't think we ever focused on David
Duncan. I don't think we even talked about whether he committed a
crime or not."</TE>
<TE>   Criner described deliberations as long stretches of quiet reading
punctuated by group discussion. There were reams of materials to
study and absorb, in addition to their own voluminous notes. Juror
Jack Gallo, the airline executive, said he took 140 pages of notes
during the trial. "There were jurors that had more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By Day 7 of deliberations, the jury was at an impasse. The vote
was stuck at 9 to 3 in favor of conviction. No one was willing to
budge. "It became useless--we were deadlocked," said Criner, who was
ready to vote for acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   The jury then sent a note to Judge Melinda Harmon. They were
deadlocked, they wrote. Harmon, using what is called an Allen charge,
sternly instructed them to keep trying, reminding them of the expense
of the trial and suggesting that if they couldn't reach a verdict,
probably no jury could.</TE>
<TE>   As they filed back to the jury room, the chastened panelists
pondered Harmon's orders. "We started reading and studying the
evidence that was about that high," said Criner, opening his arms
some 3 feet wide to demonstrate the immensity of the task.</TE>
<TE>   The list of potential "corrupt persuaders" loomed on a board
before them. "I have no idea what [the deadlock] did to the court. I
know what it did inside the jury room. We looked at all these
different people [on the list] and [asked],  'What are we going to do
here?' "</TE>
<TE>   The jurors agreed that an Andersen employee corruptly persuaded
employees to impede a government investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But they couldn't agree on which Andersen employee that was.</TE>
<TE>   Out went another note to Harmon. Must we agree on the same corrupt
persuader in order to convict? While the attorneys for each side
argued for a response that would favor their position, the jurors
doggedly continued deliberating.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday afternoon, Harmon told the jury that they need not
unanimously agree on a corrupt persuader.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, their question was moot. "We had agreed on one,"
said juror Schwab.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nancy Temple, because she was "the author of that
particular memo that was altered," Gallo said.</TE>
<TE>   Criner called the memo "a smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   "We began to look at the smoking gun and said, 'This is not what
it ought to be.' "</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing testimony about Temple's role in editing the memo,
"we came back and said, 'Well, here's our verdict,' " Criner said.</TE>
<TE>   Since jurors zeroed in on one lone memo out of thousands of pages
of documents, evidence that lawyers thought crucial to the case was
essentially discounted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had argued that Andersen promoted its document
retention policy, which called for the shredding of extraneous
documents, just as the SEC began to investigate the accounting firm's
audit of Enron's books. Criner and other jurors could not have cared
less.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't do anything with it," Criner said. "I discredited most
of that. All this business about telling people to shred documents
was circumstantial and superficial."</TE>
<TE>   Before the trial, it was pastry chef Schwab who told the court he
didn't know what the SEC did. "I know what it is now," he said
ruefully. On Saturday, all he wanted to do was to head home. "I'm
going to watch TV and talk on the telephone," he said.</TE>

<LD>Jurors in the Arthur Andersen trial said Saturday that their guilty
verdict was based on a staff attorney's suggestion that an auditor
make changes to a memo about an Enron Corp. earnings release last
fall.</LD>
<LD>   According to testimony, Andersen auditors believed that Enron's
description of certain losses as "nonrecurring" was inaccurate
because the losses were related to Enron's core business. Andersen
accountants and lawyers had discussed the issue in a series of
conference calls and e-mails.</LD>
<LD>   Here is the text of the Oct. 16 e-mail sent by Andersen staff
attorney Nancy Temple to Houston-based partner David B. Duncan,
leader of the firm's Enron audit team.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave--Here are a few suggested comments for consideration--I
recommend deleting reference to consultation with the legal group and
deleting my name on the memo. Reference to the legal group
consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged
advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I
might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   --I suggested deleting some language that might suggest we have
concluded the release is misleading.</TE>
<TE>   --In light of the "non-recurring" characterization, the lack of
any suggestion that this characterization is not in accordance with
GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles], and the lack of
income statements in accordance with GAAP. I will consult further
within the legal group as to whether we should do anything more to
protect ourselves from potential Section 10A [*] issues.</TE>

<HD>Jury Instructions Were Flawed, Firm Says</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is the full text of the statement issued by accounting firm
Arthur Andersen on Saturday in response to the jury's guilty verdict:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Today's verdict is wrong. In fairness to the jury, they were not
permitted to know the full truth about what happened last fall as a
result of the Justice Department's actions during this trial. Arthur
Andersen is planning to appeal the conviction based on flawed jury
instructions and erroneous evidentiary rulings that precluded
Andersen from presenting its entire defense.</LD>
<TE>   The reality here is that this verdict represents only a technical
conviction--based on the government's theory of prosecution, any
accounting firm or other business today could face a similar
punishment for discarding documents. By this standard, any company
could be prosecuted for following standard document disposal
practices before receiving a subpoena or even an informal request for
documents from a third party, even when no person involved in the
matter believed that anything they were doing was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that the government failed to uphold its moral
responsibility to the public by indicting and prosecuting a firm of
26,000 innocent people that self-reported its findings, fully
cooperated with the Department of Justice, the SEC, and Congress, and
worked in good faith to find a solution that would have prevented
this trial. Given these circumstances, there is no rationale for
indicting a cooperating Arthur Andersen and destroying the firm as we
knew it.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: C.E. Andrews, a senior managing partner at Arthur
Andersen, speaks outside court in Houston. With him is attorney Rusty
Hardin, right. The firm will appeal the verdict, saying jurors "were
not permitted to know the full truth" because of "erroneous
evidentiary rulings."</CP>

<HD>Judges Ignore Juries to Impose Death</HD>
<DH>Law: Judicial override in capital trials comes under
increased scrutiny. Arizona case is expected to draw a ruling from
the U.S. Supreme Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- After finding Shonelle Jackson guilty of
murdering a man while stealing his car stereo, jurors recommended
unanimously that the 19-year-old's life be spared.</LD>
<LD>   However, trial Judge William Gordon overruled the 12-member panel.
Instead of placing Jackson in prison for life without possibility of
parole, Gordon ordered him to the electric chair.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson is one of 83 people who have been sent to death row in
Alabama in the last two decades as a result of a judicial override--a
procedure that is becoming increasingly controversial in the state
and around the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Alabama is one of just four states that has permitted judges to
ignore jury recommendations to impose death.</TE>
<TE>   Judges in five other states have the sole power to make capital
punishment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a
case challenging the procedure in one of the latter states, Arizona,
on the grounds that it amounts to a violation of the 6th Amendment
right to be tried by a jury of peers.</TE>
<TE>   If Arizona's law is toppled, legal experts say it could have an
impact on the Alabama statute under the same reasoning since both
laws, in essence, give judges the ultimate power to impose death.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor says the state's law is fair because
judges, having viewed capital cases in the past, have some "sense of
proportionality."</TE>
<TE>   Critics counter that judges should not be given unbridled
authority to ignore jurors' recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Such a practice "reduces to a sham the role of the jury in
sentencing and allows baseless, disparate sentencing of defendants in
capital cases," Alabama Supreme Court Justice Douglas Johnstone wrote
in May in a dissent in the Jackson case.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama sentences more people to death per capita than any other
state, and "judicial override is the single most significant factor"
why, said Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal Justice
Initiative of Alabama. He is Jackson's appellate lawyer and plans
additional appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 24 people executed in Alabama since capital punishment
was reinstated here in 1976 were sentenced to death by judges after
juries had recommended life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The state judge who has imposed the most overrides went so far as
to advertise his record on death penalty cases during his 2000
reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In American courts, sentencing for virtually all crimes is the
sole prerogative of a judge. But historically, the death penalty has
been different. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court said that jurors
should bear the responsibility "to express the conscience of the
community on the ultimate question of life or death."</TE>
<TE>   But seven years ago, in Harris vs. Alabama, the Supreme Court
upheld the Alabama override law 8 to 1, saying it did not violate the
Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   That did not stop debate over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, two men who were sent to Alabama's death row as a
result of overrides have had their convictions overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Walter McMilian and Randall Padgett, now free men, often speak
publicly against the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama also has been criticized more broadly by American Bar
Assn. officials for providing insufficient funding for lawyers who
represent indigent defendants in capital trials.</TE>
<TE>   And Alabama officials are under attack in a federal lawsuit that
contends that the state is violating the Constitution because it does
not guarantee legal help to inmates in the final phase of death
penalty appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama law permits trial judges to override jury recommendations
and impose death, regardless of whether a jury recommends life by a
7-5 majority or a higher margin. A number of defendants, such as
Jackson, have been sent to death row even though nine or more jurors
recommended life.</TE>
<TE>   To render a death sentence, an Alabama judge must find that
aggravating factors, such as the nature of the crime or a defendant's
criminal history, outweigh such mitigating factors as a defendant's
age or lack of a record.</TE>
<TE>   The judge is required to "consider" the jury's "advisory
[sentencing] verdict," but the Alabama statute does not say how much
weight it must be given.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a standard does not invalidate the law, Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor wrote in the Harris decision. She said the high court
should not engage in "micromanagement" of tasks properly in the
state's discretion.</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens issued a strong dissent, saying that
"total reliance on judges to pronounce sentences of death is
constitutionally unacceptable," in part because it gives prosecutors
two chances to win a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Some Alabama jurors who have voted for life sentences have
expressed frustration and surprise that their recommendation seemed
meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very shocked to know that the judge had changed our
decision," said Allene Evans, one of nine jurors who recommended life
for Herbert Williams Jr., after finding him guilty of murdering a
Mobile businessman. "We were supposed to make the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama judges can override a capital jury's decision in either
direction; there have been 83 overrides from life to death, and just
seven from death to life.</TE>
<TE>   That disparity presents a marked contrast with the other three
states that have had override laws.</TE>
<TE>   In Delaware, where judges are appointed, there have been seven
overrides, all from death to life.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, there have been nine overrides to death and nine to
life. Earlier this year, Indiana's legislature abolished the practice
of overrides for future cases.</TE>
<TE>   Florida had 173 overrides for death and 51 for life from 1972 to
1992. But under a Florida Supreme Court decision, judges now can
override a jury's life verdict only if "the facts justifying a
sentence of death are so clear and convincing that virtually no
reasonable person could disagree that a death sentence was
appropriate." In recent years the number of overrides in Florida has
dropped markedly.</TE>
<TE>   A review of Alabama cases shows that some courts treat the jury's
life recommendation as a mitigating factor. But other judges give no
weight to the jury's opinion.</TE>
<TE>   In Jackson's 1998 trial, Judge Gordon did not say the jury had
done anything wrong. Rather, Gordon said he thought a death sentence
was appropriate, even though he acknowledged that there was
conflicting evidence on whether Jackson or another person involved in
the car stereo robbery had fired the shot that killed Lefrick Moore.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said there were two aggravating factors: The murder was
committed in the course of a robbery, and Jackson was on probation
for burglary and theft.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said the fact that Jackson was 18 when he committed the
crime was a mitigating factor, but was due only "slight weight"
because Jackson had an extensive juvenile court record starting at
age 12.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Alabama death penalty law enacted in 1976, the first
judge to override a life recommendation and impose a death sentence
was Braxton L. Kittrell of Mobile in 1982. Kittrell's first override
drew little attention outside Alabama, but the second came in a case
frequently cited by override supporters as an example of the virtue
of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Two members of the Ku Klux Klan, angry about a hung jury in the
trial of a black man accused of killing a white policeman, went
looking for revenge. Klansmen Henry F. Hays and James Knowles
abducted Michael Donald, a 19-year-old black man, from a Mobile
street at gunpoint, slashed his throat and hanged him from a tree.
Two years later, a Mobile jury convicted Hays of murder but
recommended life without parole. (Knowles got a life sentence in
return for his testimony.)</TE>
<TE>   Citing the brutality of the lynching, Kittrell overrode the jury
and sent Hays to death row in 1984. Hays was electrocuted in 1997,
the first white man in 84 years executed in Alabama for killing a
black person.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, about 55% of defendants sent to death row as a result of
overrides have been black, and 75% of the victims in override cases
were white.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge who has imposed the most overrides is Ferrill D.
McRae of Mobile, who has sent at least six men to death row after
rejecting jurors' recommendations for life.</TE>
<TE>   McRae, a crusty, white-haired jurist appointed to the bench by
Gov. George Wallace in 1965, said that in every instance the murder
had been "heinous, atrocious and cruel."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he noted, George Martin murdered his wife by burning
her in a family car to collect insurance money. "If burning a human
being alive is not an example of what is heinous, atrocious or cruel,
those words lack meaning," McRae said in July 2000 when he overrode
the jury's 8-4 life sentence recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   During his reelection campaign in 2000, McRae ran advertisements
listing some of the men he had ordered to death row. Among them was
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that attitudes may be shifting, the Mobile Press
Register, though saying Martin's crime was "obviously heinous,"
denounced McRae, a marked contrast to the praise it gave Kittrell for
his override 16 years earlier: "For one judge to overrule the jury's
considered judgment, so as not to favor life but to order execution,
is for the judge to assume god-like powers."</TE>
<TE>   At least 45 Alabama judges have sent defendants to death row via
override. Only a few have overridden death sentences, and one of
them, who has since died, was chastised by the Legislature for making
"a mockery of the judgment of the jury."</TE>
<TE>   Another is 17-year judge Denny Louis Holloway of Dothan. Saying he
is sometimes accused of being "soft on crime," Holloway, 55, said he
has used care in twice overruling jury recommendations of death.</TE>
<TE>   He said he "would have a hard time overruling a jury to give
death" and has never done it. "I feel that if the jurors made their
decision not to take a life; why would I want to go the other way?"</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Holloway emphasized, "When you give someone life without
parole you are not doing them a favor."</TE>

<HD>Blood Pressure Rises Over Supplies</HD>
<DH>Donors: Turf wars rage because Red Cross ships local
collections all over U.S. Some centers then are forced to buy what
they could have had free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Of the 14 million pints of blood donated each year, only 250 come
from teenagers at Shawnee Mission North High School in Overland Park,
Kan., on the outskirts of Kansas City. But in the intensely
competitive business of blood banking, that was plenty to fight over.</LD>
<LD>   Students faced taking sides in a national battle: They could keep
giving blood at the local blood bank, which supplies nearby
hospitals. Or they could donate to the American Red Cross, which had
begun collecting in Kansas City as part of a national effort to
increase its share of the blood market.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Cross recruiter trumpeted T-shirts with the school name.
The local Community Blood Center warned that the Red Cross would ship
blood out of town.</LD>
<TE>   Students chose to stay local. The Red Cross recruiter protested to
the principal, a tempest two years ago that annoyed student council
advisor Cody Fothergill.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it when high school students do selfless activities, and
this was one of them," Fothergill said. "It did throw us off guard a
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Struggles over blood supply and demand play out across the
country. At the center sits an uneasy relationship between the
American Red Cross and 75 independent, locally run blood banks. For
years, each side has collected about half the nation's blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the cookies and juice that are the public face of donation,
blood banking is big business. A single pint donated free is divided
into multiple products that sell for hundreds of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Hospitals cannot function without donors, and
experts fear they'll be turned off by increasingly public friction.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere you turn there's turf wars, there's price battles,
there's allegations of predatory behavior," said University of
Pennsylvania bioethicist Arthur Caplan, former chairman of the
government's blood oversight committee. "The country is in desperate
need of a reassessment of its national blood policy."</TE>
<TE>   Already, potential donors are confused about when they're needed.
A poll conducted for Associated Press by ICR of Media, Pa., found the
main reason people say they'd donate blood is to help after a
disaster, even though only blood that has been tested for disease and
is on the shelf goes to help disaster victims.</TE>
<TE>   Only 5% of those eligible donate annually. Periodic shortages led
20% of hospitals to postpone elective surgery, an American Hospital
Assn. survey found last year.</TE>
<TE>   Tight supply creates tension throughout the system: in the quest
for donors, in rising blood prices, in disputes over safety rules. It
was on full display after Sept. 11, when the country gave blood in
unprecedented force but got conflicting messages about whether
donations were needed at once.</TE>
<TE>   And it is transforming the industry. Faced with paying millions
more each year, some hospitals have begun forcing competition on
their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about tension in the industry, Red Cross Vice President
Trudy Sullivan said blood donations increased last year. Nationwide,
donations rose by 7%, a quarter of them in the 10-week aftermath of
Sept. 11, the National Blood Data Resource Center said.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said the Red Cross is looking at working more closely
with competitors: "There's tremendous potential for all of us in this
industry to draw more people in without disruptions between us."</TE>
<TE>   Blood is donated, but hospitals pay for every drop. Prices vary,
in part because it costs more to do business in one city than in
another. But the Red Cross generally charges more: about $175 to $200
per bag of red cells, the typical transfusion, the organization said.
Independent blood banks report charging an average of $90 to $150.</TE>
<TE>   Some cash-strapped hospitals are responding by forcing new
competition. Most striking may be New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical Center, now juggling three suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   After the Red Cross doubled its price last summer to $189 per bag,
Dartmouth hired the independent United Blood Services to provide half
its supply--at 30% less. Then Dartmouth began recruiting its own
donors, collecting 10%; the Red Cross provides the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the Red Cross and independent suppliers went
public after Sept. 11, when half a million people lined up to give
blood, even though it turned out little was actually needed.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross aggressively encouraged donations, calling it
insulting to discourage people who wanted to help. The independents
said it was irresponsible to collect blood that would go bad in 42
days and asked people to come back when the supply would need
replenishing. At an emergency meeting Sept. 14, federal health
officials tried to get both sides to deliver the same message.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are safety disputes. The Red Cross set stricter
standards than the government to guard against brain-destroying "mad
cow" disease, calling it a "cautious and conservative approach in the
face of scientific uncertainty." Competitors resent any implications
that their blood isn't as good, and the government said the Red Cross
couldn't imply that.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the competition leaves a stalemate. In Charlottesville,
Va., hospitals need about 24,000 pints of blood each year, just what
residents donate. The Red Cross collects half, shipping most to other
cities. Independent Virginia Blood Services, which serves local
hospitals, collects the other half but must import 12,000 pints from
Iowa to fill local needs.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross says it simply collects where donors want to give.
"The blood supply is a national resource that benefits patients
throughout the country," the agency's Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   But for Bob Carden, who ran the Red Cross' Mobile, Ala., region
until 1997, when he took over Virginia Blood Services, it's a daily
frustration. "We're just playing blood roulette."</TE>

<HD>Bush Campaign Promotes Great American Dream</HD>
<DH>Homeownership: The president's program aims to help people
with low incomes, particularly Latinos and African Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>He has lived in government-provided housing for eight years
now--first as governor of Texas, now as president--but George W. Bush
has not forgotten the great American dream of homeownership.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Bush used his weekly radio address to launch a
campaign he will pursue this week to help low-income Americans,
particularly minorities, attain that goal.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's initiative underscores the key role that the housing
industry has played in the economy. It also focuses on the greatest
potential growth area in the housing market: the purchasing power of
minorities.</LD>
<TE>   And by highlighting the need to help blacks and Latinos buy homes,
the president may be seeking to bolster his administration's standing
with two groups that traditionally have backed Democrats. Both as a
candidate and as president, Bush has paid particular attention to
improving his party's image among Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is scheduled to promote his housing initiative, which
requires congressional approval, for three consecutive days this
week, starting in Atlanta on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he vowed to narrow the discrepancy in homeownership
rates between white Americans and blacks and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that, while nearly three-quarters of all white Americans
own their homes, less than half of all African Americans and Latinos
do. "We must begin to close this homeownership gap by dismantling the
barriers that prevent minorities from owning a piece of the American
dream," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He offered no new proposals to accomplish this goal. Instead, he
touted measures in the budget plan he unveiled earlier this year,
which include nearly $2.4 billion in tax credits to support the
rehabilitation or new construction of up to 200,000 homes for
purchase by low-income households over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's emphasis on his housing initiative points to his
determination not to neglect domestic issues even as the war on
terrorism and crises in the Middle East and South Asia consume much
of his time and energy. The president is spending the weekend at his
Texas ranch in part to think through a plan to revive the Middle East
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   His stop in Atlanta is clearly designed to appeal to African
Americans. The city has among the highest rates of black
homeownership in the nation. His schedule calls for a visit to
Atlanta's Pryor Road area, where housing development is replacing
dilapidated and crime-ridden strip malls.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond a direct appeal to minorities, Bush's homeownership
initiative also may resonate with struggling middle-class families
that face being priced out of the booming market, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of Bush's housing program is a tax credit for
builders who erect middle-income housing for homeownership, not for
rental units. So far, it has not advanced in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bush's plan would provide $200 million in federal
grants to help an estimated 40,000 low-income families a year become
first-time homeowners. Most grants would be less than $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The single greatest hurdle to first time homeownership is a high
down payment requirement that can put a home out of reach," Bush
said. He also is seeking a record $35 million for a program that
would provide low-income buyers with comprehensive information about
the intricacies and pitfalls of buying homes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said his initiatives, if approved, would "help thousands of
American families live the kinds of lives they had once only dreamed
about.''</TE>
<TE>   Housing construction clearly would be a boon to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Home Builders estimates that construction of
1,000 single-family homes generates 2,448 jobs, $79.4 million in
wages and $42.5 million federal, state and local taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Homeownership has been a popular political cause at least since
the 1920s, when Herbert Hoover, as Commerce secretary, became a vocal
champion. But few administrations have followed through with concrete
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, President Clinton set as a goal homeownership by about
two-thirds of all American households by decade's end. Clinton's
ownership target was achieved, said Nicholas Retsinas, who directs
Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</TE>
<TE>   But growth depends on the ability of minorities to buy their own
homes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we find a way to reach out to minorities, to Latino
immigrants and the children of Latino immigrants, we will not be able
to sustain the national homeownership rate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to [Bush's] credit he's making this an issue," he added.
"It's not an issue that is very high on the Washington scene. It's
not that high a profile."</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard housing studies center says in a forthcoming report
that the number of U.S. householders owning homes hit a record 72.6
million in 2001, 67.8% of the households. Since 1994, minorities have
accounted for 40% of the gain in homeownership. Overall, minorities
make up 25% of the nation's households and 17% of the homeowners.</TE>

<HD>Gain on 1 Fire Front in Colo. Is a Setback on Another</HD>
<DH>Disaster: With the week-old Hayman blaze 30% contained,
flames in another area push toward Durango, where 450 homes are at
risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>LAKE GEORGE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters made progress Saturday against one flank of a stubborn
week-old wildfire, but they faced a greater challenge on another side
of the blaze, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "This has been a really good day," fire information officer Terry
McCann told reporters, referring to the north end of what's called
the Hayman fire, which had threatened the outlying edges of Denver's
southwest suburbs. Expectations that the fire would develop new hot
spots didn't materialize, and firefighters were able to focus on
containing it, he said.</LD>
<LD>   But crews faced a tougher challenge on the other end. "On the
south end we had some significant movement," fire information officer
Gordon Warren said.</LD>
<TE>   The Hayman fire, about 55 miles southwest of Denver, grew
slightly, to nearly 103,000 acres, from 100,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Cool, calm weather early in the day helped the fire crews, but
there was a possibility of thunderstorms with gusty wind.</TE>
<TE>   Bulldozers headed down a road into the fire area north of Lake
George as about 30 residents were allowed in briefly to check on
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Good, 29, said he jumped up and down after seeing that his
log cabin and neighboring gem mine still were intact.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still there, though many of the properties near us have had
much fire damage. The firefighters are really doing a good job," said
Good, who mines smoky quartz and crystals at the Dreamtime Mine.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,300 people remain out of their homes because of the fire,
which has blackened nearly 160 square miles since it started June 8
in the Pike National Forest, apparently originating with an illegal
campfire. It had burned to within 40 miles of the Denver city limits.</TE>
<TE>   On the southern edge of the fire, crews put out remaining flames
from an earlier backfire set to prevent the blaze from spreading into
Lake George, a small recreation community.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,800 firefighters, aided by planes and helicopters, were
working on the fire. On Saturday, it was about 30% contained by
firebreaks.</TE>
<TE>   But the good news from the Hayman fire was countered by concern
about another fire on the other side of the state. The Missionary
Ridge fire north of Durango, in southwest Colorado, stood at 18,155
acres, down slightly from 19,500 acres late Friday. But the blaze was
moving south toward the suburbs of Durango, where 450 homes were at
risk, fire information officer Keven Huffstutler said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's concern because of a potential for a blowup" if winds
increase, Huffstutler said.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least seven wildfires burning in Colorado.</TE>

<HD>Residents Get Jump on Flood Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Minnesota: Ignoring safety concerns of officials, people

<DL>ROSEAU, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Several anxious residents returned to their waterlogged homes
Saturday to assess damage and clean up from record flooding, ignoring
city officials' concerns that it isn't safe.</LD>
<LD>   Homes may have been structurally damaged, and people could by
sickened by being in the dirty water, Mayor Jeff Pelowski said.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Peter Grafstrom spent Saturday pumping water from the
basement of his riverfront home and power-washing his garage.</LD>
<TE>   Grafstrom, who remodels homes, wanted to clean his house so he
would be ready to help other residents in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to get my own stuff taken care of so I can be ready to
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every building here was damaged by the overflowing Roseau
River. The city of 3,000, about 10 miles south of the Canadian
border, was the hardest hit by record flooding across northwestern
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "People need good information before they can go to work on their
homes," Pelowski said. "It's all about public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Residents likely could return Monday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A flood recovery team of federal and state government agencies met
throughout the afternoon to discuss the cleanup effort. A town
meeting is scheduled today to give residents information about their
findings and how to get federal aid for recovery.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has declared northwestern Minnesota a disaster
area, making federal money available.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Turn Out for the Dapper Don's Last Ride</HD>
<DH>Crime: To many along the funeral route, mob boss John Gotti
was a hero. He died last week in a federal prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>He was a killer, an arrogant crime boss who inspired fear. But when
John Gotti was buried Saturday in an elaborate mob funeral, many New
Yorkers hailed him as a hero--a man who had been true to his code.</LD>
<LD>   Under drizzling skies, Gotti's gray hearse rolled past his
favorite neighborhood haunts and his home in Howard Beach, Queens,
before reaching the gates of St. John's Cemetery, where he was laid
to rest in a family mausoleum next to his son Frank. Following close
behind were more than 100 cars and limousines, thousands of onlookers
and a media horde.</LD>
<LD>   Gotti, former boss of the Gambino crime family, died of throat
cancer last week. He was serving a life sentence at a federal prison
in Missouri on a racketeering conviction that included counts of
murder, loan-sharking and extortion.</LD>
<TE>   Although Gotti had disappeared from view after his 1992
conviction, he remained America's most notorious Mafioso. And the
passing of the Dapper Don, known for his love of expensive Italian
suits, prompted strong, visceral reactions from those straining for a
glimpse of his coffin.</TE>
<TE>   "This man was a hero, he never cheated on his wife and he kept his
neighborhood safe from crime," said an emotional Mary Adams, who said
she drove from out of state to pay her respects as Gotti's funeral
cortege passed. "The government hounded him while he was alive, and
they tried to turn him into a monster, but he deserves every bit of
the send-off he's getting today."</TE>
<TE>   Others viewed the scene with skepticism. "I don't know how you
make a hero out of someone who was so violent," said Craig Wessel,
watching with his teenage daughter, Andrea. "How can you forget
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Gotti's funeral was a case of life imitating Hollywood: As chunky
wise guys patrolled the streets in front of Papavero Funeral Home in
Maspeth, Queens, federal agents snapped photos from an undercover
van. Emotional family members, some collapsing with grief, were
helped into waiting limousines, which stretched for three city
blocks.</TE>
<TE>   While helicopters buzzed overhead, aides stuffed huge wreaths of
flowers--some shaped like a cigar, a martini, a royal flush, the
Yankees logo and an Italian flag--onto trucks to lead the procession.
When Gotti's large, gold-covered coffin was brought out, many in the
waiting crowd burst into applause, shouting "Bravo!"</TE>
<TE>   Although the throng lining the procession route fell short of the
10,000 predicted by members of the Gotti family, the turnout
underscored Gotti's enduring celebrity in a culture that has
romanticized the mob.</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting, some said, that Gotti was being buried on a leafy
hill in St. John's Cemetery, a gangster's Valhalla that is also a
resting place for Salvatore "Lucky" Luciano, Vito Genovese, Carlo
Gambino and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen all the Mafia movies, like 'The Godfather' and
'Goodfellas,' " said Eddie Schubert, an office manager who joined
hundreds jammed in front of the cemetery gates, as Gotti's funeral
procession came into view. "But you tend to forget that all this
stuff is real, that it actually happens in the world, and somehow
we're all part of it today."</TE>
<TE>   Some were not impressed by what they saw. Enduring taunts and
obscene comments from people in the crowd, Ceci Finkelstein and her
friends held up a handmade sign in front of the cemetery reading:
"Why glorify?"</TE>
<TE>   Finkelstein said the pomp and ceremony sickened her "because it's
sending the wrong message to children in this country. If we glorify
John Gotti, we're glorifying a man who killed people brutally for a
living. I really can't believe we're serious about this kind of
adulation."</TE>
<TE>   "What are you yelling about, lady?" shouted a man standing nearby,
clearly irritated by her sign. "You don't know anything about Gotti."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah?" she answered. "What about John Favara?"</TE>
<TE>   In March 1980, Favara, a neighbor of Gotti's, accidentally hit the
mobster's son Frank with a car, killing him. Favara got death threats
and was preparing to move his family out of the neighborhood that
summer, but on July 28 he was grabbed on the way to work, clubbed and
tossed in a van. He was never heard from again.</TE>
<TE>   Gotti insisted he had nothing to do with Favara's disappearance
but told federal agents probing the incident: "I'm not sorry the
guy's missing. I wouldn't be sorry if the guy turned up dead."</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a reporter Saturday about this incident, Bruce Cutler,
Gotti's longtime attorney, dismissed the question as being in poor
taste. "Did you know John Gotti?" he demanded. "Do you know what
really happened? John Gotti was a man of courage. That is how we're
going to remember him."</TE>
<TE>   As Cutler spoke, members of the Gotti family climbed into
limousines for The Don's last ride. But some were not on hand.
Gotti's older brother, Peter, was arrested two weeks ago along with
other alleged Gambino crime family members on racketeering charges
involving the New York City waterfront. A younger brother, Gene, is
serving a 50-year sentence for heroin trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Gotti's oldest son, John Jr., is also in custody, serving six
years for racketeering and gambling. Friends and family had hoped to
give Gotti a Mass of Christian Burial service, but the Brooklyn
Diocese refused. Bishop Thomas Daily invoked a church precept known
as "Scandal," the belief that the church faithful would get the wrong
message if a funeral Mass was granted to someone who, like Gotti, had
lived outside the church's teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials noted, however, that the decision was not meant
to be a judgment about Gotti's lifestyle, since they believe only God
can make that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "May he rest in peace," said Mary Adams, as the procession
disappeared from view and the street in front of Papavero Funeral
Home became quiet once again. "Whatever you think about him, we won't
forget Mr. Gotti."</TE>

<HD>Mayors' Panel Against N-Waste Shipping</HD>
<DH>Conference: They cite safety but don't act on a plea to
oppose Yucca Mountain as repository.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>A committee of mayors voted Saturday to oppose transporting
high-level nuclear waste to a national repository unless federal
officials can guarantee the safety of all cities along proposed
routes.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution adopted on a unanimous voice vote stopped short of
opposing the creation of a nuclear waste repository in Nevada's Yucca
Mountain. Three Western mayors had urged their counterparts earlier
in the day to oppose the repository, saying that shipping radioactive
waste to the site would threaten the entire country.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said an earthquake centered 12.5
miles from the proposed site at Yucca Mountain on Friday reinforced
his concern that the site was unsafe for storing nuclear waste.</LD>
<TE>   "That's our problem," Goodman told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
"The nation, however, has a problem with transportation."</TE>
<TE>   Goodman, Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson and Reno Mayor Jeff
Griffin said the federal government had not done enough to study the
risks posed by shipping nuclear waste to the proposed site by highway
or rail.</TE>
<TE>   The federal plan would bury 77,000 tons of nuclear waste in
tunnels inside Yucca Mountain, where it would remain radioactive for
more than 10,000 years. The House has already approved the plan; the
Senate has to vote on it by July 26.</TE>
<TE>   The conference energy committee's resolution calls on Congress to
prohibit moving high-level nuclear waste until cities along its route
have adequate funding, training and equipment in the event of an
accident. The full conference was expected to vote on the resolution
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The conference, which drew about 250 mayors, includes a series of
meetings on issues ranging from affordable housing to the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The mayors also approved a resolution urging Washington to
distribute homeland security block grants directly to cities and
counties. President Bush has proposed sending about $3.5 billion in
such grants to states, with three-quarters of it targeted for local
governments.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be no middlemen. It should go directly to the
cities," said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat who is president
of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson told the
mayors that distributing money through the states is the quickest
way.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that before states could receive the money their plans
for spending it had to be approved by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had to do this with all of the cities, we probably wouldn't
have been able to do it," said Thompson, who was governor of
Wisconsin for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of 122 mayors found that three-fourths were concerned
about the threat of a chemical or biological attack, and almost 4 out
of 5 said they had inadequate funding to detect threats.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of four said they do not have enough money for emergency
response equipment or programs to protect city infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled to speak at the conference, which started Friday,
are Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge and Federal Emergency
Management Agency Director Joe Allbaugh.</TE>
<TE>   The mayors met under tight security, with the city closing nearby
streets as well as the shore of Lake Monona that borders the
convention center.</TE>

<HD>Work Starts on 6 Missile Silos in Alaska</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FT. GREELY, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Federal officials broke ground Saturday on six underground missile
interceptor silos as part of the new missile defense system.</LD>
<LD>   It will take more than two years to install the silos 115 feet
beneath Ft. Greely for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.</LD>
<LD>   "We need this for the defense of our country," said Brig. Gen.
John W. Holly, program director for the GMD Joint Program Office.</LD>
<TE>   The Ft. Greely site, about 100 miles southeast of Fairbanks in the
Alaska interior, will at first be used for testing. But the Pentagon
hopes to have it ready as an emergency antimissile system by
September 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's hurry to put a rudimentary system in
place in Alaska by 2004 comes 19 years after President Reagan
proposed a national defense against nuclear missile attack. Critics
suggest presidential politics is the driving force behind the
timetable.</TE>
<TE>   The project's purpose is to defend against the use of a limited
number of nuclear missiles and is designed to eliminate mutual
destruction as a strategy, said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska).</TE>
<TE>   The missile test bed work will be done by Boeing Co. and its
subcontractors, while Fluor Alaska will be general contractor.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just going to start digging holes," GMD spokesman Lt.
Col. Rick Lehner said.</TE>
<TE>   When completed, the six silos, about 100 feet apart, each will
have a 24-foot circumference and hold 70-foot-long missiles. There is
room for 100 missile beds on the site. Fluor will install roads,
fencing, support buildings and a power substation.</TE>
<TE>   The work at Ft. Greely is expected to cost $325 million, officials
said. The full system is estimated to cost $64 billion, including a
sophisticated "X-band" radar station in the Aleutian Islands and a
satellite system to detect launches.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters waited at the main gate of Ft. Greely and at an area
along the highway about two miles north of the entrance. No Nukes
North, a Fairbanks-based anti-nuclear group, organized the protest,
which began June 6 as a peace caravan across Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters have been in the area since Thursday, voicing
objections to the GMD as an offensive--rather than
defensive--program, its expense and the nuclear dangers.</TE>

<HD>Command Center Shut, Groups Asked to Search for Missing
Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Volunteers closed a makeshift command center Saturday and appealed to
neighborhood groups to search for a 14-year-old Utah girl apparently
abducted from her bedroom at gunpoint 11 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Smart's family said a decentralized search would make it
more efficient for groups to cover their own ground without first
having to go to a central command.</LD>
<LD>   The command center at a Mormon meeting house was dismantled, and a
park used as a helicopter pad is now again a soccer field.</LD>
<TE>   Police had no new leads in the June 5 disappearance and called off
regular daily news briefings. Sgt. Fred Louis said police will brief
media only when developments occur.</TE>
<TE>   The focus returned to Utah after a police chase in Texas and New
Mexico turned up the wrong man Friday, not the one wanted as a
possible witness to the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The man Texas authorities arrested Friday as a suspect in a string
of car thefts was not Bret Michael Edmunds, whom Utah authorities
want for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said Edmunds, 26, is not a suspect in the Smart
case. The girl's 9-year-old sister, Mary Katherine, described the
kidnapper as 5 feet, 8 inches. Edmunds is 6 feet, 2 inches.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Weighs Risk of Smallpox, and Risk of Smallpox Vaccine</HD>
<DH>Health: Looking at the possibility of a germ attack, panel
will decide if the medicine, which can be fatal, should be more
readily available.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County paramedics Pat Long and Eric Buege make medical
decisions every day that save other people's lives. Soon they might
face one that could save their own.</LD>
<LD>   This week, an advisory panel in New Orleans will recommend whether
the government should loosen its grip on the nation's stockpile of
smallpox vaccine, which has been kept under wraps since the disease
was eradicated worldwide in 1980.</LD>
<LD>   In light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, and subsequent anthrax mailings, government
officials are debating whether to release the vaccine to health and
emergency workers and, perhaps, millions of other Americans.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a difficult decision to make," said D.A. Henderson, one
of the world's leading authorities on smallpox, during a forum
Saturday in Washington. "There is no right answer. It's a balancing
of risk."</TE>
<TE>   For Long and Buege, taking the vaccine isn't a simple choice.
There's an estimated 1- to 2-in-a-million shot that the vaccine
itself could kill them, and a 1-in-100,000 chance of causing serious
illness, such as severe rash, infection or brain inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Their families might also suffer health problems. Studies have
shown that 20% of vaccine- related complications occur in people who
were not vaccinated but came into contact with someone who was.</TE>
<TE>   The Pomona paramedics must balance those risks against the unknown
odds that terrorists might one day use the lethal smallpox virus as a
weapon and that they would be called upon to respond to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to take the risk of the vaccine, for me or my
family," Buege said, adding that his views might change if a smallpox
attack occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Long, his partner, is less concerned and said he would likely do
whatever health officials recommended. "There are so many other
things that could kill us. Smallpox is the least of my worries."</TE>
<TE>   It's a dilemma that soon could face millions of Americans. A
smallpox terrorist attack could be catastrophic in the United States,
where routine smallpox vaccinations ended 30 years ago. Smallpox
mortality rates in the unvaccinated top 50%.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if the government resumed smallpox vaccines for
the entire U.S. population today, an estimated 300 citizens could die
of complications and thousands more would have serious health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The vaccine is one of the least safe of licensed human vaccines,"
said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Routine smallpox vaccinations in the U.S. ended in 1972, when
health officials deemed that the health risk of the vaccine was
greater than the risk of the virus.</TE>
<TE>   That's why U.S. health officials are moving cautiously as they
weigh whether to re-release the vaccine, which has only been provided
to lab workers at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and others who handle the virus.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday in New Orleans, the CDC's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices will make a recommendation about the vaccine
to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. He will
make the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a confirmed smallpox attack, few health experts
expect the panel to recommend releasing the vaccine to all Americans,
though polls suggest that more than half of the general population
would take it if offered.</TE>
<TE>   A tougher call for the CDC will be whether to make the vaccine
more widely available to the general public after a confirmed
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Under current CDC policy, if a smallpox attack takes place, the
vaccine will only be given to those people who come into direct
contact with people infected with the virus. That strategy, which
also was known as "ring vaccination," helped health officials beat
naturally occurring outbreaks in the 1940s, '50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   But some public health officials fear the ring vaccination
strategy would be less effective against a deliberate terrorist
attack, particularly in the U.S., where the population is highly
mobile. For example, if a terrorist infected with smallpox traveled
on New York City subways for a week during rush hour, how would
health officials be able to track down all potential contacts?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, many are calling for the CDC to change its policy and
recommend broader vaccinations in communities hit by an attack.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study presented Saturday, vaccinating an entire
city such as Los Angeles after a smallpox attack that affected about
1,000 people would confine the death toll to about 500 people,
according to Edward Kaplan of Yale University's School of Management.
Using the CDC's current policy, more than 3,000 deaths likely would
occur, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ring containment simply will not work in this kind of situation,"
said William Bicknell, a former Massachusetts health commissioner and
professor at Boston University's School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   Bicknell supports a gradual resumption of routine smallpox
vaccinations for all Americans, with the exception of small children,
who are more susceptible to health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Another researcher, Alan Zelicoff of Sandia National Laboratories
in Albuquerque, presented a study suggesting that a terrorist threat
could be posed by an aerosol version of the virus that is more potent
than naturally occurring strains.</TE>
<TE>   His conclusions were based on recent reports about an accidental
release of a weapon version of the smallpox virus in 1971 by Soviet
scientists. The accident may have been responsible for a smallpox
outbreak that is believed to have started when a boat passed by an
island where testing of aerosol smallpox was taking place. Zelicoff
said evidence suggests that an infected Soviet biologist on the boat
spread the disease in a nearby city, where three people died.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson, however, said there is not enough evidence to support
what he termed Zelicoff's "alarmist" conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox virus typically spreads via infected saliva and
face-to-face contact within about 6 feet. Early symptoms include
fever, headache and backache, beginning about one to two weeks after
exposure. That is followed by a severe skin rash on the face, arms
and legs, during which time the disease is most infectious.</TE>
<TE>   The last case of smallpox in the U.S. was in 1947. After Sept. 11,
government officials began to fear that terrorists might get their
hands on the virus and release it into the population.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Thompson contracted with a British biotechnology firm
to produce enough vaccine to inoculate every American by the end of
this year.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM LAS VEGAS, N.M.</KH>
<HD>No Sin City, This Vegas Savors Its Rich Heritage</HD>
<DH>History: The small community in northern New Mexico
treasures its old buildings, unlike its glittery namesake in the
Nevada desert.</DH>

<DL>LAS VEGAS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>This is the other Las Vegas--not where 40-year-old casinos are
imploded because they're no longer fashionable, but where
140-year-old storefronts still have purpose.</LD>
<LD>   The mob missed this place, but not the ruthless Billy the Kid, who
was run out of town after pistol-whipping the sheriff, and bank
robber Jesse James, who relaxed in its hot mineral baths. Probably
neither visited the town dentist, "Doc" Holliday.</LD>
<LD>   Nevada's Las Vegas may have its conventions, but it was here where
Theodore Roosevelt and his Roughriders held a reunion, attracting
10,000 admirers, a year after they stormed San Juan Hill in 1898.</LD>
<TE>   Hotel guests in Nevada's Vegas include flash-in-the-pan
celebrities, but the old Montezuma Castle mineral springs resort here
played host to Ulysses S. Grant and Emperor Hirohito of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   This Las Vegas, in fact, has so much history, the town's not sure
what to do with it all.</TE>
<TE>   More than 900 buildings in this city of 15,700 are listed on New
Mexico and U.S. registries of historic buildings. Most are clustered
downtown, still used as homes, offices and storefronts, just as they
were more than a century ago when this was New Mexico's boomtown.</TE>
<TE>   But more buildings were constructed here from 1880 to 1900 than
can be used today.</TE>
<TE>   "In other cities, old buildings are torn down in the name of
progress and are replaced with big new buildings," Mayor Henry
Sanchez said. "But we were too poor to tear our buildings down.
Poverty saved our history."</TE>
<TE>   Now the city treasures its old buildings, and it has created a
handful of preservation districts where the demolition of historic
structures is banned.</TE>
<TE>   The city is struggling to find tenants for the few dozen empty
ones, in part because investors wary of water restrictions in the
drought-ridden Southwest are afraid to launch businesses here and
because of the cost of renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders also say they want to preserve the town's heritage
and don't want to become another Santa Fe, 64 miles to the west,
which is chided by Las Vegans as having forsaken its roots in favor
of becoming a tony arts colony.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Fe is no longer a practicing Hispanic community," said Bob
Mischler, an anthropology professor at New Mexico Highlands
University here. "Santa Fe has been taken over by outsiders who have
created a whole new environment. We don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge here, Mischler said, is to preserve and capitalize
on Las Vegas' Latino and European heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas was settled by Mexican sheep and cattle ranchers in
1835, attracted by the lush green meadows that gave the town its
Spanish name.</TE>
<TE>   Army Gen. Stephen Kearny, following the Santa Fe Trail, arrived
here in 1846 and started the Mexican American War by proclaiming the
town's residents to be American citizens. No shots were fired, and in
time town commerce flourished by trading with nearby Ft. Union.</TE>
<TE>   The economy that traders generated along the Santa Fe Trail
through Las Vegas further enriched the town's merchants but was
nothing compared to the arrival of the railroad in 1879, fostering 20
years of heated growth.</TE>
<TE>   The town grew as two distinct halves--Latinos around the historic
plaza, Easterners and Europeans around the rail district.
Entrepreneurs from both cultures profited, and Las Vegas presented a
confluence of architectural styles--from adobe and California mission
to Queen Anne and Italianate--that grace the town to this day.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas has very few rivals in the West for frontier boomtown
architecture," said Elmo Baca, until recently New Mexico's historic
preservation officer.</TE>
<TE>   But after the turn of the century, Las Vegas' fortunes waned as
railroads expanded their reach to Albuquerque and other Western
towns. Baca, a Las Vegas native, said the town still embraced its
home-grown values.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Kearny came here, we've had a healthy suspicion of
outsiders," he said. "We've held on dearly to our cultural heritage,
perhaps at the expense of economic development."</TE>
<TE>   The frontier buildings were neither razed nor improved as the
city's economy stagnated during the last century. Few businesses
moved here; a factory made parachutes during World War II, and today
the biggest employer is the government.</TE>
<TE>   Not that progress isn't being made.</TE>
<TE>   The city is renovating the railroad depot, at a cost of $500,000;
the Montezuma Castle resort was renovated and is now used as one of
10 Armand Hammer United World College campuses around the world.</TE>
<TE>   And the citizens committee for historic preservation purchased an
1895 mercantile building for its own use, investing about $500,000 to
turn it into a Santa Fe Trail interpretive center.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, building owners are renovating their structures, although
some remain empty. Among them: two century-old storefronts owned by
the Maloof family, which settled here in 1892 and became wealthy New
Mexico business owners and bankers. Today, one branch of the family
owns the Sacramento Kings professional basketball team and a Las
Vegas, Nev., casino hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Among the town's boosters is Anne Bradford, who moved here from
Carlsbad, Calif., nine years ago and spent $150,000 to turn a
109-year-old home into a bed-and-breakfast inn.</TE>
<TE>   Her guests, she said, enjoy this Las Vegas for what it is. "People
will always recognize our Las Vegas," she said. "It'll always be a
little bit behind. That's part of its charm."</TE>
