<HD>In Pursuit of the Model Mustang</HD>
<DH>Buyers face thousands of choices. Early cars have sex
appeal, but the latest generation embodies 25-plus years of technical
improvements.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its explosive debut in 1964, the Ford Mustang has wowed teens
and grannies, secretaries and CEOs, and just about everyone in
between, thanks to low prices, varied body styles and options galore.</LD>
<LD>   Today, prospective owners of used Mustangs face thousands of
choices when eye-balling Ford's best-selling car since the Model T,
ranging from plain-Jane daily drivers starting at $2,000 to rare
high-performance Mustangs fetching $200,000 or more.</LD>
<LD>   Mustang enthusiasts generally regard the first-generation cars
(the '64 to '73 models) as having the most sex appeal. And a properly
restored early 'Stang--collectibles excluded--will usually cost less
to insure and maintain than a later model, yet be just as reliable.</LD>
<TE>   While the newer Mustangs still are depreciating, the
first-generation 'Stangs generally are appreciating. And whereas
Mustang motors from 1974 to the present exhibit more hoses than a
fire truck (a result of stiffened emissions regulations), the earlier
Mustangs have engines that are easy to work on.</TE>
<TE>   As the saying goes, they don't make them like they used to--and
that, with regard to Mustangs, is generally a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Facts are, the power steering is nicer in later Mustangs; the
newer cars are quicker, safer and stop sooner; they get better gas
mileage; the seats are comfier; the sound system is superior; they
pollute less; handle better; and the list goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Mustangs from 1994 and later have the advantage of 25-plus years
of technical improvements, which is worth remembering if you intend
to own one of the 7 million Mustangs made and aren't hell-bent on
buying a first-generation model.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Eisenberg, owner of Maeco Motorsport, a Northridge auto
shop specializing in performance enhancements for vintage Mustangs,
got it right when he said: "The newer Mustangs don't have the class,
the taste, the style of the old Mustangs, but they are definitely
better cars."</TE>
<TE>   The older Mustangs, immortalized by great chase scenes in
"Bullitt" and "Gone in 60 Seconds," typically sold for about $3,000
new and featured an array of options.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, for example, Ford offered no fewer than 10 engines, 17
exterior colors and 40 other options (tinted windows and power
convertible top among them) for its pony car.</TE>
<TE>   The standard engines in the first-generation Mustangs are 289- and
302-cubic-inch motors belonging to the 90-degree V family, which are
arguably the most reliable engines Ford ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Parts are readily available, and between the two engines the 302
(also known as the 5.0 liter) is by far the most popular Mustang
motor.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest factory-produced Mustangs were the Cobra, Boss, GT and
Mach 1. These typically had large engines, souped-up suspensions and
more, as did Mustangs modified by Carroll Shelby from 1965 to 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these cars are worth many times their original prices.
Buyers love the style and power and generally ignore that most aren't
that quick by current standards and today's gas prices make them
impractical to drive.</TE>
<TE>   Older Mustangs with engines exceeding 351 cubic inches typically
get about 10 miles a gallon, according to Jim Grubbs, owner of Jim
Grubbs Motorsports of Valencia, which manufactures custom engines for
Mustangs.</TE>
<TE>   If you've got a 25-mile commute and you're getting 10 mpg, at
$1.50 a gallon you're paying $150 a month for gas just to get to work
and back each day.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas first-generation Mustangs are classics, the Mustang II is
classless and should be avoided. Ford engineers, struggling with
federal emissions standards, produced gutless wonders from 1974 to
1978. If you can recall the yellow 'Stang driven by Jaclyn Smith in
the TV series "Charlie's Angels," you'll know Mustang IIs weren't
visual stunners, either.</TE>
<TE>   Third-generation Mustangs ('79s through '93s) are notable for two
things: the standard 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, which put out a
paltry 88 horsepower most of its miserable life, and the
reintroduction in 1982 of the sporty GT after a 12-year hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   Although initially anemic, the GT gradually gained power and lost
weight, so that by 1987 GTs fitted with the optional 5.0-liter V-8
were quicker than most of the big-block first-generation gas
guzzlers.</TE>
<TE>   However, because third-generation Mustangs aren't collectors'
items and typically come with high miles, they ought to be viewed as
transportation vehicles. Moreover, pre-1986 models commonly choke on
smog tests.</TE>
<TE>   If you opt for a third-generation car anyway, consider finding one
modified by companies such as Roush Performance, Steeda Autosports or
Saleen Autosport.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Shelby Mustangs, these performance-enhanced,
higher-priced 'Stangs are superior vehicles. Saleen Mustangs, built
in Irvine, first appeared on the retail scene in 1985, the Steeda GT
in 1990 and Roush Mustangs in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The current generation of Mustangs ('94s and newer) are modern
cars with dual airbags, a power driver's seat and a tilt steering
wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1994, the punchless 2.3-liter four-banger was
replaced with a 3.8-liter V-6 producing a respectable 145 horses. A
passive anti-theft system became standard in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Two model years later, the Mustang was extensively restyled and
the standard V-6 engine upgraded to 160 horses. Changes since the '99
model have been minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipate paying $2,000 to $12,000 for a reliable pre-owned
Mustang of any generation.</TE>
<TE>   Given their popularity, expect to pay at least $7,500 for a
pre-'70s model that's been competently restored. A loaded '98 or
newer Mustang typically carries a price tag of $13,000 or more, and a
Roush, Shelby, Saleen or Steeda version will usually set back a buyer
$25,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   If you are looking for an older Mustang or a highly tuned newer
model, you'd be wise to follow the advice of Marlon Mitchell,
president of the Mustang Owners Club of California and owner of
Marlo's Frame &amp; Alignment in Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   "For God's sake have someone look at the car who knows something
about Mustangs before you buy the car," the proud owner of a '66
hardtop said. "And don't ever get in a hurry. It can take a couple of
months to find what you're looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Mustang shoppers also would be well advised to learn more about
the car. The $12.95 "Mustang Red Book: 19641/2-2000," by Peter
Sessler, is a terrific resource.</TE>

<LD>The annual Muckenthaler Cultural Center Concours d'Elegance in
Fullerton doesn't draw the crowds of a Pebble Beach or a Torrey Pines
show, but for a lot of car buffs that makes it all the better: You
can see the vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   About 150 of them will be gleaming on the center's landscaped
grounds Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   What began eight years ago as a simple Sunday car show now is the
final act in a week of events dubbed the Muckenthaler Motor Car
Festival.</LD>
<TE>   There are 15 categories of entrants vying for trophies, including
pre-1980 Chevrolet Corvettes and Ford Thunderbirds of all eras. Also
included are pre-1980 Porsches, pre-1925 horseless carriages,
European sports cars and American classics from 1925 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Special classes for stylish woodies and wildly inventive American
hot rods and custom cars draw raves even from spectators who don't
know a carburetor from a hubcap.</TE>
<TE>   Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for senior citizens and children
12 and younger.</TE>
<TE>   The center is at 1201 W. Malvern Ave. For information, call (714)
780-8382 or go to www.themuck.com.</TE>

<HD>Nissan to Replace Altima Air Bag Sensors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan Motor America has launched a "safety improvement campaign" to
improve air bag performance for its popular new 2002 Altima sedan,
and General Motors Corp. has begun a recall of an estimated 60,000 of
its new mid-size sport utility vehicles to fix a fuel filter.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan, which says its campaign is not a recall but a voluntary
effort to improve the Altima's safety systems, said it discovered
through an independent group's crash test program that a sensor
responsible for triggering the front air bags in certain situations
does not fire them as quickly as it should.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it would replace the sensors on an estimated
165,000 Altimas at no cost to owners. The company began notifying
affected car owners April 15.</LD>
<TE>   GM's recall was ordered last week after the company discovered
that a fuel filter fitting on Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and
Oldsmobile Bravada SUVs can become disconnected, effectively cutting
the main fuel line to the engine. If that happened, gasoline could be
pumped onto the ground or into hot engine parts, creating a potential
fire hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would begin notifying owners this month.</TE>
<TE>   In other recalls announced in April:</TE>
<TE>   * GM has called in 10,168 of its 2002 Chevrolet Malibu models
because the left low-beam headlight does not meet federal standards.
Owner notification is scheduled to begin this month.</TE>
<TE>   * GM also said it has been calling in 1,500 of its 2002 Saturn S-
Series cars, assembled in January and February, because the brake
pedal pad could separate from the pedal, causing the driver's foot to
slip while applying the brakes. The company said customer
notification began in late February.</TE>
<TE>   * Hyundai Motor America has recalled the 2001 models of its
flagship XG300 sedan because of a possible wiring harness fault that
could prevent the seat-mounted side air bag on the driver's side from
deploying properly. About 18,000 vehicles are involved.</TE>

<HD>GM Unveils Cadillac Crossover, Chevy Pickup Truck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. last week pulled the lid off two upcoming
vehicles--cementing the design directions for two of its
divisions--by releasing sketches of the all-new Cadillac "crossover,"
a mix between a passenger car and a sport utility vehicle, and the
successor to Chevrolet's S-10 pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   The low-slung Cadillac SRX is like a muscular station wagon, with
rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, that can carry up to seven people in
three rows of seats. Its striking, chiseled looks are in line with
the angular stealth bomber design that Cadillac has chosen as the
hallmark of its styling.</LD>
<LD>   With its first crossover, Cadillac will enter what has become the
fastest-growing segment in the automobile business today. Chrysler,
Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others have announced upscale
crossovers that have not yet gone into production.</LD>
<TE>   The SRX sits 3 inches higher than a luxury sedan but 4 inches
lower than a typical SUV. It will be built at the Lansing Grand River
plant in Michigan starting in the middle of next year as a 2004
model.</TE>
<TE>   The next Chevy compact pickup truck will have a name GM hopes will
evoke an image of hardy toughness and the rugged outdoors: the
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   GM unveiled a sketch last week of the Colorado, which replaces the
venerable S-10 pickup, introduced in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted a name that would fit within the Chevy truck portfolio
and stand out in the marketplace," Russ Clark, Chevrolet marketing
director for mid-size trucks, said. "With the development of an
all-new truck, it is crucial to select a new name that resonates well
with customers and has a strong presence."</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado bears the thick horizontal grille bar and trapezoidal
headlights that now are the trademark of Chevy trucks. GM would not
release additional details but said the Colorado would be built at
its Shreveport, La., plant starting in the fourth quarter of next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The S-10 has a sister compact pickup, the GMC Sonoma. GMC will
sell a version of the Colorado in Canada and is expected to follow up
with a GMC for American customers as well.</TE>

<HD>Cracking Down on Repeat Tollway Violators</HD>
<DH>Habitual cheaters have gone to outrageous lengths to avoid
paying the fares in Orange County. Those violations have cost more
than $7 million in lost tolls and fines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's amazing what some drivers will do to cheat Orange County's
tollways.</LD>
<LD>   Take the Ferrari driver who got caught on camera sneaking through
the 50-cent toll ramp at Newport Coast Drive.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of the wealthiest areas in Orange County, and the driver
was in one of the most expensive cars on the road. Yet he had a towel
hanging out of the trunk to obscure his license plate--all to avoid
paying a 50-cent toll.</LD>
<TE>   If you think that's outrageous, consider the motorist in an Acura
Integra who drove through a toll plaza recently. Surveillance cameras
captured a photo of an arm sticking out of the trunk, obscuring the
license plate: The driver had stashed an accomplice in the trunk to
save a few bucks.</TE>
<TE>   From 1999 through 2001, tollway cheaters at four of Orange
County's toll roads have racked up 4.6 million violations involving
nonpayment of tolls, according to statistics from the nonprofit
Transportation Corridor Agencies that operates all four of the toll
roads.</TE>
<TE>   Those violations cost the agency more than $7 million in lost
tolls and fines.</TE>
<TE>   Fed up, tollway officials have joined forces with the California
Highway Patrol to crack down on cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   They are focusing on habitual abusers. The worst make their way
onto a "hot list" that includes a few individuals with so many
violations and nonpayment fines that they each now owe close to
$80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to pay tolls, which range from 25 cents to several dollars
depending on the road and distance traveled, carries a $25 fine per
violation. When a car is identified bypassing the tollgate, a notice
is sent to the vehicle's registered owner. If the notice is ignored,
the fine goes up to $50, said TCA spokeswoman Clare Climaco.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking down these scofflaws and forcing them to pay is a
daunting challenge. One Riverside woman owes more than $58,000 in
fines and toll charges, according to Climaco. "We got a hold of her
... she said she was ignoring the notices because she had 'other
issues' to address."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with habitual offenders is tough because usually they are
"in trouble financially to begin with. They are moving around a lot
and have other debts to pay. We are the least of their worries,"
Climaco said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the agency has filed a handful of civil suits against the
most egregious violators, and although it has threatened to sue the
Riverside woman, Climaco said the TCA hopes it can negotiate a
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be wishful thinking. Climaco said the woman has
changed her name repeatedly to evade paying and continues to sneak
free rides on the tollways.</TE>
<TE>   That puts her in the sights of scofflaw hunters such as CHP
motorcycle officer Brian Habegger, one of many officers who patrol
the toll plazas.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can't see a FasTrak transponder in their window and they
don't have a license plate, I stop them," Habegger said. His catches
include a couple of drivers on the TCA's "hot list."</TE>
<TE>   A transponder is a device, usually mounted on the lower edge of a
vehicle's windshield, that sends an identification code via radio
signal to a receiver in the toll booth. Drivers with transponders
have their tolls deducted from a prepaid account and are able to pass
the toll booths without slowing.</TE>
<TE>   But some motorists hide their transponder so it won't be detected
and they won't be charged.</TE>
<TE>   If a car goes through a toll plaza without a working transponder
and the driver fails to stop and pay, a camera photographs the
vehicle. But if the driver has altered or removed the license plates,
it makes it tough to identify the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the people he's nailed for evading tolls, Habegger said
he's never heard anyone admit to wrongdoing. "They always play the
innocent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officer John Olah, who patrols the 91 Freeway tollway where
transponders are the only way to pay, said some motorists he's
stopped question why they should pay to drive on a road.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to get into the political side of it, [but] I just stay
out of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Californians aren't used to toll roads, TCA's Climaco said. They
"disagree with the idea of paying for something they believe should
be free."</TE>
<TE>   Officers have even seen drivers pull over to the side of the road
before they reach a toll plaza, take off their plates and put them in
the trunk. "After they pass through the [toll] ramp, they pull over
to the side again and put them back on," Climaco said.</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers think "we're the greedy toll road agency trying to
gouge customers. In reality, we are a public, nonprofit agency that
is simply there to repay [toll road construction] bond debt," she
said. "People don't understand that the reason the tollways were
built was because the state didn't have money to build enough
freeways."</TE>
<TE>   Since the agency and CHP began stepping up enforcement, the number
of violations and lost tolls has begun to decline.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of outstanding tolls for 2001 dropped to $1.7 million,
from $2.85 million in 2000, according to TCA figures.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 1.3% of the 82.3 million vehicles that traveled the
toll roads violated toll laws, down from 3% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Climaco said toll road authorities expect the number of
outstanding violations to drop even more. "We're tracking violators
down. Odds are we're going to catch them."</TE>

<HD>Show Tries to Erase Stereotypes Via Artifacts of Americas'
Past</HD>
<DH>An exhibition at Stanford showcases a hundred items from
the Peabody Essex Museum's Native American collection</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM BACA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>When a group of New England explorers set sail more than 200 years
ago, they brought back souvenirs from the indigenous people they
encountered, hoping to inspire later generations.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1799, the East India Marine Society had gathered so
many baskets, masks, blankets, headdresses, weapons and other
American Indian items that they established a museum in Salem, Mass.,
26 years later just to keep it all.</LD>
<LD>   The Peabody Essex Museum now has more than 20,000 pieces in its
Native American collection and can display only a fraction of
them--one of several injustices curators of a new exhibition at
Stanford University are hoping to counteract.</LD>
<TE>   A hundred items collected from the indigenous peoples of North and
South America are included in "Uncommon Legacies: Native American Art
From the Peabody Essex Museum," on view through Aug. 11 at the Iris &amp;
B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely seen treasures from the 17th through 20th centuries include
headdresses of blue and red macaw plumes worn by Brazilian chiefs,
and a Chilkat goat wool blanket depicting clan symbols that initially
could only be made or worn by wealthy Tlingit people of the Pacific
Northwest Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The show also tries to erase stereotypes and ethnocentric
viewpoints by depicting the everyday lives of Indians centuries ago,
said Tom Haukaas, a Lakota artist from the Rosebud Sioux reservation
in South Dakota who consulted on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Society members collected pipes, clubs and other symbols of
warfare. However, for this exhibition, Haukaas and other Indian
consultants made a point of including such items as hats, baskets,
food ladles and a baby carrier made by Plains tribes in the 1850s.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to de-romanticize, to show the breadth of our
cultures and still present pieces of great aesthetic appeal," Haukaas
said. "Reality is sitting at home."</TE>
<TE>   Early Marine Society members, on the other hand, apparently saw
themselves as bold adventurers exploring dark corners of the globe.</TE>
<TE>   One of several early American maritime groups, the society had a
unique purpose: Form a museum of natural artifacts from beyond the
Cape of Good Hope of South Africa and Cape Horn of South America. To
be a member, marine men had to sail around both continents.</TE>
<TE>   The seafarers met inhabitants of the Amazon forests while trading
for rubber in South America. Guano and silver trades brought them to
Peru, and a need for lumber drew them into northern New England and
Canada. The fur trade--particularly sea otter pelts in demand in
China--was the attraction in the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   The indigenous people soon saw a way to make money off the
visitors, creating items solely to be traded, such as human face
masks and black argillite smoking pipes made by the Haida, said John
Grimes, the Native American Indian curator at the Peabody Essex.</TE>
<TE>   The marine men kept detailed records, although they more often
recorded their own feelings than the customs they encountered, said
those who have studied their journals.</TE>
<TE>   "The most preposterous that I ever saw is the ornaments they wear
to their mouth," wrote Robert Haswell in May 1789, describing the
Haida women who lived near present-day British Columbia. "An incision
is cut in the lower lip ... into which is forced a piece of wood in
oval form."</TE>
<TE>   Society members often documented their collections in their
journals, recording dates, places and the tribe involved. Many other
American Indian collections of the time lack such documentation, said
Manuel Jordan, a curator at Stanford's Cantor Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the record keeping, at least one tribe, the Mohegan in
Connecticut, have requested four items for repatriation, including a
historic picture box.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1990 Native American Graves and Repatriation Act,
museums that receive public money are required to release a list of
their holdings to American Indian tribes. The museums are also
obligated to negotiate with tribes if they have sacred religious
objects, items used for the ongoing practice of religion or items
important to a nation's identity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the Peabody Essex returned a round picture box that
represented one of the few surviving written-language records of the
Mohegan. The box, made of elm, is carved with designs that document
the migration of the tribe's members to what is now Oneida, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Mohegan, native Hawaiians and Cayuga in New York are
the only tribes to request items from the Peabody Essex since museums
made their holdings public in 1992, Grimes said.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes understands this exhibition may stimulate conversations
about repatriating some objects, and he said museums should be
proactive about sharing their collections with native communities.
"We're open to that and welcome it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The same kind of thinking prompted the curators to include
American Indian input for this exhibition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason that a museum at this date and time should be
presuming to speak for native communities and interpreting native art
without the interpretation of native artist and scholars and
curators," Grimes said.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts lead to better understanding between the two
cultures, providing much better context for historical presentations,
Haukaas said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, museums are no longer places where visitors are told what
to think," he said.</TE>

<HD>She Sends Songs Into the Skies</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Tena R. Clark's company pipes music aboard Air
Force One, and she has just written a song for NASA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picture President Bush jetting in Air Force One toward tense meetings
with Asian leaders and keeping tabs on the Middle East. Then imagine
the weary commander in chief, looking for a musical respite, pulling
on the headset at his seat and hearing ... "Last Stand in Open
Country" by Willie Nelson and Kid Rock?</LD>
<LD>   It could have happened--that song, along with "You're Gonna Change
(Or I'm Gonna Leave)" performed by Tom Petty and "I Am a Man of
Constant Sorrow" from the Soggy Bottom Boys were among the tunes
playing on board during Bush's travels in February. They weren't
intended as veiled messages, just part of the famed aircraft's music
menu, which is cooked up by Mississippi-born songwriter Tena R. Clark
and her employees.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, who speaks in a honeyed drawl, began her music career as a
drummer in clubs but is now chief executive of Disc Marketing Inc.,
an unusual business based in a converted Pasadena fire station that
puts together music to market products (Toyota, General Mills and
Coca-Cola are among the clients), but also has what might be called
federal properties on the pop music landscape. Clark has just written
a new song, "Way Up There," intended to help NASA rekindle its
romance with young America, and she says she is also discussing some
business with the U.S. Army.</LD>
<TE>   More intriguing, she and her employees have had a contract since
1998 to program the music that is piped through headsets aboard Air
Force One and Air Force Two for the president, vice president, their
aides, security, guests and the press. As Clark puts it: "I joke with
people all the time: Who does the most powerful man in the free world
listen to when he's flying? Us, Disc Marketing. It is interesting."</TE>
<TE>   There's no way to tell which songs the president actually listens
to, but Ronnie Schiff, the Disc Marketing vice president overseeing
the aircraft programming, says some special preferences do trickle
back. The classic soul and blues channel that Clinton specifically
requested, for instance, was jettisoned when Bush's team took over
the plane. New selections of show tunes and film soundtrack songs
were added for the current administration.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton had a hearty appetite for music (he asked that the songs
be changed out more often than every two months when he had a
travel-heavy schedule) and gave more feedback. "The current
administration, of course, with everything going on, hasn't really
been telling us as much," Schiff said. So Schiff and company are left
to divine what the president might want. They're now putting together
an all-Texas music channel for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   They also have some fun. If Clinton tuned in the classic rock
channel in May 1998, for example, he might have heard an obscure song
by a familiar voice: "Fantasy of Love," by the oft-troubled first
brother, Roger Clinton. Air Force Two, which carried Vice President
Al Gore, had a staple selection from Paul Simon: "You Can Call Me
Al."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, if you picked up an Air Force One headset you
could have listened to the Keith Richards version of the Hank
Williams song "You Win Again" or flashbacks tracking Sting's career.
On his way to opening Olympic ceremonies in Salt Lake City in
February, the president also could have checked out a classical music
salute to the Games or settled for a survey of Nashville's newest
hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force One work is only a sliver of the business done by
Clark's company, which also programs music that can be heard by the
millions of United Airlines passengers who fly each month. The
business finds 85% of its revenues, though, by creating enhanced CDs
as new-tech marketing tools for corporate America, ranging from Betty
Crocker to Victoria's Secret. An example would be the ECD fashioned
for Target that had music and fun content for kids but also contained
information on the chain's toy selection and a link to buy the items
online with just a mouse click.</TE>
<TE>   Those accounts pay the bills, but the project closest to Clark's
heart at the moment has only netted $2,500 so far. That's the
standard NASA honorarium paid for artistic works, in this case the
song NASA will use as the theme song of its yearlong "Centennial of
Flight" celebration beginning in December. NASA approached Clark,
whom it had heard about through her work on movie theme songs and
heart-tugging R&amp;B tracks for Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle, Gladys
Knight and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in New York in the back of a taxi and my assistant called
and said, 'I have NASA on the phone,' and I said, 'Nasser? Nasser
who?' and she said, 'No, NASA, the rocket people,'" Clark recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The lyrics of "Way Up There" are of the heartfelt variety, and
while to cynics they may sound like a high school junior's poetry,
for many a mainstream music fan they might recall the soaring epics
favored by singers such as Celine Dion. The chorus: "Way up
there/Where peace remains/Where silence thunders and angels
sing/Imagination and amazing grace/brings us closer to our home in
space."</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to reach out to newer populations of people," said Bert
Ulrich, curator of NASA's arts projects. "And what Tena came up with
is a beautiful, inspirational ode to the centennial, and we're
thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   Clark grew up as the daughter of a colorful Mississippi political
power broker and stumbled bright-eyed into the music world with the
reckless aplomb of a true naif. At age 12, she lingered outside a Las
Vegas showroom to introduce herself to her hero, drummer Hal Blaine,
and, impressing him with her enthusiasm, found herself a mentor.
Later, after reading songwriter Hal David's name on an album jacket,
she called him up, and he too offered insights to the youngster and
kept tabs on her career.</TE>
<TE>   She has written jingles (she was co-writer of "Have You Had Your
Break Today?" for McDonald's) and theme songs for films ("Hope
Floats," "Where the Heart Is"), and about four years ago she saw in
her start-up company a chance to marry her music skills with
marketing savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was younger I didn't know enough to be scared, and now
I've been through too much to be scared," Clark says with a shrug.
"If I've learned one thing it's that whether you're marketing
something or trying to make a movie that connects with people,
nothing works better than emotion. And nothing creates emotion better
than music."</TE>

<HD>'Politically Incorrect' Canceled; ABC Goes With Jimmy
Kimmel</HD>
<DH>Television* Bill Maher's late-night talk show had been on
the ropes since the host's controversial remarks on Sept. 17. Kimmel
debuts Jan. 27.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jimmy Kimmel, another affable, beer-drinking comedian with a Peter
Pan complex, was introduced Tuesday as ABC's new late-night talk-show
host, making official ABC's dismissal of "Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher," which has been dying on the vine for some months.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came at an annual gathering of media buyers in
New York, where the broadcast networks are unveiling their new fall
prime-time lineups.</LD>
<LD>   As Kimmel was being trotted out before media buyers, Maher said in
an interview with The Times, "I don't mind being canceled. It's
actually time to move on. My hair was embarrassing when I started;
now it's just gray."</LD>
<TE>   Indications are that "P.I." will likely exit before the July 4
holiday, while Kimmel's talk show isn't slated to make its debut
until Jan. 27, the Monday after ABC broadcasts the Super Bowl. In the
interim, ABC announced that a half-hour extension of "Nightline,"
called "Nightline Close-Up," will air weeknights at 12:05 a.m.
beginning sometime this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "P.I." came to ABC in 1997 from Comedy Central, where for four
years it had built momentum as a hybrid form of talk show, using a
combination of celebrities, writers and pundits to take on hot-button
issues. Fresh as that format was, it always hindered the show's
ability to get A-list celebrity guests--stars who were more than
willing to discuss their new movie but less so their feelings about,
say, abortion.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was a comment by Maher that seemed to doom the
show. During a charged on-air discussion six days after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, Maher argued with the suggestion that the
hijackers were cowards, adding, "We have been the cowards, lobbing
cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away."</TE>
<TE>   "They have been pretending since Sept. 17 that I don't exist,"
Maher said of ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The comments eventually caused a public-relations firestorm: Major
sponsors, including Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. and FedEx Corp., pulled their
ads, and some affiliates yanked "P.I." off the air.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those stations, including the ABC affiliate in Washington,
D.C., never returned, though "P.I.'s" ratings have generally been
holding steady, with the show averaging roughly 2.5 million viewers
per night.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will ever convince me that there's not a connection
between saying things that are controversial and losing your place at
the podium," said Maher, who had run afoul of sponsors in the past.
"Don't they have advertiser problems on all of their shows now? We
didn't go off because the ratings went down.... Ours certainly didn't
go down, and last week they were way up.... So if it's not that, then
obviously the answer lies in the world of Faye Resnick."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group
(who formerly worked for Maher's managers at Brillstein-Grey
Entertainment), separated Maher's Sept. 17 comments from ABC's
decision to cancel the show.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been a terrific show for us," Braun said. "Bill Maher has
been tireless in his efforts."</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, ABC has insisted to producers that the
network was losing money on the show and wanted to land a personality
who would give the network a bigger entertainment presence in late
night.</TE>
<TE>   In March, ABC made a widely publicized play for CBS' David
Letterman, a move that would have supplanted both "P.I." and
"Nightline." Now "Nightline's" new companion show will be anchored by
Kimmel, best-known as co-host of Comedy Central's "The Man Show,"
which debuted in 1999 as a boldfaced attempt to draw in
18-to-34-year-old males.</TE>
<TE>   "Please do not breathe a word of this to Ted Koppel," Kimmel told
advertisers Tuesday, referring to the "Nightline" host.</TE>
<TE>   "The Man Show" features girls on trampolines and sketches spoofing
various regular-guy pursuits. Braun stressed during a conference call
with reporters that the network wasn't acquiring the show's format,
as it had with "Politically Incorrect," calling Kimmel "a very unique
talent."</TE>
<TE>   A Comedy Central spokesperson said the future of "The Man Show" is
uncertain. Kimmel and co-host Adam Carolla will tape 20 more episodes
to air later this year, and the pair are also behind the Comedy
Central series "Crank Yankers," in which puppets reenact prank phone
calls, which premieres in June.</TE>
<TE>   One person who might be watching Kimmel's new show is Maher. "I'm
glad it went to someone we used a lot as a guest on our show," he
said. "There's a guy I can truly be happy for. I watch 'The Man
Show.' I've probably seen every 'Man Show' they've ever made."</TE>
<TE>   Maher said he is in talks about hosting a new television show,
though he declined to offer specifics. "I don't mind at all losing my
job," he said. "If it came down to a choice between losing my job and
losing my soul, I'm glad I lost my job."</TE>

<LD>Inexperience and a certain naivete Monday night characterized
Marjorie Elinor Dix's debut recital on the Jose Iturbi Gold Medal
series at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<LD>   The young American soprano, who has already sung minor roles at
the Metropolitan Opera, showed promise, but.... She should have asked
her audience to stop applauding between songs. She should have warmed
up more thoroughly before her first item, Beethoven's aria "Ah!
Perfido"--indeed, she should have warmed up better for the entire
first half of the evening. She should have given more thought to her
programming, which looked fine on paper but which she couldn't quite
pull off.</LD>
<LD>   Dix's attractive soprano could turn into an important voice; she
might sing Aida or Sieglinde--her brief program bio said she has
already sung Fiordiligi. But more seasoning needs to be done in this
young career. The long warmup in this performance took up most of the
program. Songs by Beethoven, Schubert and Richard Strauss, and
Ravel's "Sheherazade," proved generally pallid and unconvincing.
Words were pronounced but meanings escaped the singer.</LD>
<TE>   Only in the final group, excerpts from Berlioz's "Nuits d'Ete,"
did the voice actually blossom and the singer's temperament really
show itself. The Berlioz songs revealed the voice's true timbre, its
impressive height, Dix's ability to sing long legato lines and to
project passion.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, as if to prove that the artist is also self-critical,
Dix repeated Strauss' "Zueignung," as an encore, and to greater
success than the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Her proper and accommodating, but often also perfunctory, pianist
was William David Hobbs.</TE>

<HD>Woody's Wish</HD>
<DH>Allen, his life 'a third' over, hopes age and humor can
thrive together</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Woody Allen is trying to think of a film comedian who pulled off
life's endgame successfully, who managed to keep connecting with
audiences at his age and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   He's having difficulty.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, I don't think Chaplin did," he says finally. "I would
have thought he could."</LD>
<TE>   Buster Keaton wound up collecting paychecks for "Beach Blanket
Bingo" and "How to Stuff a Wild Bikini."</TE>
<TE>   W.C. Fields? He maintained a funny persona, but "in not very good
films."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hope? People today remember the master of repartee as an old
man standing beside Brooke Shields "reading off cue cards on the end
of the battleship."</TE>
<TE>   The Marx Brothers? They were dazzling, then "their movies fell
off." Bad scripts were part of it, Allen is convinced, but even with
good ones, "audiences would have said, 'All right, we've seen these
tricks already in a half-dozen films. Enough already.'</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to come and see you if you don't develop or
change in some way. And none of those comics developed or changed.
The only one was Chaplin, and it wasn't for the better," Allen says,
recalling how the genius of silent film ended his career writing and
directing "The Countess From Hong Kong" in 1967. "Terrible."</TE>
<TE>   He has his answer, then. "Nobody."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody ran out. I can't think of anybody who didn't run out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woody Allen was pondering the trajectory of comic genius during a
quiet moment before he had to face yet another group of film and
drama students attending a screening of his latest film, "Hollywood
Ending." He's been out and about a lot lately, venturing far beyond
his safe Manhattan haunts. At the behest of his domestic distributor,
DreamWorks, he'd made his first trips ever to Canada and Texas before
ending his promotional tour here, in Georgia, another place he'd
never been. And today he makes his first appearance at Cannes, where
his movie will kick off the famous film festival.</TE>
<TE>   In March, he made a surprise first appearance at the Academy
Awards after turning down 13 past invites. That's where he brought up
his age.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 66," he quipped. "A third of my life is over now."</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar crowd laughed on cue at Allen's optimistic calculation
of his life span--198 years by his count--and that was the whole
idea, he insists here. He simply wanted to "say something amusing,"
just as he did with the "random" gags he concocted for his stand-up
comedy routines decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if Woody Allen has stopped seeing his shrink, it seems
fair to wonder whether any remark about age could be entirely random
coming from a filmmaker who could well be feeling his own after a
lifetime of obsessing over death, the unconscious and other
terrifying absurdities of human existence.</TE>
<TE>   He just got the math a little wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's father, Martin, a onetime jewelry engraver, died last
year, at 100. His mother, Netty, died this January, at 95.</TE>
<TE>   If his parents are a guide, two-thirds of his life is past, not
ahead of him. But that still gives him 30 to 35 years, three more
decades to distract himself and see if he can defy the cruel reality
that caught up with Charlie Chaplin and the rest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In "Hollywood Ending," he plays an Oscar-winning director who's
sunk so low he's doing deodorant commercials in the Canadian tundra.
When his gorgeous ex-wife wrangles him a last chance to direct a
feature, the hypochondriac goes blind. "At least you won't be able to
read the reviews," his agent says.</TE>
<TE>   No one would confuse Allen's real-life status with that, however
weak his box office of late. That means little to him, anyway, or so
he says, time and again. What counts is that he's had loyal foreign
distributors and a series of domestic ones who back him on his terms.
In recent years, he's gone from Miramax to Fine Line to Sony Pictures
Classics, and now to DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   His terms are total freedom, except for budget. He churns out his
one-a-year movies on a shoestring by today's standards, for little
more than $15 million. In return, he writes the scripts he wants,
casts the actors he wants and gets "final cut." There's no meddling
from the sort of studio executives he skewers in "Hollywood Ending,"
guys who have great tans but can't pronounce "auteur" and lecture him
on how "Hitchcock was an artist, but he was commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's freedom means he can mock their vintage car collections,
having his character say, "If I drove around in a 1939 Mercedes,
people would think I was Himmler," and no real-life studio honcho can
grumble about how most moviegoers today probably never have heard of
the Nazi SS chief.</TE>
<TE>   Allen doesn't hear how the line plays with the Atlanta college
students who fill a theater in an upscale mall multiplex--he refuses
to watch his movies. Only after the credits roll does a public
relations aide take his arm and lead him down the aisle to the stage.
The students ask questions into a microphone, but the moderator
sometimes has to repeat them. The guest is hard of hearing.</TE>
<TE>   He's been saying for years that he's basically "lazy" and does so
again this evening, advising the students to study films of "the
really great" directors such as Bergman and Kurosawa. He writes his
scripts in "a couple of weeks," he tells them, and is not big on
rehearsing or endless reshooting. "If it's 6 o'clock at night and
I've done two takes of something and they're decent takes and there's
a basketball game on television ... that's it for me."</TE>
<TE>   The kids laugh at the notion that he is, in their parlance, a
slacker. Yet Allen seems serious as he goes on: " ... And I'm sure it
shows in the films.... I don't get perhaps the maximum out of my
work, but I get the bare minimum to have sustained a career, you
know, amidst many financial failures."</TE>
<TE>   It will be 10 years this summer that he became less funny to many
people when it was revealed that he was having an affair with Soon-Yi
Previn, the adopted daughter of his then-girlfriend, Mia Farrow. But
he and Soon-Yi are married now, with two children, and that's not an
issue with this crowd, which clearly came to the theater wanting his
film to work.</TE>
<TE>   The students laugh again at his quip about his failures, then
stand and applaud as an aide takes his arm once more and leads him up
the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, he's back in New York, talking about how gorgeous
Savannah was. After Atlanta, he took Soon-Yi and the kids to see the
coastal city's famous squares ringed with historic homes and
moss-draped trees, like any tourist family. He also sampled "real
Southern cooking," including fried chicken and cheese biscuits,
"stuff which I later learned is fried in Crisco and sticks of
butter," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Texas, he'd sampled the barbecue ribs, which leads into a
bit about why he won't live as long as his father. Dad ate food like
that every day it seems--eggs for breakfast, ice cream at night,
etc.--and never gave it a thought. Woody doesn't dare risk such
deadly fare, except he had just tried those juicy ribs, "the first
time I would say in 30 years," and now he's imagining the fat oozing
into his veins, "and all that thinking will probably cost me more
time on my life than my father's eating all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   You can't help hoping that he has indeed relished such moments,
and this whole getting-out-in-the-world business. You want to think
it's an act, largely shtick, how fragile he seems off the set,
hunching in his slight shoulders as if expecting a battering from
who-knows-what.</TE>
<TE>   "I never have a comfortable moment," he says.</TE>
<TE>   We're in his screening room off Park Avenue. Cabinets along one
wall are filled with old jazz albums. The brown sofa in the back of
the room is frayed, feathers pushing out of the seams.</TE>
<TE>   I've brought a caricature of him done a decade ago by a
psychiatrist friend, playing off the graveyard scene in Hamlet. Here
the skeleton is contemplating his skull, declaring, "Alas, poor
Woody."</TE>
<TE>   America's best-known shrink-goer before Tony Soprano stopped his
therapy a few years back. "Talking things out" took way too long, he
says. Now they can give you "these little low-dosage pills," before a
trip to overcome apprehension about flying, say. "Some people feel
antidepressants should be taken by everyone over the age of 65," he
adds.</TE>
<TE>   He can make a routine out of that too, of course, wondering what
such chemistry might have done for fictional characters, like "if you
had given Blanche DuBois some Prozac."</TE>
<TE>   Allen says, "I have a low level of depression my whole life. That
depression has given me a kind of apathy that gets mistaken over the
years for either reclusiveness or arrogance. But it's not. Like I'll
say I don't care if my film does well at the box office, I don't care
what the reviews say. But I mean it ... from a kind of 'What does it
all mean in the end anyhow?' point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Since he was in Atlanta, the reviews have started coming out for
his film. He's gotten a few three-star notices and advertising blurb
quotes--"the laughs are guaranteed"--but others are merciless. The
New York Times compares his picture to the "sweaty flops" that ended
the career of six-time Oscar winner Billy Wilder, who died in March
at 95, having not made a film in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Allen swears he doesn't care. He cites the discovery of ruins of
ancient Aztec stadiums, "and you think of thousands of people filling
these ... cheering and rooting for their generation's Michael Jordan.
And it's of zero consequence to us. I mean, less than zero. And to
them--I could see guys, you know, rooting and being thrilled and
coming out, 'Hey, are you bringing your wife over Thursday night?'
And what did it mean? It's just such a powerful potent nothing."</TE>
<TE>   One of the children of writer-director Preston Sturges once sent
him a copy of Sturges' classic "Sullivan's Travels," about a
filmmaker who sets out to make a statement about the sad state of the
world but winds up learning the power of laughter when he sees
convicts on a chain gang howl at a cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really believe laughter redeems anything," Allen says
now. "I feel it's a distraction. It can be a pleasant distraction ...
just as music is."</TE>
<TE>   He wakes up in the middle of the night with "terrifying thoughts,"
he says. That's when he concocts his lists: of baseball all-star
teams, picking singles hitters only perhaps; or film lists, maybe the
10 best silent comedies. He draws up lists until he falls asleep
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to think of all the women that I've gone to bed with
in my life," Allen says, flirting with another bit. "There's not that
many. It's not that taxing."</TE>
<TE>   The talk of best comedies brings us back to Wilder, the
writer-director behind "Some Like It Hot" and of great dramas also.
Wilder continued coming up with ideas for films in later years but
complained he couldn't "make a deal."</TE>
<TE>   "He got trapped," Allen says. "He worked in the Hollywood system
... so he was in the hit-flop syndrome there. As long as he did hits,
fine, they're breaking your door down. When you have a flop or a
couple of flops, they don't want to know you."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's role models for longevity come from the art-house
cinema--Bergman, Kurosawa and Spain's Luis Bunuel, who produced one
of his best works, "That Obscure Object of Desire," when he was 77.</TE>
<TE>   Allen says, "As long as my health holds out ... I see no reason
why I couldn't ... write and direct films, you know, my whole life,
providing I had something amusing to say, or something interesting to
say. Because I feel there's someone always around to fund me at the
low level that I'm required. I could always go to Europe or
someplace, there's always somebody willing to put up a certain amount
of money."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly true at the moment. DreamWorks seems to have no
qualms about the deal calling for the studio to distribute three
Allen comedies, one to go. It's "low risk," notes co-founder Jeffrey
Katzenberg. And the potential upside is obvious: the possibility that
Allen could yet turn out another gem.</TE>
<TE>   For all his disclaimers about nothing mattering, Allen wouldn't
mind doing that. He speaks often of his luck at having been born with
what Noel Coward called "the talent to amuse," but also of his hope
to produce a film that could be shown with those of his idols.</TE>
<TE>   When audiences hear that, they gush about some work of his--a
student in Texas went on for two minutes on why "Manhattan" was a
masterpiece. "I happen not to agree," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   But much as he recoils at such praise, he resists criticism he
perhaps ought to hear. How will anyone convince him it may be time to
scrap those screen romances with women 30 years younger? Even his
loyal fans may have found his latest, with Tea Leoni, hard to
believe.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to me," Allen says. "I can picture it in a shot."</TE>
<TE>   He bristles again when asked how he'd know if he is losing touch.
"It's hard to imagine that phenomenon exists," he says, "except in
kind of the drama of journalism."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His film opens the next day and takes in $2.2 million its first
weekend, $112 million less than "Spider-Man." "Hollywood Ending" just
makes the box-office Top 10, tied for the last spot.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian, the Los Angeles-based box-office tracker,
wonders whether Allen's "older audience" may have been "afraid to go
to the theater because of the 'Spider-Man' crowds." But this past
weekend, even as Allen headed to Cannes, it dropped off the list.</TE>
<TE>   Back in his studio, Allen had recalled what others might call his
glory days, when Marshall Brickman, his writing collaborator on films
such as "Annie Hall" and "Sleeper," suggested they drive by a theater
to see the line outside. "And there was a line," Allen said. "Then we
dispersed to our separate dwellings and my life didn't change. I
began to think, 'Now what?' 'What do I do?' 'How do I fill the
hours?'"</TE>
<TE>   His answer was, and remains: "I start writing something else."</TE>
<TE>   Next month, he begins filming his next diversion, "a comedy of
high paranoia," with Glenn Close and Danny DeVito, trying once again
to amuse the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>CBS Drops 'Max Bickford'; ABC Sets a 'Happy Hour'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Add a few more names to the list of film stars who have failed to
conquer prime-time television, with CBS canceling its Richard
Dreyfuss vehicle "The Education of Max Bickford" and its Supreme
Court drama "First Monday," starring Joe Mantegna, as the network
prepares to unveil a fall lineup featuring five new dramas and a pair
of new sitcoms.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, meanwhile--the network controlled by the Walt Disney Co.,
which operates a theme park known as "The happiest place on
Earth"--on Tuesday officially announced a major overhaul of its
schedule that the network will try to make more cohesive by marketing
8 to 9 p.m. weekdays as "The ABC Happy Hour," offering a mix of
sitcoms, "America's Funniest Home Videos" and the fantasy adventure
"Dinotopia."</LD>
<LD>   CBS--which presents its new programming roster to advertisers in
New York today as part of the so-called upfront market, a programming
showcase meant to impress media buyers--has also dropped "Family
Law," the Monday night drama in its third season.</LD>
<TE>   "Max Bickford," with Dreyfuss as a professor going through a
midlife crisis and co-starring fellow Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden,
was given the coveted slot between "60 Minutes" and CBS' Sunday movie
in September, but after a strong opening, the program's ratings
dropped substantially. Moreover, the show's creators left a few weeks
after the series made its debut over a dispute regarding the
program's creative direction.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to ax "First Monday" means both of the Supreme
Court-themed series introduced this year failed to reach a second
term. ABC yanked "The Court," starring Sally Field, in April.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will again rely on familiar faces in its new series, along
with a heavy dose of crime. Newcomers in that genre include "Without
a Trace," with Anthony LaPaglia heading the FBI's missing-persons
unit; "RHD/LA," a series from director Michael Mann, who produced
"Miami Vice," starring Tom Sizemore as the head of the LAPD's
robbery/homicide division; "Hack," featuring David Morse ("St.
Elsewhere") as an ex-cop-turned-taxi-driver who helps people,
co-starring Andre Braugher; and "CSI: Miami," an already previewed
spinoff of the network's top-rated show, "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," featuring David Caruso, who previously struck out at
CBS in the drama "Michael Hayes."</TE>
<TE>   The other drama is "Presidio Med," a medical show starring "China
Beach" alumna Dana Delany from "ER" producer John Wells.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' new comedies are "Still Standing," with Mark Addy (of the
film "The Full Monty") and Jami Gertz as a blue-collar couple; and
"Bram and Alice," starring Alfred Molina--who previously starred in
CBS' short-lived "Ladies Man"--as a famous novelist, from former
producers of "Frasier."</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC officials might be forgiven for craving cocktails
after the difficult year they've endured, the network said it's
hoping the "happy hour" concept will evoke family-based hits such as
"Roseanne" and "Home Improvement," a niche "that the network got away
from the past several years," ABC Entertainment Television Group
Chairman Lloyd Braun told reporters Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Given that ABC's prime-time lineup has witnessed a ratings decline
of more than 20% this season, Braun added that the network's goals
for its first "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"-less schedule since
January 2000 are modest.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody expects us to jump into first place next year," Braun
said. "We are looking to show progress.... We have to stabilize our
schedule."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's biggest gamble is Tuesday nights, when it will combine three
new comedies with the first-year series "According to Jim," which
moves over from Wednesdays. Notably, John Ritter, who spent seven
years chasing women each Tuesday on the network in "Three's Company,"
will play an overprotective father of teenagers in "8 Simple Rules
for Dating My Teenage Daughter."</TE>
<TE>   The network's enthusiasm regarding the decision to schedule
"Dinotopia," meanwhile, may have been tempered somewhat after Monday
night, as viewing of the three-part miniseries slipped to 13.4
million viewers--still a solid performance by ABC's standards, but a
significant drop from the 17 million who viewed Part 1 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the program premiered, ABC had ordered episodes of a
weekly series, but the producers will still face a formidable
challenge getting a program that relies so heavily on
computer-generated graphics ready for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Here is ABC's fall schedule (new series in italic):</TE>
<TE>   Sunday: "The Wonderful World of Disney," "Alias," "The Practice."</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "The Drew Carey Show," "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" "Monday
Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter,"
"According to Jim," "Life With Bonnie," "Less Than Perfect," "NYPD
Blue."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "My Wife and Kids," "The George Lopez Show," "The
Bachelor II," "Meds."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: "Dinotopia," "Push, Nevada," "PrimeTime Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "America's Funniest Home Videos," "That Was Then,"
"20/20."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday: Movie.</TE>

<LD>   Salonen on the Life of 'Foreign Bodies'</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen will
conduct the U.S. premiere of his orchestral composition "Foreign
Bodies" at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday. The piece, he
says, is a reflection of the effect of Los Angeles on him and his
work.</LD>
<TE>   After a decade here, the Finnish-born conductor still sees himself
as a "misplaced, shy Northerner amidst extroverted and confident
Californians"--a "foreign body," so to speak. But he says he's also
changed during his California stint, becoming less "cerebral."</TE>
<TE>   "As the title suggests, the piece is very physical in
nature--almost athletic," he says. "I'm playing around with ideas
such as moving very heavy masses of sound at unlikely speeds. You
can't separate the intellectual from the physical and emotional when
it comes to aesthetics. I'm also becoming more direct--interested in
arrows that go straight to the bull's-eye rather than making
arabesques along the way."</TE>
<TE>   The 21-minute piece, conceived during Salonen's sabbatical in
2000, had its world premiere in Germany with the Finnish Radio
Orchestra last August--eliciting good reviews. When it was performed
in London, he recalls, the reaction was far more mixed ("Five papers,
five opinions--that's the fun of having several newspapers").</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate its American debut, actor Dennis Hopper is throwing a
star-studded, Cuban-themed bash at his Venice home Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Composing and conducting use very different muscles--one's a
marathon and the other is a sprint," Salonen says. "And both take up
a lot of space; sometimes it feels as if one head is too small."</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen and E Street Band to Release Album</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band are set to release their
first studio album in 15 years this summer. It was previewed for
retailers, distributors and record company representatives Tuesday in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The storied alliance's last studio collection of new material was
"Tunnel of Love" in 1987. Springsteen broke ties with his longtime
group in 1989 and reunited with it a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Feterl, Tower Records' Southwest territory director, expects
the record to be a big seller. "His audience is still there as long
as his label can get the word out," said the executive, who was
invited to Tuesday's unveiling. "I think that's one older rocker
that's gonna continue to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Aaliyah's Parents Sue Over Daughter's Death</TE>
<TE>   Virgin Records, Blackhawk International Airways and several video
production companies are among those accused of negligence in a suit
filed by the parents of Aaliyah, who died in a plane crash in August.
The 22-year-old R&amp;B singer was in the Bahamas shooting a video for
her album "Rock the Boat" when the twin-engine Cessna went down,
killing all aboard.</TE>
<TE>   In papers filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, Michael
and Diane Haughton allege that the plane was "not an appropriate
aircraft for the entourage" and was loaded in a "dangerous and unsafe
configuration." To make matters worse, the pilot, Luis Morales III,
was "inexperienced and unqualified" and should not have been at the
controls, they said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from Virgin or the other
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg Belatedly Dons Cap and Gown</TE>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg, one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the
world, is adding "college degree" to his credits</TE>
<TE>   The director of such blockbusters as "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"
and "Schindler's List," started taking courses in film and electronic
arts at Cal State Long Beach in 1965 but left the university three
years later to pursue a movie career. Determined to demonstrate his
regard for higher education, he re-enrolled in spring 2001. He plans
to participate in commencement exercises on May 31.</TE>
<TE>   Minnelli Stepmom Drops Abuse Suit</TE>
<TE>   Liza Minnelli's 94-year-old stepmother has dropped her lawsuit
accusing the entertainer of elder abuse and breach of contract. "I
can't sue Liza," Lee Anderson Minnelli told Superior Court Judge
Gregory O'Brien Jr. on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the action filed last month, Anderson Minnelli claimed that her
late husband, Vincente Minnelli, guaranteed her housing in his will,
but her stepdaughter recently sold the Beverly Hills home where she'd
lived for 40 years and instructed representatives to remove her
stepmother by "whatever means necessary." Tamara Green, attorney for
the plaintiff, said her client had been influenced by a recent phone
call from Liza, suggesting they have dinner at Spago. The elder
Minnelli maintained she had never wanted to sue. "I love her," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Liza Minnelli declined to comment. But her spokesman, Warren
Cowan, said previously she has treated her stepmother generously,
paying her expenses and offering to buy her a condominium to replace
the home.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Bernadette Peters and Gregory Hines were named Tuesday to host the
56th annual Tony Awards, to be broadcast on CBS June 2....HBO is
bringing back "The Sopranos" for a fourth season on Sept. 15--nearly
a year and a half after the third season ended in May 2001....Jason
Alexander has been named the first George Burns Distinguished

teach acting and musical theater starting in the fall.</TE>

<HD>When Worlds Collide</HD>
<DH>Linda Pollari and Robert Somol have designed a house for
themselves that embraces its urban context while evoking a bit of
postwar paradise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its single-family tract houses, pristine lawns and streamlined
cars, the suburban dream of postwar Los Angeles faded away long ago.
It was swallowed up in a whirlpool of soaring land prices, rising
congestion and social unrest.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent years, a younger generation of Los Angeles
architects has been revisiting those old suburban cliches and imbuing
them with a tougher urban edge. The result has often been a grittier
vision of the city, a mix of suburban tranquillity and urban chaos,
baked under a subtropical sun.</LD>
<LD>   Few projects capture that shift with more force than a recently
completed house by the architectural team of Robert Somol and Linda
Pollari. Built on a vacant lot overlooking a busy intersection at
Olympic Boulevard and Highland Avenue, the $425,000 house is
conceived as a clash of urban and suburban images, a vision of the
American dream under siege. As such, it acts as a powerful metaphor
for a city precariously balanced between fantasy and reality, between
its shrinking aspirations and a stubborn desire to pursue worn-out
dreams.</LD>
<TE>   Pollari and Somol, who married in 1994, moved here from the East
Coast six years ago. Pollari, 47, is chairwoman of Environmental
Design at Otis College of Art and Design; Somol, 42, teaches at
UCLA's graduate department of architecture. Like generations of young
architects before them, they saw Los Angeles as a place where
untested talents could launch a career by designing small,
residential projects on limited budgets.</TE>
<TE>   But the ideal client never appeared. And the kind of abundant,
cheap lots where early Modernists such as Rudolf Schindler once
created their most revolutionary works no longer exist.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the couple decided that they could best satisfy their
architectural aspirations by designing a house for themselves. The
lot they purchased was no one's picture of paradise: Slightly
asymmetrical, it extends 150 feet along Olympic Boulevard, tapering
down from 60 feet wide along Highland to roughly 40 feet at its other
end. Somol calls the site "an acoustical disaster zone," and he
estimates that thousands of cars, trucks and buses pass by every day.</TE>
<TE>   The organization of the plan is deceptively simple. A carport
faces Highland Avenue while the rest of the house stretches out along
Olympic, framed by two long walls that reflect the geometry of the
site. The rooms--office, kitchen, living area, bathroom and
bedroom--are arranged in a single file, which decrease in size as the
walls converge. The rest of the lot becomes an enclosed private yard,
a sliver of suburbia tucked behind the house's barrier-like form.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the 1,700-square-foot house becomes a wedge between two
opposing conditions: the mechanized world of the automobile passing
by outside and the harmonious suburban world of the yard in back.
Seen from Olympic, the house appears fortress-like. Its shimmering,
corrugated metal facade is relatively blank, pierced by two
horizontal, slot-like windows.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, the house is as unpretentious as an industrial shed.
Its sleek, concrete floors and industrial fixtures give it an
appealing informality. Its wedge-like shape creates a forced
perspective in the living area, exaggerating its length.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the design compelling is its ability to transform a
seemingly mundane context into something of beauty. Set at eye level,
for example, the narrow slot windows frame a view of the cars
streaming by outside in both directions. The effect is mesmerizing.
During rush hour, the monotonous flow of cars evokes the slow rhythm
of waves lapping up on a beach--a sort of soothing urban
tranquilizer.</TE>
<TE>   The back wall, meanwhile, is more delicately conceived. Two
concrete block segments break up the wall's horizontal rhythm. A long
steel I-beam supports the roof above a series of sliding glass
partitions, giving the house a surprising sense of lightness. When
they are open, the glass doors disappear behind one of the concrete
block walls, so that the entire house opens up to the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Seen from here, the yard is a compact version of the conventional
suburban fantasy. A series of deck areas are carved out of the lush,
green lawn--an oval deck for lounge chairs, a smaller concrete pad
for the barbecue. Eventually, the architects hope to build a large
amoeba-shaped pool that will cover most of the yard. Modeled on the
swimming pool at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, the pool will have
a shallow "sand bar" where couples can recline in waist-high water
and sip drinks.</TE>
<TE>   The image evokes the Rat Pack glamour of Frank Sinatra and Sammy
Davis Jr., if at low-budget prices. The idea is that the American
dream, perhaps a bit blurrier after a few martinis, still haunts us.
It has simply been driven underground, tucked away in the cracks and
crevices of the city's collective unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Such fantasies are a far cry from the Modernist Case Study Houses
of the 1950s. Then, architects such as Pierre Koenig and Raphael
Soriano sought to create models for a perfectly balanced universe.
Their designs--which seemed to embody Le Corbusier's famous phrase
that "a house is a machine for living"--were an expression of Utopian
idealism, refined glass-and-steel structures where nuclear families
lived in blissful harmony with nature.</TE>
<TE>   The Pollari Somol House sums up the profound generational shift
that has taken place since that time. The old Utopian order is dead.
The new Utopia will be rooted in harder realities, shaped by more
personal desires. It is less concerned with high art ideals than with
popular images. Its sense of social mission lies in its lack of
pretension, its openness to new experience, its empathy for everyday
life. It is a more complex, imperfect vision, but seen from a certain
perspective, it is equally seductive--and perhaps more within our
reach.</TE>

<HD>Cellist Gives Mint Crowd Blast From the Past</HD>
<DH>Matt Haimovitz's Bach program in a rock-club environment
would have pleased the old master.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early Monday evening, Bach barged past the bouncers at the Mint, a
club on Pico, and once in, acted like he owned the joint. And for a
couple of hours, he did, as Matt Haimovitz took over the bandstand,
playing the first three of Bach's six suites for solo cello. It was
standing room only in the club, and the audience, even those quietly
munching on hamburgers or salads, listened with rapt concentration.</LD>
<LD>   That this revered, centuries-dead composer could sound more at
home in a house of rock, blues and jazz than he does in many a
concert hall or church is an eerie phenomenon, but not an
inexplicable one. Bach did not write for the concert hall--there
weren't any in his day. His instrumental ensemble music was played
either in the court or at Zimmermann's coffeehouse in Leipzig; the
solo pieces for violin, cello and harpsichord were mostly for private
use in the home.</LD>
<LD>   So my guess is that in its brief visit to the Mint, Bach's ghost
met with fewer surprises than it would have at the Music Center. The
modern cello is a bolder, louder instrument than the one the composer
knew, and the use of amplification could only have been a wonder to
him. But given how he loved to pump up the volume on his organ music,
these are things he surely would have embraced.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing, on the other hand, would have been more familiar to Bach
than music competing with conversation and food. If anything, he
would have marveled at the respectful Monday night crowd--young and
old. His biggest complaint might have been that the beer served in
America is too weak.</TE>
<TE>   Haimovitz played to the crowd and the setting, and that was
another revelation of the evening. Experts in the historically
correct approaches to early music tell us that Bach's music sounded
radically different than Haimovitz's hyper-emotional, in-your-face
approach. Certainly the thin-toned, 17th-century cellos with their
cat-gut strings don't inspire anything so robust as what this
31-year-old Israeli-born cellist achieves.</TE>
<TE>   But what of the playing itself? Might not musicians in Bach's day,
and Bach himself, have been tempted to exaggerate in just the way
that Haimovitz did in order to grab a restive audience's attention?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Mint offered the ideal opportunity for placing Bach
in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there were disconnects in performing such intensely
private music in such an exposed venue. But modern life is lived
through disconnects, and Bach has little meaning for us if his music
can't function our way. What Haimovitz was able to prove is that
timelessness in music doesn't rely so much on historically
re-creating the conditions of earlier times as it does in finding the
appropriate up-to-date ones.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in a club gave Haimovitz permission to go a little wild.
He took liberties. They were imaginative, illuminating ones that
reminded us what a fanciful improviser Bach was reputed to have been
and how he constantly rethought his music and everyone else's. One
example was the pallid, otherworldly tone Haimovitz produced for the
second Minuet of the Suite No. 1. Another was the weight, heavy as a
thumping electric bass, with which he landed on the slow chords at
the end of the Prelude to the Suite No. 2. Neither of these effects
is on Haimovitz' recent, enthralling recording of the Suites. They
don't belong there, but they did at the Mint.</TE>
<TE>   After a brilliant beginning as a prodigy, which included a
high-profile record contract with Deutsche Grammophon, Haimovitz is
in the process of reinventing his career. He dropped out of concert
life in the mid-1990s, just when he might have moved on to a new
level of stardom, to attend Harvard and learn more of the world. Now
he is back, brimming with fresh ideas. He has founded his own record
label, Oxingale. His "Listening Room" tour is taking him around the
country to play the Bach suites in pop clubs for very little money
(tickets Monday were $15, the club seats only a couple hundred, and
Haimovitz's fee was a cut of the gate) but a great deal of glory.</TE>
<TE>   In these experiments, Haimovitz has, indeed, recaptured the
freshness in music making. There is nothing like the intimacy of
hearing great music in a close, casual environment, and Monday night
the cellist seemed to absorb as much energy from the crowd as we did
from him. That pleasant smile he gave when a beeper went off during
an especially intense moment was an acknowledgment that even the
deepest sentiments must exist in an imperfect world.</TE>
<TE>   Haimovitz's set Monday was early, an opener for the more typical
bands that appear at the Mint. After the Bach was over, the club
returned to normal--it was louder, a bit more raucous, more of what
it must have been like at Zimmermann's. But magic had been in the
air, and I think everyone understood it. Bach blessed the Mint.</TE>

<HD>In 'Lost World,' a Frantic Rush to Preserve Inca Mummies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of mummies were uncovered recently at an Inca burial site,
the main portion of which lies just under the surface of a modern-day
schoolyard in a shantytown near Lima, Peru.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight on PBS, in "Inca Mummies: Secrets of a Lost World" (9
p.m., KCET, KVCR), National Geographic Explorer teams are seen
rushing to salvage what remains of the schoolyard burials and two
other archeological sites.</LD>
<LD>   Their finds could shed light on the development and conquest of
the Inca Empire, famed for its roadways, complex communications
system and high-altitude terrace irrigation system.</LD>
<TE>   But the sites are threatened by humans. Once "a sacred place,
undisturbed for hundreds of years," in the words of archeologist
Guillermo Cock, the area was leveled in 1998 by Tupac Amaru Indians
using bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Tupac Amaru children crowd in to watch as the scientific team
gently sifts the soil, brushes away the dust of ages and lifts out
the fragile mummies wrapped in cloth--"mummy bundles"--that can
contain as many as six family members and grave goods that had been
laid to rest five centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras also follow archeologist Peter Frost to a
high-altitude site of human sacrifices and to Vilcabamba, the site of
an Incan settlement.</TE>
<TE>   They also record the preliminary laboratory examinations of the
mummy bundles.</TE>
<TE>   But the focus always returns to the desperate rush to excavate the
Tupac Amaru site. Here the incongruous sounds of the playground, the
chatter of children, are heard under the footage of the desecrated
faces of the Incas, underscoring the urgency of the scientists' race
against time--and the sewage pipes, power lines and other emblems of
progress that may someday destroy the last traces of the Inca Empire.</TE>

<HD>Real World Looms Over Opening of the 55th Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>Politics at frivolous, fun-loving Cannes? Don't be surprised. Serious
matters have always been woven into the tapestry of European film in
general and the Festival de Cannes in particular. It's just that in
some years, affairs of state are more prominent than others. This
year, the festival's 55th, looks to be one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Cannes, which opens tonight with Woody Allen's "Hollywood Ending,"
was literally born into politics. Its first edition in 1939 ended
after but a single day when Germany invaded Poland and World War II
began. And in 1968, a political crisis and nationwide general strike
in France stopped the festival in its tracks and led to the formation
of the rival Directors Fortnight event.</LD>
<LD>   No one expects anything quite that cataclysmic this year. But
after a soul-searching French presidential election so recent it
still dominates newsmagazine covers--not to mention Sept. 11 and the
ongoing Israeli-Palestinian crisis--nothing looks the same anymore.
Even the rash of "Attack of the Clones" French movie covers (the
latest "Star Wars" episode screens here on Thursday) can be viewed as
reminders that the federation itself is not immune to political
crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to calm the waters after Sept. 11, festival president
Gilles Jacob wrote to concerned Americans that "the festival security
services, working in coordination with the police forces, are already
putting measures in place to reinforce security" including
bomb-sniffing dogs that can be seen around town and in rail stations
around the country. Anti-Semitic incidents in France led the American
Jewish Congress to place "For Your Consideration at Cannes" ads in
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter darkly comparing France in 1942
with France in 2002 and announcing that "Jewish travelers to France
are urged to 'exercise extreme caution.'"</TE>
<TE>   Even the films in competition, it turns out, have political
connections. For the first time ever, there is both an Israeli and a
Palestinian film in the main event. The former, "Kedma," about newly
arrived 1948 refugees pressed into military service, is by veteran
director Amos Gitai ("Kaddosh"). The latter, "Intervention Divine," a
present-day love story with political implications, is by Elia
Suleiman, whose "Chronicle of a Disappearance" won a major prize at
Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Also highly politicized is "Ararat," the new work from Canadian
Atom Egoyan ("The Sweet Hereafter.") A modern-day drama that focuses
on the 1915 massacre of Armenians, the still-unseen film has drawn so
much protest from Turkish groups, including a Web site with a
boycott-threatening form letter to be sent to distributor Miramax,
that Egoyan took the unusual step of declining a spot in the
competition because he didn't want to add to the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Even films from the U.S., which don't necessarily go in for this
kind of thing, have their political moments this year. Michael
Moore's "Bowling for Columbine," taking what is sure to be a
controversial look at guns and violence, is the first documentary to
be allowed in the competition in decades. And Rosanna Arquette's
out-of-competition documentary "Searching for Debra Winger" deals
with the sexual politics actresses face as they age.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Moore's film, two other American features are in
competition, and they look to be among the most interesting in the
entire festival. Screening first is "Punch-Drunk Love," the highly
anticipated offbeat romantic comedy from writer-director Paul Thomas
Anderson ("Boogie Nights," "Magnolia") starring Adam Sandler and
Emily Watson.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Sandler's co-star in the currently filming "Anger
Management," Jack Nicholson, gets his turn in the Cannes sun in the
new film "About Schmidt" from "Election's" Alexander Payne. The film
casts the actor against type as a conventional mid-'60s insurance
company actuary dealing with the vagaries of retirement.</TE>
<TE>   One of this year's most closely watched events is the screening of
twentysomething minutes of Martin Scorsese's perennially forthcoming
"Gangs of New York." When "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the Ring" executed a similar maneuver last year, it had to rent a
theater. But Scorsese being Scorsese and distributor Miramax being
Miramax, those minutes will be combined with the director's tribute
to Billy Wilder and shown as an official festival event called "An
Hour With Martin Scorsese." As Mel Brooks once said, it's good to be
the king.</TE>
<TE>   Also being treated like a king is Woody Allen, whose first-ever
personal appearance at Cannes was announced by a rapturous Gilles
Jacob as "an almost unimaginable event, a dreamlike apparition."
DreamWorks, which is using the Cannes event as the centerpiece of its
French ad campaign, will also attempt to match the success it had
here last year with "Shrek" with an out-of-competition screening of
the animated "Spirit," accompanied by a live musical performance by
Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer.</TE>
<TE>   Having at least as good a year as the Americans are British
filmmakers. In the competition are new films by Palme d'Or-winning
Mike Leigh ("All or Nothing"), the veteran Ken Loach ("Sweet
Sixteen"), Michael Winterbottom ("24 Hour Party People") and
Canadian-working-in-England David Cronenberg ("Spider").</TE>
<TE>   Not in the competition is the much-awaited follow-up to
"Ratcatcher" by Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, "Morvern Callar." The
film was originally set for Un Certain Regard, the same competition
auxiliary in which "Ratcatcher" played, but Ramsay bowed out of that
to take a Directors Fortnight bid.</TE>
<TE>   American films in the fortnight include "Laurel Canyon" by "High
Art's" Lisa Cholodenko; Joseph and Anthony Russo's takeoff on the
Italian comic gem "Big Deal on Madonna Street" called "Welcome to
Collinwood"; and "Only the Strong Survive," D.A. Pennebaker and Chris
Hegedus' delightful tribute to still-working soul singers like Wilson
Pickett and Sam Moore. Also on the fortnight schedule is a
one-of-a-kind event titled "Polissons et galipettes" and described as
a collection of pornographic shorts from the turn of the last
century. Predicted Peter Bradshaw in the Manchester Guardian,
"Connoisseurs, anthropologists and hard-working critics will be
queuing around the block."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Mike Leigh, two other Palme d'Or winners have films in
Cannes: Belgium's the Dardennes brothers ("The Son") and Iran's Abbas
Kiarostami ("10"). In fact, 14 of the 22 films in competition are by
repeat directors, including such rarefied folk as Italy's Marco
Bellochio ("The Religion Hour (My Mother's Smile)"), Finland's Aki
Kaurismaki ("Man Without a Past"), Portugal's 93-year-old Manoel de
Oliveira ("The Principle Indecision") and Russia's Alexander Sokurov,
whose "Russian Ark" is said to consist of a single take lasting
something like an hour and a half. And back for the first time in a
long time is Roman Polanski, with an Adrien Brody-starring Holocaust
drama, "The Pianist."</TE>
<TE>   Though much sounds familiar about Cannes, artistic director
Thierry Fremaux, in his second year, has made some changes. Public
outdoor screenings, an attempt to make the festival friendlier to
locals, are on the upswing, as are reasons to show restored versions
of older, classic films.</TE>
<TE>   Cannes 2002 will also try to tidy up unfinished business from
earlier festivals. Alain Resnais' 1968 "Je t'aime, je t'aime," unseen
at the festival because of the year's disruptions, will finally get
to play here. And seven films from that truncated 1939 Cannes will
screen as well, with a special jury convened to present a
better-late-than-never award. Blissfully unchanged, however, even in
the face of world events, is the Marche du Film, the brash market
that takes on all comers, unveiling upward of 700 films for buyers
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more unusual titles on offer this year are "Guns, Money
and Homecooking," "Duct Tape Forever," "Trophy Wives and Toy Boys"
and "How Harry Became a Tree." They aren't eligible for any awards,
they may not be politically significant or even politically correct,
but they'll always have a place in our hearts.</TE>

<LD>The ongoing parade of nostalgia marched out for the current rating
sweeps has delivered a mixed bag ratings-wise, with NBC's "L.A. Law"
reunion movie overshadowed Sunday by ABC's performance that night
with the fantasy miniseries "Dinotopia," based on viewing estimates
issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   "Dinotopia's" opening installment drew ABC's biggest audience for
"The Wonderful World of Disney" since a remake of "The Miracle
Worker" 18 months ago. That lead-in audience helped the season finale
of ABC's "Alias" post its highest rating since October, although
time-period competitor "The X-Files"--which concludes its run this
Sunday--also recorded its highest tune-in since the ninth-season
premiere in November.</LD>
<LD>   Even with "L.A. Law" failing to produce fireworks, NBC won the
week by a solid margin, as "ER" received a boost from Anthony
Edwards' final appearance, attracting the largest audience for any
program since the Academy Awards. "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit"
also scored its second-highest rating ever, as did CBS' "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Among the various specials last week, ratings were modest for "The
Honeymooners" retrospective, "Laverne &amp; Shirley" reunion and
"Favorite Stars: Then and Now."</TE>

<HD>Mother Love and the Bento Box</HD>
<DH>There's more to packing a good lunch than making another
sandwich</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONOKO SAKAI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bento means lunch or lunch box. But for most Japanese home cooks, the
act of preparing a bento box can mean much more than that. A bento
box represents a mother's love for her family. For centuries, bento
boxes have been used to carry food to school, to work and on trips so
people can taste something that feels close to home.</LD>
<LD>   When my son started kindergarten many years ago, I got up early to
produce his first bento box. It held a piece of omelet, steamed green
beans, a sliced apple, meatballs and grilled salted cod roe (tarako),
which he loved to eat with rice. For me, preparing the bento box was
a true labor of love, but when I picked him up from school he was
cross with me. A boy had told him that his lunch looked weird,
especially the cod roe.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, in this boy's eyes, the pale pink seafood sticking out
of the white rice looked like a finger. "I never want to take a bento
box to school again," my son declared, handing me the box as if it
contained evidence collected at a crime scene. From that day forward,
he stuck to sandwiches.</LD>
<TE>   Like my son, I had my share of horrible bento experiences. When my
family returned to Japan after living in America for many years, my
mother sent me off to my new school with a chicken teriyaki bento.
She wrapped the bento box in a pretty floral napkin and told me to
hold it upright, which I did most of the way, except for the last
200-yard walk through the temple grounds. I wanted to look at the
beautiful koi in the pond before I faced the treacherous first day of
school, but I needed both hands to do it, so I threw my bento box
into my knapsack.</TE>
<TE>   Despite my initial anxieties, my first day went relatively well
until I opened my knapsack. Suddenly there was an overpowering smell
of soy sauce. My bento box had leaked. A small puddle of sauce was at
the bottom, staining the corner of every notebook and dyeing the
flowers of the napkin brown.</TE>
<TE>   I could feel curious eyes measuring the size of the disaster. I
wanted to cry. During lunch I built a barricade with my books so no
one could see me eating the ugly bento. Its sauceless rice was
compressed to one side and had taken on the texture of glue.</TE>
<TE>   For several months I remained quite homesick for America. My
mother made me peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to ease my
loneliness. But eventually that got me into trouble too, because my
teacher complained that they had too much sugar. So my mother
switched back to making bento.Initially her bento came home uneaten.
One consisted of sauteed burdock root that smelled like mud. Then
there was the thousand-eye bento--a mass of baby sardines covered the
rice. I screamed.</TE>
<TE>   At home, my parents would tell me stories about the wartime, when
a bento box was just a pickled plum on a bed of rice. This was
supposed to resemble the Japanese flag and raise people's patriotic
spirits. When the war escalated and rice became scarce, a single
roasted potato or corn made up the entire bento. So why was I
whining?</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, I reacquired my taste for Japanese food. I would
find out what other people had brought to school for bento and report
back to my mother. There was a boy in class who didn't have a mother.
Every day his father would fix him a gigantic rice ball wrapped in
seaweed; it looked like a shotput. The ball and three dried sardines
were thrown together in a plastic bag. I would watch him eat the rice
ball out of the corner of my eye. I grew to like this boy because he
never seemed to mind or to envy other people's fancy bento. He just
ate his rice ball and the three sardines from head to tail.</TE>
<TE>   In less than a year after our return, my mother had honed her
bento-making skills. Her bento box would remind me of a field of
flowers. Included in the floral landscape were my least favorite
vegetables, such as green pepper and tomato, disguised as tulips.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually I learned to appreciate them not only for their
artistic presentation but for their flavor. Once someone asked me to
trade my mother's chicken meatball for a piece of shrimp. I thought
twice before I agreed.</TE>
<TE>   This year, I found a good reason to start fixing bento boxes
again. My sculptor husband moved his studio from downtown Los Angeles
to the back of our house in Santa Monica and became a regular
presence. As a result, lunchtime took on a new meaning. After a
half-day of painting and chiseling, he took real lunch breaks.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, I fixed two sandwiches in the morning: one for
him and one for my sandwich-loving son. But my husband's response was
a sigh of disappointment--perhaps not unexpected from someone raised
in a non-sandwich culture.</TE>
<TE>   So I started fixing bento boxes. My now-17-year-old son would see
me arranging the bento box in the morning and snitch from the cutting
board the ends of the cucumber rolls that I had been saving for
myself. If I made an omelet, half of it would disappear too.</TE>
<TE>   I started sneaking rolled sushi into his lunch to see if I could
break the monotony of his sandwich-only lunch. He liked the change.
In fact, he asked me to fix him a bigger box with lots of rice or
pasta.</TE>
<TE>   This pleases me, even when he sometimes hands me an empty bento
box that has spent many dark nights in his knapsack, incubating green
life forms. I am proud to have succeeded in reintroducing a tradition
that otherwise could have gotten buried under a mountain of
sandwiches.</TE>

<TE>   Rolled Sushi Bento</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes* Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Bamboo mats are available at cookware stores and Asian markets;
nori seaweed and wasabi paste are available in the Asian aisle of
well-stocked supermarkets and at Asian stores.</TE>
<TE>   SUSHI RICE</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups short-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons rice vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the rice under cold running water 2 or 3 times; drain in a
strainer for about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce
the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the rice is tender and the
water has been absorbed, 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the hot rice to a bowl and quickly toss with the vinegar
mixture.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   3 sheets nori seaweed</TE>
<TE>   Sushi Rice</TE>
<TE>   Wasabi paste</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound cooked crab meat, shredded, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 ripe avocado, sliced lengthwise into 9 pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 small carrot, cut into 4x1/2-inch strips</TE>
<TE>   1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into 4x1/2-inch strips</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   Pickled ginger, optional</TE>
<TE>   Place a sheet of seaweed shiny side down on a bamboo mat, with the
long edge toward you. Moisten your hands with water and spread a cup
of Sushi Rice about 1/8 inch thick evenly over the seaweed to the
edges and the bottom and within 11/2 inches of the top. Across the
center of the rice bed, dab a thin line of wasabi paste, about 1/4
teaspoon if you like your sushi hot.</TE>
<TE>   Use 1/3 of the sushi fillings for each roll of sushi: Place some
of the crab, if using, the avocado, carrot and cucumber lengthwise
across the rice. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Then, holding the
filling down with your fingers, lift up the mat with your thumbs and
roll it over until the seaweed and rice form a tube. Press the
bamboo-covered roll firmly to compress the roll enough to cut easily.
Use the remaining ingredients to make 2 more rolls. The sushi can be
refrigerated up to 4 hours.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, wipe a sharp knife with a well-wrung damp cloth. Place a
roll lengthwise on a cutting board and slice in half, crosswise. Cut
each half into 4 pieces. Be careful not to saw back and forth, or
else the roll will fall apart. Repeat with the remaining rolls. Place
in the bento box. Put the pickled ginger in a cup or foil and put it
next to the sushi.</TE>

<TE>   Chicken Teriyaki Bento</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   You can substitute 6 to 8 ounces of tuna, salmon or yellowtail
filets for the chicken. Slice the fish into 1/4-inch-thick bite-size
pieces and marinate in teriyaki sauce for a couple of minutes.
Pan-fry the fish in a nonstick frying pan with a little oil until
brown on both sides. For side dishes in the bento box, arrange an
orange wedge, a steamed broccoli floret and some plum tomatoes. Mirin
and sake can be found at Asian markets. Also look for mirin in the
Asian aisle of well-stocked supermarkets, and sake at well-stocked
liquor stores.</TE>
<TE>   CHICKEN</TE>
<TE>   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons soy sauce (regular or low-sodium)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons mirin</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sake</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler or grill to medium-high heat.</TE>
<TE>   Cut each chicken thigh into 8 bite-size pieces. Combine the soy
sauce, mirin, ginger, sugar and sake. Add the chicken and marinate 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Thread the chicken on skewers, then broil or grill, basting with
the marinade and turning the skewers every minute so the chicken
doesn't burn, until lightly browned. The chicken will take about 6 to
8 minutes to grill or about 5 minutes to broil.</TE>
<TE>   BASIC RICE</TE>
<TE>   1 cup short-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plus 2 to 3 tablespoons water</TE>
<TE>   Gently rinse the rice under cold running water 2 or 3 times.
Combine the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce
the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the rice is tender and the
water has been absorbed, 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Basic Rice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Lime wedges, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1 green onion, chopped, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   To arrange a bento box, place 1 1/2 cups of rice in each box. You
may use sushi molds and mold the rice into finger foods. Sprinkle the
rice with the sesame seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Add the chicken to the bento box with the lime wedges and the
green onion.</TE>

<TE>   Glazed Meatball Bento</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Make the meatballs the night before you plan to fix the bento
boxes. Usually most of the meatballs will disappear before they reach
the bento box, so you might want to double the recipe and serve them
as appetizers before dinner. For side dishes, arrange steamed green
beans or snow peas alongside. Put a slice of apple or strawberries
next to the green vegetables. Sake is available at Asian markets and
well-stocked liquor stores.</TE>
<TE>   MEATBALLS</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound ground pork or beef</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sake</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1 green onion, chopped, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon potato starch or cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for deep-frying, about 2 cups</TE>
<TE>   Combine the ground meat, soy sauce, sake, ginger, onion, salt and
starch and mix well. Form into 16 (1-inch) balls.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a wok or deep saucepan to 350 degrees. Fry the
meatballs until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted
spoon or Chinese deep-fry ladle. Drain on paper towels.</TE>
<TE>   SWEET AND SOUR GLAZE</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons rice vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon potato starch or cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   Combine the broth, sugar, soy sauce, salt and rice vinegar in a
small saucepan and cook over medium heat. Dissolve the starch in 1
teaspoon of water and add to the broth mixture. Continue cooking
until the mixture starts to bubble and thicken, about 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Meatballs</TE>
<TE>   Sweet and Sour Glaze</TE>
<TE>   Basic Rice</TE>
<TE>   Dip the meatballs in the Sweet and Sour Glaze. Place the meatballs
on skewers if you wish.</TE>
<TE>   Place some rice in each bento box. Arrange the meatballs next to
the rice.</TE>

<HD>How to Make a Bento Box</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonoko Sakai</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The everyday bento maker has to be practical and quick.</LD>
<LD>   * Most of the cooking can be done the night before. Use the
morning to assemble the food. Last night's leftovers make wonderful
bento box fillers: chicken drummettes, grilled salmon, frittatas,
potato salad, meatballs, pasta. Steamed rice is best eaten fresh out
of the pot, but day-old rice can be reheated in the microwave.</LD>
<LD>   * Cut the food in bite-size morsels so you don't have to take
silverware along. Sushi molds are handy for molding rice into
manageable finger or chopstick foods.</LD>
<TE>   * Start with the food that will take up the largest amount of
space in the bento box such as rice, pasta or sushi rolls. Then put
in the second largest piece. Around the edges add some green, such as
a floret of broccoli or asparagus, and some red, such as a plum
tomato, and stack them up against the rice or pasta to give the bento
box spots of bright color.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep vinegary foods such as pickled ginger and salads apart from
everything else, using cupcake liners, foil or lettuce leaves.</TE>
<TE>   * A plastic container with a tight-fitting lid is the best way to
avoid spillage. But if you--or your careless daughter--can remember
to carry a bento box upright, you can use any kind of box, such as
wicker, wood, lacquer, tin can and paper.</TE>

<HD>Teach Your Steak to Make Its Own Sauce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grilling may be the popular way to cook steak, but a sauteed steak
has a major advantage over a grilled one: It makes its own sauce.</LD>
<LD>   In the few minutes a steak is in the skillet, it leaves a residue
of flavor in the form of caramelized meat juices. They become the
basis of a sauce made by deglazing--adding a small amount of liquid
to dissolve the brown bits, or, as a chef I studied with in Paris
described it, "rinsing out the pan with wine."</LD>
<LD>   Pan sauces are concentrated essences served in small amounts. The
sauce should taste a bit strong so it will have enough flavor to
complement the steak. For a sauce with more body, thicken it with
potato starch or cornstarch dissolved in liquid to make a slurry.
When using a favorite wine, boost its contribution by dissolving the
starch in wine.</LD>
<TE>   Leave your sauce as is, or add another layer of flavor. The French
feel that steak goes with subtle seasonings such as fresh thyme,
parsley and chives and stands up to strong ones too, like tarragon,
Dijon mustard and Roquefort cheese. The Chinese trio of stir-fried
ginger, garlic and green onion, along with a dash of soy sauce, perks
up a sauce based on wine, broth or orange juice. For a
south-of-the-border accent, add chopped jalapenos, green onions and
cilantro. My husband adds his mother's spices to a broth-based sauce
for Middle Eastern flavor--cumin, turmeric and a healthy dose of
black pepper.</TE>
<TE>   You can make a pan sauce for any sauteed tender meat, such as duck
breasts, veal chops and boneless chicken breasts and thighs, and for
roasts as well.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Levy is the author of "Fresh From France: Dinner
Inspirations" (Dutton, 1989).</TE>
<TE>   You can substitute other dried mushrooms for the porcinis; if
using shiitakes, discard their tough stems after soaking. If you
don't have a large skillet, use 2 skillets to cook the steaks, cook
the shallots and deglaze with the wine. Then pour the wine into 1
skillet, reduce it to 1/4 cup and continue. For nonalcoholic options,
use broth, tomato juice or fruit juice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rib-Eye Steak With Red Wine and Porcini Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes</TE>
<TE>   3/4 to 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   2 to 4 tablespoons butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 cup veal or beef stock or canned beef or chicken broth,
preferably low-salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 to 2 pounds steaks, such as rib-eye, top loin (New York) or
tenderloin, about 3/4 to 1 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced shallots</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup dry red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons potato starch, arrowroot or cornstarch, optional</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced parsley, optional</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons finely snipped chives, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon, optional</TE>
<TE>   Dash sugar, optional</TE>
<TE>   Cover the mushrooms with hot water and soak for 30 minutes. If
you'd like to enrich the sauce with butter, cut 1 to 2 tablespoons of
butter in 1/2-tablespoon pieces and refrigerate them. Heat the oven
to 180 degrees or its lowest setting.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the mushrooms from the water and cut in 1/2-inch pieces.
Place them in a saucepan with the stock and thyme. Bring to a boil.
Simmer uncovered until the mixture is reduced to about 1 cup, about
10 minutes. Cover and reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Pat the steaks dry. Trim the fat from their edges. Sprinkle them
with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large heavy skillet, heat
the oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat until the
butter melts and its foam begins to subside. Add the steaks and cook
the first side for 2 or 3 minutes, regulating the heat so the fat
does not burn. Turn the steaks and cook until done to your taste,
about 2 or 3 minutes. To check for doneness, press a steak with your
finger: If the meat does not resist, it is rare; if it resists
slightly, it is medium-rare. (If you are not sure, make a small cut
in its thickest part and check its color inside.) Immediately
transfer to an ovenproof platter and keep them in the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Pour off the fat from the skillet, and melt 1 tablespoon of butter
over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring and
scraping up any brown bits. Boil the wine, stirring often, until
reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the wine into the porcini mixture and bring to a simmer over
medium heat. To thicken the sauce, put the potato starch in a small
bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon of water until blended. Gradually whisk
half of the potato starch slurry into the simmering sauce. Return to
a boil, stirring. For a thicker sauce, gradually stir in the
remaining slurry and return to a boil.</TE>
<TE>   To enrich the sauce with butter, reduce the heat to low and add
the cold butter pieces one by one, shaking the saucepan to blend them
into the sauce. Off the heat, stir in the parsley, chives and/or
tarragon. Taste and adjust seasoning; if necessary, add sugar to
balance the wine's acidity. Spoon the sauce over or around the steaks
and serve.</TE>

<HD>Dear, Swear You'll Take Me to the Rabbit Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malta, located just south of Sicily, has been ruled by just about
every country around the Mediterranean except Albania. The
Phoenicians, Greeks, North Africans, French (a couple of times),
Catalans and Italians have all left their marks, particularly the
North Africans and Italians.</LD>
<LD>   So Maltese dishes tend to have names consisting of bits and pieces
you recognize and others you don't. Qarabaghli biz-zalza pikkanti is
zucchini in a salsa piccante. Rabbit pie is torta tal-fenek.</LD>
<LD>   Now fenek--a word that, in North Africa, refers to a tiny desert
fox--is an odd thing to call rabbit. But it makes sense if you
consider that the rabbit is not native to Malta. It was introduced to
the island by the Crusader order of the Knights of St. John (since
known as the Knights of Malta).</LD>
<TE>   The Knights had imported rabbits as game for hunting, so they
wouldn't let the Maltese kill any of them. This was quite unpopular
because rabbits are notorious for poaching on gardens. (Think Flopsy,
think Mopsy, think Cottontail.)</TE>
<TE>   But the Maltese had their revenge for this plague of furry little
vegetable-munchers: the fenkata, or rabbit party. It's a sort of
picnic where people go out into the country, cook up some rabbits and
have them with spaghetti. (Take that, you Knights!) The Maltese
anthropologist Carmel Cassar has written a whole book about it:
"Fenkata, an Emblem of Maltese Peasant Resistance."</TE>
<TE>   Some fenkatas were particularly big deals, involving dancing and
all-night partying. The one at Buskett on the feast of Sts. Peter and
Paul (June 29) was so popular that marriage contracts sometimes
required that a husband promise to bring his future wife there.</TE>

<LD>Although Cook's Library is the only store in the Los Angeles area
specializing in new cookbooks, there is another that sells only used
cookbooks. Janet Jarvits Bookseller, late of Burbank, now in
Pasadena, has a national reputation as a place to find the old, odd
or out of the way.</LD>
<LD>   At any given time, Jarvits may have up to 15,000 cookbooks in her
store, just north of the Foothill Freeway. More than half are sold
through her Web site (www.cookbkjj.com), but she does a lot of
walk-in business as well.</LD>
<LD>   Among the store's highlights (and, actually, one of the reasons
for its existence) is the huge collection of community cookbooks
Jarvits bought in the early '90s from the estate of famed West Coast
cookbook author Helen Evans Brown and her husband, Phillip.</LD>
<TE>   It was the purchase of those roughly 10,000 books that finally
convinced her to move the mail-order cookbook business she had
started in 1989 out of her studio apartment and into an actual store.
"It was a giant boost for me," she says. "First of all, because I
learned so much from that collection. But also because when I bought
it I didn't have enough money to pay for the whole thing--I had to
keep making payments, so I had to really sell a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvits opened in Burbank in 1994 and, in February 2001, moved to
a larger location in the area becoming known as Pasadena's Book Row.
"We're pretty much of a generalist cookbook store with leanings
toward large collections of international cookbooks published in
various countries and American regional cookbooks," she says.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago, my in-laws took my husband and me to a newish
steakhouse in Rancho Mirage named Prime 10. It is a sharp-looking
place, very sleek and adult. The menu is more or less what you'd
expect: beefsteak tomato and onion salad, lots of big meat, a couple
of seafood alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   What I didn't expect was the towering pink pouf of freshly spun
cotton candy set down in the middle of the table at the end of our
meal.</LD>
<LD>   The diners around us looked equally incredulous. They pointed and
smiled and whispered among themselves.</LD>
<TE>   A few seconds passed. Then I tore in. It was as if I had
time-traveled back to first grade.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does bring back childhood memories," says Sandy
Josephson, the restaurant's general manager, of the $4.95 confection.
"People will start reminiscing about when they were a kid they'd get
cotton candy at the beach or at a fair. Some people scream, 'Oh, my
god!' It's just a great spontaneous reaction."</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, there's been much talk about comfort food:
meatloaf and roast chicken, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. But
what could be more comforting than food from our childhood? It
recalls carefree summers and a time when cholesterol, for all intents
and purposes, didn't exist. It makes us feel good. Quite likely, it
also makes us return customers.</TE>
<TE>   Prime 10 is not the only place feeding our collective inner child.
Porterhouse Bistro, a Beverly Hills steak place where the average
check is about $60 a head, also serves cotton candy to people
celebrating birthdays or on special request.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to break the pretentiousness in L.A.," says general
manager Bobby Burton. "We thought fine dining could be a little more
fun."</TE>
<TE>   A slew of places are doing root beer floats. Napa Valley Grille, a
stylish California bistro in Westwood, makes a classic float with
homemade vanilla ice cream and IBC root beer ($6.95). Aqua, at the
St. Regis Monarch Beach hotel in Dana Point, makes one with root beer
sorbet ($9). And Nine, an uber-hip Las Vegas steakhouse, substitutes
cinnamon ice cream for vanilla in its version. ($8).</TE>
<TE>   Nine's director of operations, Andrew Belmonti, says the float is
among the restaurant's most popular desserts. But it isn't the most
popular. That honor goes to the $8 s'mores, which restaurant patrons
cook themselves over little portable hibachis.</TE>
<TE>   "When you walk into the dining room and smell the aroma of
toasting marshmallows, it takes you back to a time when you didn't
have a care in the world," says Belmonti. "It is a nostalgic feeling,
one that everyone can relate to.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling, or the smell, seems to be contagious when it passes
through the dining room. Everyone wants to join the party around the
campfire."</TE>
<TE>   Gyu-Kaku, a casual Japanese barbecue spot in West Los Angeles,
also recently added s'mores ($2) to its menu of otherwise traditional
Japanese desserts. Restaurant spokeswoman Chaco Kim says the response
from patrons has been great, especially from younger diners: "It's so
unexpected. That's why everyone gets a kick out of it."</TE>
<TE>   The surprise element is a big part of these items' appeal. There's
also a satisfying feeling of mischief in ordering a kiddie dessert in
a real restaurant. A root beer float at a diner is a root beer float,
but a root beer float at a place like Aqua borders on rebellion. It's
saying, "No, thanks," to frou-frou pastries.</TE>
<TE>   Or rather, it's saying, "I know what I want, and I want it now,"
just as you did when you were 6. And, quite frankly, is there
anything better?</TE>
<TE>   The youthful trend isn't limited to sweets. North, a hipster
restaurant/bar in Hollywood, serves the old cafeteria favorite sloppy
Joe for $10. "It's a gourmet version," says restaurant manager Leeann
Rupprecht. "I always thought sloppy Joe was really sweet. This is
more hearty, with less of a sugary taste. It's more geared toward
adult taste buds."</TE>
<TE>   Windows Lounge at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills does a
trio of mini-burgers for $14, like upscale White Castle "sliders":
one sirloin, one turkey and one portabello mushroom.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Rockenwagner also offers a $7.95 hamburger on the Wunderbar
menu at his Santa Monica restaurant. That not-so-miniature 6-ounce
burger is served on a pretzel roll with Swiss cheese and grilled
onions. "That's the single most popular item on that menu," he says.
The Wunderbar menu also features a grown-up grilled cheese with
nuggets of lobster.</TE>
<TE>   And the Belvedere at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel recently
added a hot dog to its lunch menu. Well, they call it a hot dog, but
it's made from chicken and foie gras, served on a brioche roll and
finished with morel mushroom and onion relish and spicy oven-dried
tomato ketchup. At $16, it must be the most expensive frank around.</TE>
<TE>   But it satisfies the adult palate as well as the inner child. And
compared to therapy, it's a relative bargain.</TE>

<HD>COOKBOOK CENTRAL</HD>
<DH>The Cook's Library doesn't sell anything else. And
sometimes you get gingerbread too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday morning at the Cook's Library, Ellen Rose is slicing
strawberries behind the bookshelves. Another sort of bookstore owner
might be wedging new titles onto the shelves or fluffing the sofa
where customers can sit and consider what to buy. Rose is serving
home-baked coffeecakes.</LD>
<LD>   A Saturday regular saunters through the screen door. "How are you,
Jim?" she asks. "Ready for breakfast?" Behind her bookish eyeglasses
and honey-colored bangs lurks a charmer with a gift for making people
feel welcome.</LD>
<LD>   A minute later, Jim Gidlow, a Los Angeles public defender who says
he rarely cooks but reads cookbooks as if they were novels, is
comparing Rose's sour cream coffeecake and dark gingerbread. Before
long, so are half a dozen other customers, who juggle plates and
flowered napkins as they study book titles.</LD>
<TE>   Stacks of Jamie Oliver's "The Naked Chef," Alice Waters' "Chez
Panisse Fruit" and "A Real American Breakfast," by Cheryl Alters
Jamison and Bill Jamison, fill the display table. A flea market
purchase with lemon yellow legs, the table fits the shop's cozy
decor. Hooked rug samplers and green ceramic vases, a wing chair
covered in a fruit-print fabric and an ivory-handled cake server look
as if Rose brought them from home.</TE>
<TE>   But it is cookbooks that get people talking to strangers in this
store. Located just down 3rd Street from the Beverly Center in Los
Angeles, it is one of fewer than a dozen all-cookbook stores in the
United States. Most cookbook lovers rank it among the two best, along
with Nach Waxman's Kitchen Arts and Letters in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few stores like this in the country," said Cheryl
Jamison. She and her husband were at the Cook's Library one Saturday
to sign "A Real American Breakfast." "Nach's and Ellen's stores are
the best in the country."</TE>
<TE>   But while Waxman's store caters primarily to the professional,
Cook's Library appeals to insider and amateur alike. "I meet a lot of
nice people in here," says Gidlow, who is in his 50s and who wears
bluejeans for his weekly trek to the store. "I always hear about new
restaurants and learn things about cooking."</TE>
<TE>   Scooter Kanfer, the chef at The House on Melrose Avenue in
Hollywood, brings her student interns to the shop. "It's an important
resource," says Kanfer, who specializes in American regional cooking.
"Sometimes I'll sit in the shop for hours. It's a hub. Ellen provides
a special service to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Kanfer looks for offbeat pamphlets and classics to add to her
Americana collection. These hard-to-find items are part of what makes
Cook's Library special. Tucked on the shelves among the flashiest
book titles are at least 6,000 others to consider. They range from
ethnic and international to American regional, from beginner to
professional level.</TE>
<TE>   Dig deep enough and you're likely to stumble on total surprises:
church supper cookbooks from middle America; Junior League
anthologies by self-publishing socialites; Korean and Russian,
Colombian and Greek cookbooks, all neatly shelved and clearly marked
by region. There's also a wide selection of cooking magazines and
newsletters, some of which are usually only available by
subscription. The tidiness contradicts every assumption you might
have about passion and chaos. They don't have to go together.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone accustomed to chain stores with spotty cookbook
collections, or neighborhood bookstores that are better at
special-ordering than stocking cookbooks, the Cook's Library can be a
dizzying experience.</TE>
<TE>   And something of a marvel. The store thrives despite the nearby
chain stores that discount books. It takes creative thinking. "We
have to offer books that no one else has, things you can't even get
on the Internet," Rose says. Over the years she has developed a
clientele of chefs and restaurant owners who call her for foreign
titles she comes across in her own travels.</TE>
<TE>   Cookbook authors come to town, and Rose takes them to the Farmers
Market, a few blocks from the shop, for maximum exposure. Months
before the Christmas rush, she finagles advertising supplements for
new cookbooks that won't be in the store until the holidays. She
tacks the promotional pages to the store bulletin board and uses them
to make advance sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Business goes up and down," says Rose, who can get excited about
the challenge even when she is complaining. "It's much tougher than
it was before the discount chain stores came in. We can't afford
expensive book promotions, but we keep a huge selection of books, and
the staff is very knowledgeable. We can sell hundreds of copies of a
book if we like it. We'll put it right in our customer's hand and
tell them all about it. We test the recipes and know what they're
like."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, the staff members test recipes in their spare time.
Rose is a fanatic who is likely to be found reading the "meats"
section of some new publication at 3 in the morning if she can't
sleep. Store manager Tim Fischer is every bit as obsessed. A
cherub-faced man in his 40s, he spent years as a pastry cook at New
York's Gotham Bar &amp; Grill and invents special-occasion menus that he
writes on the store blackboard to inspire shoppers. He tactfully
advises customers about the right book for them. "He'll tell me,
'This book isn't for you; too hard,'" says Gidlow, the occasional
cook. "I appreciate the candor."</TE>
<TE>   Personal touches and a voracious appetite for every detail about
recipes, menus, techniques, flavor and ingredients slant store
conversation in a particular direction. Rose, now in her mid-50s,
opened her shop 13 years ago after a career as a television
commercial producer and a few years as a carpooling mom. "My daughter
gave me the idea for the store," she says. "She looked at my cookbook
collection one day and said I had enough to start a library."</TE>
<TE>   It took 12 of the 13 years to build up the store's inventory,
which she continues to work on with the help of a picker who finds
unusual books for her. But nothing has helped earn her a reputation
more than her unquenchable appetite for everything new in the
cookbook world.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Nigella Lawson's books before they were published in the
U.S," she says of the curvaceous kitchen goddess from England. "I
found them when I was in London. Now we're ordering books from
Australia, New Zealand and Alaska. Terrific books, but besides that,
I have customers who would rather learn about a country by reading
about the food than studying the history."</TE>
<TE>   One such customer, Desmonette Hazly, spent $140 on a recent
afternoon in the store. She was at home for several months between
assignments as an international social worker. Hazly buys cookbooks
about the countries where she is assigned to work. "Sometimes I take
the cookbooks with me and compare what is in them to what people are
actually eating," she says. She was in the store to buy books about
Brazil, where she will spend several months working at an orphanage
for children with AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   For Rose, every category of cookbook reminds her of certain
customers. Doctors want how-to books, especially on bread baking.
"They're interested in the process," she says. Slow-cooker books get
swept up by mothers who want a beginner's book for their grown-up
children. "After Sept. 11 I had women who live in New York City
coming into the store, looking for comfort food cookbooks," Rose
says. "They had come to Los Angeles to cook for their children and
wanted to leave behind a basic book."</TE>
<TE>   Young women in their 20s ask for fondue cookbooks. Sunday nights
they cook together with friends, Rose says. And parents of grammar
school kids cleaned out the Afghan cookbooks she had in stock. "The
kids were doing school projects," Rose explains. "They cooked an
Afghan dish. It's another way to learn about a country."</TE>
<TE>   Browsers who spend time in the shop are certain to collect a few
tips among the book titles. "You should smear walnut oil in the bundt
pan, not butter!" Rose announced to the room one recent afternoon.
She learned this while testing the recipe for sour cream coffeecake.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes a subtle difference, but you can really taste it," she
explains. "I learn something new all the time."</TE>

<LD>Strawberries can taste wonderful in savory recipes. Here, a fresh
strawberry puree is the basis of a dressing for spinach salad with
red onion and kiwifruit.</LD>
<LD>   The dressing, accented with fresh tarragon and garlic, has just
one tablespoon of oil--much less than most dressings.</LD>
<LD>   Though the strawberries are low in fat and calories, the crumbled
queso fresco will add a little fat to the salad, but also a nice
salty-sweet combination of flavors.</LD>

<LD>The recently revived Montrose farmers market is much changed. It's
held on Sunday mornings, not Thursday evenings; its location now
rotates among four adjacent blocks downtown; and, perhaps most
important, it's run by Mark Sheridan, former manager of the
successful Santa Barbara farmers market.</LD>
<LD>   Sheridan has refocused the market on produce and taken it upscale:
He provides ice and wicker tubs for farmers, and has directed them to
unload and move their trucks so the market looks neat.</LD>
<LD>   He has brought in several growers from the Santa Barbara market,
including Givens Organic Farm of Goleta, which on Sunday had
wonderfully sweet and tender Chandler strawberries, top-quality salad
mix, leeks, fennel and black kale.</LD>
<TE>   From Clovis, Xiong Her brought sugar snap and snow peas, long
beans, baby bok choy, Chinese broccoli and lemongrass. Bertha Wong
had oblong Juliette cherry tomatoes, beefsteak-type Shady Lady
tomatoes and crisp, thin-skinned Japanese cucumbers grown
hydroponically near the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Stone fruit has been running about a week late this year, but
Lucia Vargas of Arvin had Sherrill's Delight yellow clingstone
peaches, which were pretty good for an early variety. Steven Murray,
also of Arvin, showed up with large, tasty Brooks cherries (best when
they're dark), as well as light-fleshed Royal Rainiers, a new,
early-maturing cousin of Rainier.</TE>
<TE>   Don Schram of Fillmore had juicy, thin-skinned Valencia oranges,
which he started harvesting a month ago; they are good now but will
taste sweeter in a few weeks. He also had Chislett summer navel
oranges, one of several recently introduced late-season types, which
were quite sweet but not very juicy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montrose farmers market rotates among the 2200, 2300 and 2400
blocks of Honolulu Avenue and the 3700 block of Ocean View Boulevard
(9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sundays; for locations on specific dates, go to
www.shopmontrose.com).</TE>

<LD>Eggs for dinner? Why not? They're full of protein, versatile and
super-fast to whip up.</LD>
<LD>   Use them to make a frittata--an Italian omelet--and add a variety
of ingredients for a fusion of flavors. In this recipe, mushrooms and
applewood smoked bacon are a sweet, earthy combination.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the frittata on thick slices of tomato and a nest of
arugula. Other greens can be used, but the spiciness of arugula is a
nice balance to the sweetness of bacon and tomatoes.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mushroom and Applewood-Smoked Bacon Frittata</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Linens from Williams-Sonoma.</TE>
<TE>   4 strips applewood-smoked bacon, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely diced onion</TE>
<TE>   1 (6-ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   8 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped tarragon leaves</TE>
<TE>   5 ounces arugula, chilled</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 large tomatoes, thickly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon,
separating the pieces as you go, and cook until slightly browned,
about 4 minutes. Add the onion and cook until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook until the
mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 more minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them, fairly
vigorously, until frothy, about 30 seconds. Season generously with
salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Add half of the balsamic vinegar and all of the tarragon to the
mushrooms. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Gently pour the whipped eggs over the ingredients in the skillet.
Reduce the heat to medium and cook just until the edges have begun to
set, about 3 minutes, then cover. Cook until the eggs have solidified
and puffed up a bit, about 4 to 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Toss the arugula with the olive oil and remaining balsamic
vinegar. Arrange on 4 plates and top each with 2 tomato slices.
Lightly season the tomatoes with salt.</TE>
<TE>   Gently slide the frittata out of the skillet onto a plate or
cutting board and cut into 8 wedges. Place 2 wedges over the tomato
slices, and serve.</TE>

<LD>"The '99 Phelps Carneros Chardonnay. I'm not a big Chardonnay fan,
but this has such wonderful structure and taste--all the elements are
in balance. So many Chardonnays are so over the top with oak, but
this is delicious, without being over the top. And so many are so big
that they saturate the palate; this is refreshing. The first object
of any wine is to be delicious, and I do enjoy this one."</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Several years ago you printed a fabulous recipe that
included chicken thighs, chorizo, a bit of cinnamon and some raisins.
I lost my recipe, and I think my arteries need a little hardening
(just kidding).</LD>
<LD>   LURA JONES</LD>
<LD>   Redondo Beach</LD>
<TE>   DEAR LURA: If you want to harden your arteries, try the recipe for
the deep-fried avocado that we published in February. I'm not
kidding. But back to this recipe: It's a variation of Mexican
picadillo, which is normally made with ground beef.</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,
202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012 or e-mail to: cindy.dorn

<LD>DEAR SOS: I am a transplanted Californian from West Covina, living in
Connecticut for 14 years. I had a 1987 Culinary SOS recipe from the
Scripps Clinic in La Jolla for chewy oatmeal cookies, which have been
the most requested cookie that I make. I moved last summer and the
recipe has disappeared. I would love for you to reprint it.</LD>

<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a baking sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Use a small ice cream scoop to place about 1/4 cup of dough per
cookie onto the baking sheet, spacing about 3 to 4 inches apart. Bake
the cookies until golden and the centers are set, 18 minutes. Remove

<LD>Mark Peterson and Stephen Gatta have been making and selling
marmalades for the last four years--ever since they gave them for
Christmas gifts and found out how much everyone liked them. They
hand-squeeze the lemons and blood oranges, most of which come from
local farmers markets. Though the marmalades are delicious on their
own, they would make good dessert sauces. Or bake them in cookies,
use them to top a cheesecake or glaze chicken, fish or pork roasts
with them. They also sell wild blueberry, raspberry pineapple,
strawberry mango and plum nectarine jams.</LD>
<LD>   12-ounce jar blood orange Cognac marmalade or Meyer lemon ginger
marmalade, $6.50, from Surfas, 8825 National Blvd., Culver City,
(310) 559-4770 and Julienne, 2649 Mission St., San Marino, (626)
441-2299. The jams are also sold at these farmers markets: South
Pasadena, Thursday evenings, Meridian Avenue at Mission Street;
Pasadena, Saturday mornings, Pasadena High School on Sierra Madre
Boulevard; and Studio City, Sunday mornings, on Ventura Place. Or
call (323) 850-7403 to order by mail.</LD>

<TE>   Peameal Bacon</TE>
<TE>   Peameal bacon is a Canadian bacon unique to Canada and different
from the Canadian bacon we know. It is a boneless pork loin that is
cured and rolled in a golden cornmeal coating. Traditionally it was
coated in ground yellow peas, hence the name. It tastes more like
fresh pork.</TE>
<TE>   Peameal bacon, sliced, about 1 pound, and 2- to 2 1/2-pound and
5-pound chub roasts, $7 to $9 per pound from the Real Canadian Bacon
Co., (866) 222-6601, www.realcanadian bacon.com.</TE>

<LD>Zinfandel, a grape that makes everything from inky, boldly tannic
wines that only a lumberjack could love to the light, pink gulping
wines my mother-in-law drinks, continues to benefit from its
amiability.</LD>
<LD>   It is willing to be almost anything growers and winemakers want it
to be, and it grows happily in all but the very coolest locations in
California. It can be made into expensive, carefully crafted wines
that can compete with the greatest of any variety, yet it also
produces some of the best bargains you can find in an everyday red.</LD>
<LD>   A great part of Zinfandel's versatility derives from its success
in all sorts of vineyards, from the fancy dirt of the Napa Valley to
the high-yielding soils of warmer, inland Lodi. In the Dry Creek
Valley, for example, the leading Zinfandels are typically loaded with
ripe berry flavors and elusive spicy notes. Farther south, near Paso
Robles, it turns out riper and bolder but frequently with a certain
softness and openness (when it's not overloaded with brusque
tannins).</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, the best source of value-priced Zinfandel is the
Lodi area. Zin has a long history there but has rarely enjoyed much
fame. Now, with some growers starting their own wineries and others
aggressively working to place their grapes with well-known existing
estates, Lodi Zinfandel is gaining recognition.</TE>
<TE>   $ 2000 Bogle Vineyard "Old Vine," California, $10. Wines from
hotter areas such as Amador and Lodi, where Bogle's old vines are
located, can be heavy and dull. This one isn't, though I wouldn't
exactly call it lithe and lively. It also shows a fair amount of ripe
berry flavor and vanillin sweetness.</TE>
<TE>   *** 2000 August Briggs, Napa Valley, $30. This is a dazzling
Zinfandel, with rich varietal fruit and creamy, slightly toasty oak.
It is high both in intensity and in balance and beauty. Medium-full
in body with fairly supple tannins, it boasts deep, focused flavors
of blackberries, sweet cream, vanilla and caramel. It's tempting to
drink now because of its depth and intensity, but this wine is
capable of lasting a decade or more with careful cellaring.</TE>
<TE>   $* 1999 Clayton Winery "Old Vine, Estate Vineyard," Lodi, $14.
This wine shows the progress being made in Lodi. It may be a little
soft in structure, but its focus on ripe blackberry fruit and oaky
richness comes without heat or toughness. Enjoy it now or over the
next couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   $* 1999 Fetzer Vineyards "Barrel Select," Mendocino County, $11.
Here is a wine that is everything a value-priced Zinfandel should be
but rarely is. It's ripe and fruity with ample body, a clear sense of
berries, a bit of richness as a bonus and an open, soft construction
that makes it a good "gulper" to be enjoyed in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   $* 1999 Kenwood Vineyards, Sonoma County, $14. Forthright berry
fruit, a bit of vanillin sweetness and a sense of measured ripeness
add up to an attractive, easy-drinking Zin. It may lack the
concentration of its higher-priced Sonoma County cousins, but its
construction is solid and it will be a good choice to drink while you
wait for those grander wines to mature.</TE>
<TE>   *** 2000 Rosenblum Cellars "Rockpile Road," Dry Creek Valley, $26.
This is a gorgeous Zinfandel, but very different from the Briggs. Its
ripe, concentrated black cherry fruit comes with interesting notes of
caramel, dark chocolate and clove. While the wine pushes the envelope
in terms of intensity, it does so without falling over into jammy,
dried-berry overripeness. This is textbook Dry Creek Zinfandel.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Rosenblum Cellars "Richard Sauret Vineyard," Paso Robles,
$17. By comparison, this wine is softer, rounder and more
open--certainly not as fully concentrated as Paso Robles Zins tend to
be. Still, it carries the stamp of the area in its rounded glycerin
texture and is surprisingly drinkable in its youth.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Terra d'Oro "Home Vineyard," Amador County, $20. This wine is
all about ripeness, yet it avoids the heat and toughness that can
accompany wines of that sort--particularly when they're from the Gold
Country. Instead, this one sports a good measure of sweet,
concentrated raspberry- and blackberry-like fruit set within a
tannin-tamed, fleshy texture.</TE>

<DH>2000 Casa de la Ermita, Jumilla, Spain</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The reds of Rioja, Priorat and Ribera del Duero now rival any in the
world in terms of price and quality, but it's in the less well-known
regions of Spain, such as up-and-coming Jumilla, that you can find
some tremendous bargains. Even better than Casa de la Ermita's
terrific 1999 vintage, this blend of Tempranillo with some Cabernet
and Merlot is an intense mouthful of berries, smoke and cassis with a
long sweet finish. It's a wine for all occasions, drinking
beautifully now but also worth aging for a handful of years. It's
often available for less than $10 a bottle, so this is one to buy by
the case.</LD>
<LD>   About $10. The 2000 arrived on the market recently and should be
widely available at fine wine shops and retailers. If you can't find
it, have your local wine shop contact the distributor, Associated
Wine Distributors, (707) 963-8055.</LD>

<HD>'Godfather' Delivers a Joke or Two</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hot on the heels of a local appearance by motivational speaker Bill
Clinton came motivational speaker Rudy Giuliani, sharing, on Monday
night at the Kodak Theatre, "his leadership, inspiration and wisdom."
Those, it turned out, took the form of his thoughts on the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks along with jokes about being Italian-American,
delivered seamlessly. (With luck, Mayor Jim Hahn, who introduced the
former king of New York, was taking notes.)</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani strode onto the stage in "Godfather" mode. "I don't know
why I do this," he said of his mobster shtick. He paused a beat, then
gestured to his cordless mike. But "when they put a wire on me," he
indicated, it's hard to resist. That was a segue into patter about
his days fighting crime, eavesdropping on wise guys and "listening to
them complain about their wives, their baseball teams," and then
suddenly, "Hey, Tony, we gotta whack that guy."</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 11 stories came next. When George W. Bush visited New York
after the attacks, the former mayor said, the two drove through
Manhattan in a limo, watching residents waving flags and pictures of
the president. Giuliani couldn't help himself. "You realize, Mr.
President," he remembered saying, "none of these people voted for
you." He hastened to add, "but they love you now."</LD>
<TE>   Monday night, Giuliani felt the love, too.</TE>
<TE>   During a Q&amp;A session, a woman named Rhonda, from Temecula, asked:
"Will you marry me?" The mayor looked a little put off but quickly
recovered: "I'm in enough trouble already."</TE>
<TE>   When a member of the audience asked if he planned to run for
office, applause erupted, and the mayor joked, "Well, the applause
wasn't good enough," before voicing his support for the current
president. "Whatever I'll do in the future, we'll see," he added
noncommittally.</TE>
<TE>   David Gregory, a TV actor in the crowd, read more into Giuliani's
appearance. "I have a feeling he's going to run for office," said
Gregory, "and he's out here to get Hollywood behind him."</TE>
<TE>   At the valet line, Hollywood gave its verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "He's smooth," said one woman before getting into her Volvo.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking Out in Song and Dance</TE>
<TE>   The people lining the block outside the Roxy weren't the usual
struggling young musicians and record industry types. For one thing,
this crowd was better dressed. Cooing couples stood side by side with
eager singles. Occasionally, flashbulbs went off and the crowd parted
to make way for a rock star. Former Jane's Addiction leader Perry
Farrell paused on his way in to give a paparazzo the name of his
companion. Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath arrived behind him.</TE>
<TE>   The venue's typically nondescript interior (concrete floors and a
small, bare stage) had been transformed. Pink and silver curtains
glittered across the stage, and on either side, two women lazed on
swings that were suspended by pink feather boas. A crowd of men
dressed as sailors greeted the female guests with wolf whistles and
shouted into the crowd: "Who needs a drink?"</TE>
<TE>   Christina Aguilera made her way to the VIP section of the theater.
Nearby, Dave Navarro sat at a corner table sipping the drink of the
evening: the Pink Pussycat, a powerful combination of Chambord, vodka
and pineapple juice. The theater grew crowded (the performance was
sold out) and event staff watched nervously as a fire marshal cleared
the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   It was opening night for "Pussycat Dolls Live," a burlesque show
created by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995 as an opening act at
Johnny Depp's Viper Room. Since then, the sexy musical revue has
cultivated an underground following. This year, Antin expanded the
performance beyond its original 20 minutes to a full hour of risque
song and dance performed by a troupe of veteran dancers. (Among the
favorite routines is a nearly naked woman who "bathes" in a giant
martini glass.)</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get into Vegas and bring it to London and eventually do
some sort of touring group," Antin said during a phone interview
Monday. The show runs each remaining Thursday this month, with a
possible fourth show added in June.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, the cast features unbilled celebrity guests. Carmen
Electra (Navarro's steady) got top billing this year, and Charlize
Theron was a surprise guest. Singer Nikka Costa is scheduled to
appear in Thursday night's show.</TE>
<TE>   But Christina Applegate as emcee performed the most impressively,
dancing and cracking one-liners. While sitting atop the shoulders of
two sailors, she spotted Hugh Hefner with his blond harem. "Oh, Hef!"
she ad-libbed, "I'm glad you brought the family!"</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "... I never expected to feel this much love. The closest I can
figure is maybe the first crush you had as a child, first girlfriend.
You can't eat, you can't sleep. You're in some sort of vague pain all
the time, because your heart is just exploding. It's like that, like
having 15 crushes when you were 13 years old. You didn't realize how
much yes you have inside of you." --Richard Gere on fathering his son
Homer James, 2, with girlfriend Carey Lowell, in W magazine, due out
May 20.</TE>

<DL>BIG BEAR LAKE</DL>
<LD>Here's how I'd fight Mike Tyson. First, I'd work on that cinderblock
head of his, knowing you'll never damage that head, not in the early
rounds, but you can tire the man's arms.</LD>
<LD>   In Round 3, I'd batter his midsection, then move back to his head,
knowing his arms would be growing heavy by now and he'd drop them to
protect his bruised ribs. Round 9, I'd go for the chin again, take a
chip off the old cinderblock, bring him down head first. That's how
I'd fight Mike Tyson.</LD>
<LD>   "Dad, someone's talking to Mom," the boy tells me.</LD>
<TE>   "Good luck with that," I say.</TE>
<TE>   We're on the edge of a mountain lake on Saturday afternoon waiting
for friends to come by. Thirty yards up the shoreline some guy is
chatting up my wife--a diamond on her finger, a little girl in her
lap. These locals, they're friendly all right.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still there," the boy whispers.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask her about her MasterCard balance," I call to the guy, who
doesn't hear. When you're talking to a pretty woman, you hear only
her.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't hear you," the boy says.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask her about the kids," I yell.</TE>
<TE>   She is still, after 20 years, the most desirable woman I
personally know. That doesn't mean she's not without flaws. There's
that credit card balance. But that's not all.</TE>
<TE>   Any guy hoping to win her over has a long struggle ahead. Charm
alone won't do it. Mediocre looks either. I know. I've tried.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad," the boy says. "He's still there." Evidently, she's also
desirable to sharp-eyed strangers too long in these hills, which
upsets the boy somewhat. He wants me to fight the guy.</TE>
<TE>   Which gets me to thinking again how I'd handle Tyson, something
I've been thinking about a lot lately since I saw that article in
Men's Journal last week. "Why I'm Going to Whip Tyson," by Lennox
Lewis, was the headline on the cover. Gets a guy to thinking.</TE>
<TE>   So while driving up to Big Bear, I started considering how I'd
fight Tyson, not why. The why seemed obvious.</TE>
<TE>   By Round 10, he'd be wobbly as a country club drunk. If you can
get Tyson into the late rounds, you have a chance to ring his bell.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, I think he's leaving," the boy says as the stranger pedals
away on his old bike.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky for him," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Flirting. Chivalry. Murderous thoughts. Welcome to our Mother's
Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Here they come!" says the little girl as our friends' boat heads
our way. "That's them," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Gilligan!" screams the boy.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing like surrounding yourself with old friends on a
major holiday, Mother's Day being one of the biggest.</TE>
<TE>   So up to our friends' cabin we've come on this warm May
weekend, to honor our significant mothers with special brunches, boat
rides and music. Oh, and poetry, too, much of it store-bought.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, no matter how old I get, I'll always be your little boy,"
says the greeting card.</TE>
<TE>   "See, Dad?" the boy says as he picks out the card at Vons on Big
Bear Boulevard. "She might cry," I warn him. "I think she'll like
it," he says, tossing it in the cart.</TE>
<TE>   What's in this holiday shopping cart? Eggs. Bacon. Flowers. A $3
card. This is how we will celebrate motherhood. For one measly day,
we'll do all of the chores many mothers do every day. We'll make a
big production of it, too.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, who's setting the table?" one dad asks the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, who's burning the toast?" asks another.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing will take 10 years off a kitchen like a good Mother's Day
brunch--dads and kids burning the toast and over-frying the bacon, a
big dog mopping up spills down below.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got champagne," the other dad says. "Champagne?" asks one of
the moms.</TE>
<TE>   The big yellow lab circles her chair, then lies down with a grunt
and some muffled cursing.</TE>
<TE>   "Your dog sure curses a lot," I tell her. "She's a Virgo," the
mother explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," someone says, prompting more champagne.</TE>
<TE>   We had started the holiday Sunday in the cold lake, in a slick new
ski boat, hunkered down against the cold as we let the mothers sleep
in.</TE>
<TE>   One guy goes, then another guy goes. We don't enjoy the
water-skiing so much as we survive it. The water is still in the 50s,
cold as a gin and tonic.</TE>
<TE>   "Know what some guys are doing now?" I ask my host as we sit
around the boat, bare-chested and pretending not to shiver.</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Shaving their chests," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Who says?" my friend asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Saw it somewhere," I explain. "Promise me this: If I ever shave
my chest hair, just shoot me."</TE>
<TE>   There is a pause. The host looks at his son. His son looks at me.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad shaves his chest," the son says.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody should," I say, then jump in the icy lake.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, the mothers read, then sleep, then read, then
sleep. Our contribution? We don't wake them when we can't find a sock
or the car keys. We don't play Wiffle ball in the bathroom or
football on the beds.</TE>
<TE>   So this Mother's Day was a pretty big success, if you believe in
such things. Success, that is. And measure it pretty generously. I
put my foot in my mouth for breakfast, but saved room for brunch.</TE>
<TE>   For one sweet Sunday, we let the mothers rest. These mountains,
they're pretty good for that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad you guys came," our hostess says at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Know what some guys are doing?" I whisper.</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Shaving their chests," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "David shaves his chest," she whispers back.</TE>
<TE>   So I heard.</TE>

<HD>If It Smells Good, It Must Be Bad for You</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At some level, of course, we knew it had to be bad for us. It is,
after all, just another mood-altering substance that interacts with
the human body in a way most of us would rather not scrutinize
because it makes us feel so good. But the auto industry is in the
process of discovering what early Coca-Cola executives
learned--anything that induces euphoria is probably going to get
someone in trouble sooner or later. Even that new-car smell.</LD>
<LD>   No one would be surprised to learn that this heady fragrance is
chemical in nature. That's why we like it. It smells like unsullied
carpet, still-pristine and protected upholstery, with an undertone of
paint and a topknot of newly minted petroleum products. It smells
shiny and expensive and significant, like a new road or an attache
case of crisp bills. It is the instant payoff for grueling hours
spent in close proximity with a car salesman, the consolation prize
for the $2,000-loss that comes the moment the car leaves the lot.</LD>
<LD>   But more than that, it is a race memory, the scent of oil and
grease and ozone evokes the industrial nature of our shared heritage,
of the factories and mills that were part of so many family
histories. If the automobile is the most ubiquitous symbol of our
country's achievement, then the new-car smell is a constant promise
of its renewal. It is, in a way, the smell of America.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, a recent study by Australia's Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization found that it also
contains enough toxins to make some people sick. So while
manufacturers are working to make their plastics and polyurethane
foam less pungent, car manufacturers are trying to decide if they
can, and should, get rid of the new-car smell altogether. Marketers
know what that smell means--research has long shown that of all the
senses, smell may be the strongest motivator; certainly it evokes the
most vivid memories and emotions. And it is hard to imagine a new car
that smells of pine or citrus or nothing.</TE>
<TE>   But the new-car smell is not the only sensual icon in danger of
being made obsolete by an increasingly educated and environmentally
aware populace. When driving the relatively new electric cars, the
first thing many motorists notice is the absolute lack of engine
noise. When stopped, it seems that the car has stalled; when moving,
the only sound is the road hissing beneath the tires. It can be an
unnerving experience, as if the car were not working or simply not
real, as if you were traveling at high speeds while naked, in a
vehicular sense.</TE>
<TE>   Driving in silence, you realize how much you rely on the sound of
the engine to reassure you that all is well, that there is literal
power at your fingertips. If a revving engine makes no noise, is it
really revving? It will be interesting to see if, like air fresheners
designed to imitate that new-car smell, some enterprising person puts
together a CD to mimic the sound of a souped up Chevrolet for those
folks who've gone to the electric hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial evolution in general leans toward the compact in size
and sound. Smells, however, may be enhanced--cleansers that smell
like cucumber, detergent that smells like babies--but it is always
there. Something that smells like nothing is more unnerving even than
a silent car. One of the standard features of futuristic travel
depicted in fiction is its sleek silence--the only sounds aboard many
fictional spacecraft are the digital ticking of the control panel and
the inevitable swoosh of the air-lock doors.</TE>
<TE>   It makes you wonder: What does a new spaceship smell like anyway?</TE>

<LD>Early TV Shows for Kids</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever wondered what kids did 50 years ago for fun? Well,
part of the time, they watched a new invention called television.</LD>
<LD>   Television looked different from today. All the shows were black
and white, and the TV sets had 5-inch screens! If you were the first
family on your block with a television, everyone would come over to
watch.</LD>
<TE>   In TV's early days, there were many shows just for kids. One of
the first was "The Howdy Doody Show." The host was Buffalo Bob, and
the star was Howdy Doody, a marionette (puppet with strings) with red
hair and freckles. Buffalo Bob would start every show with "Hey,
kids! What time is it?" The audience hollered back, "It's Howdy Doody
time!"</TE>
<TE>   Another show for kids starred Gumby, a little green man made of
clay. Gumby had many adventures on "The Gumby Show" with his friend
Pokey.</TE>
<TE>   Shows about animals were also popular with kids. "Lassie" was
about a very smart dog that looked after her boy master, Timmy. "The
Adventures of Rin Tin Tin" featured a German shepherd who lived on an
Army post in the Old West.</TE>
<TE>   For boys and girls who loved horses, there was "My Friend Flicka"
and "Fury," both based on popular books for children.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Quiz: Find someone who grew up in the '50s and see how much
they remember about TV shows back then.</TE>
<TE>   1. Name the famous captain who had a favorite friend named Mr.
Green Jeans.</TE>
<TE>   2. On the show "Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie," Kukla was a puppet, and Fran
was a woman. Who was Ollie?</TE>
<TE>   3. Who was the host for "Ding Dong School"?</TE>
<TE>   4. Which show's theme song was "Happy Trails to You"?</TE>
<TE>   ANSWERS: 1. Captain Kangaroo; 2. Ollie was also a puppet; 3. Miss
Frances; 4. "The Roy Rogers Show."</TE>

<HD>A Lesson Learned From Enron: What You Can't Shred, Sell</HD>
<DH>Linda Lay's thrift store is stocked with items from
multimillion- dollar homes she and her husband have sold</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>In a city where fortunes come and go, stylish debt management is a
shameless art form. Take Linda Lay, the former first lady of Enron
Corp., who's now in the thrift store business. We're talking
salvation Armani here.</LD>
<LD>   Her new Jus' Stuff resale shop, expected to open here any day now,
is stocked with furnishings from multimillion-dollar homes she and
her husband, Kenneth L. Lay, have sold since the energy company
collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   In Texas, companies may fall, but people stand tall. The late,
three-time Lone Star State Gov. John Connally, facing bankruptcy in
1988, set the gold standard when he entered an auction house to
thunderous applause, sat second row center and signed autographs as
the possessions of a lifetime were sold to the highest bidder.</LD>
<TE>   In January, Linda Lay was on NBC's "Today" show tearfully saying
her family was near bankruptcy. Now dry-eyed since the sale of luxury
vacation homes in Aspen, Colo. (a cottage went for $10 million), and
another in Galveston, Texas, she is working with her daughter, Robin,
on selling family castoffs--pre-owned furniture. "Linda decided it
didn't make sense to keep it all," said family spokeswoman Kelly
Kimberly. "It was just stuff, and someone else might have a use for
it."</TE>
<TE>   The curious attracted to the Jus' Stuff store find a firmly locked
door with a handwritten note: "Jus' sorting through our stuff. Thanks
for stopping by."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some stop and peek between the window shades that shield
the interior from view and a luxurious expanse of furniture appears:
A mahogany canopy bed. A reproduction of an antique desk. Tables
filled with picture frames and lamps. Rugs, glassware and ceramic
rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   Track lighting shines on carefully arranged vignettes throughout
the store. A painting of Jesus rests against a mantle topped with a
pair of folk art roosters. Elsewhere, a pile of gaily flowered
pillows softens a set of bent willow chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite your taste? The store is also unloading home furnishings
from friends of the couple.</TE>
<TE>   Though the store is near the priciest homes in town, the Lays
share the block with a crazy quilt of neighbors befitting a city that
is still unzoned: Owners of 1940s bungalows live alongside a
combination manicure-and-massage emporium, an electrical supply
company and a junk shop that welcomes customers with a poster of the
Fonz on the door and crushed beer cans on the walkway.</TE>
<TE>   From his home across the street, Mark Parker has watched a parade
of workers transform the Lays' store, a former pet shop, from homely
to modern. He winced when painters sanded off a favorite big red
sign, "Kennel Town Meat Bar," which always drew second glances. Fresh
white paint went up, then a stark black awning.</TE>
<TE>   Parker's outdoor smoking breaks became infinitely more interesting
when vans pulled up to unload the secondhand goods. "They own so many
fine things, it's high-end everything," Parker said. "I don't believe
they're broke," he said, adding that the Lays still live in a home
worth millions. "I don't understand why they're doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he wouldn't mind shopping there, if his budget allowed.
"This is supposed to be a secondhand store, but it would take me six
months to pay for anything in there." Maybe Parker should ask if Jus'
Stuff offers a layaway plan.</TE>
<TE>   A paint-spattered Bob Nelson, taking a break from the blazing
afternoon sun, agreed. "It's all real nice stuff in there," said
Nelson, who helped knock down and paint walls inside the store.
"There's a lot of it in there, stacked up high. I can't afford any of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly said that though pricing is not complete, "I would think
there would be something affordable for various price ranges. They
had some small items--there were things like a set of brightly
colored dishes."</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders are banned until the store opens. If the drawn shades
don't convey the message, the constant presence of a Houston police
cruiser in the parking lot does.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the Lays, I'd be afraid and call the police, too," said
a shop owner down the street. "I think it's terrible what they did to
those people at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be surprised if anybody buys their things, though you always
have people who want a souvenir of a tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Lay name attracts or deters business is moot, said
Parker. "The rich run in a tight crowd here. You'd just about have to
kill someone to get kicked out. They'll buy the stuff if no one else
will."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Michael Quintanilla contributed to this
article.</TE>

<HD>It's a Special Type of Beauty</HD>
<DH>The painstaking, 600-year-old art of letterpress is
enjoying a resurgence</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bride-to-be Ashley Braband didn't know letterpress from a sandwich
press when she walked into Soolip Paperie &amp; Press in West Hollywood
several months ago looking for wedding invitations. But once she ran
her fingers across a letterpress card and felt the subtle landscape
created by inked metal pressed into paper, she was sold.</LD>
<LD>   "Each piece looked handcrafted," said the 23-year-old Los Angeles
human resources director, whose Napa Valley wedding is scheduled for
the fall. "It gives a lasting effect--it makes it look like it's
going to be on the paper for years and years. A lot of people have
been writing back on the response cards, 'Wow, what an invitation!'"</LD>
<LD>   Braband isn't the only one discovering the 600-year-old art of
letterpress, the original form of mechanized printing that dates back
as far as the Guttenberg Bible. The craft is enjoying a comeback in
stationery and custom invitations and announcements. Around the
region, 100-plus-year-old presses are clacking away, from Soolip on
Melrose to Aardvark Letterpress on 7th Street near downtown, to the
Claudia Laub Studio and Gallery in Hancock Park to the Fine Paper Co.
in Old Town Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   At Claudia Laub Inc., a retail-wholesale business Laub sold to
partner Jonathan Wright Herpick last year, printer Nelson Ayala is
making stationery with a shell motif in flamingo pink. In the back of
this small store, working on a 19th century press, he takes a sheet
of ivory paper and carefully positions it on one of the press' flat
surfaces. The engraved metal die with the shell motif faces the
paper, and after it's been inked it's pressed into the paper, leaving
a slight impression that transforms the blank sheet into a mini work
of art.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala examines the proof, peering through a clear plastic grid to
make sure the design is straight and centered, then checks to see if
the ink is consistent. A small motor operates the machine, which
originally was powered by foot treadles; once Ayala sets the press in
motion the large flywheel, rollers and plates swing gracefully amid
the cacophony of clicks, clacks and bangs, sending heady whiffs of
ink into the air.</TE>
<TE>   It can take months, sometimes years, to acquire the intuition to
gauge the precise amount of ink needed, to learn how to position the
paper just so and to adjust the press for varying thicknesses of
paper. Hand-setting type is a painstaking process in which individual
letters, from sliver-sized pieces to big blocks, are aligned and
spaced. Yet as careful as the most practiced printer becomes, the
charm of letterpress lies in the finished product's slight
imperfections, which speak to its handmade roots.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, offset printing, the process that replaced
letterpress in the 20th century, uses printing plates and rollers. It
is both more efficient and less labor-intensive than letterpress, but
it loses the depth and dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Though more businesses offering letterpress products are springing
up, each has its own look and style, reflecting the tastes of the
individual designers and printers, ranging from Victorian engravings
of frogs to whimsical graphics of children and minimalist modern
designs of cocktail glasses. Most images are rendered in one or two
colors, and some feature hand-painted images.</TE>
<TE>   The final product isn't cheap. A letterpress greeting card can
cost $7. Custom birth announcements can run about $500, and
multi-part invitations can shoot up into the tens of thousands of
dollars. As details escalate, so do prices. A wedding invitation
package, for instance, could include a save-the-date card, the
invitation itself, matching envelope, response card and envelope, and
thank-you notes. Each one can incorporate handset type and
custom-designed icons made into engraved copper dies. The medium is
often associated with specialty handmade papers, complex folds, plus
additions such as hand-tied ribbons, dried flowers and wax seals. All
of these up the ante considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Although they are the most common letterpress products, stationery
and invitations are not all that letterpresses can be used for.
Several small presses in the U.S. have produced limited-edition
handmade books, among them Arion Press in San Francisco and
Thornwillow Press in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, letterpress has found a fan base in the
25-and-under crowd who grew up with a mouse in one hand and a video
game joystick in the other. They're filling letterpress classes at
local art and design schools, including Otis College of Art and
Design in L.A., and Armory Center for the Arts and Art Center College
of Design in Pasadena. But it's Martha Stewart who is most widely
credited with bringing back interest in the process after she
included an article on letterpress in her magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of [the interest] is a reaction to the technology we're
surrounded with," says Scott Ward, Armory's executive director. "This
is clearly a tactile medium. You literally have to put an 'A' into
position to print an 'A' on a sheet of paper. It's such a switch from
the digital world."</TE>
<TE>   Doing letterpress commercially requires a huge commitment. Presses
are often tracked down by a small group of middlemen who seek out
defunct print shops and abandoned newspaper presses. Depending on how
the presses are found, whom they belong to, and their condition,
prices can run from $100 to thousands. One of the presses at the
Claudia Laub Studio and Gallery is from the late 19th century and
once belonged to the Los Angeles Times. Wanda Wen, owner of Soolip
and a 10-year veteran of letterpress, said she found her presses, one
from 1890 and one from the 1920s, via newsletters: "I had them
trucked over sight unseen and put them in my garage until we found
studio space," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Printers also stalk flea markets and scour online auctions and
classified ads looking for wood and metal type and dingbats--little
icons and designs such as hearts, leaves or flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "I love taking the blank piece of paper and sticking it in the
press, and when it comes out a second later it all of a sudden has
power," says Laub, who's been letterpress printing for 30 years. "I
love picking up each one and looking at it, making sure it's right. I
love using handmade paper that has thicker and thinner areas, and the
type bites into the thicker area a little more than the thinner area.
In letterpress, the letters dance a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Laub now concentrates on custom work, which she does from her
home. Rummaging through an antique oak chest in her living room, she
pulls out card after card--an elegant wedding invitation with
entwined wedding rings, a birth announcement with a baseball player
etched in navy, a bat mitzvah invitation with intricate folds.</TE>
<TE>   Not every customer who chooses letterpress is familiar with the
process; printers say they usually give their clients a brief
education to explain the work involved. But printers seem satisfied
if their clients simply share an aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people who come in know what we're about," says
Wen, "but a lot of people who don't know it's letterpress just like
the aesthetic. If I had to put it into words, our style is clean,
simple, uncluttered, and some people have said it has a certain
'Zen-ness' to it. It has a purpose to it."</TE>
<TE>   "People are appreciating printing again, and letterpress is a very
elegant form of printing," says Cary Ocon, part of the 34-year-old,
family-run Aardvark Letterpress. "We do educate some of our
customers, but more and more people are coming in asking for it. They
seem to know what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Morgan, stationery buyer for Kate's Paperie stores in New
York, says that in the last few years she's seen more young
entrepreneurs--mostly women--try their hand at letterpress.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago, we carried two companies that did letterpress,"
she said, "and now we have five, maybe six. That so many young people
are doing letterpress is great; it's heartening. I think young people
hunger for the roughness of it."</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Dare, who heads the letterpress lab at Otis, hears the same
thing from her students, who incorporate new technology with old.
Designs for letterpress can be rendered on a computer, then made into
polymer plates that can be used instead of metal dies. "The
technology," she says, "brings letterpress into the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Some letterpress printers and aficionados fear that this renewed
interest in the craft could bring the taint of trendiness, attracting
printers who want to catch the wave but don't share the passion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a craft to which you have to devote attention and
intention," says Helen Driscoll, owner of Fine Paper Co. "If
something becomes trendy, there's no respect for it, and a lot of
people will treat it like photocopy. It's good that there's an
appreciation being developed. When people are part of the process,
they acquire an appreciation when they realize what's involved."</TE>
<TE>   For Ashley Braband, the time and money spent (she estimates
between $15,000 and $20,000) for custom, one-of-a-kind invitations
was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of family and friends coming from overseas," she
explains, "and we wanted a striking invitation that would get people
excited and also set the mood for the occasion. We're having a week
of events for the wedding, which is during the harvest season, so all
the pieces are very earthy. I wanted them to give an elegant yet
relaxed feeling. People have said it's the most beautiful invitation
they've ever seen."</TE>

<HD>Meanness Has to Do With Age, Not Sex</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The media is abuzz with what is being described as a new trend of
meanness in girls. The New York Times magazine screams a headline
"Girls Just Want to Be Mean." On TV, Oprah delves into the secret
life of mean girls. This media blitz is based on a half-dozen new
books about girls and their mean streak. Now the L.A. Times is
chiming in, too ("Bullying, Girl-Style," May 6).</LD>
<LD>   Why are we obsessed on segregating the genders these days? Boys,
too, use their relationships to humiliate and shun one another at the
bus stop or on the sports field, just as girls today are known to
physically attack one another.</LD>
<LD>   This modern-day mean behavior, coined "relational aggression," is
on the upswing because girls can't play out their aggression like
boys can. Mean-spiritedness is a fact of life for both genders during
early adolescence, the years between 10 and 15. Mean behavior
committed by both genders is part of early adolescent development,
exacerbated by a culture that tells kids it's cool to be mean. Movies
cast the popular jocks and queens as condescending and nasty. With TV
broadcasting humiliation as entertainment as in "The Weakest Link,"
"Judge Judy" and umpteen talk shows, we have bequeathed to our young
nasty values.</LD>
<TE>   During middle school, peers preoccupy boys and girls. Friendships
are seen as exclusive and thus exclusionary. Meanness is not some
byproduct of feminist evolution. It is a pattern that needs to be
eliminated, not explained away. Not until we as a culture tout "It's
cool to be kind" will relational aggression ebb among girls and boys.</TE>
<TE>   This current expose has turned into an en masse confessional for
women. They want to "tell all" and be forgiven for past bullying.
Wasn't the point of these books to turn things around? I hope today's
moms don't get sidetracked in their own mea culpas. I hope their
effort to undo junior high social crimes does not eclipse the urgent
need for mothers and fathers to arm daughters and sons with skills to
survive their difficult period.</TE>

<TE>   What About Good</TE>
<TE>   Old-Fashioned Families?</TE>
<TE>   (Re: "Dating in a Family Way," May 7) Our country is based upon
the family unit. Certain leaders have noted the correlation between
single mothers and poverty in youths. Everyone knows that a child
needs a father and a mother active in their life.</TE>
<TE>   How can the L.A. Times accept and promote women getting pregnant
without a spouse? Do they wish to promote poor child care and no
moral values in our society? On the other hand, the L.A. Times should
congratulate men who marry women who already have children, men who
step up to the plate and accept the responsibility of being a father.</TE>

<TE>   I found Lisa Rosen's article on the supposedly positive aspects of
the single and pregnant woman dating scene to be completely
bewildering. Doctors will confirm that most pregnant women experience
a decrease in sexual libido, not an increase, and demographic
statistics prove that, sadly, single mothers suffer from more
depression, lower income and greater hardship than married women.
Postpartum depression is an unfortunate example of this tendency.</TE>

<TE>   Smoking Is Deadly,</TE>

<TE>   No matter how exotic you name it, tobacco is tobacco be it sheesha
or a Cuban cigar ("Passing the Pipe," May 1). I am perplexed as to
why The Times has chosen to feature smoking in whatever form as chic
even as the federal government and the medical profession have been
trying so hard to erase its Joe Camel or Marlboro Man image from our
cultural consciousness.</TE>

<TE>   Comic Strip Seen</TE>
<TE>   as Offensive to Israel</TE>
<TE>   I found the Doonesbury comic on May 1 to be very distasteful. I
lost a very dear friend in the Sbarro pizza bombing in Israel, and
when Garry Trudeau equates Ariel Sharon with a homicide bomber whose
only objective is to kill as many people as he or she can, I find it
distasteful. Sharon would not do such a thing. It is not part of the
Israeli mentality to intentionally kill innocent people, and in
trying to avoid this, Israel has lost many soldiers in booby traps.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad when a paper's anti-Israel leanings go to its comics
section. This was not entertainment. It encourages anti-Jewish
rhetoric.</TE>

<DH>East Coast collegians spending semester 'abroad' in the
Southland develop strong impressions</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a tradition at many colleges for students to spend a semester
or a year abroad. That used to mean Europe almost exclusively, but in
recent years it has come to include places like Vietnam, Senegal, Sri
Lanka, Bali ... and Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The phenomenon of East Coast college students arriving for a
semester of study in L.A., as if it were a foreign land, is rife with
potential irony, not to mention humor. Imagine wide-eyed sophomores
and juniors from the East descending on this cinema city so dotted
with theme parks and palms. Would they immediately bolt for the
nearest beaches, to study the surfing culture? Or to Beverly Hills,
to chart shopping habits of the stars? Would they gripe, in the grand
tradition of their rockbound forefathers, that L.A. is too plastic,
too spread out, too lacking in culture, public transportation, good
food?</LD>
<LD>   Does a semester in L.A. qualify as a culturally enriching academic
experience?</LD>
<TE>   At most big-name Eastern schools, the answer is no. Los Angeles is
not on the menu for the Ivy League, says Robert Shaw, a dean at Brown
University. There are so many more diverse and enriching environments
to explore, he explains.</TE>
<TE>   But the paradise and paradoxes of L.A. seemed enrichment enough
for 19 students and two professors from Hobart and William Smith
Colleges, located in the scenic Finger Lakes district of upstate New
York, in the city of Geneva, population 15,000. The conjoined
colleges share a campus, faculty and liberal arts curriculum that
encourages off-campus study and travel to exotic places.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gearan, HWS provost and former director of the Peace Corps
under President Clinton, says his school offers study in 25
countries, along with options for semesters in Boston, Washington,
New York and, starting six years ago, Los Angeles. "New York is not
as popular as L.A.," he says, partly because HWS is only five hours
by car from Manhattan, and many students were raised in or around
that city.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is considered by some to be an exotic destination," he says,
"and with good reason." Those interested in urban studies, public
policy and/or the film world probably could not find a more rewarding
laboratory, he says. For them, L.A. has the same kind of allure as
the rain forest has for entomologists.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent group of HWS students arrived in January, settled
into shared apartments at the Oakwood complex on Barham Boulevard in
Burbank, and began a semester of working at unpaid internships around
the city, combined with course studies in politics and public policy
(taught by HWS political science professor Craig Rimmerman) and
courses in film and media culture (taught by HWS associate professor
of film studies Elisabeth Lyon, who helped start the school's L.A.
studies program).</TE>
<TE>   Now, don't snicker. This is a serious learning opportunity, both
professors say. And it had better be, since parents of HWS students
pay about $27,000 tuition per year (plus $8,000 for room and board).</TE>
<TE>   Right before their semester in Los Angeles ended last week, we
caught up with the students. Will they take home the kind of
enlightening experiences they'd hoped for? An insight into a culture
different from their own?</TE>
<TE>   Tara Van De Mark of Baltimore majors in anthropology and public
policy. What drew her here, she says, were the books she'd read about
"things like lethal air in L.A., and about the junction of
environmental and social issues. About how people in poor communities
are subjected to harsher environmental conditions. They must live
near incinerators that burn trash, near power lines, near freeways
with toxic fumes. There were things I'd never heard about, although
I'd been fighting to save endangered species and on wilderness issues
since I was a child."</TE>
<TE>   Van De Mark says most people think of L.A. as "limos on Sunset and
all that jazz." What she found was completely different: "an amazing
grass-roots network connected on a plethora of social issues." Her
internship was as a computer specialist for Sweatshop Watch, an
advocacy group for garment workers. She doesn't think Angelenos
understand or care about what's going on in troubled parts of their
own city, she says. "Even the local newscasts don't reflect the
truth. I was surprised that they only emphasize less serious things.
So people don't even know what's really going on around them."</TE>
<TE>   She took public transportation to work each day--or at least, she
tried. And she learned "how garment workers and other poor people
live, how it takes them up to two hours to get to work, some of them
with babies they must drop off at day care first, and how the delays
affect their lives, their jobs, their mental health." Her own route
to work was troublesome enough. She had to beg a ride each day from
the Barham Boulevard apartment to the Red Line subway stop at
Universal City. She took the subway to 7th and Figueroa, then a bus
to 12th and Los Angeles streets. "If I had no ride to the train, I
couldn't work." What's more, she says, "our semester is over, and I
haven't begun to explore even a fraction of the city. That's because
it is so expensive to travel around, and without a car you simply
cannot get from place to place. I was in London for three weeks and
traveled the entire city using the [subway] and the buses. I mastered
it within a week."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany Fields, 21, from Westbury, N.Y., is majoring in media and
society. She was surprised, she says, by the lack of diversity in
this very diverse city. "They speak about it here all the time. But
because of the car culture, you never really see it. There's an
African American area, a Korean area, and so on. The different groups
of people never really mingle. In New York, there are neighborhoods
populated by certain groups, but the place is so compact that
everybody sees everybody else every day. It's segregated here in lots
of ways. The people who ride the buses, for example, are a totally
different social and economic group than people who drive cars. There
is a huge gap between the rich and the poor that is more evident here
than in New York. This is not good, in my view."</TE>
<TE>   Fields, who wants to be a casting director and served her
internship at a Hollywood casting agency, says she loved the
work--but the city is too entertainment-oriented. "It becomes boring
after a while. Everywhere I went, every restaurant or coffee shop,
they're talking about struggles to get into the industry, to move up
in the industry, to make it big in the industry. Can I meet anyone,
please, who's all about art? Or literature? You guys have a funny
definition of culture. The Getty Center, for example, has great
views, it's architecturally beautiful, but it's not ... as good as
the museums we have in New York. I love New York. But guess what? I
also love L.A. And because this is where I want to work, I will
definitely be back. Come to think of it ... L.A. has a lot to offer
that New York doesn't have."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Nolan, 20, an English major from a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.,
had never been to Los Angeles either. His internship was spent
working for Roger Corman's production company, where he worked on
script reading and on his own script. "I've known for a long time
that I want to write films. I'm coming back here to the UCLA
screenwriting program soon. I could never live here and raise a
family, though. I'm troubled about certain things. At sports events,
for instance, nobody's there for the sport, like they are in my home
town. Here, they're all full of vanity. They're on their cell phones,
reading magazines. Even a sporting event becomes a social scene. It's
all about who has the bigger car, who lives on the highest hill. It
saddens me that people I met seem to care only about money. "I saw
the noir side of the city--it's just what I expected from watching
'Mulholland Drive,' 'Heat,' 'Training Day' and 'Chinatown.' But I'll
come back here for as long as it takes me to become successful. Maybe
I'll get an apartment near the beach...."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Pursley, 20, a media and society major, is from
Barrington, R.I., "a town so tiny that there is no fast food, no
movie house, no alcohol." Her father manages a McDonald's in a nearby
town, where she works summers to help pay for college. She spent her
senior high school year studying in Europe, she says, and her
semester in Los Angeles was "every bit as interesting and involving,"
she says. "To be honest, I never thought I'd like L.A. as much as I
have. The first challenge for people here is transportation," she
noticed. To get to work at MTV on the Paramount lot (where she read
scripts and answered phones), she carpooled with the three guys with
whom she shared an apartment. They all chipped in to rent a car, she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside the studio it was all glitz and glamour. But walk outside,
and it's all the have-nots. The poverty I saw is overwhelming to me.
On my drive to work every day, I always felt how fortunate I was, how
lucky to be able to go to school, to share a car. The people we saw
had so little--and certainly no way to get around. We visited the
first grade of a Compton school, taught by a recent graduate of HWS.
It was the most memorable experience. I had never faced these urban
problems one on one. When you're sitting there, talking to these
terrific little kids, and you realize they will probably never have
the opportunities I have--and there is no rhyme or reason. When you
sit down, and the kids' first question to you is 'how do you pay for
college?' It has made me want to get more involved in helping with
these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Castaldo, 20, from Plainfield, N.J., is a sophisticate who's
been to Europe many times with his father (an elementary school
principal) and his mother (a prep school teacher). "I love L.A.,"
Castaldo beams. "It is shallow. It is superficial. But what great
weather. I am much more productive when it's beautiful outside. And
what a ton of stuff there is to do. I go down to the Roxy, the
Whisky, the House of Blues, the Key Club--they all have live music."
He worked at Sotheby's in the events department, "because I want to
be in the business and law side of fine arts."</TE>
<TE>   On the downside, he says, L.A. is too crowded and congested and is
"filled with problems that must be addressed. But these are not just
problems of L.A. They are the problems almost everywhere in the
world. L.A. is really a microcosm of things around the globe. This is
the new place to be, to study, to fix. Something very big is gonna
happen here pretty soon. And I mean something good."</TE>
<TE>   And, from the perspective of the teachers?</TE>
<TE>   Rimmerman, 45, who's spent semesters in London and Washington,
D.C., says the semester in L.A. helped students "learn their place in
the world and how they interact in the political and economic system
within which we live."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon, 53, says many students gained an idea of the complexity of
this city and the possibilities it offers for the future if the
problems can be fixed. "There is nothing like going to another
country to study--and believe me, Los Angeles is like another
country."</TE>

<TE>   Jasmyn felt like the invisible girl. When no one was looking, she

<TE>   She had an idea.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning she rubbed heaps of baby powder all over her

<AU>REG GREEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently I strolled through a park in Rome with Andrea Mongiardo, a
23-year-old Italian whose heart once belonged to my son.</LD>
<LD>   My son, Nicholas, a magical little creature whose teacher said was
the most giving child she'd ever met, was 7 when he was shot seven
years ago in a botched robbery on the main highway south from Naples.
Two young men, mistaking our rental car for one they thought was
carrying jewelry to stores in southern Italy, fired on us, hitting
Nicholas in the head. Two days later he was declared brain dead.</LD>
<LD>   I can remember that sunlit hospital room, with the doctors
standing in a group in the corner, leaving my wife, Maggie, and me
alone to absorb their terrible news and the thought that came with
it: "How will I ever get through the rest of my life without him?"
Never to run my fingers through his hair again, never to tickle him
or hear him say, "Goodnight, Daddy."</LD>
<TE>   We sat there numbly for a few more moments. Then one of us--we
don't remember which, but, knowing her, I'd guess Maggie--said, "Now
that he's gone, shouldn't we donate the organs?" and the other said
yes. And that was all there was to it.</TE>
<TE>   Although we are not a gloomy family and still laugh a lot, every
morning when I wake I know life will never have the sparkle it had
when Nicholas was alive. But we have never had a moment's regret
about our decision--and if we had had any regrets they would have
been banished by the first sight of the seven organ recipients, four
of them teenagers, whom we met a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four teens could have expected to live much longer,
two of the adults were going blind and the third, a diabetic, was in
pitiful shape, her whole central nervous system disintegrating,
scarcely able to see, unable to walk without help.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea was all too typical. Born with a severely deformed heart,
he stopped growing when he was 7. He underwent a dangerous operation,
which failed, then another, which also failed, then a third, a fourth
and a fifth. None of them worked. His family was in despair.</TE>
<TE>   He became so sick he could scarcely walk to the elevator in his
apartment building. Every other day he went to the hospital for a
transfusion of albumin, the protein that kept him alive. He was
hollow-cheeked, a frightened look set on his face. At 15 years old,
he knew he couldn't last much longer.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came in March 1994 when the doctors at Rome's
Bambino Gesu (Baby Jesus) Hospital brought up the idea of a
transplant. "Only a new heart can save him," they told his parents.
At first he said no. After five failed operations he was
understandably reluctant to have another.</TE>
<TE>   But he was persuaded to try. He was put on the transplant waiting
list and began the long, cruel, double-edged wait that could only end
successfully if someone else died.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing him now, and knowing what would have happened to him, I
know that if we had made a different decision and shrugged off his
problems and those of the other recipients as none of our concern,
neither Maggie nor I could ever have looked back without a deep sense
of shame.</TE>
<TE>   The operation was much more difficult than a normal transplant
because of the acute deformation of his heart; he hung between life
and death. At length, however, it was a resounding success. The new
heart turned out to be a perfect match. "It might have been made for
him," Lidia, his mother, told me, a tear in her eye because, being a
mother, she never forgets the little boy it came from.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea has had his share of ups and downs as his body, like that
of all transplant recipients, tries to reject the new organ. But, all
in all, he is thriving. He plays soccer, works with an uncle who
manages condominiums and finds deep satisfaction in the simple things
of life. Looking at him in a crowd, you would never pick him out as
the one who spent half his childhood in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   We would have done anything to keep Nicholas alive, of course. But
that wasn't an option. So standing next to Andrea in the park wasn't
horrifying or depressing or awkward. We've never thought of Nicholas
living on in any literal way inside Andrea or the others, but as I
put my arm around his shoulders, I did feel a kinship to Nicholas'
pure heart, beating steadily, and a flow of satisfaction, knowing
that even in death he continued to give so fully.</TE>
<TE>   We first met our recipients and their families just a few months
after the shooting, when our grief was still agonizingly raw. But
that meeting, which both of us had to steel ourselves to attend, was
explosive. A door opened, and in came this mass of humanity, some
smiling, some tearful, some ebullient, some bashful, a stunning
demonstration of the momentous consequences the donations had.</TE>
<TE>   We now think of them as an extended family. We've watched the
children grow and leave school and get their driver's licenses and
the adults go back to work. One of them, 19-year-old Maria Pia
Pedala, in a coma with liver failure on the day Nicholas died,
bounced back to good health, married and has since had a baby boy.
And, yes, they have called him Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, schools, squares and the largest hospital have also been
named for him. Better still, organ donation rates have almost
tripled, yet they still fall far below the need.</TE>
<TE>   I have a story I like to tell about Nicholas. On our way to Italy
a few days before he was killed, we played a game in which he was a
Roman soldier returning home, after years heroically guarding the
frontiers. When you get to Rome, we told him, you'll be famous. Poems
will be written about you, streets will be named for you, you'll get
a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   It was only a game. But it all came true. With this difference:
that Nicholas conquered not by the force of arms but by the power of
love, and that, of course, is much stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Reg Green lives with his family in Bodega Bay, Calif.</TE>

<HD>Viacom Pays $21 Million in Asbestos Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc., owner of the CBS television network, said it spent $21
million in asbestos-related litigation claims last year.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom listed the total cost of settlement and defense of
asbestos-related claims in its quarterly 10-Q filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Viacom's "reserves and insurance
are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities," the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Asbestos was used in products made before 1970 by some of the
industrial units of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which acquired CBS
in 1995. Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corp. and was bought by
Viacom in 2000. Viacom said it sold all its businesses that used
asbestos.</LD>
<TE>   The company has about 115,000 pending asbestos-related claims as
of March 31, 2002, the filing said. It received 11,000 new claims in
the first quarter of this year and settled about 2,000 claims.</TE>

<LD>Vivendi Universal sold its remaining stake of 14% in British Sky
Broadcasting Group in a deal worth $2.5billion.</LD>
<LD>   A source close to the sale said that the deal to sell the stake in
BSkyB was designed to alleviate the pressure on Vivendi credit
rating.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear Vivendi has chosen now to sell the stake because they
received a credit downgrade recently," the source said.</LD>

<LD>Vivendi Universal may abandon plans to buy the unprofitable
television operation Stream after Italian authorities imposed new
conditions on the purchase, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi can buy Stream from News Corp. and merge it with Telepiu,
its pay-TV unit, if it agrees to limit broadcasting contracts with
Italian soccer clubs to two years, Italy's Antitrust Authority said.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling lifts the last regulatory obstacle and clears the way
for a merger of the rival Italian companies.</LD>

<HD>HP Sales, Cost-Cutting Lead to Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. on Tuesday posted a fiscal
second-quarter profit as cost-cutting and printer sales made up for
the dampening effect of the slow economy, but warned it did not
anticipate a meaningful improvement in information technology
spending until 2003.</LD>
<LD>   HP, reporting on its final quarter before concluding the biggest
merger in technology history with the acquisition of Compaq Computer
Corp., showed a net profit of $252million, or 13 cents a share,
compared with $47 million, or 2 cents, in the same quarter last year.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, HP showed a profit of $498 million, or
25 cents per diluted share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared
with $336 million, or 17 cents, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<TE>   That met HP's own target, set three months ago, and Wall Street
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue, however, was lighter than HP had expected. The company
had sales of $10.6 billion, compared with $11.7 billion in the
year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is we have seen no signs of encouragement yet," Chief
Financial Officer Bob Wayman said. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said
in a statement that "while a muted recovery in the second half is
still possible, we are not counting on meaningful improvement in IT
spending until 2003."</TE>
<TE>   HP released its earnings after markets closed. Shares rose 52
cents to $20.50 during regular New York Stock Exchange trading, but
fell to $19.60 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>States Ask for Memo as Evidence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Microsoft Corp. executive urged the company to quietly retaliate
against supporters of the rival Linux operating system in an August
2000 memo that nine states still suing the software giant want
admitted as evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The nine states seeking stiff antitrust sanctions against
Microsoft late Monday asked the judge in the case to reconsider her
decision that shielded Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates from the e-mail
message during his testimony last month.</LD>
<LD>   In the memo, Microsoft Senior Vice President Joachim Kempin
complained to Gates and other senior executives that chip maker Intel
Corp. was encouraging computer makers to support Linux and funding
development of new devices that would work with Linux.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said Kempin's memo was "irrelevant"
because the company never acted on his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company's attorneys were expected to file a response
late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Linux has been touted as a possible alternative to Windows.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly disallowed the Kempin
memo after Microsoft's lawyers objected to it.</TE>
<TE>   The states' attorneys argued in their filing Monday that Kempin's
e-mail shows Microsoft continued to discuss anti-competitive tactics
even though the original trial judge had already ruled those tactics
in violation of antitrust law.</TE>

<HD>News Corp. Results Hurt by Write-Down on Gemstar Stake</HD>
<DH>Media: Performance of the 20th Century Fox film unit helps
lift operating earnings, which beat expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp. posted a $4-billion net loss in its third fiscal quarter
stemming from an expected write-down on its stake in ailing
Gemstar-TV Guide International, but it showed a big surge in
operating earnings, thanks largely to a stellar performance by its
20th Century Fox film unit.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian media giant's noncash write-down of $4.2billion on
Gemstar, the Pasadena company that publishes TV Guide and features
on-screen program guides, was taken to meet new accounting rules on
how to treat goodwill that decreases permanently in value.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar's value has plunged by about two-thirds, stemming from
such things as a patent dispute, questions about its accounting
methods and management turmoil.</LD>
<TE>   Goodwill is an intangible asset on a company's books that reflects
the premium a company paid when it acquired an asset. Several major
media companies, notably AOL Time Warner and Vivendi Universal, also
have taken big write-offs recently to more accurately reflect the
fair market value of assets they acquired.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Gemstar problem, News Corp.'s results exceeded Wall
Street expectations. News Corp.'s operating earnings climbed 54% to
$549 million for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a year
earlier, with revenue rising 18% to $3.85 billion. Much of the
increase is owed to profit from the animated hit film "Ice Age,"
which to date has grossed some $300 million worldwide. The results
also came despite disappointing results at the Fox TV network.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen in a report called News
Corp.'s overall results a "blow-out quarter," adding that the
operating earnings exceeded her projection by $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   Filmed entertainment contributed $161 million to News Corp.'s
third-quarter operating profit, up from $43 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The film unit is part of Fox Entertainment Group, a publicly
traded company that is 85% owned by News Corp. Fox Entertainment
Group, which reported its results simultaneously, said its net income
was $108million in the quarter, contrasted with a $9-million loss a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Ice Age," News Corp.'s filmed entertainment
operation saw a strong performance worldwide from "Moulin Rouge" and
growing DVD sales, as well as profit from such syndicated shows as
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "King of the Hill" and "The Practice."</TE>
<TE>   News Corp.'s television operations posted a slight increase in
quarterly operating income to $114million, from $111million a year
ago, with softer results at Fox Broadcasting offsetting the
performance of the company's TV station group. One of the company's
brighter spots was its cable networks, which include the Fox News
Channel, the Fox Sports Network and the FX Channel, in which
operating income jumped to $73 million from $24 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Chairman Rupert Murdoch said
that although he is pleased with the quarter, "it makes me all the
more impatient for our share price to reflect the company's positive
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Media stocks have been battered by investors, in part because of
softness in advertising and problems meshing newly merged operations.
News Corp.'s American depositary receipts have been trading near a
three-year low, although they jumped $2.07 to $28.45 on Tuesday after
the results were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch said he isn't prepared to declare an end to the
advertising recession but said he is seeing signs of a turnaround in
the company's television, cable and film divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can justly claim we're now beginning to deliver on
that promise and seeing real profits," Murdoch said.</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Entrepreneurship Takes Hit in 2001, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recession and the lingering effects of the dot-com bomb took
their toll on entrepreneurship in the United States last year, as
fewer people launched new ventures or stuck with start-ups, according
to a study of global entrepreneurship released Tuesday. The study
ranked the United States seventh out of 29 countries on
entrepreneurial activity, as measured by the percentage of
working-age adults launching a new business or operating one less
than 31/2 years old.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico was ranked No.1, followed by New Zealand and Australia.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. rate of adults involved in young businesses or those
still on the launching pad was 11.7%, down from 16.7% seen in 2000,
according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2001 report from the
Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership.</LD>
<TE>   An earlier, unrelated study estimated that high-growth
entrepreneurial companies create about two-thirds of all new jobs in
the U.S. economy. Researchers said the drop in entrepreneurial
activity translates into lost paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   The global study looked at two groups of entrepreneurs--would-be
business owners who were in the process of launching a business but
had yet to quit their day jobs, and ones that already had taken the
plunge and were running shops less than 31/2 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 study, an average of 6.9% of working-age adults were
in the second group, running young businesses, said Andrew
Zacharakis, a professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in the
Boston suburb of Wellesley, and the leader of the U.S. research team.
That figure dropped by half--to 3.5%--last year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was likely a function of the recession and the decline in
overall economic activity, which caused some of those young
businesses to lose customers," said Zacharakis. "The recession caused
a number of those new businesses to close."</TE>
<TE>   Although the study shows that fewer U.S. adults think good
entrepreneurial opportunities will develop over the next six months,
the study's authors see positive signs long term, as more women and
older workers gain ground in the entrepreneurial ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "Entrepreneurship as a career option is a fundamental part of our
economic system," said Paul Reynolds, also a professor at Babson, and
coordinator for the global research teams. "There is no threat to
entrepreneurship that I see."</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurial activity dipped worldwide last year, said Larry
Cox, a co-author of the report and director of research at
Missouri-based Kauffman. But it remains high in nations that
contribute to U.S. immigration, especially Mexico, which topped the
list of the nations surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   There, 18% of working-age adults were either launching start-ups
or nurturing young businesses, according to the report, which was
conducted by Babson College and the London Business School.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, nations with more entrepreneurial zeal than the U.S.
last year included South Korea, where the average was about 15% of
working-age adults, and Brazil, which saw its quotient decrease from
21.4% in 2000 to 14.2% last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Inktomi Corp., an Internet software maker, has loaned Chief Executive
David Peterschmidt $4.9million to avoid "negative inferences" that
would arise if he sold his stock.</LD>
<LD>   Inktomi, whose shares have dropped 81% in the last year, said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the loans have an
annual interest rate of 6%.</LD>
<LD>   The loans and interest are due in two years or earlier if
Peterschmidt leaves Inktomi before that time.</LD>
<TE>   Peterschmidt earned $532,935 in salary and bonus in the year ended
Sept. 30, 2001, and received options to buy 500,000 shares.</TE>
<TE>   The package is valued at as much as $11.7million over 10 years if
the shares rise 10%, according to Inktomi's proxy statement.</TE>
<TE>   Those options are worthless at today's share price.</TE>
<TE>   Inktomi shares rose 8 cents to close at $1.49 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Applied Materials Inc., the No.1 maker of tools used to produce
microchips, reported a fiscal second-quarter profit Tuesday and said
renewed demand for consumer electronics helped push orders up 51%,
topping Wall Street expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara, Calif., company also predicted a 10%-to-15% rise
in orders for its fiscal third quarter. The double dose of good news
came after the markets closed and boosted the company's shares to
$27.95 in after-hours trading. They had risen $1.06 to $26.64 in
regular Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Applied Materials said it earned $52 million, or 3 cents a share,
in the quarter ended April 28, compared with $318 million, or 19
cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street had expected earnings of 2 cents a share, according to
a survey of 27 analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell to $1.16 billion from $2.14 billion.</TE>
<TE>   New orders, the most-watched business indicator for chip equipment
makers such as Applied, rose to $1.69 billion from $1.12 billion in
the first quarter, topping Wall Street expectations, which peaked at
$1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a moderate recovery, driven by strong consumer-
related demand and a strengthening wireless market in Europe and
Asia," Applied Materials Chief Executive James Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Factories that make chips for advanced electronics are approaching
their limits, Morgan said, leading to a jump in investment in
advanced production tools.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some segments of the economy, such as telecommunications
and information technology spending, are lagging, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, orders grew strongly. The company said 21 customers
placed orders in the second quarter in excess of $10 million,
compared with 11 customers in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings reports Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Associates International Inc. reported a $238-million
fiscal fourth-quarter loss, the sixth consecutive quarter the company
failed to turn a profit. But the Islandia, N.Y.-based software firm
raised its estimates for the current quarter and for all of fiscal
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The loss for the quarter ended March 31, which amounted to 41
cents a share, was smaller than the year-earlier shortfall of $410
million, or 71 cents a share. Revenue rose 6% to $772 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company, whose accounting remains under inquiry by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, reported its earnings under
generally accepted accounting principles, dropping the controversial
pro forma method seen in its previous reports.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, the company broke even, compared with a
year-earlier loss of 29 cents a share. The results were better than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Sciences Corp. of El Segundo said it had a fiscal
fourth-quarter profit of $141.1 million after it cut expenses and won
more contracts with the U.S. government. Net income in the quarter
ended March 29 was 82 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $37.4
million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenue at the third- largest
seller of computer services rose 5.1% to $3.05 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Interplay Entertainment Corp., a struggling Irvine video game
developer, posted its first quarterly profit in more than two years.
Interplay earned $1.5 million, or 2 cents a share, in the first
quarter, contrasted with a loss of $8.4 million, or 30 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue declined 8% to $15.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   * I/OMagic Corp., a Santa Ana developer of optical storage and
related products, reported first-quarter net income of $1 million, or
1 cent a share, contrasted with a net loss of $2.1 million, or 3
cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to $26.7 million from $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   * STM Wireless Inc. in Irvine posted a loss of $2.2 million, or 30
cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of
$764,000, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Revenue declined 8% to $5.7
million.</TE>

<HD>ILM Feeling the Effects of Digital Filmmaking</HD>
<DH>Lucas shop revamps for high-definition cameras</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In a pivotal scene in "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones,"
the artists of special effects giant Industrial Light &amp; Magic were
called upon to create a massive Roman-style amphitheater for the
execution of the film's heroes.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, they relied on traditional methods, carving a miniature
version out of foam blocks and painting in the details by hand. But
construction flaws were picked up by the high-definition digital
cameras that director and ILM owner George Lucas used for the film.</LD>
<LD>   That forced ILM to go back and explore new technology and methods
to match the standards of digital filmmaking--a costly process of
trial and error that the company repeated scores of times while
creating "Episode II."</LD>
<TE>   "We had to revamp what we do from the ground up," said Jim Morris,
president of Lucas Digital Ltd., the parent company of ILM.</TE>
<TE>   Hailed as the grandfather of modern movie magic, Industrial Light
&amp; Magic has found itself in a period of profound change for its
technology and day-to-day business.</TE>
<TE>   The company, born out of the original "Star Wars," has been among
the first to feel the financial and technological effects of the
digital revolution in filmmaking, thanks to the latest "Star Wars"
chapter that starts Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The evolution of digital film production--as computers replace the
traditional photochemical process--has forced ILM and the effects
industry as a whole to rethink nearly everything it does, from the
paint it uses to the computers it buys.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a key transition for the privately held company.
Though the company says it has been consistently profitable over the
years, the changes are coming on the heels of last year's business
triple-whammy: A potential actors' strike, the dot-com advertising
bust and a general economic slump after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks led to a short-term workload slump for all of Hollywood's
digital effects players.</TE>
<TE>   Rival company Digital Domain, based in Venice, has cut its staff
over the last few years. Walt Disney Co. said it will close its
effects unit, Secret Lab, by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   ILM, the largest special effects shop in the business, plans to
shutter its TV commercials unit, ILM CP, by the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the slump, the competition remains fierce. Smaller,
scrappier rivals who rely on cheap and powerful personal-computer
tools are nibbling away at the edges of the empires of the large
effects houses that once dominated the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, we could take advantage of our scale. Now, everything's
extremely competitive," said Gail Currey, vice president and chief
operating officer of ILM. "It's not an easy transition we're making.
But to keep everyone happy and working, it's the transition we need
to make."</TE>
<TE>   Shop Has Tied Its Fate to Latest Technologies</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time ILM has had to reinvent itself. From its
renegade roots of building battleships to fly across a Van Nuys
airplane hangar, to the modern-day ascension of giving birth to
virtual dinosaurs and talking robots, ILM has tied its fate to the
latest technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1970s, Lucas landed a deal to shoot the original "Star
Wars." Looking for a workshop to handle the special effects, he was
shocked to realize that none existed. At the time, studios had scaled
back their effects teams to skeleton crews.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas decided to fund his own shop. He hired John Dykstra, a young
designer who had experimented with cameras controlled by a computer,
to put together the original ILM team and located them in the only
place they could find that was cheap and spacious--an abandoned
airplane hangar near Van Nuys Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The work was expensive, and Lucas dropped millions of dollars into
the fledgling company to bolster it during its early years.</TE>
<TE>   With the box office success of "Star Wars," Lucas opted to expand
ILM and relocated it closer to his offices in Northern California.
Today, ILM sits disguised as a series of garages and office buildings
that still boast the name of its previous owner, "The Kerner Co.,
Optical Research Lab."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, light sabers and a human-size Darth Vader suit line the
hallways. When the original "Star Wars" trilogy craze reached its
peak, fans routinely showed up at ILM's doors and rummaged through
the company's trash.</TE>
<TE>   As the years passed and computer technology evolved, ILM expanded
its portfolio of tools.</TE>
<TE>   Creatures from the first trilogy were made with bulky costumes and
clay miniatures. Today, computers rule the back lot. Hundreds of ILM
digital artists, modeling gurus and computer programmers slaved for
months on "Episode II," transforming hours of computer images into a
seamless, lush world populated by unearthly creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,000 visual effects shots that make up "Episode II," a
mere 100 remained untouched by ILM's effects crew.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a digital movie with guest human appearances," Morris
said. "No one's done that before."</TE>
<TE>   Digital Process Costly but Beneficial</TE>
<TE>   The process of digital filmmaking proved to be harder than it
sounded. Company officials declined to discuss ILM's financial
specifics and would not talk about how much their work on "Episode
II" cost.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the process was clearly expensive, as the project was riddled
with unexpected problems, starting with data management. As scenes
were shot, staff would transfer the digital images into a massive
computer database. Within weeks, millions of images cluttered the
database and workers were confounded. Trying to find a specific scene
became impossible.</TE>
<TE>   ILM staff had to create a software program that helped workers
track particular scenes as they made their way through the production
process.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there also were unexpected benefits, such as the process of
viewing the daily rushes. Typically, filmmakers will send the footage
shot each day out to a processing lab. After the film has been
developed, the footage is returned.</TE>
<TE>   It's a time-consuming process, one that is nearly eradicated with
high-definition cameras. The reason is simple: What you see on a
digital camera is what you get.</TE>
<TE>   "It saved a lot of time," said Andy Hendrickson, senior technology
officer at ILM. "In our business, time is money."</TE>
<TE>   Such financial shortcuts bolster an industry in which profit
margins are paper-thin and competition is intense.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every film, television show, commercial and music video
requires some sort of electronic modification. For many of these
projects, the job is relatively small, such as clearing up the
complexion of a starlet or erasing a boom mike that accidentally
dropped into the camera's view.</TE>
<TE>   The availability of powerful PC tools has enabled smaller shops,
which can under-bid big houses such as ILM, to go after these low-end
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Competitors spring up like dandelions," said Richard Edlund,
visual effects guru who worked at ILM during the early "Star Wars"
films. "You can get into the business with a checkbook. You can buy
off-the-shelf hardware and software and start working."</TE>
<TE>   Smaller duties come with a smaller price tag, and no need for
ILM's expensive expertise. Filling the gap is an expansive boutique
industry in Southern California, where such companies as Hammerhead
Productions in the San Fernando Valley employ digital artists who can
work for cheap from home.</TE>
<TE>   ILM's abandonment of its TV commercials venture was a rare defeat
for a company that has set the pace. At one time, the unit brought in
20% of the company's annual revenue, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being the electronic answer for all Hollywood projects,
ILM says it has focused on larger, flashier projects, giving the
smaller jobs less priority.</TE>
<TE>   Even on this front, it faces new rivals hungry for glory,
including New Zealand's WETA, which worked on "The Lord of the Rings"
series, and Bay Area-based Escape, which is working on "The Matrix"
trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   But ILM has its own blockbusters in the works. As "Episode II"
finished, the company already was involved with projects, including
the "Hulk," "Men in Black 2" and "Terminator 3" films.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, it will begin work on "Star Wars: Episode III" and may
face new hurdles as the digital stakes are raised again.</TE>

<HD>Former Auditor Says Legal Fears Spurred Shredding</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-partner of accounting firm Andersen partner
testifies about decision to detroy documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Former Arthur Andersen partner David B. Duncan testified Tuesday that
he orchestrated a document-shredding effort Oct. 23 after listening
in on an analyst conference call and realizing his firm could become
a target for lawsuits and investigations as Enron Corp. collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting firm, on trial in U.S. District Court in Houston,
is charged with obstruction of justice for the destruction of
Enron-related documents. Prosecutors have pointed to an Oct. 12
e-mail sent by an Andersen lawyer, Nancy Temple, to partners in
Houston as the trigger for the destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Temple's e-mail said it would be "helpful" for the partners to
comply with the document policy, which prosecutors contend was a
coded signal to start shredding.</LD>
<TE>   But Duncan said he didn't act immediately on the e-mail--a
disclosure that could provide an opening for Andersen's defense
lawyers. Duncan said the notion of launching a team-wide shredding
effort didn't strike him until Oct. 23, after listening in on an
Enron conference call in which Wall Street analysts blasted Enron's
murky financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, Duncan said he
ordered the effort "to not have a lot of extraneous material ...
laying around for others to discover. In the event of civil
litigation or an investigation, things that were not part of the
final [audit file] could be taken out of context [and] used against
the firm."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice last month
and is cooperating with the Justice Department, said he did not
believe he was committing a crime when he initiated the destruction.
He said he realized later that, in fact, he did believe in October
that "it was a good time" to destroy Enron-related records because of
the energy giant's escalating problems and that he pleaded guilty
because he wanted to "take responsibility for those actions."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's credibility is a pivotal issue in the case because he is
expected to be the only Andersen executive to admit to directing
others to shred files. Prosecutors have told the jury that, under the
law, Duncan's actions can be ascribed to the entire Andersen firm.
Andersen contends the 43-year-old auditor didn't technically violate
the law and pleaded guilty under government pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, Andersen's attorney, said outside the courtroom that
Duncan "was trying to do what was right" by complying with the firm's
document-retention policy, which requires keeping memos and other
records to back up an auditor's conclusions and the destruction of
drafts and other files deemed unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel sorry for him," Hardin said. "You listen to that and
you think, 'How in the world did we end up here?' [Duncan's] life is
in shambles because of something he didn't think was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, testifying for a second day, said he first huddled with
three other partners working on the Enron account Oct. 23 and then
instructed his assistant to gather the rest of Andersen's Enron
team--which worked in Enron's headquarters--and told the 20 or so
managers to "endeavor to come into compliance" with the policy. He
said the fact that compliance included destruction of certain records
"was generally understood."</TE>
<TE>   He said he started going through his desk files and e-mail for
draft memos and other such records.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw people cleaning out their office areas and I saw people
shredding documents," he said, noting that he had never seen such a
destruction effort on a team-wide basis.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he did not receive any instructions to cease
destruction or suspend the firm's policy as Enron's meltdown
intensified. Barely a week after Duncan reminded his subordinates
about the policy, Enron received a second letter from the Securities
and Exchange Commission requesting information about accounting for
some transactions.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Andersen had been evaluating Enron's books and
concluded in early November that a partnership called Chewco had been
improperly kept off the energy trader's balance sheet, Duncan said.
Andersen received an SEC subpoena Nov. 9. Partners in Houston were
told to stop shredding documents.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Duncan testified about his firm's increasing concern
about legal and regulatory actions. He said he knew that audit
questions arising from the firm's Enron work could be perilous
because Andersen was under an injunction not to violate accounting
rules after audit failures related to its work with Waste Management
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also recounted occasions when Temple asked him to remove
her name or other data from memos about Enron's finances, saying she
did not want to become a witness in potential litigation.</TE>

<HD>Movies Imitate Disney's Parks</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Its studios build on classic theme park
attractions as it seeks to reclaim its reputation as a leader in
family movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood has a long tradition of looking outside itself for raw
material, drawing on sources including novels, plays, comic books,
television shows and video games.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's turning to theme parks.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co. is developing three movies based on classic theme
park attractions, adding a new twist to an idea the company exploited
half a century ago.</LD>
<TE>   The movies, "The Country Bears," "Pirates of the Caribbean" and
"Haunted Mansion," are inspired by the iconic Disneyland attractions
and will be released this year and next.</TE>
<TE>   The movies mark both a new chapter in the history of film and a
new strategy for Disney, which until now has modeled its theme park
rides and shows mainly on its own movies, from "Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs" to "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney built Disneyland in 1955 as a physical home for the
cartoon characters he and his animators created on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Walt's idea of synergy or cross-promotion, which other media
companies now mimic, reaches new heights in the upcoming movies. The
titles will be already familiar to millions of Americans who've
visited Disney's parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, providing
Disney with a ready-made audience at a time when studios are
competing fiercely to market their movies.</TE>
<TE>   And by shining the light back on the company's classic
attractions, the movies also will help promote Disney's theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   "This just seemed to be so natural that we'd be crazy not to
pursue it," said Disney Studios Chief Dick Cook. "These are Disney
icons. They just lend themselves to movies."</TE>
<TE>   Cook should know. The studio executive began his 31-year career at
Disney as a ride operator, and his wife once worked the Country Bears
Jamboree show in Anaheim. "These films are the definition of the kind
of films we want to do," he said. Disney may produce more such movies
if the first three are successful, Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   His experiment comes as Disney is testing new waters to improve
its box-office performance with more family-oriented fare tied to the
company's roots. Disney, challenged by rival hits such as "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of the Rings" is
seeking to reclaim its reputation as a leader in family movies.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's new strategy also underscores how movies increasingly are
becoming vehicles to market products, from video games to cars, film
historians said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous paucity of new ideas today," said Rick
Jewell, associate dean of the School of Cinema-Television at USC.
"The studios are not willing to take enough chances with new
material."</TE>
<TE>   Company executives dismiss that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be no point in making these movies if you didn't
think they had the right to exist on their own terms, otherwise
they'd be commercials, not movies," said Disney Studios Production
Chief Nina Jacobson. "The truth is Walt was one of the greatest minds
of the 20th century and there are reasons why these rides are so
popular and people remember them. If you have access to this great
cultural iconography, there's no shame in going back to it."</TE>
<TE>   Though Disney produced a made-for-TV movie in 1997 based on the
Tower of Terror attraction at Disney MGM Studios in Orlando, the
studio has never developed a feature film out of one of its theme
park attractions.</TE>
<TE>   That will change with "Country Bears," a live-action musical
comedy based on the animatronic bears that have been fixtures at the
Country Bear Jamboree at Walt Disney World in Orlando since 1971.
Disneyland closed a similar attraction last year before the studio
decided to make the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The $30-million movie, which debuts July 26, tells the story of a
legendary Southern rock band reuniting to save the legendary Country
Bear Hall. Actor Christopher Walken plays a greedy banker who is
about to foreclose on the concert hall. The bears were designed by
Jim Henson's Creature Shop and dance to original songs by John Hiatt.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three movies, "Country Bears" is the most faithful to the
attraction, said director Peter Hastings. "You're building on a huge
fan base because millions of people have visited the Country Bears in
Florida and at Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Chernov and Andrew Gunn are producing the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn also is producing "Haunted Mansion" with Don Hahn, who also
produced "The Lion King." The movie is loosely based on the Haunted
Mansion attraction originally built at Disneyland in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "Haunted Mansion," which premieres late next year, stars Eddie
Murphy. He plays a father who encounters a ghost when he and his
family move into a haunted house.</TE>
<TE>   The third movie, "Pirates of the Caribbean," is a big-budget
"romantic action adventure" produced by high-profile filmmaker Jerry
Bruckheimer ("Pearl Harbor") with Clayton Townsend. The movie, set
for summer 2003, features a daring attempt to rescue someone from
dangerous pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to get involved in a pirate movie,"
Bruckheimer said. "[Pirates] was one of my favorite attractions
growing up."</TE>
<TE>   Bruckheimer expects the ride's popularity will give the movie a
lift. "You're bombarded with thousands of images trying to pull your
attention, from TV to video games," he said. "If you have something
people are interested in, it makes it much easier to get them out of
their living rooms and into theaters."</TE>
<TE>   The parks will help spread the word. To promote "Country Bears,"
for example, Disney World will plaster theatrical posters on trams,
billboards and buses throughout the resort and run trailers of the
movie on hotel televisions.</TE>
<TE>   And the movies should give the attractions a lift.</TE>
<TE>   "It does help raise awareness for our attractions," said Walt
Disney Parks and Resorts spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Ross, USC professor of film and popular culture, agrees.
"How can it not help them?" he asked. "They're getting all this free
advertising."</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Sets New 'Core Profit' Measure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Responding to deepening skepticism about the way many companies
report their financial performance, Standard &amp; Poor's introduced a
new benchmark Tuesday designed to more accurately gauge corporate
earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new "core earnings" measure, the 10,000 U.S. firms
analyzed by S&amp;P will have some revenue that they now use to boost
profits--such as pension fund gains--stripped away.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the lucrative stock options that corporations typically
grant to their executives will be deducted from earnings because S&amp;P
believes that will help provide a better yardstick of the costs
companies incur to pay their top managers.</LD>
<TE>   The result of the changes, in the near term, is that many
companies will appear to be less profitable--boosting share
price-to-earnings ratios. That could add to worries that stocks are
overvalued.</TE>
<TE>   But S&amp;P, whose research is considered more independent than that
of major brokerages, said declining investor confidence in the wake
of numerous accounting scandals pointed to a need for more accurate
reporting.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing changes, investors will lose more and more faith in
the stock market," said David Blitzer, S&amp;P's chief investment
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P's new measure of core earnings--also referred to as
"operating" earnings--will exclude gains and losses on asset sales,
unrealized gains or losses from hedging activities, fees related to
mergers and acquisitions, and legal settlements.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P President Leo O'Neill said the firm won't lobby for its core
earnings measure to be mandated by regulators, but is willing to
discuss the system with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In one example of how S&amp;P's measure will change corporate results,
General Electric Co.'s per share earnings for 2001 were reported at
$1.41 excluding an accounting charge, but S&amp;P now calculates the
conglomerate's core earnings at $1.11--a 21% difference.</TE>
<TE>   GE spokesman David Frail said S&amp;P's new standard departs from
generally accepted accounting principles and raises questions about
whether the method "can serve to clarify or whether it's going to
confuse things further" for investors.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Says He Issued Warning to Enron</HD>
<DH>Energy: Writer of memo about the company's rigging of the
California electricity market will testify that he questioned
legality of the practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The outside lawyer who wrote a memo detailing the ways Enron Corp.
was manipulating California's energy market warned the company that
it might be breaking the law, says the statement he plans to deliver
to Congress today.</LD>
<LD>   After receiving the memo in early December 2000, an Enron staff
attorney said he ordered an end to the trading practices, states his
statement to a Senate committee investigating price manipulation in
Western energy markets.</LD>
<LD>   Late Tuesday, the attorneys general of California, Oregon and
Washington sent the committee documents subpoenaed from Enron's major
electricity trading floor in Portland, Ore. The documents describe
Enron's trading strategies and "provide strong confirmation that West
Coast energy markets were harmed by price manipulations," California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing was called last week after federal energy regulators
released copies of internal Enron memos written during California's
energy crisis. One memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, detailed trading ploys
used by Enron that in at least one instance "may have contributed" to
a statewide power shortage.</TE>
<TE>   As the lawyers who wrote and received the now-infamous Enron memos
prepared to testify before the Senate subcommittee on consumer
affairs, the chairman of another Senate panel investigating Enron's
collapse said his inquiry has raised questions about whether federal
energy regulators "heeded important warning signs" that left
consumers unprotected from potential energy market abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, made his comments in a sharply
critical letter to Pat Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, on the eve of congressional hearings today on
Enron's strategies to drive up electricity prices during California's
power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC's job is not simply to promote market changes, but to
anticipate and monitor new developments and problems and to protect
the consumer against abuse," Lieberman said. "That latter role seems
to have been neglected."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman was critical of a May 2001 FERC investigation of Enron's
electronic trading activities that he said asked "some of the right
questions ... but ultimately settled for incomplete, unconvincing or
incorrect answers."</TE>
<TE>   The four lawyers who wrote the trading memos released last week
and the Enron lawyer who received the memos, which detail a
smorgasbord of trading strategies to boost profit in the California
market, are expected to explain how the documents came to be written
and how they were received by Enron, then the world's largest energy
trader.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Hall was an attorney with law firm Stoel Rives in October
2000 when he was asked by Enron to research the company's trading
practices. Hall said he found the techniques to be deceptive and
delivered his report--along with copies of California's criminal
statutes on fraud and theft--to a corporate official, according to
testimony expected to be delivered today.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, who subsequently went to work for Enron's trading operation
and is employed by the new owner of that business, UBS Warburg, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, in his statement, said his supervising partner delivered the
copies of the criminal statutes because he "wanted it to be clear to
Enron that deceptive practices could constitute violations not only
of ISO rules but also possibly of criminal statutes." ISO refers to
the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid and operates an electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   "As I learned about Enron's trading practices, I became
increasingly concerned," he said. "In the course of my discussions
with traders, I became aware that certain of these trading strategies
involved deception."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, one strategy dubbed Load Shift appeared to
involve submitting schedules to the ISO that intentionally overstated
or understated the load in different zones to cause the ISO to make
payments to relieve the supposed congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "As I learned of deceptive practices, I advised the traders with
whom I spoke that such practices were deceptive and that they should
stop such practices immediately," he said. "I also attended meetings
in which Enron traders provided assurances that such practices had
been discontinued."</TE>
<TE>   Hall said he e-mailed the memo to Enron's in-house counsel and
outside litigation counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Tuesday by the attorneys general include
handwritten notes from company meetings in early October 2000 that
describe trading and public relations strategies to address
investigations. "Can they tell how much money we're making?" said
one. Another note said the range of public positions stretched from
"answer questions, say nothing" to "answer questions, finger others."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said the notes describe comments by Tim Belden, head of
Enron's West Coast trading operations. One document referred to
British Columbia's electric utility and Tulsa-based Williams Cos. as
"hogs at trough." California sued those two companies alleging
overcharges in the state's markets.</TE>
<TE>   Richard B. Sanders, a senior Enron attorney, said in a statement
to the committee that although he was not confident the Hall memo was
accurate, he "directed that certain trading practices described
therein be suspended."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said he then authorized outside counsel from another firm
to review the Hall memo and trading practices and to write another
memo "so that I could provide appropriate legal advice to the
company." That follow-up memo disputed some findings of the first.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's panel is probing whether the government could have
done more to prevent Enron's collapse, but his letter is likely to
come up at the two hearings planned today by other Senate committees
investigating price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply cannot accept anything less than proactive and
energetic efforts by FERC to understand, monitor and, where
necessary, regulate changing market developments," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he could not conclude that a more proactive FERC
inquiry would have sounded the alarm about Enron's shaky financial
condition, "a better investigation may well have exposed the cracks
in Enron's foundation sooner."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Business Likes Cuba, but Obstacles Remain</HD>

<LD>Former President Carter spoke of human rights in Cuba, but Fidel
Castro would much rather have talked turkey--the poultry kind--along
with chickens, eggs, beans and other agricultural produce.</LD>
<LD>   Castro's government, 43 years in power, is eager to talk of U.S.
foodstuffs and medical equipment. And U.S. companies are just as
eager to talk business because Cuba's educated population and
tradition of achievement in medicine could make it an important
market, once Castro and his Communist government leave.</LD>
<LD>   However, that promise may take some time to be realized. The Bush
administration opposes a broad opening of economic relations with
Cuba. And Castro, now 75, appears to be going strong. Only last month
he regaled Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a group of this state's
agricultural and business officials for five hours at a dinner in
Havana.</LD>
<TE>   Castro said the Cuban government wanted to purchase 10,000 tons of
California chicken, worth about $3.6 million. He in- quired about the
protein content of California poultry and the state's abundant bean
crop.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba has been on a buying spree in U.S. farm circles. Since
November, the island nation has purchased $70 million worth of
chickens from half a dozen states, plus eggs from Massachusetts, rice
from Texas and soybeans, corn and wheat from Illinois and eight other
Midwestern states. In all, Cuba buys foodstuffs from 27 states,
building up a strong base of support in Congress for ending the U.S.
trade embargo on Cuba, which allows only sales of food and medicine
on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   And Havana's buying policies are having some effect. Today 40
members of Congress, evenly divided between Republicans and
Democrats, are expected to offer their suggestions to improve
relations with Cuba. The group's recommendations will include lifting
the travel ban that pre- vents most U.S. citizens from vacationing in
Cuba and allowing U.S. banks and financial insti- tutions to provide
credit for transactions with Cuba, which now must be done on a strict
cash basis.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration is not likely to heed the congres-
sional recommendations. After initially accusing Cuba of export- ing
biotechnology that could be used by terrorists, a State Depart- ment
official said Tuesday that the U.S. has no evidence that Cuba is
exporting weapons material or making weapons of its own.</TE>
<TE>   The administration removed a clause from the recently passed farm
bill that would have opened the way for Cuba to get credit from U.S.
banks. And the president is expected to give Cuba a cold shoulder
when he speaks Monday on policy toward the island nation, says Philip
Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va.,
think tank. "He'll probably call for tightening the travel ban,"
Peters says.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, U.S. business remains eager for commercial ties with
Cuba. Archer-Daniels- Midland Corp. led agribusiness executives,
including Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, on a mission to Cuba in
February. Two years ago, a commercial fair in Havana on
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment drew 350 represen- tatives of
97 U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   The level of interest is unusual for an ostensibly poor country of
11million people and annual economic output of only $17billion--about
4% of the economic output of Mexico. But Cuba is different in the
eyes of many U.S. businesspeople. They see its economy as tethered
now by Communist rule but capable of doing much better once economic
liberalization comes post-Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Businesspeople point to Cuba's high levels of education and its
medical establishment, which supplied physicians to the Soviet bloc
and to impoverished countries of Africa and is capable of collab-
orating with Britain's Glaxo- SmithKline Corp. and the Uni- versity
of Mexico on developing vaccines against cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. business community is impressed with the growing number
of entrepreneurs who survive in the Cuban system, running restaurants
in their apartments and similar small businesses. If the levels of
actual business done so far are meager, well, there are obstacles,
say U.S. businesspeople. For example, despite the large turnout at
the Havana medical fair in 2000, not much business has resulted
"because the lack of available credit makes U.S. drugs and medical
equipment too expensive," says John Kavulich II, head of the
U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a New York-based group that
maintains research on Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   So what is the outlook? Probably more of the same. There will be
growing sentiment in Congress, pushed by agricultural and business
interests, to expand trade and tourism with Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. business community believes that greater contact with
Americans and with American dollars, in tips to waiters and taxi
drivers, will have the liberating effect such dollars had in Eastern
bloc societies in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   In that placid view, reflected this week in comments by Carter in
Cuba, the Bush administration's objections to opening trade relations
are based on appealing to the traditional anti-Castro politics of the
Cuban exile communities in Miami and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there is the dark possibility that Castro and
his armed forces are miscalculating--as they did with Soviet missiles
in the 1960s--and dabbling in biological weaponry. If so, the con-
sequences for Cuba and its people would be terrible.</TE>
<TE>   So in the wake of Carter's highly publicized visit, it would be a
good sign if Castro continues to focus on talking turkey.</TE>

<HD>Homestore.com Reports Loss of $34.8 Million for Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc., the largest source of for-sale home listings on
the Internet, on Tuesday reported a net loss of $34.8 million in the
first quarter on revenue of $74.1million.</LD>
<LD>   The loss for the three-month period was much smaller than the
$99.8-million loss the company reported during the same quarter last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding discontinued operations, the Westlake Village-based
company would have reported a loss of $35.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   Homestore.com shares fell 5cents Tuesday to $2.23 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com has struggled in recent months. Top managers
resigned after the company disclosed that its revenue had been
overstated by as much as $45 million during 2000 and as much as
$113million in the first three quarters of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The first quarter was challenging for Homestore as management
resources were diverted by the internal inquiry into our past
accounting practices and our thorough review of our business units,"
Homestore Chief Executive Mike Long said. "We have made progress in
these first 120 days in realigning our resources and focusing on our
customers and core products and services."</TE>

<HD>Markets Soar on Sales Report</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Strength of retail data boosts indexes, a sign
that investors are losing their fears about recession or stagnation,
analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors on Tuesday made a dramatic turn back to believing that the
U.S. economy is on a solid growth track, driving stock prices, bond
yields and the dollar all sharply higher.</LD>
<LD>   A surprisingly strong government report on April retail sales
helped restore flagging confidence in the economy's prospects,
analysts said. The Commerce Department said total April retail sales
rose 1.2%, the biggest advance since October and double the increase
economists had expected.</LD>
<LD>   The news helped reignite bullish sentiment on Wall Street, where
battered stock prices rocketed last Wednesday, only to give up much
of their gains Thursday and Friday before rallying again Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials leaped 188.48 points, or 1.9%, to
10,298.14, building on Monday's advance of almost 170 points.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which jumped 3.2%
on Monday, shot up 4% on Tuesday, gaining 66.51 points to 1,719.05.</TE>
<TE>   After regular trading ended, Applied Materials, the world's
biggest maker of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, said orders
soared in the quarter ended April 28, further stoking hopes for the
depressed tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   Though stocks' rally of the last two days has just returned major
indexes to their levels of three or four weeks ago, some analysts
said the combined action in stocks, bonds and the dollar this week
suggests that investors are rapidly losing their fears about the
economy sinking back into recession or stagnation. Those fears helped
fuel a deep sell-off in stocks in April.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a new recognition that the economy is going to be
OK," said James Glassman, economist at J.P. Morgan Chase Securities
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, which has been sinking in value against key currencies
since early April as some foreign investors have soured on the U.S.
economy's outlook, resurged Tuesday. The euro fell to 90.3 U.S. cents
from 91.2 cents Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations of healthy economic growth drove Treasury bond yields
higher, with the 10-year T-note ending at 5.28%, up from 5.22% on
Monday and the highest since April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Energy prices also jumped, with near-term crude oil futures in New
York rising 98 cents to $29.36 a barrel, highest since September.</TE>
<TE>   After trading ended, the American Petroleum Institute said U.S.
crude inventories fell 7.4 million barrels last week, far exceeding
the 2.5-million-barrel decline analysts had expected, according to
Reuters. The rundown in oil supplies stems from continuing strong
demand even as major exporters have cut production, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Though rising energy prices normally might be viewed in a bearish
light on Wall Street, they are another sign that the recovery remains
on track, optimists say.</TE>
<TE>   In April many investors had begun to fear that the economy was
grinding to a halt, said Steven Wieting, economist at Salomon Smith
Barney in New York. But a barrage of data in the last two weeks has
pointed to continuing strength in consumer spending and a possible
revival of corporate spending.</TE>
<TE>   Wieting describes the economy as "weak but healing, [rather than]
strong and faltering."</TE>
<TE>   It was computer networker Cisco Systems' earnings report that
helped fuel a 7.8% jump in the Nasdaq composite index last Wednesday,
after Cisco expressed cautious optimism about demand.</TE>
<TE>   Applied Materials' strong report Tuesday on new orders could help
keep the tech rally alive in the near term, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are wanting to put more money to work" in stocks that
could benefit from a growing economy, said Ed Nicoski, analyst at
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   For most of this year many investors have shunned tech stocks,
fearing that earnings of those companies aren't primed to rebound
soon because corporate spending remains depressed. The Nasdaq index
still is down 12% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors have been eager buyers of stocks in many
consumer-dependent industries whose outlooks remain upbeat. Shares of
home builders and consumer-products giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble
have been big winners, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders continued to gain Tuesday, along with stocks of
major retailers. But tech stocks ruled the day, led by such sectors
as software and electronic equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors remain suspicious of tech shares. Winners topped
losers by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq on Tuesday, but trading volume
was moderate after adjusting for the record activity in WorldCom
shares.</TE>
<TE>   A major issue is basic valuation: Tech stocks still are highly
valued relative to expected 2002 and 2003 earnings. And investors
have grown weary of the many short-lived tech rallies of the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Nicoski said the action in tech shares over the last week
suggests that some investors are beginning to hunt for relative
bargains in the sector, given rising confidence in the economy
overall.</TE>

<HD>Napster's Collapse Nears as Funds Fade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc., the Bay Area start-up that brought online music piracy
to the masses, teetered on the brink of bankruptcy Tuesday as it
struggled to transform itself from industry outlaw to ally. Company
founder Shawn Fanning and two other top executives resigned, and the
company told employees it was insolvent after a deal with global
media conglomerate Bertelsmann collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Barring the arrival of any last-minute funding, people close to
Napster expect the company to seek bankruptcy protection within days.</LD>
<LD>   Napster's demise would leave the major record labels and music
publishers, which sued it for copyright infringement, trying to
collect damages for the billions of unauthorized copies of songs that
Napster users made. But the music industry wouldn't be left
empty-handed: It still has two appeals court rulings that effectively
outlaw networks such as Napster's.</LD>
<TE>   Bertelsmann, which lent Napster at least $85 million to help
develop a legitimate version of its service, might end up with the
company's assets if it goes into bankruptcy protection. And if it
does, it's likely to resurrect the Napster brand with a fee-based
service that compensates the music industry for its works.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing appeared imminent after Napster's board
missed a Monday deadline to sell just its assets to Bertelsmann, a
major investor in Napster said.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Conway, whose investment fund has poured more than $1 million
into Napster, blamed "self-serving, greedy, out-of-control egos" for
the collapse of the latest talks.</TE>
<TE>   Conway said the failure of the venture capitalists on the board to
strike the deal meant not only that Napster's shareholders would be
stranded but that its 70 employees also would lose their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a bankruptcy, Bertelsmann isn't guaranteed to walk
off with Napster's assets because the labels and publishers still
want to be paid, said attorneys Carey Ramos and Jeffrey Knowles, who
represented various music publishers in the lawsuit against Napster.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's developments were the latest in a series of setbacks for
the Redwood City-based company, a pioneer in online file sharing that
has yet to profit from the innovations of its 21-year-old founder.
Fanning was 18 when he wrote the code that powers Napster.</TE>
<TE>   The company's free service skyrocketed in popularity two years
ago, drawing tens of millions of consumers with easy-to-use software
that let them copy songs from each others' computers through the
Internet. But the music industry's copyright-infringement lawsuit
eventually crippled the service, and Napster couldn't win the
licenses it wanted from the major labels to launch a legitimate
subscription offering.</TE>
<TE>   Napster's demise won't stem the rise of music piracy: Several
other online file-sharing networks have emerged that are attracting
even larger global audiences. Instead, it exemplifies how slow the
major labels have been to fight piracy in the marketplace with
fundamentally different approaches to distributing music.</TE>
<TE>   Indicating that it had not given up hope of reviving Napster,
Bertelsmann said, "We are hopeful that Napster's brand and technology
will be able to realize its potential as a compelling consumer
proposition."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann had offered to buy Napster for $16.5 million, but a
dispute erupted among the closely held company's shareholders over
the price and over how the spoils would be divided.</TE>
<TE>   Silicon Valley venture capital firm Hummer Winblad had the right
to take more of the sale money out first under the terms of its May
2000 agreement to invest in Napster. Fanning's uncle, John Fanning,
who had incorporated the company the previous year and served as its
chairman, rallied other investors to negotiate for a bigger slice of
what Bertelsmann was willing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Fanning ultimately lost that fight, with a Delaware
judge ruling Tuesday against Fanning's attempt to seize control of
Napster's board. In the meantime, however, Hummer Winblad's
representatives on the board rejected Bertelsmann's offer to buy all
the company's stock, insisting that Bertelsmann indemnify them
personally in case they were held liable for Napster's past
infringements, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann then offered to buy Napster's assets and pay off some
of its debts as part of a prepackaged bankruptcy plan that would have
left Hummer Winblad and other shareholders empty-handed. When the
board failed to act on that offer, Bertelsmann withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   The board's failure to accept either offer prompted Konrad
Hilbers, Napster's chief executive and a former Bertelsmann
executive, to resign Tuesday, along with Jonathan Schwartz, its chief
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The likely end of Napster Inc. as an independent company cuts
short one of the most audacious experiments in the history of
commerce. From its beginnings in Massachusetts, Napster was attacked
as an illegal aid to those who wanted free music. Yet at the height
of the Internet boom, it managed to attract more than $15million in
funding from Hummer Winblad and other professional investors who saw
the potential for a giant payoff if Napster withstood the industry's
assault or negotiated a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   With that help, Fanning's dorm-room inspiration became one of the
fastest-growing Internet applications in history. But it also
provoked a war that's still raging between the entertainment and
technology industries, with now routine skirmishes in courtrooms and
on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The company wound down and eventually shut off its free service in
response to federal court orders. Yet its successors learned from
Napster's experience, many of them basing themselves in other
countries and using less centralized systems harder to shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Before and after Bertelsmann's investment, Napster came close to
striking a deal with the major record labels that won round after
round against it in federal court. Both sides blame each other for
the collapse of the earliest talks.</TE>

<HD>4 Accused of Bilking Banks of $1 Billion</HD>
<DH>Courts: The men are suspected of running a worldwide metals
trading scam. Two Southland institutions are among the victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A global metals trading scam allegedly swindled up to $1 billion from
banks ranging from giants like FleetBoston Financial Corp. and J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. to two small Southland lenders, federal
prosecutors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bank officials and prosecutors expressed amazement at the scope
and subtlety of one of the largest bank frauds on record. According
to charges unsealed in a New York federal court, the scheme allegedly
cooked up by four men in New Jersey hoodwinked at least eight banks
into financing bogus metals shipments in India, Hong Kong and
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a very, very sophisticated operation," U.S. Atty. James
Comey said at a news conference in New York. "These folks lined up
people around the world, places that could only be reached by
rickshaw, to pose as metal traders."</LD>
<TE>   Comey estimated the loss at $600 million to $1 billion--enormous
as bank scams go but apparently not enough to jeopardize the
financial stability of any of the institutions.</TE>
<TE>   In the largest bank fraud on record, the villain was the
institution: Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International, which was shut
down by the United States, Britain and other countries in July 1991.
BCCI pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy after depositors'
losses reached $15 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In another big scam in 1996, a former Philip Morris Cos. employee
pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining a $350-million loan from a
group of seven banks by claiming he needed the financing for a
top-secret international project of the tobacco company. The
government recovered $200 million of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   The latest alleged scam also involved a group of banks, including
General Bank, operated by Los Angeles-based GBC Bancorp, and
Torrance-based Chinatrust (USA), a subsidiary of Taiwan's China Trust
Commercial Bank. The banks are part of a cluster of local banks
catering largely to ethnic Chinese customers. Executives at the banks
said their institutions got caught up in the fraud through their East
Coast offices.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged the four defendants concocted a global Ponzi
scheme, using New Jersey-based metals trading companies to take out
loans supposedly to pay metals suppliers and instead using it to
repay old debts or simply spending it. Because the old debts were
being repaid, the defendants' credit actually improved during much of
the scheme, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme allegedly involved forging thousands of documents,
creating "sham" collateral for loans and a paper trail of
transactions that never occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme began to unravel in September, when a J.P. Morgan
representative walked to the Manhattan offices of one of the
companies and found a door with a peephole--not a sophisticated
metals trading operation, Comey said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the banks learned only in the last month or last few days
that they lost money in the scheme, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the scam started in May 2000. But bank officials
said the operation began long before that.</TE>
<TE>   "These [metal trading] companies had been in business upwards of
10 years," said Li-Pei Wu, chairman of General Bank, which began
lending to the purported trading firms four years ago and had little
trouble getting repaid until early this year. GBC Bancorp has
$27million in potential exposure and already has set aside
$13.5million to cover losses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had been dealing with many larger banks around the world,"
Wu said. "If it's a scheme, it had been going on for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Chinatrust Chief Executive Henry W. Peng said his bank loaned the
alleged scam artists $8.8million but should recover $2million to
$3million because the bank has the mortgage on their New Jersey
office building.</TE>
<TE>   Primarily a real estate lender, Chinatrust considered the bogus
metals traders to be among its strongest commercial borrowers during
a five-year lending relationship, Peng said.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes me very frustrated, very shocked," he said. "They were
fabricating all the bills of lading, all the invoices."</TE>
<TE>   When loan payments stopped coming in last fall, the suspects first
blamed the global economic downturn that followed the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland banks' damages are small by comparison. Comey said
FleetBoston's loss totals $130million, and Fleet spokesman Jim
Mahoney said the firm will write off about $70million in the second
quarter. Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc., owner of
Pennsylvania's largest bank, already has taken a $50-million charge
to earnings, spokesman Brian Goerke said. J.P. Morgan reported a
relatively modest $2.7-million loss.</TE>
<TE>   In their complaint, prosecutors identified other banks that were
defrauded as KBC Bank, Hypovereinsbank, and Dresdner Bank
Lateinamerika. Comey said other banks may come forward to report
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The men named in the complaint are Narendra Kumar Rastogi, Anil
Anand, Manoj Nijhawan and Udha Shankar. Their metals trading
companies, based in Piscataway, N.J., included Allied Deals Inc.,
Hampton Lane Inc. and SAI Commodity Inc., prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Virendra Rastogi, the brother of Narendra Rastogi, was arrested
earlier this month in London while shredding documents at his small
metals trading company, RBG Resources, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The men appeared late Tuesday before Magistrate Judge James C.
Francis IV in New York. All remained in federal custody except for
Balakrishna, who was freed on $500,000 bail and placed on electronic
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Temkin, a lawyer for Rastogi, said, "Mr. Rastogi intends to
plead not guilty and will defend the case vigorously."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the other suspects did not immediately return
telephone messages.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, mail
fraud and wire fraud, each of the defendants could face a maximum
sentence of five years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Business Groups Protest Proposed Options Tax</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to assess payroll taxes on some types of stock options and
employee stock plans drew protests Tuesday from high-tech companies
and business groups, which said the proposed levy could lead many
businesses to cancel stock-option programs.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of the additional cost and complexities of compliance,
and because of the prospect of filing claims, soliciting employee
consents and restating payroll filings, some employers may decide not
to offer these important programs to their employees," Bill Blaylock,
a vice president and tax director with Texas Instruments Inc., told
Internal Revenue Service officials during a public hearing on the
proposed tax. He and nine other witnesses urged the IRS to withdraw
or delay the tax.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS proposed in November that gains from incentive stock
options and employee stock-purchase plans be subject to the same
Social Security, Medicare and unemployment taxes taken out of regular
paychecks.</LD>
<TE>   The tax, 15.3% in all, would be levied when employees cash in
stock options or buy stock at special discount prices through their
employer. Employees and employers would split the burden equally. A
congressional tax committee has estimated that it would raise $23
billion over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans have
mushroomed in popularity over the last decade as a low-cost way to
boost loyalty and spread wealth among employees.</TE>
<TE>   "This tax will disproportionately affect rank-and-file employees,"
said David Sherwood, benefits tax counsel for Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups said the tax would weigh heaviest on employees at
the lower end of the wage scale because they would pay a larger
percentage than those whose earnings exceed the Social Security cap
of $84,900.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses will be liable for the tax as of January 2003 unless
the IRS reconsiders, or Congress says otherwise.</TE>

<HD>Pilot's Arrest Adds to Screening Debate</HD>
<DH>Security: Union is pushing for 'smart-card' IDs for flight
crews to save them the indignity of public frisking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arrest of an American Airlines captain for allegedly assaulting a
security screener is intensifying the debate over whether airline
flight crews must endure the same heightened security checks as the
public.</LD>
<LD>   The incident in Hawaii last week followed the arrest of at least
one other pilot for alleged checkpoint skirmishes in recent months,
and industry crews and their unions are loudly complaining that crews
must empty their pockets, take off their shoes and otherwise be
searched.</LD>
<LD>   "It is insulting for pilots to be treated like criminals in full
view of the traveling public" given that "pilots are entrusted with
the lives of hundreds of passengers and an aircraft worth tens of
millions of dollars," John Darrah, president of the Allied Pilots
Assn., said Tuesday. The APA is the union of American's 11,500
pilots.</LD>
<TE>   The APA wants the new Transportation Security Administration,
which took over airport security after the Sept. 11 attacks, to issue
"smart-card" IDs for crews that show they already have security
clearance.</TE>
<TE>   The American pilot, Harry Hartsough, 51, was arrested Thursday at
Honolulu International Airport on suspicion of misdemeanor assault,
said John Borges, administrator for the Honolulu Sheriff's
Department. As Hartsough allegedly objected to being searched, he
took off his coat and hit the screener in the eye, Borges said.</TE>
<TE>   The screener was treated for the eye injury and released, said
Marilyn Kali, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The American flight to Dallas was delayed an hour while American
found another pilot, she said.</TE>
<TE>   After Hartsough was arrested, he was released on bail and is
scheduled to appear in court this week, TSA spokeswoman Deirdre
O'Sullivan said, adding that American executives have watched a
videotape of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   American spokesman John Hotard confirmed the arrest but declined
to elaborate, except to say the airline is evaluating smart-card
technology for its crews. Hartsough couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   As for the union's complaint, O'Sullivan would say only that "we
continue to rely upon the pilots for their continuing cooperation."</TE>

<HD>Financial Restatements Continue to Rise</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Filings are submitted at record pace as
federal officials and auditors press firms to undo irregularities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. companies are filing financial restatements admitting false or
faulty accounting at a record pace this year, according to a study at
New York University's Stern School of Business.</LD>
<LD>   Restatements almost tripled from 1997 to 2001, and this year's
rate will exceed last year's total of 158, the study said. Kroger
Co., the biggest U.S. grocery chain, home furnishing retailer
Restoration Hardware Inc., and Westlake Village-based Homestore.com
Inc., the nation's largest online real estate service, joined Enron
Corp. in restating results since January 2001, company filings show.</LD>
<LD>   "This is looking like the year of the restatement," said Jack
Ehnes, chief executive of the California State Teachers Retirement
System, which oversees $100 billion in investments. "It's certainly
disturbing for investors who expect financial statements to be
accurate."</LD>
<TE>   Investors and regulators link the increase to the stock market
boom of the late 1990s, as companies came under heightened pressure
to produce profits and accounting oversight was lax. After the Enron
collapse last year, federal officials and auditors are pressuring
companies to undo accounting irregularities, regulators say.</TE>
<TE>   "The public's sensitivity to the risks from financial reporting
failures has become extraordinarily heightened," said Stephen Cutler,
enforcement director at the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Each
day seems to bring a new restatement, revelation or allegation that
calls into doubt the accuracy or completeness of another company's
financial statements."</TE>
<TE>   Financial Executives International, an organization of corporate
financial officers, distributed the NYU study. "Restatements are
analogous to plane crashes," spokesman Christopher Allen said. "They
cause a mess when they happen, but they happen infrequently relative
to the total number of flights."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier studies by the SEC and Arthur Andersen found the leading
reason why companies restated finances was to correct improperly
reported revenue. Examples include counting sales before they were
made, booking barter transactions as sales and recognizing sales
before services were performed.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC forced half of the restatements in 1999, according to the
NYU study. Regulators typically investigate when they get a tip from
a company insider.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies voluntarily restate. Others have been pressed to
revise results by their auditors, who are under pressure because of
the Enron collapse, said J. Richard Dietrich, an accounting professor
at Ohio State University.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Retailers See Sales Soar in April</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers buying cars, clothing and home improvement materials drove
U.S. retail sales in April to the largest monthly gain since October,
the government reported Tuesday, easing fears of a consumer slowdown
and offering more evidence of a strengthening economy.</LD>
<LD>   The 1.2% gain in retail sales over the previous month was double
the growth rate economists had expected.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the upbeat news, several large retail chains reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings. They included the world's
largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., along with J.C. Penney Co.,
discounter TJX Cos. and jewelry sellers Tiffany &amp; Co. and Zale Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The surprising retail sales gains and profit reports sparked a
stock market rally, with particularly strong stock price rises for
Wal-Mart and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer continued to ride the wave of strong wage growth and
solid housing gains that have followed interest rate declines," said
Matt Fassler, a retail analyst with Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said April sales of retail and food
services gained 4% from the year-earlier month. Excluding
auto-related spending, the gain was more impressive to economists, at
1.3% over March and 3.7% compared with a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The news contrasted with last week's reports by individual
retailers of April same-store sales, which had mostly disappointed
investors and led some economists to question the health of consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the domestic economy.</TE>
<TE>   Based on those company reports, Goldman Sachs pegged April sales
as gaining a scant 0.8% from the same period a year ago, well below
the firm's estimate of 2.8%.</TE>
<TE>   But those tallies were skewed because of an early Easter holiday
and because some of the retail industry's strongest
performers--including many home improvement and electronics
stores--don't report individual monthly sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department data released Tuesday pegged building
material and garden retailers as gaining 5.6% over April 2001 and
electronics and appliance sellers as gaining 8.5% over the same
period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some concern about a pullback, particularly when April
chain store sales numbers came out on top of March data being
relatively weak," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist with Deloitte
&amp; Touche. "But the consumer has been the stalwart of the economy all
along." That consumer strength has benefited discount sellers such as
Wal-Mart. Its stock rose $2.35 on Tuesday, closing at $57.39 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares in Sears gained $2.89 to $54.89 on
the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65 billion, or 37
cents a share, up 20% from $1.38 billion, or 31 cents, a year earlier
and beating by a penny the estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call. Wal-Mart sales jumped 14% to $55 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for J.C. Penney rose to $86 million, or 29 cents a
diluted share, from $41 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   With first-quarter revenue at its JCPenney stores and Eckerd
drugstores up 2.7% to $7.73 billion, the company also raised its
full-year earnings guidance to 90 cents to $1 a share, compared with
39 cents last year. Shares in J.C. Penney rose $1.69 to $24.89 on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Off-price retailer TJX, which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls,
said earnings for the quarter rose 19% from a year earlier to $147.1
million. Sales were $2.67 billion, up 17% from $2.27billion a year
earlier. TJX shares rose 68 cents to $21.37 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nevada is suing 16 drug makers and biotechnology companies, including
GlaxoSmithKline and Amgen Inc., alleging that the companies charged
inflated prices for medicines.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Frankie Sue Del Papa, in two civil lawsuits filed
in January and March, accused the companies of consumer fraud and
racketeering, alleging that the drug makers charged improperly high
wholesale prices for their products. The government's health-care
programs use average wholesale prices supplied by the drug makers to
help determine reimbursement.</LD>
<LD>   The Montana attorney general's office and other state and federal
authorities also are investigating whether drug makers and other
health-care companies have worked with doctors to collect excessive
payments from government health insurance programs, including
Medicare and Medicaid.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>H&amp;R Block Inc. said that it filed for a federal bank charter that
would allow the largest tax-preparation company to offer savings
accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Another opportunity that the bank charter would provide is for the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Chemical and paint maker PPG Industries Inc. said it reached a
$2.7-billion settlement for all asbestos-related personal injury
claims against it and Pittsburgh Corning Corp.</LD>
<LD>   PPG also expects to take an after-tax charge of $500 million to
cover the associated costs.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement will be paid by Pittsburgh-based PPG and more than
three dozen of its insurers over a 21-year period once the deal is
completed, which probably will take more than a year. The settlement
is subject to court approval.</LD>
<TE>   The charge, which PPG would record only at that time, reflects the
current value of cash payments over the 21-year period and 1.4
million shares of PPG stock. The settlement will be part of the
reorganization plan for bankrupt Pittsburgh Corning, in which PPG has
a 50% stake.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was announced after the close of trading. Shares of
PPG closed at $57.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.30, or
2.3%.</TE>

<LD>Boeing Co. forecast an increase in its 2004 commercial aircraft
output while restating its view that next year's deliveries will show
a decrease from this year's levels.</LD>
<LD>   "We will have enough orders to support 275 to 300 deliveries next

chief executive of Boeing's commercial aircraft unit.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing delivered 527 aircraft in 2001, an unusually high number,

<LD>Edison Schools Inc., the largest private U.S. manager of public
schools, agreed to change its revenue reporting as part of a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The commission challenged Edison's practice of not disclosing that
as much as 41% of its reported revenue was money that never went to
the company. In previous SEC filings, Edison reported that money
going from school districts to employees such as teachers was Edison
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Edison's second-quarter loss widened to $16.9 million, or 31 cents
a share, from $5.98 million, or 13 cents, in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue rose 31% to $121.9 million.</LD>

<HD>Saipan Workers Can Sue as Class</HD>
<DH>Labor: Ruling is a milestone in effort to change garment
manufacturing practices on the island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of U.S. retailers, including Gap Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and
Target Corp., suffered a major setback this week when a federal judge
ruled that thousands of garment workers on the Pacific island of
Saipan could sue the companies and their contracted factories as a
class.</LD>
<LD>   The retailers also failed to block an $8.7-million settlement by
19 other firms, including Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Liz Claiborne
Inc., that sets a strict code of conduct and opens factories on the
island to independent monitoring.</LD>
<LD>   The two rulings, handed down Tuesday, are milestones in a
three-year legal effort by California anti-sweatshop activists to
change labor practices in Saipan, part of the U.S. territory of the
Northern Mariana Islands, which has become a garment-producing center
for the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "It's blockbuster," said Michael Rubin, a San Francisco attorney
who filed the lawsuit in 1999 with Los Angeles attorney Al Meyerhoff.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the ultimate outcome of the case, the certification of
the class is significant because it recognizes all garment workers on
the island as a single aggrieved group, Rubin said, when typically
such classes are limited to workers employed by a single company.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling could open the door to other lawsuits by low-wage
workers in industries with multiple employers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswomen for Gap and Target said they were disappointed by the
rulings. A J.C. Penney spokesman did not return phone calls. The
ruling means the suit, which is against 13 retailers and 48 factories
on the island and seeks compensation for about 30,000 current and
former workers, can proceed.</TE>
<TE>   The retailers and factory owners argued that because conditions
varied from factory to factory, it was unfair to combine all garment
workers on the island into a single class.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, for example, used monitors and was selective about which
factories it used on the island, said spokeswoman Tamsin Randlett.</TE>
<TE>   However, U.S. District Judge Alex R. Munson, based in Saipan,
ruled that although the problems may vary from one workplace to
another, they "all stem from the same alleged conspiracy amongst the
defendants to dominate and control the garment work force."</TE>
<TE>   Saipan is the most densely settled island in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory. The Labor Department
has documented widespread violations of labor laws in island
factories and has levied multimillion-dollar fines and reached
settlements with dozens of factories. But activists claim that the
violations, such as unpaid overtime and payment of less than the
$3.05 hourly minimum wage, continue.</TE>
<TE>   Most workers are young women from rural China and the Philippines
who pay large fees to recruiters, then spend years paying them back
from meager earnings. Attorneys say the practice amounts to
indentured servitude.</TE>
<TE>   The practice will be discontinued under the settlement, which was
allowed to proceed under the ruling. The settlement, signed by 19
retailers in 1999 and 2000, sets up a monitoring system through the
Boston-based company Verite.</TE>
<TE>   As a territory, Saipan is subject to all U.S. laws. But in 1989,
to encourage economic development, the administration of President
George Bush loosened immigration and minimum wage laws.</TE>
<TE>   There have been congressional efforts to close the exemptions, but
they have consistently stalled.</TE>
<TE>   The class-action suit was filed under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, which triples any damages awarded. Rubin
said it was the first time a class in a sweatshop case had been
certified under RICO.</TE>

<HD>SEC Proposes New Rules for Fund Ads</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Agency wants companies to clarify time frame of
performance figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules Tuesday that
could make mutual fund advertisements clearer, especially in cases
where fund companies tout performance that isn't necessarily current.</LD>
<LD>   Existing SEC rules allow fund ads to include returns for one-,
five- and 10-year periods that are current to the end of the most
recent quarter. But many fund companies play up their most impressive
performance figures in ads, even though the quoted performance may
reflect gains achieved years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Under the SEC proposal, which was issued for public comment for 60
days, funds that use dated figures also must display the time period
more prominently. The proposal also would require fund ads to direct
investors to the most recent month-end figures, using a telephone
number or a Web site.</LD>
<TE>   "This will help raise the bar for mutual-fund advertising," David
S. Schwartz, an SEC attorney, told the commission.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposal follows complaints from investors and members of
Congress that some funds still are hyping performance from the boom
years of the late 1990s and are failing to adequately disclose
expenses to investors. In recent years, the SEC has charged Van
Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. and Dreyfus Corp. with using
misleading advertising. Both paid fines without admitting or denying
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also proposed giving funds more flexibility in how they
advertise their portfolios. The measure would eliminate a requirement
that limits ad content to what is contained in a fund's prospectus.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Shares Sink After Action by S&amp;P</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Inc. stock slumped to a new 10-year low Tuesday and set a
U.S. trading record with some 670 million shares changing hands. The
wild action reflected Standard &amp; Poor's decision to drop the once
highflying telecom company from the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index effective
at Tuesday's close of trading.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom stock (ticker symbol: WCOM) dropped 20 cents, or about
14%, to close at $1.24. Earlier in the day, it set a low of
$1.08--down more than 90% from its 52-week high of $19.01.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's, which cut WorldCom bonds to a junk rating on
Friday, said Monday that it was removing the company from the S&amp;P 500
index because it no longer represented its industry.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Chief Executive Bernie Ebbers resigned at the end of last
month, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking
into the company's accounting and $366 million worth of personal
loans made to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of membership in the S&amp;P 500 meant that money managers
who try to mimic the performance of that benchmark index were
compelled to dump WorldCom shares Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways Group (U) also was dropped from the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday.
The airline's shares slid 13cents to $2.85.</TE>

<TE>   Fiat Plans IPO</TE>
<TE>   of Ferrari Shares</TE>
<TE>   Investors who could never afford to drive a Ferrari now may at
least be able to own a piece of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Fiat said it plans to sell shares in Ferrari, the maker of
high-performance sports cars, in an initial offering to reduce the
parent firm's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Fiat will keep at least 50% of Ferrari, whose cars can sell for
$200,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Fiat said it applied for a listing for Ferrari on Italy's main
stock exchange. It wasn't clear whether the company's shares might
also trade in U.S. markets as American depositary receipts.</TE>
<TE>   "If you consider how many fans Ferrari has throughout the world,
the IPO should be a big success," said Stefano Masullo, head of
investment firm Opus Consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ferrari is less profitable than other European luxury car
makers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Its operating profit margin, or earnings before tax and interest
as a percentage of sales, was 5.9% last year, half of Porsche's 12%.
BMW's operating margin was 8.2%.</TE>
<TE>   "Trophy investments are all very well if you have enough money to
not worry about getting a return," said Jeremy Podger, who helps
oversee $20 billion in assets at Investec Guinness Flight.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Slash Xbox Price to $199</HD>
<DH>Tech: The software giant's reduction launches a price war
with rival Sony in the global games market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. today will slice the price of its Xbox video game
console by one-third to $199, matching a similar move a day earlier
by rival Sony Corp. to lower its PlayStation 2 price.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement officially launches a brutal price war between
two well-heeled companies battling for dominance in the
ultra-competitive $27-billion global games market.</LD>
<LD>   The Microsoft move also wipes out the edge Nintendo Co. had in
marketing its GameCube console, which until Monday was $100 lower
than both Xbox and PS2 at $199. Nintendo officials said the Japanese
game giant has no plans to change the price of its GameCube.</LD>
<TE>   "Nintendo is in a position of strength," said Perrin Kaplan, a
Nintendo spokeswoman. "Our product is selling very well."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft had planned to make its announcement next week at the
Electronic Entertainment Expo, the industry's biggest trade show. But
Sony's move forced the Redmond, Wash., software giant to act quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft had to make this move today," said Michael Pachter,
director of research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
"They can't let Sony walk all over them."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in hardware prices benefits game publishers, who stand to
benefit from an accelerated spread of consoles into more homes,
Pachter said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's great news for all game publishers," said Brian
Farrell, chief executive of THQ Inc., a major game publisher based in
Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   "THQ really shines in the mass market, so this move to $199 will
trigger more mass market gamers to buy consoles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers also stand to gain from a price war. Drops in hardware
prices usually go in tandem with lowered software prices. Currently,
top-tier games debut at $49.99.</TE>
<TE>   Many publishers and analysts expect that price to hit $39.99 by
this holiday or early next year. Sony already plans to slash the
retail price of marquee titles produced in-house to $39.99, said
Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman. Microsoft said it will not lower the
price of its signature games, currently $49.99.</TE>
<TE>   Although the price war squeezes margins for Microsoft and Sony,
the two companies ultimately benefit from selling more consoles since
each reap royalties on every game sold for their boxes.</TE>
<TE>   The key for Sony and Microsoft is to cut their manufacturing costs
as quickly as possible to keep up with the price war.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Microsoft on Tuesday also said it will shift the
production of Xboxes from Hungary to China, where the costs are
expected to be "substantially" lower, said Todd Holmdahl, Microsoft's
general manager of Xbox hardware.</TE>
<TE>   Flextronics International Ltd., which makes the Xbox for
Microsoft, will move production to Doumen, China, in June, where the
cost of transporting parts is far less, said Jim Sacherman, vice
president of Flextronics marketing in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft will continue to make Xboxes for the North American
market in Guadalajara, Mexico, but will make boxes for the European
and Asian markets from China.</TE>

<HD>EPA to Watch Farm Smog</HD>
<DH>Environment: California agriculture's clean air exemption
will disappear under a legal settlement of three consolidated
lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC and MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A loophole that allowed California farms to escape federal air
pollution controls has been closed as part of a legal settlement
Tuesday that will cause the state's agriculture to be regulated the
same way it is in the rest of the country.</LD>
<LD>   Although agriculture is a major source of air pollution in
California, the state Legislature in 1976 granted farmers an
exemption from federal Clean Air Act requirements to secure permits
before operating or expanding. While California pioneered many air
pollution controls, it was alone among the states in granting
agriculture, its largest industry, a waiver from federal air quality
regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Emissions from the state's farms are subject to some control. For
example, there are days when agricultural burning is prohibited.
However, state and local air quality officials have lacked the power
to issue permits that regulate a variety of operations, including
feed lots, diesel-powered irrigation pumps, livestock waste lagoons
and pesticide spraying.</LD>
<TE>   In settling three consolidated lawsuits, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency acknowledged that the agricultural exemption
violates federal law and agreed to begin regulating farms in the
nation's leading agricultural state next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time agriculture will be regulated in
California under the Clean Air Act. That's why it's a big deal," said
Anne Harper, attorney for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, one of
the plaintiffs in the suit. "We hope this is a first step in
regulating agriculture so they become part of the solution instead of
part of the problem."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA has made it clear that unless the state Legislature
removes the 26-year-old loophole, the state could face economic
penalties. The agency has begun an 18-month countdown toward the
imposition of sanctions that could include tougher pollution
regulations on new businesses as well as the loss of federal highway
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a deficiency in California," said Jack Broadbent, who
runs the EPA's air quality programs across the Pacific Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins the process of identifying these emissions so
agricultural operations can begin to take steps that will lead to
emissions reductions. It's another step that will help air quality."</TE>
<TE>   Regulating a significant portion of California's $30-billion
agriculture industry is not a role the EPA relishes. The agency has
long had authority to intervene, but did not do so until it was sued
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, physicians and concerned citizens who sued the
EPA hailed the agreement as an important step toward clean air. They
sued after the EPA approved California's air quality plan that
perpetuated the agricultural exemption.</TE>
<TE>   "It is long overdue for big [agriculture] to do its air share to
clean up our air," said Brent Newell, an attorney for the Center on
Race, Poverty and the Environment in Delano, in Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   "When the largest agribusinesses are required to get air pollution
permits, this will level the playing field for other business sectors
that already obey the Clean Air Act."</TE>
<TE>   Growers reacted to the announcement with dismay.</TE>
<TE>   "Agriculture does support clean air and we want to do our part,
but now, instead of working with local air folks, we're going to be
working with folks out of Washington. The farther they are from here,
the less they understand agriculture," said Paul Betancourt, a Fresno
County cotton grower.</TE>
<TE>   "What about a guy who wants to expand? How much is it going to
cost him on top of the expense of new land and equipment? Is this
another case of discouraging success? We should be encouraging folks
to grow and prosper."</TE>
<TE>   "We have really been trying to protect the air," said Brad
Schnoor, who farms 5,000 acres of almonds, corn and alfalfa in Madera
County. "We don't burn anymore. We grind all of our prunings. We've
gone to some no-till corn varieties that eliminate the need to plow
and create more dust.</TE>
<TE>   "We water down all our roads. But I don't know what we can do to
cut down on the dust during almond harvest. What do you do about a
guy plowing his field? Tell him he can't?"</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture contributes to air pollution in a number of ways.
Clouds of dust from dirt roads atop levies cloud the Imperial Valley.
Downwind from Chino dairy farms, ammonia from cow excrement
contributes to some of the worst particle air pollution in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Joaquin Valley, progress in reducing ozone, one of the
components of smog, lags behind the rest of California, while
emissions of dust and smoke in the valley are actually increasing.
Most farm operations have no pollution controls. About 3,500 smoky
irrigation pumps dot hundreds of farms and few of the machines have
pollution controls. Huge livestock feedlots produce clouds of dust,
manure and chemicals that contribute to smog as well.</TE>
<TE>   Smog in Bakersfield, Fresno and Sequoia National Park is beginning
to rival that of Los Angeles. From the Central Valley, the Sierra
Nevada appears shrouded in haze much of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, the EPA will give California six months to
remove the exemption for agriculture before issuing notices to big
farms to secure permits for diesel-powered water pumps by next May
and for remaining farm operations by August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although those actions do not automatically trigger emissions
controls, they provide a powerful incentive for farms to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   Since the requirement applies only to agricultural operations that
emit more than 25 tons of smog-forming pollutants annually, a farm
can avoid permits and bureaucratic red tape by reducing emissions
before the deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Also, by placing agriculture under permits, air quality officials
can more accurately track how much pollution farms produce and where
it comes from.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura man has been arrested on suspicion of bilking more than
$700,000 from Ventura and Santa Barbara county charities for the
mentally disabled--three months after a colleague was convicted of
embezzling from the same nonprofits, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Allen Henry Norton, 51, was taken into custody Monday by the
district attorney's major fraud unit after a yearlong investigation,
Vinse Gilliam, deputy chief investigator, said. Norton has been
charged with multiple counts of grand theft and embezzlement,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Norton is accused of stealing the money while serving as general
manager for Ventura and Oxnard thrift stores owned by the Foundation
for Retarded Citizens of Ventura County and a third operated by the
Santa Maria Assn. for the Retarded in Santa Barbara County.</LD>
<TE>   Norton's arraignment Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court was
postponed until Friday. He remains in jail in lieu of $500,000 bail,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest marked the second time in the past nine months that an
administrator for the Ventura- and Santa Maria-based charitable
groups has been accused of stealing money meant to aid the mentally
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Peachey, 61, an Oxnard accountant who provided bookkeeping
services to both charities for 18 years, was sentenced in February to
nine years in state prison for embezzling more than $1 million from
the two organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Peachey used the cash to build a
5,400-square-foot-home on 20 acres of farmland near Bakersfield. The
foundation took the deed of the house after Peachey's arrest and
recently sold it for $240,000, foundation President Andrew Soter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soter and other officials with the Ventura organization expressed
shock Tuesday at what they called "an embarrassing and awkward
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam said the investigation of Norton began after a routine
audit by an outside accounting firm uncovered missing funds from the
accounts of the thrift stores.</TE>
<TE>   The same audit had implicated Peachey.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that Norton and Peachey had been working
together to embezzle money, Gilliam said. Norton is suspected of
funneling money from the thrift store accounts into his personal
account between 1995 and 2000 and then using the funds to pay for
designer clothes, limousine rides, resort vacations and stereo and
video equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have recovered nearly $45,000 worth of property
allegedly purchased with the stolen funds and $10,000 in jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Norton embezzled the money by diverting the funds for his own
needs," Gilliam said. "He single-handedly deprived those most in need
of precious resources which could have benefited hundreds and
possibly thousands of individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Ventura foundation said they notified their
colleagues in Santa Maria of financial discrepancies after their
audit. That organization conducted its own probe and contacted Oxnard
police, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Norton worked for a private management company employed by the
Ventura County foundation for nearly 20 years, said Shirley Jones,
the organization's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said she never suspected wrongdoing until the 2000 audit
turned up missing funds in Ventura, Oxnard and Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   She said Norton appeared before the foundation's board of
directors and blamed higher costs and more new thrift stores for
cutting into revenue earnings. Norton was fired from his position in
December 2000, Jones said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Mother's Efforts to End Baby's Life</HD>
<DH>Courts: Brain-damaged Christopher Ibarra will remain on
life support for now as O.C. jurist refuses to award sole custody to
either parent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge refused to award a mother sole custody of her
severely brain-damaged infant Tuesday, blocking her effort to take
the child off life-support machines.</LD>
<LD>   She and the boy's father disagree about whether the child should
remain on life support. The father, accused of causing the boy's
injuries and awaiting trial on assault charges, would face a homicide
charge if 8-month-old Christopher Ibarra died.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Richard E. Behn ruled neither parent is fit to care for the
child. He faulted the father for abusing the baby and the mother for
failing to prevent the abuse.</LD>
<TE>   The decision means that Christopher will remain on life support
indefinitely. The judge ordered the county's Social Services Agency
to monitor Christopher's health but prohibited officials from making
any medical decisions that could end the baby's life.</TE>
<TE>   "This court is going to make medical decisions for this child,"
Behn said. "There's going to be no medical treatment other than that
that sustains life."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have concluded that Christopher suffered a "devastating"
brain injury and will never recover. He breathes with the help of a
machine pumping oxygen through a hole in his throat and is fed
through a plastic tube inserted into his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Christopher's mother, Tamara Sepulveda,
said she's frustrated that her son remains in a vegetative state.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen right now, but I have to be patient,"
she said. "I want the best for my child."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's grandmother, Susan Sepulveda, said the family continues
to believe that taking Christopher off life support is the only way
to end the baby's suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no life there. There's no life in his body. That's the
hardest part, looking at somebody lying there," Susan Sepulveda said.
"He can't do anything. He can't even blink."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's 23-year-old father, Moises Ibarra, is held at the Orange
County Jail on suspicion of felony child abuse. He is awaiting a
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of child abuse, he faces up to nine years in prison.
If his son dies, Ibarra could face a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Sepulveda said she will continue efforts in court to gain
control over medical decisions involving Christopher. But the judge
said it is premature to consider turning off the life-support
machines.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother would go down and turn off the machines tomorrow," he
said. Behn said that wouldn't happen without an additional hearing.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Fire May Be Arson</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Officials say it appeared to have several
starting points along Antonio Parkway. Residents earn firefighters'
praise for keeping brush cleared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA, MAI TRAN and DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after a fierce brush fire threatened million-dollar homes in
south Orange County, crews doused hot spots while arson investigators
combed the area where the blaze started.</LD>
<LD>   As residents cleaned up ash and soot Tuesday, they expressed
gratitude to the firefighters who saved 700 homes in the area and to
a brush-clearing project that officials said held the flames at bay.
They expressed shock and anger at reports that the blaze may have
been set.</LD>
<LD>   "If this resulted from arson, somebody needs to get their bell
rung," homeowner Craig Tilmont said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said the blaze appeared to have several starting
points along Antonio Parkway across from the Tijeras Creek Golf Club
in Las Flores. Yet to be determined is whether the fires were set,
and if so, whether by more than one person, said Dennis Shell, a
spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority. Late Tuesday, he
said, no suspects had been identified in an incident that could have
been far worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had wind on this fire, there's a ... potential that [it]
would have been really, really bad," Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   About 70 firefighters remained on the job Tuesday in the hills
above Rancho Santa Margarita, while helicopters dumped water on parts
of the scorched 1,100 acres inaccessible from the ground. Officials
said they expect to finish the job by this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Residents got much of the credit for averting disaster. Besides
installing fireproof roofs and planting greenbelt vegetation, Shell
said, they had recently cleared debris and brush from a 150-foot
perimeter around their houses. Some of that work was part of a
homeowners association project completed just three days before the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no dried-out vegetation or piles of lumber around the
homes," Shell said. "They were wonderfully defended, and it was a
real big help to us."</TE>
<TE>   Though the smell of smoke still wafted down streets Tuesday, the
sense of relief was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Outside her house on Sundown Drive in Rancho Santa Margarita,
Christina Law hosed down windows while her young son and daughter
played in the green backyard that contrasted sharply with the
blackened hillside only a few feet away. As Law mopped up, she
wondered aloud how she was going to get the smell of smoke out of the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgot to close one window when I evacuated, and that was all
it took," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When she saw the flames top the ridge at the end of her street
Monday afternoon, Law said, she grabbed her daughter and a few
photos, then fled. Her husband was at work and her son in preschool.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire was coming in so fast," she said. "That's all I had time
to do. As I drove away I saw the helicopter flying over the street,
carrying water."</TE>
<TE>   On nearby Apache Drive, Tilmont and his neighbor Geoff Ward were
trying to figure out how to remove stains left by the red fire
retardant that splashed on their houses when a plane dumped it on a
nearby hill.</TE>
<TE>   Tilmont's house is for sale, and a potential buyer came by Tuesday
morning to inspect it.</TE>
<TE>   Though the home was not damaged, Tilmont said, the buyer had
second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   But because the fire has already burned away the brush, "this area
is safe from fire for the next 10 years," he said. "It's probably the
safest place in the entire county now."</TE>
<TE>   Tilmont said he was home sick Monday when he smelled smoke. He
opened the garage door and saw smoke rising over the ridge at the end
of the street.</TE>
<TE>   He awakened his sleeping daughter, put her and the family dog in
the car, grabbed a few photo albums and took off. The family stayed
with friends Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Ward said he never left home. He stayed in the backyard with a
garden hose, wetting down trees to prevent them from catching fire.
He was outside when a plane dropped fire retardant on the house and
hillside behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was covered in red jelly, and the sidewalk and driveway were
covered by about a quarter-inch of the stuff," Ward said. "But that
pilot saved my house."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles firefighter Dave Lucas found himself at the receiving
end of his colleagues' services Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He was battling a house fire in South Central Los Angeles when a
fellow firefighter told him he had a message from his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Joanna had called to say there was a fire in my backyard and to
get home right away," Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed home to Rancho Santa Margarita, but officials would not
let him get near his house--even when he flashed his firefighter's
badge.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned," he said, "but there were a lot of fire engines
in the neighborhood. I was confident that the firefighters had the
situation in hand."</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Lucas expressed disgust that the fire may have been started
deliberately.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty sick person that does something like that," she
said. "Whoever did this has my 5-year-old daughter very scared."</TE>

<LD>A woman who befriended an elderly man living in the same hard-luck
downtown Los Angeles hotel has been charged with strangling him,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheryl Fleming, 43, a longtime resident of the Alexandria Hotel in
the 500 block of Spring Street, was arrested April 30 on suspicion of
killing Enrique Garnica, 73, a bullfighting fan and retired
bartender. Hotel employees found the man's body April 9 on the floor
of his fifth-floor room with a bedsheet around his neck.</LD>
<LD>   "They had a close, friendly relationship. He was an old man, and
she assisted him," said LAPD homicide Det. Emmett Badar. "Helped him
with his cleaning, things like that."</LD>
<TE>   Fleming has told police that she did not kill Garnica, Badar said.
She is being held at County-USC Medical Center's jail ward because of
a medical condition. Detectives continue to search for a motive for
the killing, Badar said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Garnica lived in the hotel for at least five years.
Employees, tenants and friends described Garnica, known as "Kiki," as
amiable.</TE>

<HD>Not Fancy, But a Prep School All the Same</HD>
<DH>Children at View Park, an L.A. Unified charter campus in
the Crenshaw district, aim to be top students at top colleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Interrupt a sixth-grade class at View Park Prep, and they'll quickly
tell you the mission of their charter school.</LD>
<LD>   "To go to the best colleges and universities in the world,"
several students blurt out before returning to their studying for a
science test.</LD>
<LD>   The full name of the public elementary and middle school is a
mouthful--View Park Preparatory Accelerated Charter School--but it
says a lot about its mission. "They're going to college," headmaster
Michael Piscal said, "and when they get there, they're going to be
the top students."</LD>
<TE>   Along with those expectations are other markings of private, or
independent, schools: uniforms, a leader who calls himself "Head of
School and CEO," an ambitious fund-raising campaign and a waiting
list with more than 1,000 names. Even the school golf tournament for
dads sounds preppy.</TE>
<TE>   In significant ways, though, View Park Prep looks nothing like the
stereotype of a "prep school." There is no tuition. And all but a few
of the 342 students are black, closely reflecting the demographics of
the surrounding neighborhoods in the Crenshaw district. (Nationally,
African American students comprise about 5% of students attending
independent schools, according to the National Assn. of Independent
Schools. Overall, students of color comprise 17% of all students at
the association's member schools.)</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools such as the 3-year-old View Park Prep are public
schools, funded by taxes, but they tend to operate more like private
schools. Chartered by public school boards, they control their
budgets and do not answer to a central office. Typically, these
schools are small. They can design their own curricula. And without
unionized faculties, they are freer to hire and fire their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The Presbyterian church on West 54th Street where View Park rents
most of its space is in a neighborhood lined with tall, skinny palm
trees, but the windows on most of the homes nearby have bars on them.
Across the street from the campus is a beauty salon and a television
repair shop. Neither looks like it is open very often, if ever. There
have been days when Piscal has heard gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in the Crenshaw district by "dumb luck," he said. After
teaching English at the highly regarded Harvard-Westlake School in
Studio City, Piscal said he went looking for a less affluent, urban
area to test his theory that a top-notch education could be delivered
without charging eye-popping tuition.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to provide in this community, in their own
neighborhood, a school that can accomplish the same thing" as
prestigious private schools, he said. "Why does a kid have to drive
from Crenshaw to the Valley to get a good education?"</TE>
<TE>   Parents at View Park say they tried their traditional public
schools but found they were not rigorous enough and discouraged them
from being involved in their children's education. Like a private
school, View Park requires parents to donate their time--and welcomes
their money.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come to View Park, you don't just come as a child. The
whole family has to go to school here," said Rochelle Mackabee, the
director of operations. Her son and nephew are in seventh grade.</TE>
<TE>   Families at View Park Prep get in through a lottery. While some of
them could afford private school tuitions, 60% of the households earn
less than $45,000 a year, Piscal estimates, and 19% of students
qualify for lunches subsidized by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Dulan, who owns a restaurant, had his children enrolled in a
private school, but he now saves $15,000 by sending them to View Park
Prep, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little more relaxed," Dulan said, comparing View Park with
his children's old school in Westchester. "The parents aren't as
pretentious, but the academic standards are high, and that's what I
like."</TE>
<TE>   The curriculum closely mirrors that at private schools, because
Piscal sought their input when he expanded an after-school program to
found View Park Prep in 1999. In seventh grade, for example, View
Park students read "Watership Down," as do their counterparts at
Harvard-Westlake. That prep school donated computers and desks, and
several of Piscal's former students there have taught at View Park.
Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, the retired chairman of its English
department and the heads of several other area independent schools
have given Piscal advice and sent philanthropists View Park's way.</TE>
<TE>   View Park Prep is used to visitors. Everyone wants to show off
something. First-graders rope you into listening to them read. A
fourth-grader studying California history offers trivia on the San
Buenaventura mission.</TE>
<TE>   View Park's standardized test scores are well above the state
average and among the best for elementary schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District, which granted View Park's charter. Piscal
boasts that his fifth-grade students outscored those in Beverly Hills
last year in spelling and language arts (although they trailed them
in math and reading).</TE>
<TE>   This year is a 10-year milestone for the country's fast-growing
charter school movement. The first law allowing charters passed in
Minnesota in 1992, and California soon followed. Now, half a million
children attend more than 2,400 charter schools in 34 states,
according to the Charter Friends National Network. For all the
success, however, some schools have been just flashes of grand ideas,
failing because of mismanagement, squabbling and lack of funding.</TE>
<TE>   View Park Prep began with kindergarten through sixth grade and
added seventh and eighth last fall. In 2003, Piscal plans to add a
high school--still a rarity in the charter school movement. He has
discovered, as private schools know all too well, that to expand
programs requires fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   The separate but associated Inner City Education Foundation is
trying to raise $11 million to build View Park Prep its own campus.
That sort of fund-raising is on the scale of an independent school's,
but, Piscal said, "we don't have affluent parents who can contribute
$20,000 a year to a capital campaign." So, once again, he and View
Park's backers are opening their Rolodexes to solicit foundations and
the prep-school world.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hudnut, headmaster of Harvard-Westlake School and Piscal's
former boss, said public and private schools should not consider
themselves too different to learn from each other.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us has a monopoly on good educational practice," he said.</TE>

<HD>Compton Trustee Accused of Lying</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Basil Kimbrew, the school board's vice president,
is charged with falsely claiming to live within city limits in two
recent elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five months after the state Department of Education restored full
authority to the Compton school board, the board's vice president was
arrested by state investigators and charged with lying about living
within city limits during two recent elections, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Basil Kimbrew, 48, was arrested at the state Department of Justice
office in Commerce on Monday. He was released that night after
posting $50,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Kimbrew--a self-proclaimed "political provocateur"--faces three
felony counts of perjury and two felony counts of state Election Code
violations for claiming to live in a Compton apartment while residing
in Carson, court papers show.</LD>
<TE>   The charges allege that Kimbrew lied in filing papers for the 1999
school board elections and in the hotly contested 2001 Compton
mayor's race. During the mayor's race, Kimbrew campaigned in a
bulletproof vest and finished a distant fifth. In that race, he
raised questions about his own residency by carrying on a Compton
campaign even as his wife was seeking a City Council seat in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   "We are basically alleging that when he ran for office, he listed
his residence as Compton but did not in fact reside in Compton," said
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry White. Kimbrew, White
said, lived at the time in his wife's Carson home.</TE>
<TE>   A former school board member, Saul E. Lankster, also is accused of
lying about his residency in the 2001 mayoral election and two
previous elections for state Assembly and the Los Angeles Community
College District Board of Trustees.</TE>
<TE>   One of the perjury counts against Kimbrew refers to an alleged
false address on a voter registration form he filed. The charges make
no reference to the November 2001 school board election, when Kimbrew
won a new four-year term while using the address of a home in a
different Compton neighborhood. White said Kimbrew was living at that
address.</TE>
<TE>   Reached Tuesday, Kimbrew would not comment. If convicted, he could
be sentenced to up to five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Kimbrew and Lankster represent a setback for
the Compton school board, whose members have sought to repair the
body's tattered reputation. In 1993, the board was stripped of all
power because of widespread corruption, $20 million in deficits and
low test scores. The state ran the district until December, when
state schools Supt. Delaine Eastin ordered a return of local control.</TE>
<TE>   During the period of state management, Kimbrew--who was first
elected to the school board in 1995--was one of the board's most
vocal members. In March 2001, Eastin temporarily delayed the return
of local control because of what a state team of auditors called
disruptive behavior by Kimbrew.</TE>
<TE>   Kimbrew has been a player, however minor, in virtually every
political scandal in Compton during the last decade. Six years ago,
he testified in federal court that he accepted illegal payments on
behalf of a councilwoman, who was convicted of extortion and tax
fraud in the case. Kimbrew was not indicted.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he has carried on a high-profile feud with former
mayor Omar Bradley. In interviews, Kimbrew has acknowledged
distributing fliers that without evidence accused political opponents
of having illegitimate children and committing murder.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a Superior Court judge has accused Kimbrew of lying on
the witness stand in a case challenging the outcome of the 2001 city
elections. Those allegations are unrelated to Monday's charges.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Kimbrew closely parallel those filed last
month against Lankster, who served on the school board until November
2001. Lankster, who lost a reelection bid shortly before the return
of local control last fall, faces three felony perjury counts and
three counts of election law violations for claiming to be living in
a Compton apartment while residing in Long Beach, White said.</TE>
<TE>   The charges stem from unsuccessful bids by Lankster, a Republican
and perpetual candidate for office, for a state Assembly seat in
1999, a Compton Community College District trusteeship in 1999 and
the Compton mayoralty in 2001. He finished sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Lankster has pleaded not guilty.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Not Making Reforms, Monitor Says</HD>
<DH>Report: Overseer contends some officers are undermining the
federal consent decree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Department officials have failed to make changes
mandated by the federal consent decree governing the LAPD and, in
some instances, have belittled and undermined efforts to overhaul the
agency, according to the latest report by the LAPD's court-appointed
monitor.</LD>
<LD>   That report will be filed today with U.S. District Judge Gary
Feess. He has the authority to punish officials for failing to comply
with the decree, which the city entered into last year to head off a
lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.</LD>
<LD>   In the report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, Michael
Cherkasky and his monitors at Kroll Associates concluded that the
LAPD has made progress in some areas, moving to construct a
computerized system to track potential problem officers, for
instance, and swiftly investigating use-of-force incidents involving
police.</LD>
<TE>   But Cherkasky also found that the LAPD has failed to implement
major aspects of the consent decree, including tracking racial data
on pedestrian and traffic stops.</TE>
<TE>   The report faulted the LAPD for its handling of confidential
informants and its efforts to track and thwart street gangs, among
other things.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD is non-compliant with a number of provisions of the
consent decree," according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "Of equal or greater seriousness is the presence of a vocal
minority inside the LAPD that continue to fight to preserve the
insular culture that led to the adoption of the decree.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe there is no problem with the LAPD, the problem is
with 'outsiders.'</TE>
<TE>   "These 'outsiders' are portrayed as uninformed, biased,
politically motivated, greedy and/or incompetent interlopers," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   "These officers do an enormous disservice to the majority of the
LAPD and the community and negatively impact an institution they
purport to love--the LAPD-- and a cause they risk their lives
for--public safety," the report added.</TE>
<TE>   "This must and will change."</TE>
<TE>   Although the report did not identify the officers involved, it
stated that some are members of the LAPD's Consent Decree Task Force,
the group responsible for seeing that the Police Department
implements the decree's provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, Mayor James K. Hahn said he would oppose Chief Bernard
C. Parks' bid for a second term because the mayor questioned whether
the chief was doing enough to implement the decree. Expressing
similar worries, the Police Commission voted 4 to 1 last month to
deny Parks a second five-year term. Parks stepped down two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Warned of some of the monitor's impending conclusions, Hahn in
recent days has urged the commission and interim Chief Martin Pomeroy
to immediately address the problems, according to some city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The city entered into the consent decree with the U.S. Department
of Justice last June amid allegations that the LAPD for years engaged
in a "pattern or practice" of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   With an interim chief now at the helm and the city seeking to fill
Parks' position, the issue of compliance with the decree is expected
to play a central role in the search for a new chief. Hahn, who will
select the nominee for chief from choices given to him by the Police
Commission, has said that he is searching for candidates who will
enthusiastically embrace the decree's mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky--a former New York City prosecutor who took on John
Gotti and the mob--has released two previous reports on the LAPD's
progress, generally giving the department a passing grade while
raising specific concerns about its determination to embrace the
decree.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, Cherkasky struck a more critical tone,
identifying a number of areas where he said that the LAPD and those
responsible for overseeing it are falling behind on their legal
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his findings include:</TE>
<TE>   * The data entry of information on the ethnicity of those involved
in pedestrian and motor vehicle stops is critically and seriously
backlogged, making it impossible for the department to determine
whether racially based stops are being made.</TE>
<TE>   * The department produced audits on excessive force and other
topics that the monitor concluded were "seriously flawed and many
substantive errors were made."</TE>
<TE>   * The LAPD's database of police informants has mistakes and lists
some informants who have died, raising "questions regarding the
accuracy of the information maintained in this system."</TE>
<TE>   * Members of the LAPD are publicly denigrating the measures
mandated by the decree, actions that the monitor concluded "represent
a deliberate effort to create resistance to the consent decree."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the problems it cited, the team found the officers'
attitudes toward the decree most disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   At one meeting, an officer attempted to distance the LAPD from the
decree.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not with the Police Department," the report quotes the
officer as saying. "This is with the feds and the city about the
Police Department. We are not controlling this. It is coming out of
the mayor's office ....The LAPD is the biggest fish that the
[Department of Justice] ever got on the line. They got us."</TE>
<TE>   Another officer said the reforms were "unnecessary and
time-consuming," Cherkasky wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky also documents a number of personal slights directed at
him and his team.</TE>

lauded, although last payment of $102,000 won't be blocked if he's
terminated. Gary Simon wants to quit, get money.</DH>

<LD>The collapse of Orange County's quest to build an airport at El Toro
took the flavor of a nasty divorce Tuesday when supervisors met
behind closed doors to debate whether to reward the performance of
outgoing program manager Gary Simon.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, supervisors eliminated the El Toro office and Simon's
position, effective June 4. Under Simon's contract, he would be paid
a six-month severance plus another month of pay upon termination. But
the money evaporates if he resigns--a clause Simon wants amended to
allow him to resign and get the extra pay, more than $102,000.
Supervisor Todd Spitzer, Simon's most vocal critic, said Tuesday that
Simon appears to have the votes to get his severance when he steps
down. But Spitzer said there was dissention over a portion of the
board resolution that praises Simon's job performance. At the end of
Tuesday's tense meeting, supervisors agreed to revisit the issue
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The debate is emblematic of El Toro's contentious planning
history, which began in 1994 when Orange County voters approved
zoning for a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine base and ended
in March when another vote rezoned the property for other uses.</LD>
<TE>   "Gary knew the rules of the game going in, and he's trying to
change the rules," said Spitzer, who fought the county's plans for an
El Toro airport and has accused Simon of lying about county expenses
for El Toro--a charge Simon has denied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's indicative of El Toro through the years. Whoever has been in
charge has always tried to change the rules to fit their agenda,"
Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, an airport supporter, said
Simon's work is something the county can be proud of, despite the
combative political environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure, now that Gary's job has disappeared, that
when he's looking for a new job that he gets a good recommendation,"
she said. "I've been very impressed with him and have been able to
work with him very well."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he was confident that he and supervisors would be able
to come to terms Monday. He has earned $182,000 a year overseeing an
agency of 29 employees, most of whom have found jobs elsewhere in
county government. Last year, the office's budget was $11.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly has been a privilege and honor to work for the
board," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was hired in January 2001, his second stint at the county.
He had headed El Toro's real-estate team a year earlier, then left to
work for an engineering firm hired for an expansion of Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Simon returned to head an El Toro office that for the first time
reported directly to supervisors. The office had been moved in May
2000 from the control of then-County Executive Officer Jan
Mittermeier, who left the county after arguing that the change
breached her contract. She had the same severance provision in her
contract as Simon and was terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has sparred with Simon, as he had with Mittermeier, over
several El Toro matters. The relationship became so tense that
Spitzer began tape-recording his meetings with Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2001, Spitzer protested when thousands of county
postcards touting the airport were shipped to a post office after a
judge ordered county officials to stop using public funds on airport
promotions. Simon had told Spitzer there were no mailers pending,
according to Spitzer's tape-recording of the meeting. Later that day,
however, Simon and Deputy County Counsel Don Rubin authorized a final
mailing.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he has no problem paying Simon but does not want the
county to praise his work. "His performance, in my mind, triggered
termination for cause," Spitzer said. "We don't even owe him his
severance because of his lack of performance and lack of veracity.
But I'm willing to live by the severance provision."</TE>

<HD>Make-A-Wish Has Wish of Its Own: More Donated Frequent
Flier Miles</HD>
<DH>Charity: Foundation depends on the mileage to fill many
pleas of terminally ill children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Make-A-Wish Foundation faces the possibility that, for the first
time in its 22-year history, it may have to deny a request from a
terminally ill child, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Dependent on 1 billion donated frequent flier miles annually to
grant many of its dream dates, the foundation is suffering from a
nationwide dearth in charity to and from airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles chapter alone needs about 15 million donated miles
to send children and their families to dream destinations--most often
Hawaii--but is scheduled to receive only 600,000 miles this year as
its share of the national coffers.</LD>
<TE>   Among the children the organization is trying to serve is Erika
Monfiero, 9, who is scheduled to fly to Florida in June. Her wish, to
visit DisneyWorld, comes just as she is recovering from a relapse of
leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Sherilynn Monfiero of Long Beach, said the trip is a
dream for the whole family.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been able to take her farther than Las Vegas, and
that's only because I have a brother who lives there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The wishes of children like Erika are forcing Make-A-Wish to
improvise.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to scramble, but we really haven't been able to,"
said Judith Lewis, the chapter's president and chief executive.
"We'll survive. We just haven't figured out how yet."</TE>
<TE>   Tapped out this month, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los
Angeles has dipped into reserves to buy tickets to send a family of
five to Hawaii, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To grant an estimated 140 trips this year, Make-A-Wish Los Angeles
would have to spend hundreds of thousands more from an already tight
budget, she said. This year, it expects to grant 335 other wishes
that would not involve air travel.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is hitting Orange County's Make-A-Wish Foundation as
well, with frequent-flier-mile donations down about 50%.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, said Fred Johnson, the nonprofit's chief executive,
the group is having to pay for tickets once donated to the tune of
about $60,000 to $75,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still a little scared to fly, so we're not getting the
miles," Johnson said of the Tustin-based chapter, which grants about
125 wishes a year, 30% to 40% of them involving trips.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation recently stepped up its fund-raising efforts,
especially with organizations and individuals willing to sponsor
specific wishes.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't ever turned anyone away," Johnson said, "and we're not
going to."</TE>
<TE>   Several factors account for the shortfall in frequent flier
donations. The number of air travel passengers dropped sharply after
Sept. 11. Fewer travelers means fewer frequent flier miles earned.</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11, I thought maybe the mail had stopped," Lewis said.
"We got almost nothing in the way of support."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines, facing tough budget decisions, have slowed their
donations of free air miles as well.</TE>
<TE>   America West, for example, gave 20 million matching miles to its
charities at the end of 2001 as a one-time effort to get people to
keep giving.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign worked, bringing in more than 2.5 million miles from
travelers in October and November.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the extra push, donations have fallen dramatically
this year, said C.A. Howlett, senior vice president of public
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some Travelers Begin Hoarding Free Flights</TE>
<TE>   Also, now that several airlines have dropped expiration dates from
their frequent flier programs, some travelers are hoarding the free
flights instead of donating them to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Adriene Davis, a spokeswoman for Indiana University's Center on
Philanthropy, said a fear of flying is probably not the biggest cause
of the slumping donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our research over time shows that the economy, more than anything
else, correlates with giving levels," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Make-A-Wish Foundation and other agencies say they have not
yet recovered from a falloff in donations of all sorts since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, some charities reported unprecedented giving after the
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   USC public policy professor James Ferris said the problems of
Make-A-Wish and other charities show the danger of relying too
heavily on a single type of donation, such as frequent flier miles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to go along and grow and survive on free miles when
everybody's giving them away," said Ferris, director of USC's Center
on Philanthropy and Public Policy. "But you have to diversify for
times like this."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also should not expect to replace all its air miles
with cash donations, Ferris said, because it's harder to write a
check than to hand over a flight voucher.</TE>
<TE>   Competition With Other Charities Also a Factor</TE>
<TE>   Another factor complicates the plight of Make-A-Wish--competition.</TE>
<TE>   Just over a decade ago, Make-A-Wish Foundation and Ronald McDonald
House were among the few charities requesting miles from donors, said
Randy Peterson, publisher of webflyer.com and InsideFlyer Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Petersen said, more than 1,000 charities--local and
national--are vying for the currency. "Everybody's figured out the
game now," Peterson said. "It will never be the same for
Make-A-Wish."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson has launched a Web site, www.miledonor.com, to serve as a
clearinghouse for those who want their air miles to go to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix-based Make-A-Wish, with a $105-million annual budget,
serves about 10,300 children nationwide each year. About two-thirds
of the wishes include travel.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism, a battered economy and competition for business
travelers have made it harder to grant the last request of the next
child who wants see eagles before dying, but one Westlake Village
mother said she hopes Make-A-Wish prevails.</TE>
<TE>   Tammy Hospodar, whose son Michael released the ceremonial eagle of
the Chilkat tribe in Haines, Alaska, in November 2000, said the
Make-A-Wish-funded trip made Michael's struggles against cystic
fibrosis easier for the whole family to bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the cost was, the benefit was priceless," Hospodar said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the family had enjoyed trips to the Santa Barbara
Zoo, and Michael, now 13, had grown to love visiting an eagle there.
Then someone stole it. His request to Make-A-Wish: simply to see
another eagle.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought someone was going to bring an eagle to our door and
let him pet it," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Make-A-Wish flew the family of four to Alaska, where
Michael saw hundreds of nesting eagles and was given a key to the
city of Juneau.</TE>

<HD>Fowl Are Out of Bounds</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Canada geese prefer a Van Nuys golf course to a
nature area, raising concerns for their safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Woodley Lakes Golf Course in Van Nuys, the Canada geese don't seem
to bother the golfers, and the golfers don't bother the geese.</LD>
<LD>   But Rosemarie White, president of the Canada Goose Project, thinks
that environmentalists and city officials need to sit down before
tensions between geese and people escalate, and find better ways to
manage the waterfowl.</LD>
<LD>   White, who lives in Valley Village, is concerned because the
Canada geese in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area seem to prefer the
busy golf course on the west side of Woodley Avenue to the designated
wildlife area on the east side.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, one breeding pair of Canada geese crossed six lanes of
traffic on Woodley Avenue, its brood of five goslings in tow. The
geese relocated next to one of the man-made lakes on the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   According to White, at least 45 adult geese and 28 goslings are
living among the sand traps and fairways.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the second year that this family migrated from the
wildlife area to the golf course," said White, whose organization
tracks fluctuations in the goose population.</TE>
<TE>   White said she worries that the geese's preference for water
hazards puts the migratory birds on a potential collision with
hazards of another kind. In other cities, including Seattle,
thousands of Canada geese have been killed by government decree as
public nuisances, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The potential danger to geese is especially great now, White said,
because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed turning more
responsibility for management of the species over to the
states--which may lead to a loosening of hunting regulations.</TE>
<TE>   White has been meeting with the Los Angeles Department of
Recreation and Parks, which manages the golf course, to discuss ways
to protect both geese and the interests of the golfers. So far, the
relationship seems friendly on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Golf carts wind through the course, their drivers apparently
unaware that goose eggs are being hatched among the bulrushes and
under trees.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Moe, water manager for the recreation area, said he hears
few complaints from golfers about the big, handsome birds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most of our golfers are pleased to see the wildlife,"
said Moe. "I'm sure some golfers are slightly frustrated when their
ball stops dead because of running into goose effluvia."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Canada geese are increasingly controversial. Their
populations have been growing in recent decades, and many communities
regard them as pests. The geese also have their champions, including
White and Gregg Feigelson, director of the New York-based Coalition
to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese.</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site (www.icu.com /geese), Feigelson's group urges
supporters to notify the Fish and Wildlife Service of their
opposition to its proposed regulation extending the goose-hunting
season and allowing other actions that would reduce the number of
resident Canada geese.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be an all-out war on Canada geese," Feigelson said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal agency puts the resident U.S. goose population at
3.5-million birds.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service has been holding public hearings on
the proposal in 11 states, but California is not one of them. A
decision is expected by fall.</TE>
<TE>   White's Canada Goose Project plans to give Moe and other
Recreation and Parks personnel an award--they're calling it the Bo
Peep Award--for shepherding the local geese and stopping traffic
while they crossed Woodley Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   She said she is hopeful that all the interested parties can find a
way to keep the geese from becoming an issue at Woodley Lakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a problem now," she said. "I would like to sit down with
the city agency and invite in other organizations that are helping to
find solutions to the problem of migratory birds taking up residence.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution is not to kill the animals. The solution is to look
at the causes first and establish habitat away from the [heavily
used] parks that's compatible with the animals' needs."</TE>
<TE>   Most observers blame habitat destruction for increasing the
sometimes-abrasive contact between geese and humans.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last 100 years, man has destroyed over 95% of the
wetlands areas along the Pacific flyway, so these migrating birds
don't have a place to rest and recuperate during their seasonal
journey," Moe said.</TE>
<TE>   White said planting more forage for the geese in the wildlife area
might lure them away from the golf course, which now functions as a
lavish buffet of clover and grasses.</TE>
<TE>   Clashes between humans and wildlife will grow more common, she
predicted, if communities don't recognize the need to dedicate more
open space as habitat for urbanized species such as Canada geese.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Yparraguirre, a waterfowl biologist with the California
Department of Fish and Game, said the state does not relish assuming
more responsibility for the geese, if only because of increased
bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   He, too, thinks habitat destruction has created the current
situation. "There are thousands of Canada geese in almost every
county of our state now," he said. "It's a byproduct of human
development."</TE>
<TE>   Issuing more permits to hunt geese is not a solution, at least in
urban areas, he said. "I live in the city. I don't want hunters in my
backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Many communities are looking for creative ways to balance human
and wildlife needs, he said. "But I'm afraid that this is one problem
where there may or may not be a perfect solution."</TE>

<HD>L.A. to Honor Identity Cards From Mexico</HD>
<DH>Experiment: Council votes to accept matricula consular on a
trial basis, opening city services to illegal immigrants. Some say it
undercuts U.S. law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department and other city agencies will accept
identification cards issued by the Mexican Consulate as valid ID for
illegal immigrants on a trial basis as a result of a closely watched
City Council vote Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles City Council voted 13 to 1 to approve a six-month
pilot program to accept the matricula consular, an identification
card the Mexican government has issued to expatriates for more than a
century.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means illegal immigrants--ineligible for Social
Security cards, driver's licenses and other officially recognized
U.S. identification documents--will be able to obtain many of the
same city services as legal residents. Among other things, they will
be able to borrow books from libraries, attend hearings at City Hall,
and be cited and released by police for minor traffic violations,
rather than being taken to jail to be processed for those stops.</LD>
<TE>   Immigrants' rights groups and most council members hailed the
move, saying it allows immigrants to prove their identity--especially
important in a post-Sept. 11 world--and to ease the travails of
everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue of human dignity and respect," said Councilman Nick
Pacheco, urging his colleagues to support the matter. "This country
has long respected all of our residents, and this is an expansion of
that respect."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Narro, a project director with the Coalition for Humane
Immigration Rights of Los Angeles, said the decision helps hundreds
of thousands of undocumented workers, such as day laborers and
domestics, who form a key element of the region's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "These workers basically live in the shadow of our city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, argued that the decision will undercut federal
immigration laws.</TE>
<TE>   "This document is almost a flat-out admission that the person who
holds it is in the country illegally," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman
for the Los Angeles office of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform. "The city of Los Angeles should not adopt an official policy
of not only are we going to turn a blind eye, but we're going to
recognize these documents that say we're here illegally."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government has advised its 48 U.S. consulates to
promote the ID cards for the estimated 3 million undocumented
Mexicans living in the United States. Applicants must provide a birth
certificate, military or school ID or other valid Mexican
identification to receive the matricula consular. A new generation of
cards incorporates security features such as holograms to discourage
forgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the measure approved Tuesday, Los Angeles city workers do
not have to accept a card they find suspicious. If police pull over a
speeding cardholder, for example, they can call the Mexican Consulate
to verify his or her identity.</TE>
<TE>   Similar measures have been approved in Phoenix, San Francisco,
Santa Ana and other cities. Banks, airlines and other businesses
courting Mexican customers have been recognizing the cards as legal
ID in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Miriam Galicia Duarte of Wells Fargo in Los Angeles said
20,000 new accounts have been opened at her bank's branches since it
began accepting the cards last November. About $50 million has been
deposited in California banks overall, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It "has been an incredible program that has given the opportunity
to thousands and thousands of individuals in the U.S. to now be a
part of the financial mainstream in this country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Hal Bernson--the lone member of the council to vote
against the pilot program--said he believes individual institutions
such as Wells Fargo have the right to decide whether to accept the ID
cards. But "I have some questions about why we should recognize this
card officially," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mehlman agreed, saying police officers can already exercise
discretion when dealing with illegal immigrants. "You couldn't do any
police work without certain discretion," he said. But "we shouldn't
be giving people any blanket assurances that they never have to worry
about the police."</TE>
<TE>   Local and police officials countered that the move--supported by
the LAPD--will help protect neighborhoods, and especially the
vulnerable residents preyed upon by slumlords and gang members who
know their victims are afraid to call the police.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be able to report crimes to the LAPD without any
fear," said Councilman Eric Garcetti. "We need to have that in our
communities."</TE>

<HD>Shameless Governor Is a Compulsive Money-Grubber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're reading this over bacon and eggs, Gov. Gray Davis has
already raised about $10,000 in campaign contributions today. If
you're reading at dinner, rest assured Davis is working harder than
anyone in hot pants and pumps, hustling to stay on his pace of
$35,000 a day and $1million a month.</LD>
<LD>   The state of California is not doing nearly as well. With a budget
deficit that has ballooned to $23.6billion on his watch, Davis was
forced to take time out from his busy fund-raising schedule Tuesday
to be governor.</LD>
<LD>   I thought maybe he was going to offer the state a loan from his
reelection campaign fund. Instead, he came up with a plan to strip
health-care services for the poor, chop education funding and raise
taxes, which he'd told us he would never do.</LD>
<TE>   But neither the suffering of the poor nor the jeers of critics
will distract Davis from his one true passion--the donation
shakedown.</TE>
<TE>   He's a marathon man who doesn't break a sweat or get a single hair
out of place, let alone display anything resembling a human emotion,
even when caught in compromising positions with his donors. It's
almost as if he's got a pathological disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Just out of curiosity, I did a little research and came upon the
National Institute of Mental Health Web site, which describes
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) like this:</TE>
<TE>   "The individual who suffers from OCD becomes trapped in a pattern
of repetitive thoughts and behaviors that are senseless and
distressing but extremely difficult to overcome.... If severe and
left untreated [OCD] can destroy a person's capacity to function at
work."</TE>
<TE>   Ring-a-ding-ding.</TE>
<TE>   The way Davis works donors, you'd think he was running against the
ghost of Ronald Reagan, when in fact Bill Simon is the ghost of Dan
Lungren. That's two flat-footed oafs in a row as opponents, and yet
Davis raises money like he's having a nervous breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Two UCLA psychiatrists told me Davis' behavior doesn't necessarily
mean he has OCD. But I can't think of a kinder act on my part than to
attribute Davis' behavior to a medical condition. No one of sound
mind can be as unremittingly shameless in hitting people up for
money.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, prison guards, software salesmen, energy barons,
grandmothers, enterprises big and small--Davis has his hand out to
one and all. If your child puts up a lemonade stand this summer and
someone pulls up in a limo to strong-arm a piece of the action,
you'll know who.</TE>
<TE>   In what might be Davis' lowest, grubbiest act to date, one of his
fund-raisers invited UC Berkeley students to come chat with the
governor. "This is a great opportunity to interact with the governor
for a mere $100," the e-mail said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, of UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies,
recalled one of these students running into his office, stunned by
the brazen come-on.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a tizzy about it, saying I wasn't going to believe what
just happened," says Cain, who thinks there might be something to the
idea that Davis should have his head looked at by trained
professionals. "He is a compulsive human being who has allowed his
compulsiveness to consume him."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, my colleague Dan Morain wrote about California Teachers
Assn. President Wayne Johnson's Valentine's Day visit with the
governor in Sacramento. It almost sounded like a visit to a Mafia
don, so I called Johnson to see if he wouldn't mind re-creating the
scene for me.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat down and started talking, I forget about what; some
legislation, I guess," says Johnson, who was with two aides. "So
we're talking, and out of the blue, he said, 'I need a million
dollars from you guys.'"</TE>
<TE>   It almost sounds like Tourette's syndrome; an uncontrollable
neurological impulse. I asked Johnson if there was any detectable
change in Davis. A normal person can't ask someone for a million
dollars without guilt, fear or shame creeping into his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   There was a silent, pregnant pause, he says. Johnson didn't
respond to the request, and Davis didn't repeat it. Just silence.
Then the conversation picked up where it left off, as if nothing had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't seem to throw him at all," Johnson says. A month later,
Johnson added, Davis hit him up again for the million.</TE>
<TE>   Hot pants and pumps, 24-7.</TE>
<TE>   Davis palmed more than $2 million in campaign contributions from
prison guards, then handed them a gargantuan raise even as the budget
deficit grew into double-digit billions. Last year, after Oracle won
a sweetheart $95-million, no-bid contract from the state, Davis got a
$25,000 check from an Oracle lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   Why would he risk public flogging for such smarmy displays?</TE>
<TE>   It's part calculation. Davis knows he'd have to commit greater
sins than selling off contracts and access before Democrats go
running into Bill Simon's arms.</TE>
<TE>   And it's part obsessive compulsion. Prozac is often prescribed,
but there may be no drug powerful enough.</TE>

<HD>When It Comes to Creativity, These Kids Wrote the Book</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the thunderous applause of their schoolmates, 27 students at
Newcastle Avenue Elementary School learned Tuesday that a book they
wrote last year as fourth-graders has won top honors in a nationwide
contest.</LD>
<LD>   "Who Let the Cat Out of the Bag," a book about idioms, won grand
prize in the nonfiction category of the Scholastic Book Fair's 16th
annual Kids Are Authors contest, which had more than 2,000 entries
from the United States, Mexico and Japan. More than 20,000 copies of
the book will be printed and available for sale--at about $4
apiece--at Scholastic Book Fairs throughout the country, beginning in
the fall.</LD>
<LD>   The illustrated book focuses on idioms such as "cut it out" and
"it's raining cats and dogs," defining each.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from a handful of officials at the Reseda school, no
one--not even the parents of the winning students--knew the purpose
of the afternoon assembly where the announcement was made.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so excited. My parents are going to be so proud," said
10-year-old Stephanie Fuentes, a native Spanish speaker who learned
English when she was 5. All of the kids who worked on the book
learned English as their second language.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the book came from their fourth-grade teacher,
Lizette Madruga, who began her teaching career last school year.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in fourth grade, I wrote a paper called 'My Profession
as a Writer.' I wanted to be Dr. Seuss," said Madruga, 24, now a
middle school teacher in South San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Many people praised the children for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, you are not just the best students. Today, you are not
just the best students in California. Today, you are the best and the
most creative students in the United States," said Bob Collins, a
superintendent for the southwest San Fernando Valley area of the Los
Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the student authors received dictionaries; in the
fall, they will each receive a copy of the book and a medal. The
school will get $2,000 in Scholastic Book Fairs merchandise.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has allocated $9.2 million from Proposition 40 funds
for restoration of the Crystal Cove State Park Historic District.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 40 provides a total of $2.6 billion to help protect
California's air, land and water for future generations. The state
Department of Parks and Recreation is to receive $225 million of
that.</LD>
<LD>   Activists had secured about half of the $10 million to $12 million
needed to transform Crystal Cove's dilapidated beachfront cottages
into lodges. Funds from the bond measure should cover the rest.</LD>

<HD>There's No Ducking the Freeway Fallout of Hatching Season
for Mallards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there a conspiracy by ducks to disrupt the freeway system? That's
what Ron Widman of Redlands asked after reading about a mother and
her offspring waddling onto the San Bernardino Freeway. He was aware
of recent incidents in which families of waddlers also disrupted
commuters on the San Diego Freeway and on Pacific Coast Highway, not
to mention Lincoln Avenue in Cypress (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   What it is, said Kimball Garrett of the L.A. County Natural
History Museum, "is duck hatching season. They're mallards, one of
the few waterfowl species that have adapted to urbanized areas." And
he explained why the m.o. always seems the same: one mom and the kids
out for a stroll.</LD>
<LD>   "The fathers don't have much direct involvement in the care of the
young," said Garrett, the ornithology collections manager. "It'll be
several weeks before the babies learn to fly and, before then, they
walk around and follow mommy. She has to find a good feeding area for
the young. If she walks across a freeway to get to one ... well,
they're very good at following mother."</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps it's time to build duck-pool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Surfing back in time: In Tuesday's column, I wrote about the
prankster who altered a crossing sign in Pasadena so that it appeared
to show a pedestrian carrying a surfboard.</TE>
<TE>   That reminded entomologist Rick Vetter about a project he was
involved in years ago at UC Riverside in which several such signs
were embellished "as performance art or guerrilla graffiti or
whatever." Most are preserved only in photos now. One showed a
pedestrian wearing a mortarboard and holding a diploma. Another, near
the Neurobiology Department, depicted a figure holding a magnifying
glass near a floating brain. And, near the Entomology Building, a
figure was shown wielding a net (see photo). And, no, the latter
wasn't chasing ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood uses stand-ins all the time: I hope you readers out
there are working as hard as I am at finding a solution to the
Hollywood sign controversy. The Hollywood secessionists want the
landmark, you'll recall, but Angelenos have said no, pointing out
it's in Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   No one seems to have embraced my idea of leaving it in place and
merely inserting an arrow pointing to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   So here's my next proposal: The secessionists should obtain the
Hollywood sign that stood inside Legoland when the amusement park in
Carlsbad opened. It's available because Legoland was forced to take
it down a few months later after the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was just an unusual homework assignment: The police log
of the Saddleback Valley News reported that some juveniles in Laguna
Hills were observed "using toilet paper to spell out words on the
hillside behind Ralphs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Owen Simon noticed that a shelf at a Sherman Oaks
library held the autobiography of National Rifle Assn. President
Charlton Heston next to a book titled "Don't Shoot It's Only Me," by
Bob Hope.</TE>

<LD>In a county increasingly divided between rich and poor, Margarita
Esquivel finds herself decidedly among the have-nots in a Stanton
apartment complex that caters to working-class immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   There is one bedroom, which holds a bunk bed for Esquivel's
daughters, 6 and 4, and a cradle for her 6-month-old son. Another bed
is reserved for nights when Esquivel must snuggle the baby to sleep,
and for naps for a neighbor child she watches during the day.</LD>
<LD>   Esquivel sleeps with her husband on a foldout sofa in the living
room, which also serves as kitchen, dining room and play area. Car
seats, a stroller, crayons and toys are scattered on the floor among
bags of empty aluminum cans the family recycles for extra cash. A
basket of mangos sits on a dining table with seating for three.</LD>
<TE>   Five people in two rooms for $800 a month, paid with wages
Esquivel's husband earns as a helper at a construction site.</TE>
<TE>   "Rent is too high," she says. "This is the way we have to live."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, it is the way Orange County lives.</TE>
<TE>   New data from the 2000 census shows that large areas of Orange
County's older core cities are becoming crowded with low-wage, poorly
educated families seeking an economic toehold in a region notorious
for its high cost of living.</TE>
<TE>   And the congestion is spreading beyond the traditional landing
spots for immigrants, such as Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Although Santa Ana remained Orange County's most crowded city in
the '90s, with more than one-third of the city's housing units
holding at least 1.51 people per room, Stanton saw one of the biggest
increases in crowding, with the number of homes holding 1.51 people
per room doubling to 20.5%--second only to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   That ratio means one in five two-bedroom homes in Stanton with a
living room and a kitchen would be home to at least six people.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is more than a statistical matter for Fernando and
Miranda Becerra, who rent out their living room in their one-bedroom,
$850-a-month Stanton apartment to strangers. The young couple
shepherd their two children into the bedroom at night while two men
sleep on mattresses on the living room floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everyone here has more people in their apartments because
they can't pay their rent otherwise," Miranda said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayra Meade, 35, manager at the Becerra's apartment complex, said
the practice is common.</TE>
<TE>   "They always tell me that they have guests, but those guests stay
there for months," she said, adding that she allows the stacking up
as long as the apartments are kept up and the rent paid.</TE>
<TE>   That is not easy.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Garcia, 32, earns the minimum wage of $6.74 an hour--about
$1,000 a month--at a 99-cent store. His wife, Maria Garcia, 28, makes
about $1,300 a month at a Walgreens. Their $800 rent is about a third
of their monthly income.</TE>
<TE>   The Garcias have five young children who sleep together in a
king-sized bed in the apartment's only bedroom. Garcia and his wife
use a sleeper in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   This is not what Garcia envisioned for himself when he came from
Mexico 14 years ago, hoping for a better life. He saw himself owning
a comfortable home for his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Garcia has been trying to build his credit and his
savings. But the home looms as a sort of mountain he can see but not
reach. Still, it is a dream delayed, not dead. "I will do it," he
vowed.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the family makes do and tries to save what it can.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard," Garcia said. "Because minimum wage is not enough to
live decently."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While other Ventura College students took finals this week, those in
Music 14 and Music 15 courses prepared for their season finales.</LD>
<LD>   Clarinetist Bernard Leventhal, 88, rehearsed for the solo
performance of a sonata he has been studying for eight months.
Trumpet player Daniel Palomino, 21, bought his first tailored suit.
Aspiring conductor Markus Montgomery, 26, slept with the score to
"The Great Gate of Kiev" and "Hopak" by Mussorgsky at his bedside, in
case he woke up with an inspiration after his late-night cramming
sessions.</LD>
<LD>   Leventhal, Palomino and Montgomery are enrolled in the college's
Community Orchestra class, which gives its last concert of the school
year tonight at 8 p.m. in the Ventura College Theater. This mandatory
performance in front of at least 400 people is the final exam.</LD>
<TE>   "Performing is a little bit more difficult than a regular test,
because if you mess up, all the people are going to hear," said
Palomino of Camarillo, who also plays in his family's mariachi band.
"It makes you want to practice instead of procrastinate."</TE>
<TE>   The 50-piece orchestra, in existence for nearly three decades, is
made up of 40 students and 10 paid semiprofessional musicians,
brought in to round out the wind, string and brass sections.</TE>
<TE>   The students run the gamut from teenagers to seniors and include
teachers, engineers, lawyers and others who just want to keep up
their musical "chops."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the epitome of a community orchestra, because it puts a guy
like me--who has been playing forever--alongside kids who are still
in high school," said Leventhal, a retired chiropractor who spent
much of the 1930s performing Big Band music on cruise ships and in
New York clubs.</TE>
<TE>   During a semester, the class meets weekly, with some evening and
weekend rehearsals before the orchestra's two concerts. The orchestra
will also perform the national anthem and "Pomp and Circumstance" at
the college's spring commencement exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Students earn only 1.5 credits for their time and effort, but the
course allows them to live out a piece of their dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a certain amount of ego satisfaction that comes with
being able to say, 'I'm probably the oldest man ever to play this
[Leonard] Bernstein sonata,'" said Leventhal of Oxnard. "I told them,
'You've got to let me do this while I still can.'"</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery said being selected to lead the orchestra during one of
its pieces was an honor that left him speechless. Although he hopes
to pursue a career as a conductor, he said that even if he doesn't
make it professionally, the leadership training will live with him
forever.</TE>
<TE>   Director Burns Taft, a veteran music professor at Ventura College,
said his orchestra and a similar one at Moorpark College fill a void
in Ventura County's music scene, where opportunities to hear
symphonic works performed the way the great composers intended are
rare.</TE>
<TE>   "To put a professional orchestra on the stage, you are talking
about millions of dollars, so people don't get many chances to hear
one," Taft said</TE>
<TE>   Taft said the students who are retirees often tell him they enjoy
performing with the orchestra because it "keeps them mentally and
physically alert in a way that other activities don't match." For the
working students, "it's an island of serenity in a hectic world, and
that's something that people need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palomino, one of the concerts four soloists, is scheduled to
perform a trumpet concerto by Haydn. Initially, he was hesitant about
telling his friends he had signed up to be in an orchestra, but a
year later, he is proud of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I find a lot of people appreciate it even if they don't
understand it," he said. "I will probably never get to play in an
orchestra after this. But it's a learning experience, and I've
encompassed everything I've learned about blending and dynamics into
my mariachi band."</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to the concert cost $10 general and $5 for students and
seniors. Proceeds help defray expenses. The theater is on Loma Vista
Road, between Central Campus Way and North Campus Way.</TE>

<HD>Park Map to Guide Planning</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The 'greenprint' of Los Angeles will include
population densities to help show which areas need more open space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles will identify areas throughout the city with the greatest
need for recreational areas and open spaces by mapping the city's
current parks, Mayor James K. Hahn said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The project, called Greenprinting Los Angeles, will help officials
determine how to allocate park funds, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "We currently have 1.2 acres of open space for every 1,000
people," Hahn said at a news conference in North Hollywood. "This is
one-tenth of what it should be. We want every Angeleno to be within
walking distance to a park."</LD>
<TE>   The mapping project will be conducted with the nonprofit
organization Trust for Public Land, which specializes in protecting
land. Using existing data, the group will create a map showing the
current distribution of parks and the population density of the areas
around them to determine which locations throughout the city need
additional park space. The resulting plan also will use socioeconomic
factors to determine need.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he hopes the inventory can help correct the situation
uncovered by a recent study, which found that the city spends a
disproportionate amount of money for park improvements in areas that
need them least.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "greenprinting" method has been used in Washington
state and New Jersey, but the L.A. project will be the first in a
metropolitan area, said Larry Kaplan, of the land trust. It is
expected to take about nine months and cost about $150,000.</TE>

<HD>Tustin Marine Base Fight Proves to Be a Learn-Learn
Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I vowed (privately) not to return from vacation until Tustin and
Santa Ana officials settled their argument over the former Tustin
Marine base. Sly as a fox, I figured to be vacationing a long, long
time.</LD>
<LD>   Given the cities' rhetoric over the years, I expected a
Sharon-Arafat brunch before Tustin and Santa Ana ever broke bread.</LD>
<LD>   Just my luck, Tustin City Hall and Santa Ana Unified School
District officials announced an end last week to what had become an
increasingly unpleasant dispute between neighboring cities.</LD>
<TE>   To recap, Tustin was the lucky beneficiary of the 1999 closure of
the base. The city came up with a development plan that didn't
include land for a new school for Santa Ana--something the federal
government had led the district a few years earlier to believe it
would get when the base closed.</TE>
<TE>   The battle was on.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, Santa Ana school officials filed a federal lawsuit.
They got a state legislator to introduce a bill on their behalf.
Tustin, offended by charges it was discriminating against Santa Ana's
Latino students, in effect told Santa Ana officials to bring it on.
It also filed suit.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the solution wasn't all that complex, which meant it
was there all the time. Santa Ana got 22 acres (it originally wanted
about 100) for an elementary-middle school. The district also
received $38 million to buy land for a new high school elsewhere. If
the 22 acres prove too contaminated for a school site, Tustin will
pay the school district another $22 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now that everyone is all kissy-face, what better time to ask the
parties what they might have done differently? That is, did the
combatants learn anything during the protracted, contentious fight?</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed separately, Santa Ana school board president John
Palacio and Tustin City Manager Bill Huston gave remarkably similar
and nondefensive answers. Both say the rancor is gone and that each
side made mistakes and learned something during the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both sides were very passionate about their position, and
rightfully so," Palacio said. "Both parties came to the realization
that the longer we took in making closure, there weren't going to be
winners and losers, because the loser would always have an appeal....
Had we come to that realization years ago, perhaps we could have
settled much sooner."</TE>
<TE>   However, Palacio then used almost exactly the same language as
Huston would later: "It was a process we had to go through," Palacio
said, "as difficult as it was."</TE>
<TE>   Palacio said he doesn't mistrust Tustin's motives. While not
apologizing for anything said from Santa Ana's side, he said the
racial element became "part of the negotiation process. I think both
boards will say that each party had to do what it had to do in order
to represent its position."</TE>
<TE>   I asked Palacio, as a school board member for four years, what
lesson was learned. "Listening," he said. "When you're in the heat of
battle, you've been fighting for eight years, you're passionate about
your position, sometimes from the inside maybe you don't see that
you're not listening to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Huston was equally upbeat and conciliatory, without pulling
punches. I asked him the same questions I'd asked Palacio. He began
by saying, "I'm going to ramble a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several minutes, he replayed the contentious and
multilayered history of the matter and said its resolution might
serve as a guide for future disputes--especially in a demographically
changing California when racial elements get tossed into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Offended by charges of discrimination--partly because its own city
is so ethnically diverse--Tustin hunkered down in the face of the
allegation. "We underestimated the passion of the Santa Ana school
district," Huston said. "I think both sides misread each other a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   Like families that fight, Huston said, when it's over, "you regret
that you were having the fight, you step back and say that you're all
part of the family and you've got to make it work. We're all part of
the same community."</TE>
<TE>   I asked about lingering resentment. "Obviously, there have been
hard feelings and harsh words," Huston said. "But the resentment is
not there because we're all so elated with moving on. If there was
any resentment, it lasted five seconds. It's time now to move on."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Huston said, "it got down to classic communication,
trying to understand the other party's point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Agreed, Palacio said.</TE>
<TE>   He told me he'd met earlier in the day with Tustin Mayor Jeffery
Thomas. One of the things on the table was a proposed joint-use
library on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "As of this morning," Palacio said, "we're talking about doing a
deal together."</TE>

<HD>Ballot Forger Picked On the Wrong Person in March Election
Mess</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a mess, the primary election. March madness comes to
California.</LD>
<LD>   The rules changed. The election date changed. Some polling places
had no ballots. Some polling places had ballots, but no one to hand
them out. Some polling places had no places.</LD>
<LD>   It was Monty Python's Election Day, except that Monty Python would
have pulled a better turnout. On March 5, only one registered
California voter in three bothered to vote at all.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately for somebody--we don't yet know who--one of those
one-in-three voters was Andrea Drever.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Drever lives in Santa Monica, the much-mocked old People's
Republic, where, I am impressed to say, every cup of coffee you
drink, every buck you slip to a street character, can be considered a
political act: Is that latte brewed from environmentally responsible
shade-grown beans? Is that buck going to pickling the liver of a
panhandler?</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Drever votes. If she doesn't, she feels guilty. Her
boyfriend is from South Africa, where, a few years back, the world
saw millions of people waiting stoically in the sun, in lines five
and six hours long, to vote in their first free elections. Her
friends are "always campaigning, always fighting for women's rights
and all kinds of things, so compared to them I feel very lame."</TE>
<TE>   But--there's always a but, or there wouldn't be a story--but on
Tuesday, March 5, Drever strolled around the corner, to a little
church on Lincoln Boulevard, to vote.</TE>
<TE>   This time, she wasn't handed the Democratic ballot and waved over
to a flimsy voting booth. She was told she'd already applied for an
absentee ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'No, I didn't.' It made me really suspicious.... It made
me mad that somebody was out there voting in my name, or trying to,
and maybe in other people's names." Drever cast a provisional ballot,
and went off to work, and there, she began to lock and load those
weapons of democracy: the telephone and the fax machine.</TE>
<TE>   Drever is an advertising copywriter. Her words can entice people
into spending thousands of dollars on cars. She knows how to write a
letter. She knows how to make a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Once she got over that I've-been-mugged sense of violation, "I was
really happy they did it to me. I'm the last person they want to do
this to.... I want someone to get in trouble over this."</TE>
<TE>   She sent her complaint to the county's registrar-recorder, Conny
McCormack, with a note, "I am very upset about this. Please contact
me if I can be of any help in prosecuting this person." Two weeks
passed, then two months. When she didn't hear back--well, she
figured, it's a little gripe in a big county.</TE>
<TE>   And then this week, the county's letter arrived. There was a copy
of the absentee ballot application, with "Andrea Drever" and a
signature not remotely her own. A forgery.</TE>
<TE>   The absentee ballot form was provided by the Committee for Safety
and Modernization at Santa Monica College. That was a campaign run by
former Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, one of those guys who takes
the trouble to find out what kind of coffee beans go into his latte
and what kind of pollution is going into his lungs.</TE>
<TE>   His firm, Urban Dimensions, came aboard to help pass a bond
measure for $160 million for campus construction and repairs. It did
pass, by more than two to one.</TE>
<TE>   Zane was on a rare holiday Tuesday, but Luis Marquez at Zane's
firm said the absentee ballot applications were handled by a West
L.A. company called EDH and Associates, where nobody was picking up
the phone on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Drever's was not the only voter complaint, or even the
first. The county has sent out scores of inquiries about suspicious
absentee ballots, and 177 answers have come back. Some voters say
they only signed a petition to put the measure to a vote--they did
not apply for absentee ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop for this is the district attorney's Public Integrity
Division, where only one complaint was sent so far, and that one was
sent back to the county clerk for more information.</TE>
<TE>   Drip, drip, drip--176 more complaints, and perhaps you wind up
with something.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever did this was taking a chance, but not much of one. In the
electoral crapshoot, who bothers to vote? Of those who bother, how
many will put up a fuss if they're told there's a problem?</TE>
<TE>   After all, it's not anything serious, like a forged check. It's
just one vote. Isn't it?</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Pike Finally Underway</HD>
<DH>Development: Work begins on long-delayed, $130-million
waterfront entertainment complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach officials were pinching themselves on Tuesday to make sure
it had finally started: construction of a $130-million waterfront
entertainment center called the Pike at Rainbow Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 14 years of planning, intense public scrutiny, financial
setbacks and legal delays are "finally behind us," said Long Beach
Mayor Beverly O'Neill during a ceremonial groundbreaking attended by
about 300 people.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a significant day in the revitalization of Long Beach,"
she said. "This area is going to be teeming with people enjoying
themselves."</LD>
<TE>   The 380,000-square-foot development will feature a mix of
restaurants and entertainment venues, including a 14-screen Crown
Theater and a 40,000-square-foot Gameworks.</TE>
<TE>   It is scheduled to open in September 2003--two years behind
schedule--on 18 acres of city-owned land south of Ocean Boulevard,
between the Long Beach Convention Center and the Aquarium of the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The project was originally known as Queensway Bay, but the new
name, and the site itself, carry historical significance in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Pike was a sprawling seaside amusement zone and billed itself
as the "Place Where Fun Was Invented." In 1954, the Pike was ranked
among the top five amusement centers in the nation. But in time it
declined and in 1979 it closed for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Pike at Rainbow Harbor is the centerpiece of a coastline
revival envisioned in 1992 as part of a plan to lure visitors back to
downtown Long Beach, which at that time was struggling to cope with
the closure of the Naval Shipyard and the loss of about 50,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Many other elements of that plan have been in place for years,
including the Long Beach Convention &amp; Entertainment Center, Shoreline
Village, the Queen Mary and the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The $120-million aquarium, which has suffered a steady decline in
attendance and revenue since it opened in 1998, is counting on the
Pike's 50 tenants to attract more paying customers.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, Diversified Realty Corp., has already invested $15
million in the project and signed agreements with restaurants and
watering holes, including California Pizza Kitchen, Harry's Bar,
National Sports Grill, Gladstone's, Subway, Daphne's Greek Cafe and
Quizno's.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the new center will generate hundreds of
construction jobs, up to $100 million a year in sales, and about $1
million a year in tax revenue for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's commitment to the Pike includes construction of a
2,200-car parking structure near the foot of downtown's Pike Street.</TE>
<TE>   The development will be about 70,000 square feet smaller than
originally envisioned. A huge Ferris wheel promised in the original
development package was dropped. Some critics were disappointed over
what they viewed as a lackluster list of tenants.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials dismissed all that on Tuesday as
inconsequential in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   "The waterfront is the 'wow factor' in this development," said
Deputy City Manager Reginald Harrison. "While it may not be unusual
to have a Gameworks, where else will you be able to step outside and
stroll the coastline?"</TE>
<TE>   "Once it's up and running," he added, "there will be plenty of
opportunities to fine-tune."</TE>

<HD>Disparities Found in Per-Pupil Spending</HD>
<DH>Education: Report says $1,700 separates highest (Laguna
Beach) from lowest (Orange) district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A county education report shows wide disparities in how much money
public schools in Orange County are spending on their students.</LD>
<LD>   The school district with the highest per-pupil expenses, Laguna
Beach Unified, spent $7,411 per student in the 2000-01 school year,
while the lowest-spending district, Orange Unified, spent $5,632 per
pupil, a difference of more than $1,700, according to the report from
the Orange County Department of Education.</LD>
<LD>   There are several reasons for the differences, education officials
said. They have to do with the two ways that districts can be funded,
along with the state's complex formula for giving school districts
money for each student. Private donations also play a role, as do
funds that districts might receive for children with special needs.</LD>
<TE>   Laguna Beach, for example, is one of the county's basic aid
districts, meaning it gets most of its funding from property taxes,
rather than being funded by the state for each student that attends.
With growing property values in a high-priced area, the district is
well-funded. In books alone, Laguna Beach Unified spent about $400
per student, almost twice the amount spent in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had $300 more per student, that's more than $5.4 million
that we would have," said Brock Wagner, Tustin Unified School
District's assistant superintendent of business. The district spent
less than $6,000 per student, lower than the average for unified
school districts, which cover grades kindergarten through 12. "I
could do a lot if I had $5.4 million more."</TE>
<TE>   The district could hire specialists, beef up programs or make
campus improvements, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified School District spent $6,477 per student last
year--the second-highest per-pupil spending among the county's 12
unified school districts. That's partly because it also got roughly
$23.8 million from the state for special education--far more than any
other unified school district in the county. With more than 5,000
special education students, Santa Ana Unified has one of the largest
programs in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a greater need for special education funding than other
districts," said Wendy Margarita, assistant superintendent of
business services for the county Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   The per-student spending figures do not include construction bonds
that many Orange County districts have passed.</TE>
<TE>   Some school officials say the disparity has more to do with the
formula the state uses to allocate money than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Until the late 1970s, school districts relied on local taxes for
funding. Proposition 13 in 1978 changed that system, distributing the
money for most districts centrally from the state, based on how many
students attended. But the per-student formula was based to some
extent on property values at the time. Over the years, relative
property values have shifted considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified, for example, receives about $100 less per student
from the state than the state average, while Los Alamitos Unified's
is $202 higher.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because Irvine was pretty much lima beans when these base
revenue limits were set," Margarita said. "Their property taxes would
have been much less than an area such as Los Alamitos, which was much
more urban."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Irvine has relied on private donations to keep
science and other programs going.</TE>
<TE>   The county's per-student spending figure for Orange Unified
doesn't include $3.6 million that the district paid in benefits to
its retired teachers who are over 65. No other district in the county
offers that benefit and carries that expense, said Linda Gibbs, the
district's assistant superintendent of business and finance.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we included that, our per-student expenses would have gone up
to $5,755," Gibbs said.</TE>
<TE>   But the district would still be the lowest among the county's
unified districts, and second lowest in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Most districts in the county fall below the state average--but
still are better off than they would have been in the pre-Proposition
13 days, when funding was based on property values alone.</TE>
<TE>   The exception is a smattering of districts throughout the state
such as Laguna Beach, where property taxes are high enough that the
state determines that the district is better off using that as the
source of funding.</TE>
<TE>   "Our property taxes run pretty high," said Norma Shelton, Laguna
Beach Unified's assistant superintendent of business services. "We
feel fortunate that we were able to have those expenditures. It shows
that we're ... able to provide the best education possible for the
students."</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>District Spending
Laguna Beach schools spent more on its students last year than
any other unified school district in the county--almost $2,000
more per student than schools in Orange Unified, which spent the
least, according to an annual study conducted by the Orange
County Department of Education.</TE>

<HD>Judge Finds Man Guilty of Attacks on Teachers</HD>
<DH>Court: Monthlong crime spree victimized four women at two
schools in South-Central L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who victimized four teachers at two South-Central Los Angeles
schools over a one-month period was convicted Tuesday of robbery,
kidnapping and rape.</LD>
<LD>   Antwon Marshall, 19, who fled his crimes on a bicycle, faces a
possible life sentence for the attacks. Sentencing is set for May 31.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall waived his right to a jury and was tried by Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Norman J. Shapiro. The trial lasted
nearly a week, and included testimony from four victims.</LD>
<TE>   Shapiro found Marshall guilty of rape, oral copulation,
second-degree robbery and kidnapping for an attack on Aug. 20. He
also convicted Marshall of robbery, attempted robbery and assault
with a deadly weapon for two other incidents in July. Shapiro
dismissed a count of second-degree robbery in an alleged fourth
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall began his crime spree by robbing his victims, and his
behavior escalated until the violent attack Aug. 20, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. Sam Dordulian. "He preyed on teachers," Dordulian said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall rode up to Barrett Elementary School on his bicycle on
July 23 and robbed a teacher at gunpoint, Dordulian said. The next
day, he rode his bicycle to 99th Street Elementary School and
demanded that a woman go into the women's bathroom on campus. She
refused, and he fled when he saw a police car nearby, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 20, Marshall returned to the 99th Street school about
10:30 a.m. Two women, both new teachers, were setting up their joint
classroom and had left the door open. Marshall entered with a gun and
demanded money from them. He then sexually assaulted them before
taking their money and cell phones, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   As Marshall started to lead his victims to a nearby ATM machine,
the women escaped when they saw a few of their colleagues. Marshall
fled on his bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   "He told them he was going to kill them," Dordulian said. "Both
victims were terrified and shaken."</TE>
<TE>   School officials and police did not release any information about
the rapes until two days later, prompting criticism from residents in
the neighborhood. Police said they did not say anything earlier
because they did not want to jeopardize their investigation.</TE>

<HD>Trial Is Ordered in Scalding of Boy</HD>
<DH>Hearing: His parents, fearing their children would be taken
from them, sought care in Mexico, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oxnard parents of a 3-year-old who was scalded after soiling his
pants took the boy to Tijuana for treatment to prevent their four
children from being taken away, a detective testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Maria and Alfredo Esquivel, both 26, told police they feared
authorities would remove their children from their home because they
had previously been convicted of beating their 2-year-old daughter,
Oxnard Police Det. Kenneth Klapman said during a preliminary hearing
for the couple.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Roland Phelan ruled later
Tuesday that there was enough evidence to support a trial of the gas
station attendant and his homemaker wife.</LD>
<TE>   A trial date is scheduled to be set May 28. The Esquivels are
charged with seven felony counts, including torture, for allegedly
plunging their son, Fabian, into a bathtub of 145-degree water on
Dec. 21. The second- and third-degree burns covering 20% of his body
from the waist down required hours of skin-replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Klapman also said that Alfredo Esquivel admitted to police that he
held his son under the scalding water despite the boy's screams to
let him out as Maria Esquivel bathed him.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point he saw Fabian's feet and legs turning red and
thought, 'What am I doing?' and removed him from the water," Klapman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Esquivels agreed that Alfredo's mother, Luz Rodriguez,
would take the boy across the border, they waited at least six hours
to leave so Rodriguez's boyfriend could accompany them, Klapman said.</TE>
<TE>   Fabian finally received medical attention at a Tijuana hospital 18
hours after he was burned. He was transferred to UC San Diego Medical
Center five days later with severely infected wounds and underwent
skin graft surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Before Fabian left Oxnard, the Esquivels had applied aloe vera
from a plant in their front yard and egg yolk to the wounds,
witnesses said during the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We sneer and look down our noses at Mexican remedies, but they
really thought they were getting good medical treatment for their son
when they took him to Mexico," said Randy Tucker, Alfredo Esquivel's
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   He and Maria Esquivel's attorney, Charles Caffy, said the two were
loving parents who had planned to take their four children to a Chuck
E. Cheese's restaurant that day.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Esquivel was convicted in 1999 of hitting his daughter

<LD>County planner Charles Antos was elected to the Seal Beach City
Council on Tuesday in a runoff to replace Shawn Boyd in the Old Town
district.</LD>
<LD>   Antos, who will be sworn in at a council meeting May 21, received
580 votes, or 62.2%. He defeated businesswoman Beverly Pearce, who
got 352, or 37.7%.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County district attorney is investigating Boyd's
business connections. Boyd, 33, was defeated in the March election,
coming in third in a field of four candidates.</LD>
<TE>   He has not been charged with a crime and has said the
investigation of his alleged voting on the purchase of a trailer park
while having business connections with the owner is why he lost his
reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   Antos faces such issues as a utility-users tax, the lack of
low-income housing and the future of 10 acres owned by the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP property, vacant for more than 30 years, has been zoned
for a hotel on three acres and open space on the rest. There are no
plans to build the hotel, and there is concern the site may be
contaminated with asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   The city has an 11% utility-users tax. There has been discussion
about lowering the tax, eliminating it or letting voters decide its
fate.</TE>

<HD>Valley Secession Proposal Too Flawed for Ballot, L.A. Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: Council urges state panel to not set an election
until financial concerns are addressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a crucial decision on San Fernando Valley secession a week away,
Los Angeles city leaders Tuesday mounted a last-ditch attack on the
breakup proposal, saying it should not be placed on the November
ballot without major revisions.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted unanimously to recommend that a state
commission not schedule a secession election until Los Angeles'
concerns about the proposal's financial impact are addressed. The
council claims that the plan would create a multimillion-dollar hole
in the city's budget.</LD>
<LD>   By California law, a secession measure can be put to a citywide
vote only if the Local Agency Formation Commission finds the breakup
"revenue neutral," or financially fair to both the Valley and the
remainder of the city.</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO is scheduled to vote May 22 on whether to call a secession
election. Its staff has determined that an independent Valley would
be financially healthy, and that a breakup would not harm the
remainder of the city.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles officials have repeatedly challenged LAFCO's math.
On Tuesday, the council adopted a consultant's report showing that
secession would cost the city at least $153 million a year in lost
revenue, money that a Valley city would have to pay Los Angeles in
so-called alimony.</TE>
<TE>   That estimate is almost three times the $55.8 million in payments
proposed by LAFCO. But it is much lower than the nearly $300 million
that city officials had previously demanded.</TE>
<TE>   The council's action also means the city will not agree to
transfer assets in the Valley, such as fire and police stations,
without compensation, because it does not believe it has been made
financially whole. LAFCO, which is also reviewing secession proposals
for Hollywood and the harbor area, has said it can require asset
transfers even if the city objects.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line for the city of Los Angeles could be catastrophic
if this is not recognized," said Ed Hamilton of the consulting firm
Hamilton, Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler Inc., hired by the city to analyze
likely costs again.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's estimates were based on a review of just eight of the
more than 40 city departments. It examined "stranded" costs for
centralized services that Los Angeles says it would still carry if
the Valley broke away.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists called the city's objections fodder for a possible
lawsuit aimed at keeping Valley cityhood off the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, head of the secession group Valley VOTE, noted that
LAFCO has rejected the stranded costs argument. Los Angeles could cut
its costs if it no longer has to serve the Valley, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The city is coming up with as much as it can to build a legal
case to challenge a vote on cityhood or to scare residents of the
city into believing the city will go broke," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   The council also approved a report by city Administrative Officer
William Fujioka that says LAFCO failed to properly study the
viability of Valley cityhood, and did not fully consider the negative
fiscal impact of secession on the remainder of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Fujioka report is scheduled to be considered by LAFCO today.
It raises 20 objections to the cityhood study, all of which address
financial issues that LAFCO has been wrestling with for two years.</TE>
<TE>   City services in Los Angeles after secession would have to be cut
by about $303 million over the next 27 years, the report says. It
contends that LAFCO inaccurately divided bond debt between Los
Angeles and a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Fujioka told the council, the proposed $18-million
reserve fund for the Valley is "woefully inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   City officials also said LAFCO erred in not including a $4-million
annual deficit at Van Nuys Airport in the commission's fiscal study.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Fred Merkin raised legal objections to the
LAFCO study, saying it does not meet the requirement for a thorough
examination of the potential financial harm to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Merkin and the council also maintained that LAFCO does not have
authority to force Los Angeles to charge residents of a Valley city
the same water and power rates assessed in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Public Access Laws Deemed Adequate</HD>
<DH>Analysis: L.A. County supervisors are told that no more
reforms are needed to ensure open government. Yaroslavsky disagrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State laws and new local policies are sufficient to ensure access to
county government, and no new reforms are needed, according to the
law firm hired by the Board of Supervisors to review open government
proposals.</LD>
<LD>   J. Kenneth Brown was hired last month to analyze a proposed open
government ordinance and to advise the board on some of its own
suggestions for reform.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, in a six-page memorandum, Brown said he thought the
board ought not to implement anything beyond what it voted to do last
month and what is required by state law. Among the proposals he
recommended against were moves to shorten the time limit for
releasing short public records, to provide settlement agreements to
the public as soon as they are reached and to give the public access
to supporting documents.</LD>
<TE>   "I do not recommend that the board adopt any other aspect of the
Sunshine Act," he said. Current state laws "provide sufficient
guidance" for access, he added, pointing out that few local
governments have passed their own ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   If the board decides to make reforms, supervisors ought to do so
through easily changed policies, rather than laws, Brown recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and advocates of public access
criticized Brown's report, saying it was a shallow analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that the status quo is fine," said Yaroslavsky,
who proposed the majority of the reforms the board has implemented.
"I'm just frustrated that after a month, this is where we are."</TE>
<TE>   The county's policies on public access have been a subject of
complaints by some advocates for many years. The current push for
increased public participation began after the inadvertent disclosure
of a secret board vote to kill a proposed ballot initiative. The
issue became a lightning rod, giving various groups an audience to
air their grievances about the county's closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis last month by The Times found that more than 90% of
the supervisors' official business was conducted without public
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors typically meet individually with the county
administrative officer on Mondays to discuss the board's Tuesday
agenda. In addition, the supervisors' aides meet in private before
the board's official sessions to resolve policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of mounting public pressure, the board voted on April
2 to improve access to county government. The board voted to
tape-record its private meetings, post more public documents relating
to county business on the Internet, provide a better explanation of
matters discussed behind closed doors and allow the public to view
meetings of the supervisors' deputies.</TE>
<TE>   The board hired Brown to examine several additional proposals
after advocates and some supervisors raised concerns about County
Counsel Lloyd Pellman, who has advised against increased public
access and also is at the center of the controversy over secret votes
and meetings that have led to calls for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's firm was already representing the county in a lawsuit
filed by the Los Angeles Times that accuses the board of violating
open meeting laws. Supervisors Gloria Molina and Don Knabe said they
thought hiring Brown as a consultant on reforms would be efficient
because he would be familiar with the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates of public access complain that the dual role
creates unsurmountable conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem to us that [to defend the lawsuit] they would need
things to stay the same, and that's what they recommend," Karen Ocamb
of the Los Angeles Press Club told the board Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Her group asked, and was granted, two weeks in which to prepare a
response to Brown's report before the supervisors take further
action.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's firm, Brown, Winfield &amp; Canzoneri, does other defense work
for the county. It has been paid more than $1.1 million by the county
since the beginning of the fiscal year in July, according to county
documents. Brown said his analysis so far will cost the taxpayers
about $10,000 to $15,000. The county administrator estimates the
total bill for Brown's advice will be $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brown denied any conflict of interest, insisting that reforms are
not admissions of past guilt. He said he simply did not like the
specific provisions of the Sunshine Act proposed by Ocamb and others.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Santana, a spokesman for Molina, said it is too soon to
judge Brown's work. Many on the board said Brown--and the county--are
hamstrung by the pending lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think his job is over. At some point, we're going to
need some analysis of what we could do that's better than what we
have today," Santana said.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Shootings of Mother, Brother in Glendale</HD>
<DH>Rampage: Alleged murder-suicide attempt leaves woman dead
and two sons critically hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly shooting his mother
to death and critically wounding his brother before turning the gun
on himself, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Taron Gorgoyan, 22, was in critical condition in the Los Angeles
County Jail ward late Tuesday with what investigators believe was a
self-inflicted shotgun wound to his head, said Sgt. Kirk Palmer, a
spokesman for the Glendale Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer said the motive for the shootings remained unknown Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The shootings occurred about 3 p.m. Monday in the family's
two-bedroom apartment in the 500 block of West Lexington Avenue, a
tree-lined neighborhood of houses and apartment buildings just south
of the Pasadena Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect's mother, Karine Kostanyan, 49, was pronounced dead 90
minutes after the incident from a single shotgun wound to the upper
body, police said. Her son David Gorgoyan, 19, who was shot in the
stomach, remained in critical condition late Tuesday at Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we think happened is that Taron shot his brother and his
mother, though we don't know in what order," Palmer said. "Then, he
attempted suicide by turning the shotgun on himself."</TE>
<TE>   Police said they don't know how soon they can conduct extensive
interviews with either brother because of their injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said one of the brothers called 911 following the
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the family had been under stress since Kostanyan's
husband died several months ago of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "The family took it hard," Palmer said. "Whether or not it was a
factor in this incident, we still don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and friends described the family as close-knit.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Parker, who lives nearby, spoke highly of David.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the nicest guy," Parker said. "He was the nicest kid I ever
met."</TE>

<HD>County Bans New Ad Signs</HD>
<DH>Billboards: Board approves temporary moratorium in
unincorporated areas after L.A.'s embargo prompts a flood of
requests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday
to temporarily ban new billboards in unincorporated areas.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who proposed the emergency
moratorium, said she expected to have the board's support for a
permanent ban of such "visual blight" within a year for the 2,653
square miles of unincorporated territory, an area more than twice the
size of Rhode Island.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors said they had been responding to a flood of
applications for new signs since the city of Los Angeles approved a
permanent ban on new billboards two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   "The billboard industry has known that L.A. city was drafting
their ban for some time, so they had already begun making their moves
to apply for new billboards in the unincorporated areas of the
county," said Burke's spokeswoman, Glenda Wina.</TE>
<TE>   Under the provisions of Tuesday's moratorium, billboards in the
unincorporated county areas will be capped at the current 692 for 45
days. At the end of that period, Burke and others said, they expect
to have the moratorium extended while a study is conducted and the
supervisors reach a permanent decision.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard companies and lobbyists reached Tuesday declined to
comment on the moratorium. Some said they were caught off guard by
the board's action and have not had time to formulate a response.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted with the city of Los Angeles' ban on new
billboards, the industry unsuccessfully proposed to take down
one-fourth of the city's 10,000 billboards in exchange for being able
to erect 50 double-sided ads along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Since April 2000, applications have been submitted for 78 new
billboards in the unincorporated areas of the county; 56 of the
applications were for sites in Burke's district in southwest Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty were approved overall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 41-year-old Port Hueneme man who allegedly used a box cutter to
fatally slash his wife pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a single count
of murder.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Solis entered the plea during an arraignment in Ventura
County Superior Court. Solis denied an allegation that he used a
cutting device during the slaying, and he denied an allegation that
he violated his probation on a drunk driving case.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary hearing on the murder charge and related allegations
is set for June 26.</LD>
<TE>   Solis, whom police described as a construction worker on
disability from a back injury, was arrested after police found his
wife, 51-year-old Olga Solis, dead in the couple's bed last month.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned relatives had called police after a family member
noticed suspicious cuts on Solis' wrists and neck, authorities said.
Relatives told police the couple had a history of marital problems.</TE>
<TE>   Solis remains jailed on $500,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Council Motions Back Stadium Proposal</HD>
<DH>Sports: Plans call for reimbursement of city funds for NFL
facility and exploratory panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the NFL announced creation of a group to explore football in Los
Angeles, several City Council members introduced motions Tuesday to
allow the use of public money to help build a stadium as long as the
city is repaid, to find potential stadium sites and to create a
special committee to negotiate with the league.</LD>
<LD>   The flurry of legislative activity comes as Los Angeles lawmakers
increasingly are turning their attention to the quest for a football
franchise--an idea that the city pursued vigorously several years
ago, only to lose out to Houston in 1999. That disappointed
supporters in Los Angeles and some National Football League
officials, who have been working on and off to bring a team to the
city ever since the Rams and later the Raiders left.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, both camps were moving ahead on their own fronts. In
Houston, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue appointed a group of five
owners to explore alternatives for returning pro football to Los
Angeles. Tagliabue also hinted that expanding the league might be an
option.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Councilmen Nick Pacheco and Dennis Zine introduced a
motion to allow the use of money generated by the City Center
redevelopment project in downtown Los Angeles for construction of a
football stadium--as long as that money is repaid to the city
treasury.</TE>
<TE>   The motion forbids any public subsidy that is not reimbursed but
would also allow a developer to use the Community Redevelopment
Agency's power to assemble and acquire land and relocate residents
and businesses for a stadium in the 879-acre redevelopment district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common sense," Pacheco said. "At the end of the day, I want
to make sure we get our money back."</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment plan--which lawmakers say was drafted without
football in mind but which has clear opportunities to assist that
effort--is expected to generate $2.4 billion in property taxes and
other revenue over the next 30 to 45 years. That money is supposed to
be funneled back into the district to create houses and jobs, lure
commercial and industrial businesses, help the homeless and restore
historic buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The motion endorses the Staples Center as a model for financing a
sports facility. It was primarily built with private funds but
received a $12-million public subsidy through a previous downtown
redevelopment plan.</TE>
<TE>   The original draft of the motion released Monday said no city
money could be used under any circumstances. Pacheco said the draft
was released in error, and that no one lobbied him to change it.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco also said he talked to Tim Leiweke--part of a powerful
coalition trying to build a state-of-the-art stadium in South
Park--late Monday and was asked to serve on a team of officials
working on bringing football back to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke represents Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, the
principal backer behind Staples Center. Attempts to reach officials
from Anschutz's company late Tuesday were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas proposed making the redevelopment
agency scour blighted areas that it is revitalizing for potential
stadium sites. Council President Alex Padilla and members Eric
Garcetti and Jan Perry also signed that motion, which might expand
the city's search for sites.</TE>
<TE>   "It further advances the point that has been lost on some--that
there are options from which to choose, and we will see which option
finally presents itself as the most compelling or credible,"
Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   His motion also would form an ad hoc sports-franchise committee,
as was created in Los Angeles' last bid for a team, "as a vehicle for
City representatives to work with the National Football League," the
motion says.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, who headed the previous committee, said the
creation of another panel will help clarify the situation and give
the public greater insight into the negotiations over a stadium and
team.</TE>
<TE>   "It will cause it to be dealt with in the light of day, rather
than behind the scenes, particularly if public dollars are going to
be involved in any way," he said.</TE>

<LD>Two people, one of them a 16-year-old boy and the other a 41-year-old
man, were shot to death in apparently unrelated incidents on the
streets of Compton, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Denis Gibbs, 41, was felled by a single gunshot about 10 p.m.
Monday as he stood at a pay phone at Wilmington Avenue and 133rd
Street, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours earlier, a 16-year-old boy on a bicycle in the 1900
block of Slater Avenue was fatally shot by another bicyclist.
Authorities said the shooter was between 16 and 18, and that the
shooting probably was gang-related.</LD>
<TE>   The boy's name was withheld pending notification of his family.</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Boom Offset by Rise in Poverty</HD>
<DH>Census: Figures for Ventura County show a nearly 44%
increase during the 1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although rich compared with the rest of California, Ventura County
treaded water financially during the 1990s as a high-tech boom was
offset by a sharp increase in poverty, especially in farm worker
communities.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the number of county families earning $150,000 annually
tripled during the past decade, the number of residents living below
the poverty line rose nearly 44%, the U.S. Census Bureau reported
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the $59,666 income of the typical Ventura County
household was still 26% higher than the statewide norm, the census
reported.</LD>
<TE>   But poverty in the county increased at a faster pace than
statewide, from 7.3% of the local population a decade ago to 9.2%,
accounting for 68,540 people.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the number of impoverished children rose by 39%, three times
the county's overall growth rate during the past decade, according to
the census.</TE>
<TE>   County residents are generally richer, better educated and own
more homes than a decade ago. But they also live in more crowded
dwellings, speak less English at home and are more racially
segregated in their communities.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a widening gap between the rich and poor in this county,"
economics professor Jamshid Damooei of Cal Lutheran University said.
"We're looking at an increasingly rich county with a very bad income
gap. We're getting richer, but only for certain groups, not all."</TE>
<TE>   The widening gulf often breaks along lines of race, ethnicity and
educational attainment--a well-educated white majority and a
less-skilled Latino minority. And between the affluent east county
and the poorer west.</TE>
<TE>   Income and educational breakdowns by race won't be available for
months, but new census data and previous studies show the disparity.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in predominately white Thousand Oaks, where 42% of
adults have at least a four-year degree, income per person is more
than double that in Oxnard, Santa Paula and Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   In those three farm communities of the Santa Clara Valley and
Oxnard Plain, between 9% and 14% of adults have college degrees, and
English is spoken as the primary language in fewer than half of the
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "In this county, even more than the state, we've created a
two-tier world," planning expert Bill Fulton of Ventura said. "The
two tiers are geographically segregated, which is pretty common, but
is starker here because of our land-use policies."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, voters throughout the county have approved anti-sprawl
measures that set city boundaries and guarantee separation among
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, land-use policies that have allowed our communities
to retain their distinctive characteristics have also made them more
segregated and more different," Fulton said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Schniepp, executive director of the California Economic
Forecast in Santa Barbara, said he isn't alarmed by the increasing
poverty rate. Nor does he believe Ventura County is less affluent
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The poverty statistics reflect large Latino families, not the
increasing spread of poverty, he said. Indeed, just 6.4% of the
county's 184,378 families were impoverished in 2000, up from 1990 but
still low compared with the state's 10.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree that the county is getting worse off," Schniepp
said. "Yes, the lower end seems to be widening, with increased
immigration. But overall, salaries are rising, more people own homes,
we've got better schools and lower crime rates, hardly any inflation,
and anybody who wants a job can find one."</TE>
<TE>   The working poor of Oxnard, Santa Paula and Fillmore are not as
well off as other county residents, Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the broader question is: Are these people worse off than they
were?" Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   No, he said, because they immigrated to this country for jobs and
have begun to work themselves up the American economic ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "These three cities are poorer, more Hispanic and more segregated,
but that doesn't mean they're worse off," Schniepp said. "Their
quality of life is improved, not diminished."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Lawson, director of Oxnard's census outreach project, agreed
the increase in the poverty rate is not necessarily a bad thing, or
something to worry too much about.</TE>
<TE>   The higher number of poor people reflects the type of crops being
picked today--a broad switch from citrus to strawberries, a
labor-intensive crop, he said. The increased poverty rate, he added,
also reflects an end to migrant labor. Workers now generally stay put
instead of following seasonal crops.</TE>
<TE>   "The poverty is not permanent, and that's the key," Lawson said.
"Nobody wants to see it increase, but we're talking about an
immigrant group rising up the economic ladder."</TE>
<TE>   A sure sign that is occurring is the increase in home ownership in
Oxnard and Fillmore, Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, nearly 4,000 more individuals and families lived in
homes they owned in 2000 than did a decade earlier, and that city's
rate of ownership--57.3%--is now higher than California's overall.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore's rate is even higher, at 63.2%, and rising. Santa
Paula's rate of 57.7% reflects a slight decline. In comparison, the
Ventura County rate rose to 67.6% in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "If home ownership rates continue to increase, and we avoid any
massive new influx of immigration, those [poverty] numbers will come
down," Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It means wealth accumulation and eventually a way out of poverty.
Home ownership opens the door for seed money for training or college
or to start a business."</TE>
<TE>   When the two faces of Ventura County are viewed as a whole, this
semirural coastal area of 753,000 residents still stacks up favorably
with the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   About 38% of households earned more than $75,000 a year, compared
with 29% statewide, according to the data. About 27% of local
households earned less than $35,000, compared with 37% statewide.
County residents also had a higher rate of college degrees and high
school diplomas, fewer crowded homes, and more families spoke English
at home than elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the county's household income barely stayed with inflation
during the 1990s. The median household income--where half are higher
and half lower--increased $14,054 in 10 years to nearly $60,000, the
figures show. But after adjustments for inflation, the 1990 figure
was within $158 of the 2000 median.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, incomes gauged by household, family and person increased
slightly slower in Ventura County than in the state overall,
according to the census data.</TE>
<TE>   To Schniepp, the 1989 to 1999 income figures are misleading,
because they compare one economic boom with the next and do not
reflect recovery from the doldrums into which the county fell during
the early 1990s, when income growth stopped cold.</TE>
<TE>   And adjusting the 1989 figures for inflation distorts true buying
power, Schniepp said, because many basic costs do not go up with
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   An example is the cost of housing in 1990 and 2000. After being
adjusted for inflation, home mortgage payments and rents fell. Just
31.3% of renters reported spending more than 35% of their income on
housing in 2000, down from 35.2% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "Taken together, these figures show the county's affluence,"
Damooei of Cal Lutheran said.</TE>
<TE>   "But look at the increase in the number of children in poverty.
This puts an emphasis on how we can improve education and vocational
training, and prepare everyone for higher-earning jobs."</TE>

<HD>County Braces for the Worst</HD>
<DH>Budget: Manager says programs and jobs must be cut in face
of revenue shortfall, aggravated by state's woes. Spending priorities
may be revised.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Layoffs and cuts in Ventura County government programs are inevitable
as budget managers struggle to close a projected $17.6-million
shortfall, County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   About 140 jobs will be permanently slashed, Johnston said. Most of
the positions are already vacant or are filled by employees who can
be transferred to other duties, the county manager said.</LD>
<LD>   But at least 10 employees will probably be fired as the county
deals with a budget imbalance that has been years in the making.
Officials have not yet decided where the cuts will occur, Johnston
said in a budget update for the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   Also unclear is the local effect of a staggering $23.6-billion
deficit in the state's budget. Gov. Gray Davis blamed fallout from
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and a falling stock market for the
state's declining revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials were only beginning to assess what effect the
larger deficit could have on health care, crime prevention,
university funding, road improvements, land conservation programs and
individual taxpayers in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's concerned about what the effect is going to be as it
trickles down," said Melanie Markley, a Probation Agency manager.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has some assurances Davis' proposed cuts shouldn't
affect the $65-million juvenile justice center under construction in
El Rio, Markley said.</TE>
<TE>   But $2 million a year in state funding for juvenile crime
prevention programs could be in jeopardy, Markley said. Meanwhile,
proposed reductions in Medi-Cal rates could affect operations at
Ventura County Medical Center, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We depend so heavily on other jurisdictions for our money that
when it happens to them, it happens to us," Johnston told
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The grim financial picture prompted some supervisors to suggest it
may be time to alter the way the county apportions its $1.1-billion
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn said the board should revisit a policy of
using $9 million in annual tobacco settlement payments to expand
health-care services. Some of the money is also distributed to
private hospitals to offset the cost of caring for uninsured
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long agreed that a review is necessary, saying
the money might be better spent keeping the county's public hospital
and clinics open.</TE>
<TE>   But any change might meet resistance from a citizens committee
that makes tobacco settlement funding recommendations to the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   That committee in the past has made clear that it prefers the
dollars to be spent on new programs, such as dental clinics for poor
families, rather than backfill existing health-care budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Other county policies, such as protected funding for public safety
departments, could also be reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be so severe that we're going to have to revisit
every policy," Supervisor Steve Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   In his fiscal report, Johnston said Ventura County is facing a
$17.6-million deficit, regardless of what happens in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of operating the 7,200-employee government is
outstripping revenue, creating an ongoing budget imbalance, he said.
One reason is the county's declining share of property taxes because
of state decisions made in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But local funding decisions also play a role, the county chief
said. In 1994, 48% of the county's general fund was spent on public
safety departments; today it is 58%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions on how tobacco settlement dollars are spent also
limit flexibility, Johnston said. Most alarming, while other counties
were building up budget reserves during flush years, Ventura County's
emergency fund was declining.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, California counties had a median reserve of 14% but
Ventura County's was just 5.8%, Johnston said. Such low reserves make
it more expensive to borrow money and can trigger a cash crunch, he
warned.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors last year began rebuilding the reserve, but there is a
long way to go before the county can restore its tarnished credit
ratings, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to bring you the grim news," he said. "But as long as you
know the constraints, we can start planning for them."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said his office would work to reduce the number of
layoffs. It will be several weeks before the county knows precisely
where the cuts will come, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the county's largest employee union said he is not
overly concerned--yet.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on where those 10 jobs are," said Barry Hammitt,
executive director of Service Employees International Union Local
998. "They've still got 45 to 90 days to worry about placing those
people, so the sky doesn't seem to be falling yet."</TE>

<HD>Council Calls for New Spending Rules for DWP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously requested Tuesday that
Department of Water and Power commissioners adopt proposed revised
spending guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules were prompted by City Controller Laura Chick, who
refused to authorize payment of more than $600,000 in DWP bills
earlier this year, arguing that the agency wastes public money on
lavish parties, community events and staff perks. Among the bills
Chick took issue with was $100,000 for a black-tie dinner celebrating
the reopening of City Hall. The bills were later paid.</LD>
<LD>   The new guidelines require that the recipient of community
outreach money be a nonprofit agency, and forbid contributions to
individuals, political campaigns and parties, and groups that
discriminate or support religious activities. The rules also require
spending to be related to the department's core mission, and set up
new spending procedures.</LD>

<HD>The Internet or a .45, It's Robbery of the Artist</HD>
<DH>'Sharing' will kill the drive to create.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A friend passed through town the other day, a young writer I've
mentored. He is traveling to take the pulse of Americans and write a
book.</LD>
<LD>   We were halfway through our first schooner of ale when the subject
of Internet piracy arose. This writer called it information
"sharing." I called it "stealing," and within a flash we had nothing
at all to discuss.</LD>
<LD>   Our views were so far apart, so different and so certain that we
could not do what friends, or writers, should. We couldn't inquire.
We didn't listen. If there was a shred of empathy between us, we were
drawing on old reserves.</LD>
<TE>   We changed the subject to something simpler--women, I think.</TE>
<TE>   This confrontation unsettles me. Our culture's changing views
about ownership, possession and enjoyment of someone else's creative
work are leading us to dark places.</TE>
<TE>   Even if I draw back and seek to frame matters as questions, my
tone still assumes the edginess of argument: If technology bestows a
new right on its users to "share" music, movies and stories without
payment, what will be the incentive to make music, produce movies and
write stories? Aren't we rushing toward a vastly diminished future in
which Internet technology coldly devours those things that provide us
diversion and pleasure and stimulation?</TE>
<TE>   Or this: What is the distinction between robbing a person and
robbing him of his ability to earn? In this context, how is the
technology of Pentium different from a .45?</TE>
<TE>   But what is obvious to me is off point to my friend and the others
with whom I cannot carry on this discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Am I against freedom? Whose side am I on: big business or the
ordinary guy? Why can't a person share a movie or a song on the
Internet--or even a copy of this column? Hey, it's just free
promotion, getting the word out, like hearing a song on the radio or
clipping the newspaper, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Or as my friend put it: How about the underground guerrilla
filmmaker who wants to send her work out over the Internet for
everyone to see? Should she be blocked from expressing herself to
protect some big movie studio's profits?</TE>
<TE>   There is a kind of Mideast finality to these non-discussions.</TE>
<TE>   My own view is that we've already gone too far, and Congress will
have a difficult time setting things right. Our dreamy infatuation
with the possibilities of technology and the Internet has come at the
expense of our wariness. Our hard-earned cynicism about the promised
free lunch seems to have been suspended just when we need it.</TE>
<TE>   Those who now share music instead of buying it cling to the notion
that they are part of a populist celebration that will be good for
musicians in the same way that public libraries have been good for
authors. By extension, all of our arts will flourish.</TE>
<TE>   Not for long. Rolling Stone magazine recently reported that
between 1997 and 2000, music sales increased 18% nationwide but
dropped 13% at independent stores near college campuses. CD-burning
and Internet music "sharing" are chiefly to blame. "Where indie
record stores once thrived, tech-savvy students short on funds can
now build their record collections for the buck or less that a blank
disc costs, rather than the $12 to $18 it costs to buy the commercial
product," the magazine explained.</TE>
<TE>   At Tower Records, customers temporarily bought, copied and then
returned 50,000 CDs a month until the chain tightened its return
policy, according to the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, The Times reported that perhaps a million people saw
the newest installment of "Star Wars" online before the movie opened
in theaters, thanks to piracy and easy Internet distribution. In the
case of a big-sound, special-effects film like this, ticket sales
probably will not decline. But what about other movies? And who will
buy or rent the DVD when they can copy their own?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there's some middle ground," my friend told me,
politely, as a means to draw our disagreement to an end.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think so. History will record this epoch in which we live
as the Convenience Age, not the Information Age. And as it becomes
more convenient to download than to buy, it won't matter whether you
call it sharing or stealing. The result will be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "After you've invested a couple of years of your life in this
book, you won't want just one person to buy a copy and share it with
everyone else on the Web, will you?" I asked my friend, needling him
one final time.</TE>
<TE>   "No, but I don't want government controlling what we can do,
either," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   As I said, we had nothing to discuss.</TE>

<HD>Gee, Is There a Choice Between Profits and Patriotism?</HD>
<DH>Tans trump taxes as companies flock to Bermuda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's official: I've decided to move this column to Bermuda. But don't
worry about getting me a house-warming present because I'm not really
going anywhere. I'll still live in the U.S., earn my living here and
enjoy the protection, technology, infrastructure and status of the
land of the free and the home of the brave. I'm just changing my
business address. Because if I do that, I won't have to pay for those
benefits--I'll get them free!</LD>
<LD>   It's all perfectly legal. It's what accountants and financial
advisors have dubbed "tax-motivated expatriation," which has a nicer
ring than "sleazy tax-cheating loophole." It's the latest mega-trend
in corporate America, with more and more U.S. companies
reincorporating offshore as a way of slashing their tax bills. You
see, Bermuda, along with sparkling water and beautiful pink-sand
beaches, also has no income tax. None. Pop that into your Quicken and
see how fast it fattens your wallet.</LD>
<LD>   And setting up shop on the sunny island couldn't be easier. A
company "moving" to Bermuda doesn't actually have to move. It doesn't
even have to have an office or hold any meetings there. It just needs
a P.O. box and someone to pick up the mail. Or it could just let the
mail pile up and forget about having someone pick it up. There's
another cost savings.</LD>
<TE>   This kind of paper relocation saved $400million last year for Tyco
International, a New Hampshire-based manufacturer. And
Ingersoll-Rand, a U.S. company that made the jackhammers that helped
chisel Mt. Rushmore, avoids paying a U.S. tax bill of more than
$40million a year by slipping into its Bermuda shorts.</TE>
<TE>   But the tax savings don't stop there. Many companies that move to
Bermuda also open a corporate beachhead in that Wall Street of the
Caribbean--Barbados--where, thanks to the alchemy of modern
accounting and a sweetheart tax treaty, profits earned in the U.S.
can be shipped abroad and transformed into a tax write-off.</TE>
<TE>   And the benefits of this offshore shell game extend well beyond a
corporation's bottom line. Formerly red, white and blue companies now
sporting a Bermuda tan are also suddenly and conveniently immune to
judgments against them in U.S. courts, less accountable to their
shareholders, who are unable to file class-action suits, and freed
from a whole host of annoying government regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is sure precisely how much this corporate exodus is costing
our government, but the IRS estimates that it's siphoning off at
least $70billion each year from the U.S. Treasury. And that number
doesn't include the billions in taxes that corporations avoid paying
by creating offshore subsidiaries. Enron, for example, had 881 of
them and paid no taxes in four of the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Even more galling is the fact that many of the same companies that
are giving the taxman the brushoff as they shield themselves with
their Bermuda ZIP codes think nothing of holding out their hand when
Uncle Sam is doling out government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   And how's this for irony: Among the more than $1billion in federal
contracts held by Accenture, which relocated to Bermuda in 2001, is a
five-year deal to redesign the IRS Web site. I wonder if it will
include a special chat room for those who feel no need to pay their
fair share.</TE>
<TE>   Also showing a flair for self-parody is Tyco International, which
established its Bermuda mail drop in 1997 and has taken in $1billion
at the public trough over the last year--including $100million for
helping provide terror- related emergency response services. Very
post-Sept. 11 patriotic. But patriotism is the last refuge of the
scoundrel, right? So when forced to choose between patriotism and
profits, Tyco quickly charted a course for Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Barton, an Ernst &amp; Young tax partner, doesn't see any problem
with this: "The improvement on earnings is powerful enough that maybe
the patriotism issue needs to take a back seat to that." Of course,
it's not just tax revenue that's being lost. Because of convoluted
laws that allow profits funneled offshore to be invested in foreign
countries without being taxed--as opposed to money that's brought
back into the U.S., which is subject to taxes--we're also losing
American jobs to cheap-labor havens like China and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this tax dodge is not available to you and me--only
to corporations. Just try telling the folks at the IRS that you're
planning to relocate to Bermuda and would like to sign up for the
zero tax rate and see how long it is before they stop laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the billions being lost to these offshore tax havens,
however, the Bush administration has shown little ardor for closing
the loopholes. On the other hand, it seems very keen on ensuring that
those receiving noncorporate welfare work for every dollar they get.
The president doesn't want anybody getting a free ride from the
government without accepting the responsibility that comes with it.
At least anybody who's not a CEO.</TE>

<HD>El Jefe Basks in Carter's Light</HD>
<DH>Timing of the former president's Cuba trip couldn't be
worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA INGRAHAM</AU>
<BD>Laura Ingraham hosts a nationally syndicated radio show
from Washington. E-mail: suggestions@ lauraingraham.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget "Spider-Man." The real blockbuster of the season is "Jimmy and
Fidel's Excellent Adventure," starring former President Carter and
Energizer Bunny Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. The early reviews from
the mainstream press are glowing: Carter's best performance yet!
Castro seems totally at ease in his role as host! The two have a
natural chemistry!</LD>
<LD>   There's Oscar buzz in the air.</LD>
<LD>   It makes perfect sense that Castro would have sought this
costarring role. Cuba is sinking into economic quicksand. After the
fall of its Soviet patron, the money flow from Moscow to Havana has
gradually run dry. Meanwhile, European and Canadian businesses have
pulled back investments that went bad in the bureaucratic morass of a
state-controlled economy. Even Mexico, one of Castro's most loyal
defenders, seems to have had it. So it was a no-brainer for el Jefe.
And, boy, has it paid off. Castro hasn't gotten this much publicity
since the triumphant return of would-be inner-tube defector Elian
Gonzales.</LD>
<TE>   Far more troubling are the actions of Carter. First, he put the
Bush administration in an untenable position by requesting permission
for a special visa to visit Cuba. (Imagine the outrage on the left if
the administration politely had said no.) Second, he scheduled his
trip at a time when the Bush foreign policy team is already juggling
the war against terror and the situation in the Middle East. Third,
he sided with the Castro regime against the U.S. on the issue of
whether Cuba is developing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton charged that
Cuba had developed the capacity to produce biological weapons and had
shared some of that expertise with rogue nations such as Iran and
Syria. On Monday, Carter, flanked by Castro flacks, questioned the
timing of the Bolton comments and said U.S. officials had told him
that there was no evidence linking Cuba to the export of biological
weaponry. Setting aside the fact that a former president would share
the substance of intelligence briefings with a communist dictator, it
is appalling that Carter would criticize his government while
visiting one of the world's most abusive regimes.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell reiterated that the government
believed that Cuba had "a biological offensive research capability"
and that Bolton's comments were "not breaking new ground." But the
U.S. should rest peacefully because Carter also has proclaimed that
he believes that his pals in Cuba will live up to their international
commitments restraining certain transfers of potentially dangerous
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of Carter's Cuba trip point to the heightened
international awareness of Cuba's human rights abuses and a renewed
dialogue on lifting the U.S. trade embargo, the bane of Castro's
existence. For more than four decades, U.S. presidents have
highlighted the horrors carried out to protect Cuba's communist way
of life. Why does Carter think he will succeed in influencing Castro
now when he couldn't as president? Has he decided to selectively
repress memories of the horrific Mariel boat lift? As to the trade
embargo, reasonable people disagree on that. Carter didn't have to
give Castro a public relations boost to fire up the debate.</TE>
<TE>   For the past several years, even those of us who didn't think much
of the Carter presidency began to see him as the admirable idealist,
hammering away for the poor with Habitat for Humanity. But this visit
to Cuba reminds us that Carter has been the raspberry seed in the
wisdom tooth of every administration that succeeded him. Jay
Nordlinger in the National Review Online recently recounted how
Carter cuddled up to Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega during the Reagan
administration, traveled to North Korea when President Clinton stood
against that nation's nuclear aspirations and lobbied the U.N.
against the Gulf War during the previous Bush presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Former presidents aren't just ordinary citizens. They remain on
the public payroll, both with their pensions and the tax dollars
spent to protect them and provide them with support staff. And they
carry with them a level of prestige and cachet that requires that

<HD>City Project: a Rip-Off Waiting to Happen</HD>
<DH>Downtown plan would deplete county coffers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZEV YAROSLAVSKY</AU>
<BD>L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky represents the
Third District, which includes portions of Los Angeles west of
downtown, Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley and the coast from
Venice to the Ventura County line.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redevelopment can be an important policy tool to revitalize blighted
neighborhoods. Over the years, it can claim many successes, but it
also has produced more than its share of wasteful boondoggles.</LD>
<LD>   As currently proposed, the downtown City Center Redevelopment
Project is a taxpayer rip-off waiting to happen.</LD>
<LD>   Let me be clear that I strongly support revitalizing downtown Los
Angeles into a world-class centerpiece of our city. Projects such as
the Disney Concert Hall, the new cathedral and Staples Center are a
huge leap in that effort. More must be done to increase affordable
housing and commercial amenities for the area to truly be a vibrant
urban center. However, this redevelopment proposal steps beyond the
legal limits and must be rethought. What is the rush?</LD>
<TE>   Redevelopment works by diverting property tax revenue from the
city and the county to underwrite new projects, such as commercial,
retail and housing developments in economically depressed (defined as
blighted under state law) neighborhoods. State law prohibits
including property if it isn't blighted or if its designation isn't
necessary for successful redevelopment to take place. Yet that is
what the City Council contemplates doing today.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial interests behind this ambitious plan--which includes
within its project area two hotels, a 7,000-seat theater, more than
1million square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of office
space and 800 housing units--have said that if the city wants a hotel
next to the Convention Center, the taxpayers must subsidize it. The
developers, however, have declared that they intend to build the rest
of the entertainment center whether or not the city coughs up the
cash for a hotel. In other words, the nonblighted Staples Center
parking lots in the redevelopment area are not key to this project
and therefore it violates state law to include them.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporating these parking lots in the redevelopment area would
cost the county $278million in property taxes over the life of this
project. These are funds that would otherwise support the county's
core mission of providing health care and homeless and job training
programs. Demanding that the county pony up to subsidize
profit-making ventures by cutting services to the most dependent
among us is unconscionable.</TE>
<TE>   If city officials believe that a hotel is so important to the
Convention Center's success, they should offer the developers a full
rebate on the 13% bed tax that the city collects from them. That type
of subsidy might make the hotels economically viable without
compromising the finances of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, there are broad hints that this project will also be
used to facilitate the building of a new football stadium downtown.
The signs are clear: Local business leaders are negotiating with the
NFL about moving a team to Los Angeles; a new training camp for the
San Diego Chargers is being built 17 miles from downtown. Although
two City Council members have introduced a motion to bar use of city
or Community Redevelopment Agency funds unless repaid to lure a team
or build a stadium here, the county still would be stuck with the tab
if the stadium was built within the project area. I support bringing
an NFL team to L.A. but not at the expense of county taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The City Center plan, as proposed, is improper, illegal and should
not be approved. But here's what should happen: Elements of the
proposed project that would truly benefit the poor, such as building
and rehabilitating affordable housing, deserve public support, and
the county should participate financially in that. The City Council
should jettison the 27acres of nonblighted land already scheduled for
development regardless of whether the plan is approved.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves us with a redevelopment project we can all support in
good conscience, one that would be a win-win for everyone.</TE>

<HD>Seize Castro's Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We have to wonder whether Fidel Castro knew what he was getting into
when he offered former President Jimmy Carter a chance to address the
people of the nation over which he has reigned as dictator for 43
years. What he and the island's oppressed population got was blunt
rabble-rousing--in Spanish no less--in support of those brave Cubans
striving for democracy, free speech and respect for human rights.
Carter's bold move, however, was accompanied by blunders during his
visit.</LD>
<LD>   In welcoming the American on his historic arrival in Cuba Sunday,
Castro invited Carter to bring in whomever he chose to investigate
whether the communist nation had or was about to cross the line from
researching biotechnology to researching (and possibly exporting)
bioterrorism. Let's hope Carter has been on the phone to the U.S.
government's best specialists and they've already booked flights to
Havana.</LD>
<LD>   On May 6, John R. Bolton, undersecretary of State for arms
control, suggested in a speech that Cuba had "at least a limited
offensive biological warfare research and development effort." He
also said Cuba had "provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue
states."</LD>
<TE>   Inspections could confirm the threat or offer some peace of mind
that Castro has not followed Iraq's Saddam Hussein in embracing
unconventional warfare. Inspections would also simultaneously shed
light on whether the Bush administration was sounding a valid alarm
or crying wolf. Or maybe, as Castro and others have charged, it was
playing politics, either to influence the Florida election in which
the president's brother is running or as an inside tactic to nudge
some in the administration even further from Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The other thing inspectors could accomplish--if Carter steps back
and lets the U.S. government handle the offer--is to spare the former
president a measure of public scorn. Carter showed dismal judgment in
standing on Cuban soil and publicly siding with the hemisphere's last
remaining dictator against accusations raised by officials of the
U.S. government at a time of genuine concern about international
terrorism. Carter's complaints that Bush administration officials
apparently misled him during pre-trip briefings only makes us want to
shout: Jimmy, it's not about you!</TE>
<TE>   Carter put his foot in his mouth. But he also has one foot in
Cuba's door. His speech helped redeem him. He can do even better by
testing the sincerity of Castro's offer to allow in legitimate
bioweapons inspectors.</TE>

<LD>An Inuit boy was asked once how he thought the world looked in olden
days. The child, who'd never been off the Arctic tundra except via
satellite TV, thought an instant and replied, "Everything back then
was black and white."</LD>
<LD>   Images have always been powerful in the human mind, where they
were forced to reside in the individual imagination until
photography's development allowed image sharing--and manipulation.
Imagine how history might differ if Joseph of Nazareth, Christopher
Columbus or Ben Franklin portaged a Polaroid. Would the Thirty Years
War or slavery have lasted so long with photo coverage? Would Abraham
Lincoln be elected with video of his awkward gait and sound bites
confined to one phrase? And did everyone really walk that quickly
during the 1920s?</LD>
<LD>   Now, it seems, new generations of real images, including those of
the North Korean refugee family trying to flee to a foreign compound
in China the other day, are assuming a more potent political power.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone has memorable emotional images--the Hindenburg burning,
the Spanish soldier as a bullet strikes, Jackie Kennedy in a
blood-stained dress or John-John saluting, Jack Ruby sticking a
pistol in Lee Harvey Oswald's stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Some images also developed political impact and purpose. Police
dogs lunging at peaceful civil rights demonstrators in Selma. The
naked Vietnamese girl running from napalm or a starving African child
with a vulture lurking behind. The World Trade Center crash images
were deemed so powerful their replay dwindled within days of the
tragedy, The Pentagon and Pennsylvania sites, devoid of searing crash
images, linger more in our mental backgrounds. Then, the image of a
handcuffed, hooded Taliban member kneeling before U.S. guards ignited
intense international debate on U.S. prisoner policies.</TE>
<TE>   The haunting film footage in late 2000 of a Palestinian boy caught
in Israeli gunfire and the boy's death in his father's arms may
actually have shown Palestinian gunfire, heavily edited later,
according to a documentary on Germany's ARD-TV.</TE>
<TE>   The world saw images of last week's attempted escape by a Korean
family into the Japanese consulate in Shenyang, China, and their
pigtailed daughter crying in terror as Chinese police moved in. Those
images exist only because refugee advocates invited a Japanese
cameraman to a reserved hotel room overlooking the compound. Dozens
of such escapes have occurred for months. Only now, with preplanned
images of a little girl dressed in pink, have calls for action
mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Americans long ago grew savvy about images in ads. The unanswered
question is: Has our ability to process, question and put
split-second political images in a larger context kept pace with the
ability of technology and proponents to produce and manipulate them
and us? There's no clear image of that yet.</TE>

<HD>Unhealthy Bias on Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commission that will decide soon whether the San Fernando Valley,
Hollywood and harbor area secession measures qualify for the November
ballot is an unapologetic cheerleader for breaking up Los Angeles.
Surely this is not what the California Legislature intended when it
created local agency formation commissions almost 40 years ago--at
that time, mostly to oversee mundane disputes over sanitation and
lighting district boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, state Controller Kathleen Connell audited the
commission's analysis of Hollywood secession and found that a
Hollywood city would not bring in enough tax revenue to support
itself. The commission's contention to the contrary was based on the
new city borrowing $10 million from Los Angeles--what nerve!--and
cutting services by another $10 million.</LD>
<LD>   Connell earlier had found that a harbor area city would be
millions of dollars in debt under even the rosiest of scenarios
(meaning not shouldering any debt or other obligations it undertook
as part of L.A.), as did the commission's own consultant. But LAFCO
Executive Director Larry Calemine told The Times, "We're looking
under bedcovers; we're looking behind the chairs" for extra revenue.
Chairman Henri Pellissier said, "If it's possible or practical, we'd
like to put it on the ballot," adding that Calemine "may have left us
some openings."</LD>
<TE>   Calemine, a leader of a fizzled Valley secession movement in the
1970s, has already dismissed a Connell audit that said a new Valley
city would have alarmingly little money to set aside for unexpected
expenses and emergencies. He has also rejected arguments--which the
city will mount yet again today before LAFCO--that the commission's
analysis has underestimated secession's effect on what would remain
of L.A. It's clear that the commission sees its role not as an
evaluator but as an enabler. It is not determining whether secession
should go on the ballot but how to get it there.</TE>
<TE>   This is wrong, and not just for Los Angeles residents who believe
that this city can be saved. It's misleading for those who may vote
for breakaway cities based on unsupported promises of better services
and lower taxes.</TE>
<TE>   By law, local agency formation commissions are answerable to no
one but the courts--which was no big deal for commissions that
largely oversaw relatively small matters. The Legislature can't
intervene, despite the way this commission is handling--or
mishandling--a much more complex and consequential issue.</TE>
<TE>   After two years and $2 million, the commission has offered no
concrete details on what new or old cities would be like beyond a
three-year "transition" period that itself doesn't stand up to
scrutiny. Maybe that vagueness is what secession supporters are
counting on. Voters, if they follow Connell's more realistic
assessment that deconstructing the nation's second-largest city would
be no breeze, could surprise them.</TE>

<HD>Carter Calls for a Freer Cuba</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>In a live address on Cuba's state-run television, former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter appealed in Spanish for President Fidel
Castro's government to embrace the democratic freedoms of speech,
assembly and dissent and called on the U.S. to lift its four-decade
economic embargo of the Communist-run island.</LD>
<LD>   In the historic speech, the first time Communist Cuba has allowed
an American leader to freely address its citizens, Carter cited
Cuba's constitution and a petition drive by dissidents that calls for
democratic reform--a movement largely unknown to the island's 11
million residents until the speech--in urging the nation to greater
freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   "When Cubans exercise this freedom to change laws peacefully by a
direct vote," Carter declared, "the world will see that Cubans, and
not foreigners, will decide the future of this country."</LD>
<TE>   Carter then fended off ideological challenges from three Cuban
students and a law professor in the audience, who asserted that
Castro's 1959 revolution and long rule have brought benefits far more
important than democracy to a land that has achieved 100% literacy
and universal, free health care.</TE>
<TE>   The former president, who reestablished limited diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the U.S. during his term, stayed his
ground, arguing that rights sought by the petition drive known as the
Varela Project are enshrined in international human rights agreements
Cuba signed in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Carter spoke at Havana University's ornate Aula Magna auditorium.
Before his address, he held his hand over his heart during a
rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner"--rarely performed here--and
mouthed the words to "That Old Time Religion" as it was sung by the
university choir.</TE>
<TE>   Castro, clad in a dark business suit in the front row, listened
intently throughout Carter's 20-minute address and the
question-and-answer session that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Then the two septuagenarians headed to the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Both avid baseball fans, Castro and Carter had box seats for
Cuba's annual All-Star Game, an invitation-only event pitting the
best of the island's Western League against Eastern League stars at
Havana's Latin American Stadium. With Castro at his side on the
mound, Carter threw out the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   'Our Countries</TE>
<TE>   Share Many Things'</TE>
<TE>   Carter had told a student group Monday that he would keep his
speech short so he wouldn't be late for the night game. He and former
First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who is accompanying him here, are "strong
fans of the Atlanta Braves," he told the group.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the people of our countries share many things," he told
the students. "Two of them are music and baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Carter, 77, is on a five-day visit that marks the first time a
present or former U.S. president has come to Cuba since Calvin
Coolidge in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   His poignant critique of Cuban society Tuesday night served as a
counterpoint to his unplanned statement the previous day challenging
Bush administration officials to prove their recent allegations that
Cuba's advanced biotechnology industry had provided potential weapons
capability to "rogue" states such as Iran.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the controversy continued to simmer in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer rejected suggestions
that the administration had upped its anti-Cuba rhetoric to detract
from Carter's visit.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the administration first raised concern about the
possible development of biological weapons in Cuba on March 19 during
Senate testimony by Carl W. Ford Jr., assistant secretary of State
for intelligence and research.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer confirmed that the issue had not come up May 9 during
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice's conversation with Carter
about his trip. That conversation was general and had taken "just a
few minutes," he said. Its focus was human rights, according to
Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes that President Carter is a crusader for
human rights, that President Carter has an opportunity during this
trip to do good things for the people of Cuba," Fleischer said. "The
president's concern in Cuba is the tyranny of the Castro regime."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush "hopes that as a result of this trip ... Fidel
Castro will change his tune and focus on bringing freedom and rights
to his people," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bush said at the White House that Carter's visit "doesn't
complicate my foreign policy, because I haven't changed my foreign
policy. And that is that Fidel Castro is a dictator, and he is
repressive, and he ought to have free elections, and he ought to have
a free press, and he ought to free his prisoners, and he ought to
encourage free enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   Though the message of freedom was clearly Carter's intent, he
delivered it via Cuba's only television network in far gentler and
more diplomatic terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not come here to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs but
to extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people and to offer a
vision of the future for our two nations," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our two nations have been trapped in a destructive state of
belligerence for 42 years, and it is time for us to change our
relations and the way we think and talk about each other."</TE>
<TE>   End to Economic</TE>
<TE>   Embargo Urged</TE>
<TE>   In calling on Congress to lift all restrictions on U.S. citizens'
travel to Cuba, end the embargo and establish free trade between the
two nations, Carter stressed that the economic blockade is "not the
source" of Cuba's economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he said, it "induces anger and resentment, restricts the
freedom of U.S. citizens and makes it difficult for us to exchange
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   As for Cuba, he said, it "has adopted a socialist government where
one political party dominates and people are not permitted to
organize any opposition movements. Your constitution recognizes
freedom of speech and association, but other laws deny these freedoms
to those who disagree with the government."</TE>
<TE>   Carter stressed several times in response to questions from
students, who were raised and educated under Castro's tightly
controlled system, that he believed that the Varela Project petition
drive was a wholly Cuban effort toward reform.</TE>
<TE>   Oswaldo Paya, the project's leader, who spent the last year
gathering 11,020 signatures calling for the National Assembly to hold
a referendum on democratic reforms, met with Carter over breakfast
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba's state-run media have reported nothing on the project, and
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told reporters Sunday that he
believed that the petition drive was "imported" from the U.S.
government.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the often heated exchanges between Washington and Havana,
Carter stressed that regardless of the years of animosity, "we hope
that someday soon, you can reach across the great divide that
separates our two countries and say, 'We are ready to join the
community of democracies,' and I hope that Americans will soon open
our arms to you and say, 'We welcome you as friends.'"</TE>
<TE>   Carter delivered a similar message the previous day during a
session with a small group of students at a Havana social-work
school.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Words for</TE>
<TE>   Many Cubans</TE>
<TE>   Americans "take pride in our freedom to criticize our own
government and to change our government when we don't like it by
voting in elections that are contested," he told the students.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people are completely free to form our own businesses, to
hire other people to work and to make a profit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those were magic words to many Cubans, who increasingly are
chasing dollars and profits since Castro legalized the U.S. currency
after the fall of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Carter plans to hold private meetings Thursday with Cuban
dissidents. Castro's government has permitted such exchanges with
increasing frequency since Pope John Paul II visited the island four
years ago and called for the Cuban government to open the nation to
contact with the world.</TE>
<TE>   Castro had already laid the groundwork for possible damage control
from Carter's expected criticisms of his regime's record on human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   In a 40-minute speech at Havana's Latin American Medical
University on Monday night, Castro delivered a harsh critique of
capitalist democracies, from that of ancient Greece, which enslaved
tens of thousands of citizens, to modern systems that he said have
left hundreds of millions of people in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Then the 75-year-old Cuban leader, who has controlled most every
nuance of this nation's life for nearly half a century, delivered his
own bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Carter will deliver "the central words" during his visit to the
island nation, Castro told the group. "But if I say something, they
will be the final words."</TE>

<HD>Pact Gives Russia a New Role in NATO</HD>
<DH>Alliance: The pact reflects Putin's efforts to move closer
to the West. Moscow gains equal footing on issues ranging from arms
to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>REYKJAVIK, Iceland</DL>
<LD>NATO took another important step closer to Russia on Tuesday with an
agreement that will give the West's former Cold War foe a new
consultative role and greater influence within the alliance.</LD>
<LD>   Ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia
completed final details of a deal that will bring the two sides
together to work on such issues as counter-terrorism, arms control,
regional crises and natural catastrophes.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement was another sign of Russia's accelerating efforts
under President Vladimir V. Putin to move closer to Europe and the
United States. It comes a day after U.S. and Russian officials
announced agreement on an arms control treaty that aims to reduce the
countries' stockpiles of deployed nuclear warheads by two-thirds, to
between 1,700 and 2,200 each, over the next 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   The new NATO arrangement marks "the funeral of the Cold War" and
allows Russia "to come out of the cold as a partner, ally and friend
of NATO," said British Foreign Minister Jack Straw.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the end of the Cold War, the two sides have struggled in
recent years to work out a relationship that bridges their
often-conflicting interests.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the alliance and Russia set up an organization
called the Permanent Joint Council that was to seek solutions to
issues of mutual concern. But the council suffered a body blow in
1999 when NATO embarked on a war against Yugoslavia, a longtime
Russian ally.</TE>
<TE>   Frictions have continued in the council since then, and the
Russians have accused all NATO members of ganging up on it as "19
against one."</TE>
<TE>   In the new structure, Russia is supposed to have the status of an
equal member, at least on the handful of agreed-on issues. NATO is
supposed to include Russia throughout its deliberations, rather than
presenting it with unchangeable policies at the end of a review.</TE>
<TE>   Several safeguards have been put in place to keep Russia from
having too much influence. Moscow has no standing, for example, to
try to influence the expansion of NATO that is now on the table. The
revamped council would be limited to a relatively small number of
issues, at least to start. In addition, any member who objects to a
line of discussion can call it to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   The move is another reflection of the Russian leader's new
attitude toward the West. Putin believes that his country's future
lies in stronger integration with the Western economic powerhouses.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian president has noticeably strengthened his nation's
ties with the United States and its European allies since Sept. 11,
which reminded the two sides of the common terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks were "an extraordinary catalyst--that for the first
time since 1945 focused attention on what we have in common," NATO
Secretary-General George Robertson said in a speech last month. It
led "not to a temporary thaw but to a real sea change in attitudes by
both sides."</TE>
<TE>   The new agreement was a "pragmatic recognition that genuine
cooperation on terrorism and, I hope, a range of other issues is to
our mutual benefit," Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's deal was reached near the wooden Icelandic guest house
where President Reagan and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, held talks in 1986 that eventually helped lead to the end
of the Cold War. The new agreement will be signed at a meeting May 28
in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   At a morning session, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell declared
that the alliance needed to begin immediately "to put meat on the
bones" of the agreement. "We need work of substance," he said,
according to another U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   The new agenda calls for the two sides to begin with a series of
projects. They will:</TE>
<TE>   * Conduct a joint assessment of security threats, including the
danger of attacks by civilian aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   * Seek to increase military contacts and conduct joint training,
senior U.S. officials said. The two sides might set up a joint
training center, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   * Pool ideas on short-range missile defense and planning for civil
emergencies, including attack from chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials were optimistic about the new organization,
they acknowledged that there are no guarantees that the arrangement
will succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is no political will, this will be a sterile body,"
Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the council's work could be threatened by
differing points of view on various issues, such as what to do about
the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or Western concern about
Russia's international arms sales.</TE>
<TE>   "The change in the way you take decisions could be more cosmetic
than substantive," said Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO and now a consultant at Rand Corp. But he said the greatest
significance is that the two sides have decided not to be put off by
the failure of the last effort.</TE>
<TE>   "If you manage to push Russia from the undecided category to
becoming a country that will play a cooperative role, then you've
brought something historic," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Russians often have viewed NATO as a threat to their
interests, "now they've realized that they have more to gain by not
standing in the way," said Sean Kay, a former U.S. defense official
who worked on the first round of NATO expansion. "Russia's goal is to
get as much influence with European institutions as possible, and
here they're getting that."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts worry that although Putin is clearly in favor of the
new arrangement, it could still be stalled by Russians farther down
in the bureaucracy who see it as a threat to their national security.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Tuesday's meeting was occupied with setting the rules for
new members to qualify to join the alliance and with discussing how
smaller countries with relatively weak militaries can contribute more
to the alliance. NATO is expected to add seven members at a meeting
in Prague, the Czech capital, in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting also brought signals that United States and some other
NATO members increasingly believe that because of the threat of
terrorism the alliance must be prepared to take action outside its
home turf.</TE>
<TE>   Such suggestions have always been controversial within the
alliance, and as recently as 1999 the membership shot down such
moves.</TE>
<TE>   "The kinds of challenges NATO may be facing in the future won't
always be located in Central Europe, and NATO has to have the ability
to move to other places," Powell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official, who requested anonymity, insisted that
"Sept. 11 ended the 'out-of-area' debate. NATO needs to be prepared
to go wherever the threat comes from."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson also contended that the alliance can no longer limit its
activities to any geographical area.</TE>
<TE>   The final communique of the meeting said NATO must be able to
field forces that can move swiftly to wherever they are needed.</TE>

<HD>'Animal Shelters Cannot Be Expanded Overnight'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Pets Turned In by Owners Deserve Same Protection as Those Off the
Streets," Voices, May 11: Paula Kislak's idealism implies that she
has little experience with the realities of animal sheltering. The
things she purports the supporters of former state Sen. Tom Hayden's
bill "wanted" (and which we all want) cannot miraculously be
accomplished by a wave of the legislative wand.</LD>
<LD>   Unwanted pets are dumped like living garbage and quickly
forgotten. Many animals are turned in to shelters because of violent
tendencies that make them a danger to human and animal safety. Animal
shelters cannot be expanded overnight and are at the bottom of
tax-supported funding priorities. The Hayden law created a tragic
overcrowding crisis rather than a cure, and many unadoptable, old,
sick and injured animals suffer a thousand deaths rather than a
simple, humane injection.</LD>
<LD>   I have never met anyone working in an animal shelter who enjoyed
euthanasia. It takes a tragic emotional toll on those who must
perform this act of mercy for those animals that were doomed by the
mere fact that they were born into a world with too few homes and too
little commitment. However, to force these animals to be jammed into
confined kennels with stronger, more dominant and aggressive animals
vying for the same space and food creates inhumane, and often cruel,
conditions.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kislak alludes to the Hayden law, which extended holding periods
for animals in public shelters, as the reason impound rates have
declined in L.A. County. However, Hayden did not include the "spay
and neuter opportunities" she mentioned, and no provision in his plan
addressed owner accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Credit for any population decline should go to state Sen. Edward
Vincent (D-Inglewood) for his law requiring shelters to spay or
neuter dogs and cats before placement. This law, coupled with higher
licensing fees for unaltered animals, has played a role in reducing
the number of surplus animals born each year that end up in public
pounds.</TE>

<LD>Matt Johanson dissertates (Commentary, May 5) on the propensity of
high school sophomores to insert "like" superfluously within almost
every sentence. At least this tendency seems to fade as one reaches
adulthood. Not so the habit of inserting "you know" multiple times
within a sentence. Seemingly adults today who should know better
actually cultivate this mannerism as a kind of trendy newspeak. Often
I can barely resist responding, "If I knew, why would I be listening
to you?"</LD>

<LD>   La Crescenta</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your criticism of the use of the word "like" leads me to request
that you start a similar campaign to eliminate the use of the word
"well" whenever an interviewee answers a question on TV. Listen to
them and you will find it is used more than the teenagers use "like."
Well, I've made my point.</TE>

<LD>My compliments for publishing David DeVoss' "Bosnia 10 Years Later Is
a Broken Country" (Opinion, May 12). Those of us who have closely
followed the tragic events in the Balkans as well as those who have
visited Bosnia many times since the Dayton accords debacle attest to
the validity of this piece. For the first time, your readers got a
true picture of Bosnia. It should be a lesson to many, especially to
those who continue to advocate replication of the Bosnia model
throughout the world. The first replication in Kosovo is yet another
fiasco. Nonetheless, some foreign policy gurus recommend that the
Bosnia model be replicated even on the West Bank.</LD>

<LD>Re "Child Fatally Shot When Gang Members Intervene," May 11:</LD>
<LD>   It's obvious that under present conditions society will never be
able to control gang violence. Perhaps all gang members should be
offered taxpayer-financed instruction on the proper use of firearms
so they can learn to hit their intended targets rather than innocent
bystanders. Police and the sheriff's departments' firing ranges could
be made available to gang members on an ongoing basis so they could
remain proficient. Who knows, perhaps over time fewer babies and
children will be killed and the gangs will eventually succeed in
wiping each other out.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe we could simply lock them all up and throw away the key.
There must be something we can do to contain these ignoramuses and
offer society the protection it deserves.</LD>
<TE>   Wayne D. Kerr</TE>
<TE>   La Crescenta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The problem with gangs is that their so-called "turf wars" usually
result in the injury or death of an innocent child (as we witness
almost weekly). Gang participation is embedded in culture; it's a
lifestyle almost impossible to eradicate. The LAPD's hands are tied
at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Why do people who live in poor communities always have to be the
innocent victims of gang violence? Does poor equal no basic human
rights? The least the Police Department and community leaders could
do would be to send out fliers warning residents in gang-ridden
communities to keep their children inside or away from areas where
violence might occur.</TE>
<TE>   Neal Pilkinton</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find it sadly ironic that Carol Bellamy's graphic profile of the
plight of children throughout the world (Commentary, May 7) appeared
at a time when L.A. is still assigning blame to "poverty" and
"despair" when it comes to the sociopathic activities of gangs and
gang members.</TE>
<TE>   These gang members have nice, shiny cars to drive. They have
enough money to buy guns. They can afford the latest homeboy or
homegirl fashions. Their sneakers are spotless. They have access to
education, training programs, public assistance and services. Some of
them have the dubious privilege of being overweight. They have
electricity in their homes. A refrigerator. A bed or two. A
television. Paved streets in front of their homes, etc.</TE>
<TE>   The truly poor--those who live beyond the margins of our island of
privilege--cannot fathom the wealth of those we consider hopelessly
deprived. Let's all lose the excuses and make a gratitude list
instead.</TE>

<LD>Re your May 10 obituary about UCLA professor Beverly Robinson: Her
expertise in folklore and her academic accomplishments are extremely
impressive, but it was her teaching that had an impact on the lives
of countless students. I took her course, History of Black People's
Theater in America, in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Professor Robinson rarely asked us to discuss our assigned
reading. Instead, she challenged us to explore our own perceptions
and ideas. Our class conversations made me eager to attend each class
and compelled me to show up during her office hours to further our
discussions. Her teaching gave me a better understanding of black
theater, but even more important, a greater appreciation for American
culture.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Illegal Immigrants' Best Form of ID Is Ingenuity," May 12: I am
unimpressed. It should have been headlined "101 Ways to Beat the
System." Praising the people who violate the laws of our country by
living here illegally is insulting to the legal citizens, to people
who are here on visas and to the people who are waiting to enter the
U.S. through legal channels. As a Democrat, I am very disappointed
with Assemblyman Gil Cedillo's proposition to further reward
criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Uninsured motorists are indeed a problem, but Cedillo is not
proposing to fix this problem, as rewarding illegal immigrants with
identification cards and amnesty only provides incentives for even
more people to come across our borders illegally. Efforts should be
made to end this cycle instead of perpetuating it. Businesses that
hire illegal immigrants should be heavily penalized, and, yes, the
government needs to make efforts to deport people who are living here
in violation of our laws.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. government needs to start actively protecting our
citizens from a rapidly expanding population, overcrowded schools,
urban sprawl, uninsured motorists, the burden on the taxpayers from
paying for services provided to illegal immigrants and the host of
other problems that mass illegal immigration brings.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What I learned growing up in the U.S. was that being a citizen
meant I had to obey the law. The 1.5 million illegal immigrants in
California obviously do not qualify for citizenship since they feel
no need or obligation to obey the laws of this country. If they had
any respect for our laws, values or legal system they would not be
here illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Why don't the media cover the real issue: why illegal Mexican
immigrants come to America in the first place? Why don't we start
focusing on ways to help Mexico strengthen its economic status and
stabilize the government instead of signing treaties to legitimize
the exploitation of its situation?</TE>
<TE>   If we can send $3 billion in financial aid per year to a certain
country in the Middle East, why can't we spend a fraction of that
helping a neighboring state achieve self-sufficiency? This would give
the U.S. a prospering and friendly neighbor state that would be a
staunch ally and relieve an already out-of-control illegal
immigration problem. Take a poll of Mexican immigrants who are here
illegally, sking whether they would have come to the U.S. if they
could have found similar jobs in Mexico under a stable government.</TE>

<LD>While Andrew Shaddock is profoundly disappointed by the federal
government's refusal to fund the Exposition Line (letter, May 13), I
am profoundly relieved. Light rail squanders vital transportation
funds. The latest MTA budget shows that fares paid by existing rail
riders will only cover 22% of the cost of operating current lines.
Taxpayers will pick up the other 78%.</LD>
<LD>   A more cost-effective solution would be to construct one of the
missing freeways. If we brought the freeway system up to capacity, it
would be a win-win for everybody. Transit users would ride 65-mph
express buses down the freeway, and those who choose to drive would
have faster commute times. Air quality would improve because cars
would not be idling in traffic, burning gasoline and producing most
of their pollutants. Commuters would finally have a viable
alternative to the Santa Monica Freeway--a Beverly Hills or Slauson
Freeway.</LD>

<LD>Kudos to the L.A. school system's District C team for requiring high
school students to think about their lives after graduation in a
meaningful way ("No Plans, No Graduation Rite, Seniors Told," May 7).
What's the point of school accountability if students don't have a
plan? In today's economy, students need more than a high school
diploma. Without college or additional training, a high school
diploma is a ticket to nowhere.</LD>

<LD>An Orange County judge refused to award a mother sole custody of her
severely brain-damaged infant Tuesday, blocking her effort to take
the child off life-support machines.</LD>
<LD>   She and the boy's father disagree about whether the child should
remain on life support. The father, accused of causing the boy's
injuries and awaiting trial on assault charges, would face a homicide
charge if 8-month-old Christopher Ibarra died.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Richard E. Behn ruled neither parent is fit to care for the
child. He faulted the father for abusing the baby and the mother for
failing to prevent the abuse.</LD>
<TE>   The decision means that baby Christopher will remain on life
support indefinitely. The judge ordered the county's Social Services
Agency to monitor Christopher's health but prohibited officials from
making any medical decisions that could end the baby's life.</TE>
<TE>   "This court is going to make medical decisions for this child,"
Behn said. "There's going to be no medical treatment other than that
that sustains life."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have concluded that Christopher suffered a "devastating"
brain injury and will never recover. He breathes with the help of a
machine pumping oxygen through a hole in his throat and is fed
through a plastic tube inserted into his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Christopher's mother, Tamara Sepulveda,
said she's frustrated that her son remains in a vegetative state.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen right now, but I have to be patient,"
she said. "I want the best for my child."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's grandmother, Susan Sepulveda, said the family continues
to believe that taking Christopher off life support is the only way
to end the baby's suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no life there. There's no life in his body. That's the
hardest part, looking at somebody lying there," Susan Sepulveda said.
"He can't do anything. He can't even blink."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's 23-year-old father, Moises Ibarra, is held at the Orange
County Jail on suspicion of felony child abuse. He is awaiting a
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of child abuse, he faces up to nine years in prison.
If his son dies, Ibarra could face a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said it is premature to consider turning off the
life-support machines.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother would go down and turn off the machines tomorrow," he
said. Behn said that wouldn't happen without an additional hearing.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Blaze May Be Arson</HD>
<DH>Fire: Investigators say it appeared to have several
starting points. Residents praised for keeping brush cleared.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after a fierce brush fire threatened million-dollar homes in
south Orange County, crews doused hot spots while arson investigators
combed the area where the blaze started.</LD>
<LD>   As residents cleaned up ash and soot Tuesday, they expressed
gratitude to the firefighters who saved 700 homes in the area and to
a brush-clearing project that officials said held the flames at bay.
They expressed shock and anger at reports that the blaze may have
been set.</LD>
<LD>   "If this resulted from arson, somebody needs to get their bell
rung," homeowner Craig Tilmont said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said the blaze appeared to have several starting
points along Antonio Parkway across from the Tijeras Creek Golf Club
in Las Flores. Yet to be determined is whether the fires were set,
and if so, whether by more than one person, said Dennis Shell, a
spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority. Late Tuesday, he
said, no suspects had been identified in an incident that could have
been far worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had wind on this fire, there's a ... potential that [it]
would have been really, really bad," Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   About 70 firefighters remained on the job Tuesday in the hills
above Rancho Santa Margarita, while helicopters dumped water on parts
of the scorched 1,100 acres inaccessible from the ground. Officials
said they expect to finish the job by this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Residents got much of the credit for averting disaster. Besides
installing fireproof roofs and planting greenbelt vegetation, Shell
said, they had recently cleared debris and brush from a 150-foot
perimeter around their houses. Some of that work was part of a
homeowners association project completed just three days before the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no dried-out vegetation or piles of lumber around the
homes," Shell said. "They were wonderfully defended, and it was a
real big help to us."</TE>
<TE>   Though the smell of smoke still wafted down streets Tuesday, the
sense of relief was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Outside her house on Sundown Drive in Rancho Santa Margarita,
Christina Law hosed down windows while her young son and daughter
played in the green backyard that contrasted sharply with the
blackened hillside only a few feet away. As Law mopped up, she
wondered aloud how she was going to get the smell of smoke out of the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgot to close one window when I evacuated, and that was all
it took," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When she saw the flames top the ridge at the end of her street
Monday afternoon, Law said, she grabbed her daughter and a few
photos, then fled. Her husband was at work and her son in preschool.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire was coming in so fast," she said. "That's all I had time
to do. As I drove away I saw the helicopter flying over the street,
carrying water."</TE>
<TE>   On nearby Apache Drive, Tilmont and his neighbor Geoff Ward were
trying to figure out how to remove stains left by the red fire
retardant that splashed on their houses when a plane dumped it on a
nearby hill.</TE>
<TE>   Tilmont's house is for sale, and a potential buyer came by Tuesday
morning to inspect it.</TE>
<TE>   Though the home was not damaged, Tilmont said, the buyer had
second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   But because the fire has already burned away the brush, "this area
is safe from fire for the next 10 years," he said. "It's probably the
safest place in the entire county now."</TE>
<TE>   Tilmont said he was home sick Monday when he smelled smoke. He
opened the garage door and saw smoke rising over the ridge at the end
of the street.</TE>
<TE>   He awakened his sleeping daughter, put her and the family dog in
the car, grabbed a few photo albums and took off. The family stayed
with friends Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Ward said he never left home. He stayed in the backyard with a
garden hose, wetting down trees to prevent them from catching fire.
He was outside when a plane dropped fire retardant on the house and
hillside behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was covered in red jelly, and the sidewalk and driveway were
covered by about a quarter-inch of the stuff," Ward said. "But that
pilot saved my house."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles firefighter Dave Lucas found himself at the receiving
end of his colleagues' services Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He was battling a house fire in South-Central Los Angeles when a
fellow firefighter told him he had a message from his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Joanna had called to say there was a fire in my backyard and to
get home right away," Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed home to Rancho Santa Margarita, but officials would not
let him get near his house--even when he flashed his firefighter's
badge.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned," he said, "but there were a lot of fire engines
in the neighborhood. I was confident that the firefighters had the
situation in hand."</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Lucas expressed disgust that the fire may have been started
deliberately.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty sick person that does something like that," she
said. "Whoever did this has my 5-year-old daughter very scared."</TE>

<LD>Household incomes fell during the 1990s in much of Southern
California, according to Census 2000 data released Tuesday, reversing
decades of gains and tarnishing the region's historic image as a
place of rising fortunes.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County suffered the worst drop in median household
income in the state, while median income also fell in Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and was stagnant in Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   The income losses in Southern California occurred as median
household income rose for California as a whole and sharp increases
in income benefited parts of Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   The census reports--the first data released from the "long form"
questionnaire delivered to about one in six households
nationwide--confirmed what many economists studying California had
already observed during the 1990s: widening gaps between the north
and south, and the rich and poor. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * In Los Angeles County, the number of individuals living in
poverty rose 28% to 1.6 million. Eighteen percent of the county's 9.5
million residents live below the federal poverty line. The growing
trend was mirrored throughout Southern California; Orange County, for
example, experienced a 44% increase in the number of people in
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles County's median income dropped from $45,600 in 1990
to $42,200 in 2000 when adjusted for inflation. That was a striking
change from the previous two decades, when median income in the
county rose 3.5% in the '70s and 21.5% in the '80s. The median income
in the city of Los Angeles fell even more sharply than the county
figure.</TE>
<TE>   * While the county's population grew by 7.4%, its civilian labor
force shrank by 5.1% to 4.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   * As welfare reform took hold in the mid-'90s, setting time limits
for cash aid and imposing strict work requirements, the number of
households receiving welfare dropped. In L.A. County, 32% fewer
households--199,000--were receiving welfare in 2000 compared with
1990. In California, the number of households on welfare fell by 42%,
to 563,000. The average individual welfare payment shrank an average
of 37% in L.A. County to $4,946.</TE>
<TE>   Along with economic information, the long-form data showed other
population trends:</TE>
<TE>   * The number of Latinos in L.A. County grew by 26.6% to 4.2
million. County residents of Mexican heritage climbed 20% to more
than 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County's White and</TE>
<TE>   Black Populations Fell</TE>
<TE>   * The county's white population fell 18.3%, and its black
population fell 3.6% while the Asian/Pacific Islander population rose
26.4%.</TE>
<TE>   * The number of adults with less than a ninth-grade education rose
faster than the population growth, by 11.9%, to 955,000.</TE>
<TE>   * The number of county residents with bachelor's degrees climbed
19%, to 794,000. And the total of county residents with graduate or
professional degrees rose 20%, to 517,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties
experienced increases of 36% to 70% in the number of foreign-born
residents, while Los Angeles County's figure increased by 19%, to 3.5
million, or 36% of the population. More than half of L.A. County's
residents--54%--said in 2000 that they spoke a language other than
English at home, up from 45% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the census data show great gains and losses across the
economy and the state.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide increase in the percentage of people in
poverty--30%--was greater than L.A. County's. The state's median
income rose, however, partly because of a jump in the number of
wealthy residents. About 216,000 California residents had incomes
above $150,000 in 1990. In 2000, the number grew to about 642,000,
without adjusting for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' income drop was in sharp contrast to an estimated
national growth in household income of $2,000 during the same period,
said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute
in Washington, D.C. No national census figure is yet available
because the government has released long-form data for only 13 states
so far.</TE>
<TE>   'Something Is</TE>
<TE>   Going Wrong'</TE>
<TE>   Boushey said that in such a national "boom time," Los Angeles'
income decline "really does indicate something is going wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Much of what went wrong was a loss of jobs in the recession of the
early and mid-'90s that was never fully reversed. For example, the
number of manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles County fell in the decade
to 587,000 from 861,000, a decrease of 32%, census data show.</TE>
<TE>   Current research suggests that a key reason why median income in
Southern California is lower than Northern California is the low pay
of jobs created during the 1990s in Southern California. For example,
one of the sectors of the Los Angeles County economy that did expand
in the '90s was the low-paying textile and apparel sector, which
gained nearly 10,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   An ongoing UCLA study of newly created jobs in California shows
large disparities between development in the north and south, said
Ruth Milkman, director of the university's Institute for Labor and
Employment.</TE>
<TE>   The kinds of industries growing in the north were concentrated in
high-tech and generated a large share of professional and managerial
jobs. Southern California's growth, meanwhile, was heavily skewed
toward low-skill, low-wage jobs, in part because of an abundance of
low-skilled immigrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   Service Jobs Grew</TE>
<TE>   More in Southland</TE>
<TE>   "It's part an immigration story, but it's also driven by employer
demand," Milkman said. Service jobs, from valets to carwash
attendants, also grew at a higher rate in Southern California, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's disturbing to me is the lack of a middle," she said. "If
you look at hourly wages for new jobs in Southern California, you get
a strong polarization of high wage and low wage, a pretty steep 'U'.
In Northern California, you see more of a 'J'. That presents real
mobility problems for folks at the low end. We're beginning to
resemble much more a Third World society where a class of people are
stuck at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those stuck at the bottom are immigrants with low
education levels--particularly those from Mexico and Central America,
the largest ongoing stream of migration to the state, especially to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today's immigrants are a diverse lot, including many college
graduates and PhDs--the kind of immigrant entrepreneurs so visible in
the high-technology sectors in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Southern
California, however, has been a particular magnet for newcomers from
Mexico and Central America, who tend to lag in education and often
wind up taking low-wage jobs in construction, the service sector, the
factories and fields.</TE>
<TE>   Those legions of working-poor immigrants contribute mightily to
inflated poverty levels and declining per capita incomes. Their
families tend to be larger than the median, stretching their limited
ability to provide. Consequently, poverty extends to their children,
many of whom are born in this country and are therefore U.S.
citizens. The great bulk of people living in L.A. County now are
either immigrants or second-generation Americans--the children of one
or more immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Other census surveys have noted a downward trend in poverty among
individual immigrants during the 1990s, said USC demographer Dowell
Myers. But that growth is slow, considering that so many arrive with
barely more than junior high school educations--and higher education
levels are widely viewed as the best way out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "All the efforts we see--living wage ordinances, Justice for
Janitors, increased minimum wages--all of these are good for
immigrants and help reduce poverty," Myers said. "But it's not enough
to affect the basic trend. And you can't hold the U.S. education
system responsible for someone only having had an eighth-grade
education level in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Pastor, a UC Santa Cruz economist, said an influx of poor
immigrants "certainly had an impact on Southern California, but
that's only part of the story." He also described Southern
California's recovery from the early 1990s recession as a period in
which "employment increased, but not necessarily income," because of
the preponderance of low-wage jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor credits some of Northern California's success at
high-quality job creation to activism by businesses as far back as
the 1970s. One example he cited was the Silicon Valley Manufacturing
Group, an alliance of mostly technology companies started in 1977 by
then-Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive David Packard.</TE>
<TE>   The Manufacturing Group now has 190 companies as members and
lobbies for transportation, education, energy and environmental
improvements, which it believes fosters industrial growth. "They have
led several fights to raise taxes for things like light rail,
connecting freeways or starting a housing trust. They didn't wait for
community groups [to propose changes]," Pastor said. "You don't hear
a lot of business groups in Los Angeles proposing to raise taxes to
do things like train workers."</TE>
<TE>   High-Tech Firms Draw</TE>
<TE>   Educated Immigrants</TE>
<TE>   Northern California's high-tech industries also attracted large
numbers of highly educated immigrants. Santa Clara County, which has
roughly the same proportion of foreign-born residents as L.A. County,
saw its median income climb 16.5% to $70,243 in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   When incomes are compared by counties, three tiers emerge, with
wealth heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. With
median household incomes above $70,000, Santa Clara, Marin and San
Mateo counties ranked at the top, followed by Contra Costa County at
more than $63,000.</TE>
<TE>   A second tier, consisting mostly of counties where median
household incomes were between $40,000 and $60,000, included Southern
California, the coastal counties south of San Jose and a swath of
counties crossing the state east from the Bay Area. From Stanislaus
County south, all the Central Valley counties made up a third tier of
incomes between $32,000 and $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   The northernmost counties were the poorest, with median incomes
mostly falling between $27,500 and $32,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the period covered by the 2000 census, the northern two-thirds
of the state gained economically compared to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   While median household income was stagnant or declined in all five
counties of the Los Angeles metropolitan region as well as Kern
County, it increased in all but two of the state's other counties.
The greatest gains were in the Bay Area, the eastern Sierra and the
Sacramento Valley counties. The counties of the San Joaquin Valley
generally had small income gains.</TE>
<TE>   Southland's Poverty</TE>
<TE>   Extends to Suburbs</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's poverty extended to suburbs long seen as
refuges from Los Angeles' urban problems. Some scholars think the
rise in poverty in Orange County is even worse than the census data
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   "The income figures that are used to define poverty nationally
obviously don't factor in such things as the higher costs of housing
in California in general, but particularly in places like Orange
County," said William H. Frey, a demographer and sociologist at the
University of Michigan Population Studies Center and the Milken
Institute in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "The national poverty income figure is a figure we use as a
yardstick, but it's a faulty one. In Orange County, it obviously
understates poverty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The figures also paint a dreary portrait of the rapidly growing
Inland Empire. Riverside County saw a 63% rise in individual poverty,
and San Bernardino County sustained a 51% increase. "What you are
seeing is the exporting of the coastal communities' problems to the
inland region," said John Husing, an Inland Empire economist and
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing prices are way out of sight in Los Angeles and Orange
County," said Frank Williams, chief executive officer of the Baldy
View chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California.
The chapter represents builders in eastern Los Angeles County and
throughout San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting, unfortunately, a poorer segment of the population
coming into our counties because of housing costs."</TE>

<CX>   Census data--The headline on Wednesday's Section A story reporting
the 2000 census data on lower household income in Southern California
incorrectly referred to the amount as an average. The $42,200 figure
used was, as the text of the story stated correctly, not an average
but a median, meaning that half of all households made more than that
amount and half made less.</CX>

<HD>Chargers Hire New Stadium Negotiator</HD>
<DH>Sports: Former Tom Bradley staffer will try to help San
Diego football team get new facilities there or in Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers have hired Mark Fabiani, former chief of staff
to Mayor Tom Bradley and then a White House lawyer in the Clinton
administration, to help the team negotiate for a new stadium either
in San Diego or Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Fabiani said owner Alex Spanos prefers to remain in San Diego but
if he cannot get a new stadium, he will consider moving to Los
Angeles. The Chargers say they need a new stadium to remain
financially competitive in one of the NFL's smallest media markets.</LD>
<LD>   Fabiani said that the proposal by billionaire Philip Anschutz to
build a stadium near Staples Center will force San Diego officials to
make a decision in the next few weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles situation is moving more quickly than anyone
anticipated," Fabiani said. "We anticipate getting a call in a month
or two to consider an option to move to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion polls have shown that a large majority of San Diego
voters do not want to finance a new stadium. But, Fabiani said, "We
have a situation where San Diego could lose the Super Bowl forever,
and could lose its pro football team to Los Angeles forever, and
those two facts ought to focus people's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy said that he believes San
Diegans need time before they confront the possibility of public
participation in building a stadium. He noted that the city has
completed four years of litigation over a 1998 public vote
authorizing a downtown ballpark for the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still recovering from the trauma of that
[litigation]," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said he is in contact with Fabiani and a group of San Diego
business executives who are dedicated to finding a way to keep the
Chargers from moving. The group, headed by longtime sports booster
Ron Fowler, is looking for a public-private partnership like the one
approved by voters for the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want San Diego to be in the position of St. Louis and
Baltimore where a team leaves town and five years later people wake
up and say: 'What happened?'" Fowler said.</TE>

<HD>Martha Brown Hicks, 68; Civic Leader Helped Those on Skid
Row</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Brown Hicks, the founding president of Skid Row Development
Corp., which was established to promote economic boot-strapping on
downtown Los Angeles' meanest streets, has died. She was 68.</LD>
<LD>   Hicks, also a former city airports and library commissioner, died
May 7 in her Los Angeles home, current corporation President William
Hill announced. He did not disclose the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of a St. Louis preacher and teacher, Hicks seemed an
anomaly on skid row with her designer suits, managerial style and
doubts about statistical estimates of the numbers of homeless people.</LD>
<TE>   But within 10 years after the Community Redevelopment Agency
tapped her to head its new corporation in 1978, she had set up
Transition House, a 130-bed shelter to help the homeless become
employable, and started several small businesses to create jobs for
them.</TE>
<TE>   She also ran the San Julian Emergency Shelter and built and
renovated commercial buildings for light industrial and
administrative uses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
granted her a special merit award for her work with Transition House.</TE>
<TE>   Despite criticism of her flamboyant style, Hicks was appreciated
as a top-notch fund-raiser who was dedicated to improving life
downtown for the homeless and for businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha is a tireless, energetic, fashionable fund-raiser who is
loved by the business community," architect Chris Martin told the Los
Angeles Business Journal in 1994. "If you put dollars into Martha,
the consequence is an improved environment downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Even when homeless men stared at Hicks, precisely because of her
sleek appearance, she refused to "dress down" to please her critics.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up poor," she told The Times during a stroll through skid
row in 1988. "You have a street sense and a confidence. These people
don't bother you."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks told The Times she had modeled herself on a black attorney
named Mary Bush Wilson who had addressed her St. Louis high school.
Impressed by Wilson's career-day presentation, Hicks decided: "I
wanted to be successful, professional. I wanted to be slim and
svelte. I wanted to have prematurely gray hair and two last names.
And I did."</TE>
<TE>   After completing Hubbard Business College and St. Louis
University, Hicks came to Los Angeles in 1956 and got a job as a
secretary in the Planning Department of the city of Compton. Later
she earned an urban planning certificate from UC Irvine and moved up
to the position of assistant city manager of Compton.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, Hicks was hired by the city of Santa Monica as director
of its grants and community services programs. Four years later, the
Community Redevelopment Agency came calling.</TE>
<TE>   Always well-connected in the business and political community,
Hicks befriended Richard Riordan many years ago after persuading him
to contribute $20,000 to the Skid Row Development Corp. She
volunteered to work in his campaign and, after he became mayor,
Riordan named her in 1994 to the powerful Los Angeles Airport
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, who retired from the development corporation in 1996, was
named by Riordan the following year as a commissioner on the board of
the Los Angeles Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by three children, Pamela, Angela and Michael; two
sisters, Willis Marie Shepard and Rosalie Jackson; one brother,
Dewitt Kilgore; and one granddaughter.</TE>

<HD>Fire Library's Director, Attorney for Nixon Daughter Urges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for one of former President Richard M. Nixon's daughters
has accused the Nixon library's director of sullying the president's
legacy and urged the library board to remove him from office.</LD>
<LD>   The charges by Irvine attorney Thomas Malcolm, who represents
Tricia Nixon Cox, come just days after Cox and her sister, Julie
Nixon Eisenhower, said they were working to end their dispute over
how the library is run.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter sent to board members over the weekend, Malcolm says
John Taylor created a "media frenzy" by suing over a $19-million
bequest to the library by the former president's longtime friend
Charles "Bebe" Rebozo. The lawsuit pits Eisenhower, who wants the
money sent to the library, against Cox, who wants a smaller committee
comprising the sisters and a Nixon friend to control the money.</LD>
<TE>   "By launching a frivolous lawsuit and initiating a media frenzy
about a feud between the president's daughters, Mr. Taylor has
abrogated his duties to the legacy of the 37th president," Malcolm
said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor could not be reached for comment. But others involved in
the library defended him, saying Malcolm's letter contains
half-truths.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also accuses Taylor of failing to encourage and support
scholarly efforts during his 12 years as director of the Yorba Linda
library and of not effectively promoting Nixon's impact both
nationally and globally.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm also told board members that he will provide them with
information that will cause them concern about the library and its
staff. He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent is to reform the governance of the library and educate
the board, and hopefully replace the director of the library. That's
our goal," Malcolm said in an interview Tuesday. "This is something
that needs to be addressed. It was poor judgment in launching this
litigation. The damage done by the executive director, as far as
[Cox's] reputation, is irreparable."</TE>
<TE>   Florida attorney Robert Landon, who represents the library in the
lawsuit over the Rebozo bequest, called Malcolm's comments "puzzling"
and said the letter is filled with "inaccuracies and
misrepresentations."</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm accused Taylor of initiating the lawsuit over the Rebozo
money, when, in fact, the decision to file the litigation was made by
the library board's nine-member executive committee, Landon said.</TE>
<TE>   Landon said Malcolm might have another agenda, suggesting that the
real goal might be for Cox and her husband, New York attorney Edward
Cox, to gain more power over the library.</TE>
<TE>   Dimitri K. Simes, director of the Nixon Center foreign policy
think tank in Washington, said it was ridiculous for Malcolm to say
the Nixon library has not supported scholarly efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon Center, which is affiliated with the Nixon Library and
is overseen by the same board, is a leading public policy institution
on issues of national security and Chinese and Russian relations,
Simes said.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo's bequest has been bottled up in Probate Court in Florida
because of the dispute between the president's daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower wants the funds to be controlled by the library's board
of directors, saying it's the most professional way to manage the
money. Cox wants a committee comprising the sisters and Robert
Abplanalp, a Nixon friend, to oversee the foundation's gift, as she
says Rebozo's will instructs.</TE>
<TE>   With Eisenhower's blessing, the Nixon Library filed lawsuits this
year in Miami, where Rebozo died, and in Orange County, demanding
that the money be handed over to the foundation immediately.</TE>

<HD>Logicon May Have Kept State in Dark</HD>
<DH>Hearings: E-mails at the firm that arranged the Oracle deal
indicate an effort by salesmen to withhold information from a state
official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>E-mails and testimony released Tuesday in a legislative hearing on
the state's $95-million Oracle software contract show that the
salesmen involved limited what they told state officials on the
assumption that "giving too much information can only be a bad
thing."</LD>
<LD>   In a third day of Joint Legislative Audit Committee hearings on
the matter, lawmakers reviewed internal e-mails of Logicon Corp., the
Virginia-based company that pitched the Oracle contract to the state
and stood to earn $28 million from the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mails reinforce the state auditor's conclusion that the
Oracle contract was approved by several state department heads and
Gov. Gray Davis' Cabinet secretary without independent testing of
Logicon's claim that it would save the state more than $100 million
over the next decade.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, according to a sharply critical audit released last
month, the Oracle contract could cost the state $41 million more than
it would have spent otherwise. The contract was intended to license
hundreds of thousands of state workers to use various kinds of Oracle
computer software.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and Logicon have volunteered to rescind the deal, and talks
to do so are underway.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony slowed Tuesday by Democratic concerns that the
bipartisan committee is overreaching its authority, lawmakers heard
Kim Heartley-Humphrey, a Department of Information Technology deputy
director, describe her concern about Logicon's proposal from the
first time it was pitched to state officials in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concerns, Heartley-Humphrey said, was that Logicon
wanted to do a contract through a state purchasing program that
avoided competitive bidding and typically involved computer-related
contracts of no more than $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   She said she also worried that Logicon's claims of massive savings
had not been validated by the state.</TE>
<TE>   On May 28, 2001, three days before the state signed the contract,
Logicon employee Greg Loos described Heartley-Humphrey as
"challenging" in an e-mail sent to Logicon co-worker Rajan Mittu.</TE>
<TE>   "What exactly did she ask you for with this analysis?" continues
the e-mail. "Tim is concerned about giving her too much detail unless
she specifically asks for it, because Kim historically has a habit of
complicating things."</TE>
<TE>   "It's best to keep things at a 'summary' level with her--unless
she has specifically asked for this much detail," states the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Another internal Logicon e-mail from earlier that day states, "We
plan on giving Kim the least amount of data possible. At this point,
giving too much information can only be a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Committee chairman Dean Florez (D-Shafter) asked Heartley-Humphrey
whether Logicon was "intending to keep you in the dark?"</TE>
<TE>   "I really can't speak to that," said Heartley-Humphrey. "They knew
from the beginning that I had major concerns with it."</TE>
<TE>   The auditor found Logicon's projection of how much the state would
save on future Oracle software license purchases and maintenance
"seriously flawed." The company based its numbers on state purchase
orders for Oracle software from 1997 through 2000, but included many
products not covered by the $95-million licensing agreement. Logicon
also inflated the savings by counting some costs twice, according to
the auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman, the parent company of Logicon, said in a brief
written statement Tuesday that because its cost savings data were
complicated, the company decided that giving it to the Department of
Information Technology "would not be helpful at that late stage."</TE>
<TE>   The company repeated its assertion that the Oracle contract
"provides substantial savings" to California.</TE>
<TE>   From its first hearing April 18, the work of the Joint Legislative
Audit Committee has been politically fragile and wide-ranging,
including an unusual and extensive request made Monday for copies of
communications from the governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) warned Tuesday that the committee
risks overstepping its authority and possibly tainting any
prospective criminal investigation. Federal Bureau of Investigation
spokesman Nick Rossi said his agency is working with the U.S.
attorney's office to determine whether a criminal investigation of
the contract is warranted. The state attorney general has also opened
an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The committee defeated a Peace motion to limit the questioning of
each witness by the committee chairman to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think limiting the discussion limits the search for the truth,"
said Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   More hearings are scheduled for Tuesday and June 4.</TE>

<LD>Joseph Lowenbach Steiner, 95, a co-founder of Kenner Products Co.,
which made such popular toys as Play-Doh, died Saturday in suburban
Cincinnati after a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Steiner and his brothers Albert and Philip were in the soap and
soft drink business in the Ohio River city in 1947 when Albert saw a
boy waving a bubble wand through a soap solution, sending bubbles
into the air. The brothers decided to invent a gun that would shoot
bubbles--a product called the Bubble Rocket, which sold more than 1
million units in 1949.</LD>
<LD>   They named the new toy company Kenner Products for the Cincinnati
street on which their offices were located.</LD>
<TE>   Kenner, one of the first sponsors of the "Captain Kangaroo Show,"
was advertising its products on national television by 1958. Among
the other popular toys marketed by Kenner, now a part of Hasbro Inc.,
were the Easy-Bake Oven, Baby Alive, "Six Million Dollar Man" and
"Star Wars" action figures.</TE>
<TE>   The Steiners sold the company to General Mills in 1967, and Joseph
Steiner retired four years later. Two years ago, Hasbro closed the
original Kenner facilities, which once employed 2,500 people.</TE>

<LD>Nothing seems to be going right for the Department of General
Services.</LD>
<LD>   The agency, which oversees the purchase of billions of dollars
worth of goods and services for California government, has lately
been tangled in the politically charged furor over a no-bid
$95-million Oracle software contract. Director Barry Keene resigned
several weeks ago, after the state auditor blasted the contract as
one-sided and possibly unnecessary.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the department set out to improve its shopping
practices.</LD>
<TE>   The department followed standard operating procedure: It asked
private industry to submit bids and proposals for a study of the
state's procurement laws, policies and manuals.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, according to one big law firm that wishes that it
could bid on the multimillion-dollar job, the request for proposals
was written in such a way as to exclude any law firm with experience
in state contracting.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the request for proposals fails to include standard
language on resolving disputes about the contractor's performance.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of studying the department's procurement practices is
"laudable and frankly long overdue," wrote law firm Best, Best &amp;
Krieger in a letter last week to state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon).
But the way that the department set about trying to solicit bids for
the work "may well be some of the best evidence of the necessity for
the study itself."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Per-Pupil Spending Varies Widely</HD>
<DH>Education: Report finds a $1,700 difference between
district with highest expenditure (Laguna Beach) and lowest (Orange).</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A county education report shows wide disparities in how much money
public schools in Orange County are spending on their students.</LD>
<LD>   The school district with the highest per-pupil expenses, Laguna
Beach Unified, spent $7,411 per student in the 2000-01 school year,
while the lowest-spending district, Orange Unified, spent $5,632 per
pupil, a difference of more than $1,700, according to the report from
the Orange County Department of Education.</LD>
<LD>   There are several reasons for the differences, education officials
said. They have to do with the two ways that districts can be funded,
along with the state's complex formula for giving school districts
money for each student. Private donations also play a role, as do
funds that districts might receive for children with special needs.</LD>
<TE>   Laguna Beach, for example, is one of the county's basic aid
districts, meaning it gets most of its funding from property taxes,
rather than being funded by the state for each student that attends.
With growing property values in a high-priced area, the district is
well-funded. In books alone, Laguna Beach Unified spent about $400
per student, almost twice the amount spent in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had $300 more per student, that's more than $5.4 million
that we would have," said Brock Wagner, Tustin Unified School
District's assistant superintendent of business. The district spent
less than $6,000 per student, lower than the average for unified
school districts, which cover grades kindergarten through 12. "I
could do a lot if I had $5.4 million more."</TE>
<TE>   The district could hire specialists, beef up programs or make
campus improvements, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified School District spent $6,477 per student last
year--the second-highest per-pupil spending among the county's 12
unified school districts. That's partly because it also got roughly
$23.8 million from the state for special education--far more than any
other unified school district in the county. With more than 5,000
special education students, Santa Ana Unified has one of the largest
programs in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a greater need for special education funding than other
districts," said Wendy Margarita, assistant superintendent of
business services for the county Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   The per-student spending figures do not include construction bonds
that many Orange County districts have passed.</TE>
<TE>   Some school officials say the disparity has more to do with the
formula the state uses to allocate money than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Until the late 1970s, school districts relied on local taxes for
funding. Proposition 13 in 1978 changed that system, distributing the
money for most districts centrally from the state, based on how many
students attended. But the per-student formula was based to some
extent on property values at the time. Over the years, relative
property values have shifted considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified, for example, receives about $100 less per student
from the state than the state average, while Los Alamitos Unified's
is $202 higher.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because Irvine was pretty much lima beans when these base
revenue limits were set," Margarita said. "Their property taxes would
have been much less than an area such as Los Alamitos, which was much
more urban."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Irvine has relied on private donations to keep
science and other programs going.</TE>
<TE>   The county's per-student spending figure for Orange Unified
doesn't include $3.6 million that the district paid in benefits to
its retired teachers who are over 65. No other district in the county
offers that benefit and carries that expense, said Linda Gibbs, the
district's assistant superintendent of business and finance.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we included that, our per-student expenses would have gone up
to $5,755," Gibbs said.</TE>
<TE>   But the district would still be the lowest among the county's
unified districts, and second lowest in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Most districts in the county fall below the state average--but
still are better off than they would have been in the pre-Proposition
13 days, when funding was based on property values alone. The
exception is a smattering of districts throughout the state such as
Laguna Beach, where property taxes are high enough that the state
determines that the district is better off using that as the source
of funding.</TE>
<TE>   "Our property taxes run pretty high," said Norma Shelton, Laguna
Beach Unified's assistant superintendent of business services. "We
feel fortunate that we were able to have those expenditures. It shows
that we're ... able to provide the best education possible for the
students."</TE>

<HD>Gilroy Quake Is Vivid Reminder of '89 Shaker</HD>
<DH>Seismology: It's one of the strongest in Bay Area since
Loma Prieta disaster. Magnitude is revised down to 4.9.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Gilroy earthquake Monday night was small by Bay Area standards,
but a reminder of what quakes there can be.</LD>
<LD>   The quake's magnitude was revised Tuesday from the original 5.2 to
4.9. Bill Ellsworth, the scientist in charge of earthquake studies
for the U.S. Geological Survey in the West, and Doug Dreger of the UC
Berkeley Seismographic Laboratory, changed the figure based on more
readings from various stations in the state's new Trinet system.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it was one of the strongest quakes in the area since the
1989 Loma Prieta quake, which had a magnitude of 6.9 And scientists
said there is a 70% chance of a tremblor as strong as the 1994
Northridge quake striking the Bay Area by 2030.</LD>
<TE>   There were no injuries or significant damage from Monday's quake,
which was centered three miles southwest of Gilroy, best known for
its annual garlic festival.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists said Tuesday that, contrary to initial word, the jolt
was on the Sargent fault next to the San Andreas fault, not on the
San Andreas.</TE>
<TE>   The jolt sparked a house fire in San Jose when flammable liquids
spilled near a water heater and the vapors ignited. It took 40
firefighters an hour to knock down the fire, said San Jose fire
spokesman Rob Piper. The house was destroyed, he said. Elsewhere the
damage was considered minor.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt really strong," said Joe Kline, a Gilroy city spokesman.
"But I was pleasantly surprised at how little damage was reported. It
was more of a wake-up call to reinforce the need to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   The quake was felt throughout the Bay Area, however, and
scientists attributed the wide scope to the comparatively shallow
depth of the quake, centered just five miles below the surface</TE>
<TE>   The heavy volume of calls after the temblor caused service delays
for half an hour throughout the Bay Area. "Any time you have a
natural disaster, there is network congestion," said Pacific Bell
spokeswoman Jenny Conradi. Phone service was back to normal about 25
minutes after the quake.</TE>
<TE>   The quake also caused a stir at the National Hockey League playoff
game then underway between San Jose and Colorado in San Jose. "This
again focuses our attention on the Bay Area [seismically speaking],"
Ellsworth said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He said there have been several moderately strong quakes in the
Gilroy area in the last half a century, including a magnitude 5.3
temblor in 1959 at the same spot as Monday's quake.</TE>
<TE>   Gilroy is near two major faults, the San Andreas and the
Calaveras, and not far from a third, the Hayward. All three faults
are capable of a 6.7 quake or stronger.</TE>

<LD>The family of a Moreno Valley man killed in last month's train crash
has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Burlington Northern Santa
Fe Railway and Metrolink, saying the two rail lines failed to install
adequate safety devices that could have prevented the crash.</LD>
<LD>   The wife and two daughters of Robert Kube, 59, one of two
commuters who died in the April 23 head-on crash involving a
Metrolink train and a freight train, also allege that operator
fatigue contributed to the incident.</LD>

<LD>Security was increased at the Central Justice Center on Tuesday after
30 demonstrators rallied in support of a Long Beach man arrested on
suspicion of possessing explosives and making terrorist threats.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 Orange County sheriff's deputies and Santa Ana officers
were at the courthouse before the 9 a.m. protest on behalf of Matthew
Gordon Lamont, 20, who was arrested in La Habra on April 20. Long
Beach police said they found him with materials to make a Molotov
cocktail that he planned to use at a birthday celebration for Hitler.</LD>
<LD>   After about two hours, the demonstrators were escorted away by a
sheriff's SWAT team. No one was arrested, authorities said.</LD>

<LD>A pilot and passenger were killed when their small airplane, going
from Fullerton to Carson City, Nev., crashed Monday about 18 miles
east of this small town near Yosemite National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The occupants of the Cessna 210 Turbo aircraft were not
immediately identified by the Tuolumne County coroner, nor was the
cause of the crash immediately known. The crash ignited a small
wildfire, which was quickly extinguished by U.S. Forest Service
firefighters in the Ackerson Meadows area of the Stanislaus National
Forest.</LD>

<LD>Five of eight teenagers accused in an alleged hate-crime attack on
five elderly Latino migrant workers pleaded no contest Tuesday and
face maximum sentences of 12 to 15 years in state prison. Three
others pleaded not guilty.</LD>
<LD>   The workers were beaten with pipes and shot with pellet guns in
their makeshift camp east of Del Mar on July 5, 2000, by teenagers
who yelled ethnic slurs. The teens were allegedly seen in a clubhouse
that had racist and Nazi literature and anti-Latino graffiti.</LD>

<LD>The former director of a job-training program who took bribes and sex
from employees was sentenced to 14 months in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Abdrahman Gamudi, 47, of Oregon pleaded guilty to soliciting and
accepting bribes and sex from employees at the Entrepreneurial
Resource Center. He was fired three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Oliver Wanger said Monday that Gamudi took
advantage of his workers during his "reign of terror." Wanger said
Gamudi's conduct was depraved and ordered him to pay $6,148 in
restitution to victims.</LD>

<HD>5 Asylum Seekers May Be Released</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan and China agreed today that five North Korean asylum seekers
who were dragged out of a Japanese consulate in northeastern China
last week would be released and sent to a third country, Japanese
media reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Kyodo news agency said the agreement came during talks in
Tokyo between China's ambassador to Tokyo and Japan's vice foreign
minister.</LD>
<LD>   Officials, however, would not confirm the deal. The two sides had
agreed only on the importance of an urgent solution, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry official said.</LD>
<TE>   China and Japan have been at loggerheads over the asylum seekers,
including a 2-year-old girl, since Chinese police seized them and
dragged them from the consulate in the city of Shenyang a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the five would be sent to South
Korea or the United States via Manila as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what sort of face-saving agreement would be forged
to resolve the feud. Japan has demanded that the North Koreans be
handed over and that Beijing apologize for the incident, which Tokyo
says violated diplomatic conventions. China insists that its police
received permission from the Japanese consular staff to remove the
asylum seekers.</TE>

<LD>   Poachers in Rwanda have killed two mountain gorillas, a highly
endangered species, in an attempt to capture and sell their young,
wildlife conservation officials said.</LD>
<LD>   With only about 350 of the gorillas remaining in the wild, the
population is so fragile that each one lost is significant, experts
say.</LD>
<TE>   The poachers made off with one baby after killing two females. Two
men are being held in the killings, but officials believe that they
are part of a larger criminal ring.</TE>

<LD>   A veterinarian who failed to diagnose Japan's latest case of "mad
cow" disease has committed suicide, health officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The woman was found dead in her apartment Sunday morning, a day
after the cow tested positive. The Health Ministry confirmed that it
was Japan's first case of mad cow disease since last autumn.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who had failed to spot early signs of the disease in
the cow on the island of Hokkaido, was not identified. She left a
suicide note reading, "As a veterinarian, I apologize for such
actions," according to a manager at the health center where she
worked.</TE>

<LD>   A woman has been jailed for 60 days for failing to stop her
daughters from skipping school--a punishment that her family called
unfair but that educators applauded.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Amos, 43, was sentenced in Banbury last week for not
ensuring that her daughters Jackie, 13, and Emma, 15, regularly
attended school.</LD>
<TE>   It is believed to be the first time that the courts have jailed a
parent under powers gained in November 2000, when the maximum penalty
for allowing a child to skip school was raised from $1,400 to $3,650
and up to three months in prison.</TE>

<LD>   After decades of logging that left large swaths of the country
looking like a desert wasteland, China embarked on a $10-billion,
10-year program to plant 170,000 square miles of trees--an area
slightly larger than California.</LD>
<LD>   It is the largest reforestation project ever, forestry officials
said, suggesting that only an unprecedented effort can stop the
chronic droughts and deadly flooding blamed on logging.</LD>
<TE>   Six separate projects are planned, ranging from reforesting
hillsides to creating nature reserves for pandas, Tibetan antelopes
and rare orchids.</TE>

<LD>   A Jordanian woman became the first to be granted a divorce under a
law amended in January, a court official said in Amman. Previously,
only men in this Islamic nation could initiate a divorce.</LD>
<TE>   The woman, identified as "S," had filed for the divorce on the
grounds that she hated her husband, "M," and they could not live
together. Her request was granted last week.</TE>
<TE>   The husband accepted the divorce after she agreed to return a gold
coin, which was part of her dowry, and renounced her claim to $7,000
in a marriage contract.</TE>

<HD>Demands by Hard-Liners and Outsiders Vex Sharon and Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Both leaders try to finesse political pressures.
Israel kills 2 Palestinians, arrests 15.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told lawmakers Tuesday that the
nation must remain vigilant, even as the army underscored his point
by raiding four West Bank villages before dawn, killing two
Palestinian intelligence officers and arresting 15 suspected
militants.</LD>
<LD>   "There will be no sanctuary for terrorists," he told parliament,
adding that peace talks would not resume until the violence stopped
and the Palestinian leadership was overhauled.</LD>
<LD>   In his speech--which was met by heckling that saw one legislator
removed from the chamber--Sharon said his government was trying not
to react to provocation, even as he accused Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat of ordering and organizing terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon avoided mentioning the political drubbing he received
Sunday when members of the central committee of his Likud Party
defied him and passed a resolution ruling out the idea of an eventual
Palestinian state west of the Jordan River. Instead, the prime
minister reiterated his position that any peace agreement would
require a long lead time and a significant reform of the Palestinian
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be a different [Palestinian] Authority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Labor Party, however, questioned whether the
architect of the recent intense military campaign against Palestinian
cities and towns in the West Bank really wants a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "The prime minister can portray himself as a supporter of a
Palestinian state, but we know this is not where he is headed," said
Ophir Pines-Paz, a Labor lawmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat and his advisors reject Sharon's conditions and condemn the
idea of pursuing any interim solution. Peace will come only when
there is a final settlement to create an independent Palestinian
nation, they counter.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the rhetoric and vows on both sides never to compromise is
a set of internal and external pressures that Sharon and Arafat are
trying to finesse, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of this week's Likud challenge, Sharon must decide how
to position himself relative to his own party; to former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his leading challenger in the party; and
to the Israeli electorate.</TE>
<TE>   If he decides to tilt further to the right to meet Netanyahu's
challenge, he could hurt his chances in the next election, which must
be held by November 2003. If he tilts closer to the center, he could
lose his party's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot will depend on how he plays things in the next few weeks,"
said Joseph Alpher, an Israeli political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also has a difficult set of problems to tackle. He's facing
calls both internally and externally to reform the Palestinian
Authority, streamline its decision-making structure, revamp its
security apparatus and flush out corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's call for reform focuses on how the Palestinian Authority
deals with security and spends its money--issues that can have an
immediate impact on the safety of Israeli citizens. Palestinians, on
the other hand, want reform in order to placate foreign critics and
to enhance their own lives through more representative government.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very different agendas," said Ali Jirbawi, a political
scientist with Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. "About the only
thing they have in common is the word 'reform.'"</TE>
<TE>   Arafat faces political limits in his ability to overhaul the
Palestinian Authority even if he wanted to, given the perception
among his people that he would be bowing anew to U.S. and Israeli
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   His revolutionary credentials already were tarnished when he
agreed last week to end a standoff at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem by exiling 13 militants overseas and sending 26 more to the
Gaza Strip, a concession to Israel seen by many as a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has the added problem of turf battles within his various
security forces. Late Monday, Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan
Asfour was beaten by five masked men, an attack that was believed to
be part of this maneuvering.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat is a survivor and has shown an ability to get out of tight
corners. Nevertheless, what he is likely to do--perhaps as early as
today, when he is scheduled to address Palestinian lawmakers--is to
offer a face-saving reform plan that might include a limited election
in a bid to blunt critics and buy time.</TE>
<TE>   Both Arafat and Sharon face politically extreme wings of their
party or movement intent on invoking past pain and violence they have
suffered, said Yaron Ezrahi, an Israeli author and political analyst.
"There's a lot of sensitivity and some very loaded moves on the
agendas of both sides," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Getting these extremes to compromise is obviously very difficult,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But viable peace talks involving a fully committed U.S. could give
both leaders political cover, allowing them to shift closer to the
center, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the political jostling, the Israeli army reported Tuesday
that its soldiers killed Khalid abu Kheiran, a Palestinian
intelligence official, and one of his deputies during a shootout in
the West Bank village of Halhoul. Witnesses said a third man was
arrested and another escaped. In separate actions, Israeli forces
arrested 14 suspected Palestinian militants in other West Bank
villages.</TE>

<HD>33 Die in Kashmir Attack</HD>
<DH>India: The three assailants who opened fire at an army base
are among those slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India</DL>
<LD>Suspected Islamic militants attacked an Indian army base in Kashmir
on Tuesday, shooting soldiers and their families in the camp's living
quarters in an assault that left at least 33 people dead, including
10 children, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the deadliest attack by suspected militants in the disputed
Himalayan region since an Oct. 1 suicide bombing and shootout at the
state legislature that left 40 people dead.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, three assailants in army uniforms got off a bus
outside the camp at Kaluchak and fired at soldiers, police Supt.
Subhash Raina said. Seven bus passengers were killed in the ensuing
battle, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The militants then entered the camp's residential quarters and
fatally shot five soldiers and 18 of their family members, said Chief
Minister Farooq Abdullah, the top elected official of India's Jammu
and Kashmir state. The three militants also were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the victims were children and 12 were women, he said. At
least 45 people were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Kaluchak is six miles south of Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christina
Rocca met with top Indian officials Tuesday to urge them to resume
dialogue with Pakistan to end a six-month military standoff between
the nuclear rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just this type of barbarism that the war on terrorism is
determined to stop," Rocca said.</TE>
<TE>   A Kashmiri news agency said it received two phone calls from
Islamic militant groups claiming responsibility for the attack, but
Indian officials said neither claim seemed credible.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Islamic militant groups have been fighting since
1989 for the independence of the Indian-controlled portion of the
Kashmir region, or its merger with Pakistan. New Delhi accuses
Pakistan of arming, training and funding the militants. Pakistan
denies doing so but says it supports their goals.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani government condemned Tuesday's attack. "Such
incidents warrant an impartial and comprehensive inquiry to unmask
the motives of their perpetrators," a government statement said.</TE>
<TE>   In India's Parliament, Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani said that
"the incident appears to have been timed to demonstrate to the world
that despite the global coalition against terrorism, terrorists in
Jammu and Kashmir will continue to be active."</TE>

<HD>New Chief to Take Command of U.S. Troops in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Military: Army Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill is tapped to be first
in the region to oversee the war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. military plans to install a new commander of American forces
in Afghanistan, marking the first time that a single officer
stationed in the region has been designated to oversee most aspects
of the ongoing war.</LD>
<LD>   Army Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps,
is expected to occupy the new post by month's end. Pentagon officials
said Tuesday that the move is designed to streamline the command
structure and replace an arrangement in which the various services
report to separate regional leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The change was ordered by U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Tommy
Franks, who is based in Tampa, Fla. McNeill will report to Franks,
Pentagon officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Franks "wants to have a subordinate who is doing hands-on,
day-to-day" management of the war, said Marine Corps Gen. Peter Pace,
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The change in command
structure, Pace said, allows Franks "to spend perhaps a little more
time on the rest of his region," which encompasses 24 other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill will be placed in charge of almost all of the 7,000 U.S.
forces in Afghanistan, although special units will continue to report
directly to Franks, a spokesman said. McNeill also will coordinate
efforts involving thousands of coalition forces from Canada, Britain
and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Pace said the United States is still trying to
identify 32 prisoners captured Sunday in a Special Forces raid near
the Afghan city of Kandahar. Five other suspected Islamic militants
were killed in the nighttime operation. Pace said U.S. forces were
fired on first.</TE>
<TE>   He said the raid was launched after the U.S. obtained information
indicating that a senior Taliban commander was in the vicinity,
raising speculation that the operation may have been aimed at
capturing the elusive former Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar.</TE>
<TE>   But a U.S. intelligence official said Tuesday that Omar was not
the target. He declined to say whom U.S. forces were pursuing in the
operation but said a Taliban commander did not appear to be among
those killed or captured.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Khan Mohammed, head of the Afghan military in Kandahar, told
Associated Press that U.S. troops had captured former Taliban
regional commander Abdul Salam in the city late last week after Salam
met with U.S. officers and an aide to the city's governor.</TE>
<TE>   Pace also said U.S. forces had uncovered two large weapons caches
over the past week in operations near Herat and Orgun, a town south
of Gardez near the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   The materials included five T-54 tanks, hundreds of
rocket-propelled grenade and mortar rounds and more than 1 million
rounds of machine-gun ammunition.</TE>

<HD>U.N. OKs New Iraq Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Sanctions: The import of items with potential military use
requires prior approval. Permits for food and relief goods will be
expedited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday to impose new
import controls on Iraq, overhauling a 5-year-old sanctions system
that has been derided by the right as ineffectual and by the left as
unfair to ordinary Iraqis.</LD>
<LD>   The new system features a catalog more than 300 pages long of
products with potential military use that the Persian Gulf nation
will not be allowed to purchase without specific approval. At the
same time, the United Nations will expedite import permits for food,
medicine and other humanitarian items, as well as for oil industry
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S.-backed plan was designed in part to mollify critics in
Europe and the Middle East who blamed Iraq's rising rates of infant
mortality and malnutrition on existing U.N. import controls.</LD>
<TE>   "It will facilitate greatly the movement of humanitarian and
purely civilian goods to the Iraq economy," U.S. Ambassador John D.
Negroponte said. "By simplifying this export regime and focusing it
more on products and services that could contribute to a weapons of
mass destruction program, I think the regime has been made more
effective."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats also said they hoped that the council's
unanimous support for the sanctions plan will increase pressure on
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri has met twice this year with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss sanctions and arms
inspections and is expected back here this month for a third round of
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Syria, the lone Arab representative on the 15-member council, had
raised objections during the last week to the new sanctions system,
but it joined in the unanimous vote.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats here representing Hussein's government condemned the
passage as further "harassment of the Iraqi people" and reiterated
their demands for the complete removal of trade controls.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials contend that the inventory of items the U.N. says
could be used for weapons development includes hundreds of products
needed for legitimate industry, such as high-powered computers and
pharmaceutical equipment.</TE>
<TE>   As before, the U.N. will continue to collect all of Iraq's
declared oil revenue, which is placed in an escrow account and used
to pay for approved imports.</TE>
<TE>   "This will prevent any development of the Iraqi economy for the
future," said Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Douri.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. imposed sanctions after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990 and has kept measures in place since, in part because it wants
proof that Baghdad has given up all efforts to develop weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The new sanctions plan's lengthy "goods review list" was
negotiated during the last three months between Russia, which has
become Iraq's biggest supplier of advanced industrial equipment, and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under the existing sanctions system, adopted in December 1996,
Iraqi import orders are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by a U.N.
monitoring committee. An Iraqi purchase can be halted by any Security
Council member that suspects the item could be used for military
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, backed in some instances by Britain, is using
this power to block $5.2 billion in Iraqi orders for machinery and
other goods, some of them dating back years.</TE>
<TE>   Several affected supplier countries--including Russia, France and
China, all permanent members of the Security Council--have accused
Washington of stopping civilian imports that the sanctions system was
designed to permit and punishing foreign companies that sell to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints were cited by Iraqi and other Middle Eastern
critics as evidence that sanctions were being used not to thwart
Iraq's military programs but to cripple its industry and public
services.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Accused of</TE>
<TE>   Political Delays</TE>
<TE>   "There were grounds for suspicion that the U.S. was indulging in
highly political delays on products that did not really represent
that kind of threat," said Richard Murphy, an expert on the region
with the Council of Foreign Relations and a former U.S. ambassador to
Syria and Saudi Arabia. "We had played with things just to stick it
to the Iraqis."</TE>
<TE>   The new catalog of "dual use" goods was conceived by the Bush
administration as a way of avoiding these frictions while maintaining
tight constraints on the Iraqi military. Though many import orders
halted by the United States might now be denied permanently, about
$700 million in blocked sales of Russian goods will be allowed in
under the new system, according to diplomats here.</TE>
<TE>   Syria had asked last week that the authorizing resolution
acknowledge Iraq's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N.
Charter--a move intended to signal opposition to U.S. military action
and to bolster Iraq's arguments that it should be allowed to buy or
build conventional weapons. But none of the other 14 council members
supported the Syrians and the motion was withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   Alleged Conspiracy</TE>
<TE>   to Circumvent Sanctions</TE>
<TE>   Though Syria joined the 1991 Persian Gulf War coalition that drove
Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, it recently has been accused of
conspiring with Baghdad to circumvent U.N. sanctions. In the most
serious charge, Syria is said by Western diplomats and independent
oil industry analysts to be illegally importing about 150,000 barrels
of oil a day by pipeline from Iraq, providing Hussein's government
with petroleum income outside U.N. control and freeing up Syrian oil
for the export market.</TE>
<TE>   "Syria has a reason to join the consensus of the council because
otherwise she is looking very exposed as a country that is not fully
following the resolutions on the export of Iraqi oil," Jeremy
Greenstock, Britain's U.N. ambassador, said after Syria had won a
one-day delay in the sanctions vote Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But the Syrians and other Arab nations continue to blame U.N.
import controls for health problems in Iraq. Many leaders of the
European left also have become vocal opponents of the sanctions. Last
month, a group of 120 Western European activists, including French
members of the European Parliament, flew to Baghdad to protest the
impact of sanctions on Iraqi children.</TE>
<TE>   The child mortality rate in Iraq has almost doubled since the
1980s, and malnutrition--once rare--is now endemic in the rural south
and in the capital's poorest suburbs, according to surveys by local
and foreign health professionals.</TE>
<TE>   But trade sanctions are not the cause of the crisis, according to
U.N. experts familiar with the country. The precipitous decline in
health indicators began during the final and most intensive stages of
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, continued during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and accelerated as a result of U.S. bombing raids during the Gulf
War, they say.</TE>

<HD>Deadly Messages to Mexico</HD>
<DH>Some officials say the Arellano Felix drug gang has killed
1,000 people to assert its control. The stories of two victims reveal
its ruthlessness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Their killings were surgical, their brutality unspeakable, and their
death toll on California's doorstep runs well into the hundreds. Many
of their victims were symbolic, chosen for the message their slayings
would send, and by all official accounts, the killing was fun.</LD>
<LD>   One victim was Jose "Pepe" Patino Moreno, a notably honest man who
worked amid the corruption of Mexico's counternarcotics squads. The
fearless, soft-spoken prosecutor who had won rare trust from U.S. law
enforcement was found in a steep ravine on the road to Tecate. His
head had been crushed by an industrial press; his 47-year-old body
was so broken it felt like a bag of ice cubes when they lifted it.</LD>
<LD>   The message: No one is beyond the reach of the Arellano Felix
gang.</LD>
<TE>   Alejandro Hodoyan has never been found. His mother watched
helplessly as her eldest son was kidnapped at gunpoint in broad
daylight in downtown Tijuana five years ago. She had been driving him
to San Diego, where Hodoyan was to enter the U.S. federal
witness-protection program.</TE>
<TE>   The message: Don't snitch on the Arellano Felix brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Arellano Felix Organization, Mexico's most powerful
drug gang has for more than a decade used violence and money to
maintain control of the lucrative Baja peninsula drug-smuggling
corridor, through which a fourth of the cocaine consumed in the
United States is funneled. A federal grand jury indictment filed in
November 1999 called the gang a violent criminal enterprise run by
two racketeering brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Other documents and sources uncovered by The Times in recent weeks
provide a rare inside look at the cartel's brutality, its
effectiveness and the ruthlessness of its leaders.</TE>
<TE>   That portrait comes amid new hope that recent setbacks suffered by
the gang may mean its era of terror is nearing an end.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Arellano Felix, the enforcer who was on the FBI's 10 most
wanted list, is dead, killed in a February shootout with police in
Mazatlan. Brother Benjamin, the "chairman of the board," was arrested
in Puebla weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the image the Arellano Felixes carved out for themselves
remains so fearsome that, even now, few people seem willing to speak
out against them.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, who are preparing a case to extradite Benjamin,
insist they have secret witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We have spent millions of dollars to protect witnesses against
the Arellano Felix Organization," said Errol J. Chavez, head of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's San Diego office since 1997.
"And they're hidden throughout the United States. They're not all
dead or afraid to talk."</TE>
<TE>   As yet, though, none have done so publicly, despite dozens of
arrests and prosecutions of the cartel's drug mules, midlevel
assassins and top lieutenants.</TE>
<TE>   But the stories of the victims--pieced together from law
enforcement sources, official records north and south of the border
and the remembrances of family and friends--testify not only to the
cartel's inner workings but also to its corrosion of Mexican life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to see any limit to the evil," said Patino's
sister, Maria Guadalupe Patino Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   The official list of victims is so lengthy that the members of a
multi-agency U.S. task force set up to target the organization in the
mid-1990s finally gave up on a color-coded "Dead Chart" they had
designed. They had documented about 300 victims when they stopped
counting a few years ago. Some U.S. agents now put the toll as high
as 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead are nearly two dozen Mexican law enforcement
officials, many of them corrupted by an estimated $1 million a week
in bribes the cartel spread around under a policy of plata o
plomo--"silver or lead"--according to former DEA chief Thomas A.
Constantine.</TE>
<TE>   A handful were honest police officers or prosecutors, men such as
Patino and Baja California state prosecutor Hodin Gutierrez Rico, who
was shot more than 120 times in front of his family and then run over
repeatedly by a van.</TE>
<TE>   There were rival, upstart drug traffickers who failed to pay the
Arellano Felixes for transit rights through the Baja corridor.
Authorities say the cartel punished one such group in Ensenada in
September 1998 by lining up 18 men, women and children and executing
them one by one.</TE>
<TE>   Other victims were from the gang's own ranks--suspected embezzlers
or potential informants, cartel lawyers who knew too much, even
family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just to kill someone. It's terrorism," said William
Gore, who heads the FBI's San Diego office. "It's to intimidate an
entire population.... And that's how they stayed in power so long."</TE>
<TE>   Added Don Thornhill, a DEA veteran of the war on the Arellano
Felixes based in San Diego: "If you know your kids are going to get
killed, your mother, your wife, that helps keep people in line."</TE>
<TE>   Here, based on official documents and sources, is the story of two
of the victims: one an insider who produced the only portrait on
record of the family's methods and moods, the other an outsider, a
cartel hunter whose killing was a catalytic event, several law
enforcement officials say, that paved the way for Benjamin's capture
and Ramon's death.</TE>
<TE>   "To kill is a party. It's fun. No remorse or anything. They smile
after an assassination, and they go eat a lobster in Rosarito. Pure
lawlessness. That's what this thing is."</TE>
<TE>   The words are Alejandro Hodoyan's, describing the network of
assassins loyal to Ramon Arellano Felix. His videotaped
comments--made in 1996, after weeks of torture by the Mexican
military, Hodoyan later alleged--live on, five years after Hodoyan
himself vanished.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Mexican officials insist that Hodoyan's brother, Alfredo,
was among the Arellano Felix assassins--a young man from a well-off
Tijuana family who was one of the so-called Narco Juniors.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo, who was extradited from San Diego in 1999, is on trial
now in Mexico City in the killing of a corrupt federal police
commander, Ernesto Ibarra Santes, who allegedly was slain because of
his loyalty to a rival cartel. Ibarra died in early September 1996,
the day after Alejandro Hodoyan was picked up by a military
counternarcotics squad.</TE>
<TE>   Military authorities held Alejandro for months until, after what
he later described as constant beatings in documents on file in San
Diego federal court, he agreed to provide an insider's view of the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro, a native of San Diego and captain of his Tijuana high
school basketball team, had been friends with Ramon and his top
assassins since they were kids, he said. But throughout months of
interrogation, Hodoyan insisted that he was never directly involved
in the cartel's multi-ton drug deals or its many killings.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he cast himself as something of a confessor. The gang
leaders and their lieutenants came to his apartment, he told
investigators. They drank beer. And they spun out story after story
of how they did business.</TE>
<TE>   Hodoyan's confessions--some on file in U.S. federal court and the
rest contained in a bootleg copy of his videotaped statement (the
official copy remains under federal court seal)--reveal details of
the cartel and its leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He describes how the group's killing of Guadalajara's Roman
Catholic cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, in 1993 was a rare
error, how Ramon and his assassins mistook the prelate for a rival
drug lord who had tried to kill the brothers at a Puerto Vallarta
discotheque the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's killing catapulted the brothers into the public eye
in Mexico and led to the jailing of Francisco, the eldest, the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   Hodoyan also explained the brothers' Mafia-esque hold on their
followers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arellanos are very different with their own people," he told
investigators. "The Arellanos pay them with favors.... They give them
houses, they give them cars. If I have a problem, if one of their
people gets put in jail and he has no money, they go and get him a
lawyer, they pay for whatever is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a relative in the hospital, they pay for whatever is
necessary. A debt, if you're going to lose your house, they give you
money."</TE>
<TE>   As for the drugs--federal investigators say the cartel has moved
hundreds of thousands of pounds of cocaine and marijuana into the
U.S. and hundreds of millions of dollars back--Hodoyan detailed the
trafficking routes.</TE>
<TE>   And of Ramon, Hodoyan said: "Where there is danger, Ramon puts
himself there. He always has to be doing something. In 1989 or 1990,
we were on a corner in Tijuana with nothing to do, and he tells us:
'We are going to kill someone. Who has a beef with someone?'</TE>
<TE>   "Cars passed by, and he asked us [to point out] whoever we knew.
Whoever got pointed out showed up dead in a week. Nothing more than
to kill."</TE>
<TE>   In early 1997, Mexican officials turned Hodoyan over to U.S.
authorities in San Diego, where a newly formed task force was
targeting the cartel as never before. He gave a brief statement to
the DEA, and Assistant U.S. Atty. Gonzalo Curiel offered to put him
in the federal witness-protection program on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Hodoyan balked, fearing he would never again see his wife, two
daughters and an extended family, relatives now say. He returned to
Tijuana to think it over. At the end of a long family meeting on
March 4, 1997, Hodoyan decided to accept the U.S. prosecutors' offer.
The following day, he was kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't accept the witness protection when we offered it,"
Curiel recalled. "And that was unfortunate, because we had real-time
information that he was going to be abducted and killed by the
Arellano Felix Organization"--warnings Curiel said were passed on to
Hodoyan.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five years old when he vanished, Hodoyan became one of the
500 or so men and women with ties to the drug trade who human rights
activists in Tijuana say have gone missing since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro's mother isn't convinced her son is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Cristina Palacios Roji Hodoyan, who has spent years trying to find
out if he is actually being held somewhere as a protected future
witness, declined to talk about the case. She said her lawyer told
her that to do so could influence the outcome of her other son's
ongoing murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   But she added: "I just want someone to say what happened to my
son. I don't think it's fair for my two granddaughters to have that
limbo, to grow up not knowing whether they have a father or not.</TE>
<TE>   "And for me, when I go to church, I don't know whether to pray for
Alejandro's soul or to pray for him."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks before Pepe Patino crossed the border into Mexico
for the last time in April 2000 at California's Otay Mesa border
station, a colleague in Mexico's attorney general's office took him
aside.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are critical," fellow prosecutor Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz told
Patino. "You are not covering yourself well. You are here alone
without enough people to fight this cartel. You should be thinking
about quitting this job and making a change.</TE>
<TE>   Patino replied: "No. This is my job. I like it. And I'll take the
risks."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez recalled the conversation in a recent telephone interview
from Vienna, where he now serves on a U.N. transnational
organized-crime task force.</TE>
<TE>   Chief of the Mexican government's organized-crime unit at the
time, Gonzalez had assigned Patino to help lead the investigation
into the Arellano Felix brothers in 1993, immediately after Cardinal
Posadas' killing.</TE>
<TE>   Patino, a Mexican-trained lawyer of humble roots, was known for
his white shirts, dark "Blues Brothers" suits, gentle manner and
willingness to take on any assignment. His lifestyle was built solely
on a Mexican government paycheck and showed not even a hint of
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Patino and his group would arrest Francisco, the eldest
brother, now serving eight years in prison for his involvement in the
cardinal's murder. Benjamin and Ramon would be indicted in the U.S.
on racketeering charges alleging they headed a criminal enterprise
specializing in drug trafficking, money laundering and murder. Ramon
would be placed on the FBI's most wanted list--alongside Osama bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Through those years, Patino proved himself tough, fearless and
honest. In 1998, an unarmed Patino stood down more than 70 heavily
armed, crooked cops protecting drug lords in Cancun. He was
instrumental in the arrest of top Arellano Felix henchmen, who were
later released by a corrupt Mexican judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very simple man, very honorable. He loved his work very
much. When I told him to be careful, he would always say, 'Don't
worry, daughter, I'm well accompanied.' But he wasn't," said his
widow, Maria de Lourdes, from her home in a working-class Mexico City
barrio.</TE>
<TE>   When the DEA, FBI and U.S. attorney's office in San Diego agreed
to provide Patino with a safe house and sensitive drug intelligence
information in January 2000, it marked the beginning of a new era of
bilateral cooperation that continues today.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Patino as someone they could trust.</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop was years of bitter betrayal and suspicion between
U.S. and Mexican drug investigators. By then, U.S. officials presumed
that all local, state and federal police in Tijuana had been
corrupted--if not by the Arellano Felixes then by rival cartels. And
Mexican officials believed that American investigators routinely
trampled on Mexican sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   When Patino arrived on the scene, former U.S. Atty. Charles G. La
Bella recalled, "we had a crucible. We had critical mass.</TE>
<TE>   "Pepe was a very quiet man, but he was an extremely effective
man," said La Bella, who headed the criminal division of the U.S.
attorney's office in San Diego in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very forceful interviewer. He was not averse to knocking
some heads. He was a guy who'd throw around drug dealers in their
jail cell, knowing they could hurt him on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   "He sent them the message he didn't fear them or their
organization."</TE>
<TE>   On April 10, 2000, Patino's Chevy Lumina sedan was commandeered
shortly after crossing into Mexico from the U.S. Local police
insisted for nearly a week that what happened to it was just a road
accident, but an autopsy of Patino later showed that he, like the two
slain Mexican federal officers found with him, had been so badly
tortured that most of his bones were broken before he died.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was so much to send the message that they can
kill cops and prosecutors as it was to find out what he knew,"
recalled San Diego FBI chief Gore. "I read the autopsy, and there's
no doubt, whatever Pepe Patino knew, they knew."</TE>
<TE>   Patino's killing sent clear messages nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "It sent me a very strong message that the cartels had more
influence than we recognized," said DEA chief Chavez, adding that he
is convinced Patino's assassins knew of his every move through
high-level leaks within the Mexican attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a message to Mexico City: Don't come into our area and
screw with us. And the message to me was that they were so
influential, that they had so much control and that they were so
daring that they could go after that level."</TE>
<TE>   Former prosecutor La Bella and his successor, San Diego U.S. Atty.
Patrick K. O'Toole, said Patino's death also was a watershed that
helped lead to Benjamin Arellano Felix's recent capture--and to the
current high level of U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the drug war.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a turning point," La Bella said. "I think it had the
effect of galvanizing U.S. law enforcement. It convinced them that
this was a war--a war we couldn't lose--and I think the Mexicans
realized that this was a line in the sand."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the significance of Patino's death, it took 16 months for
his widow and four children to begin receiving his pension, which
amounts to a mere 12% of the $80,000 hazardous duty pay he was
earning at the time of his death.</TE>
<TE>   His eldest daughter, Cristina, says she receives death threats
from someone inside law enforcement aiming to discourage the family
from seeking his killers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, despite their recent successes against the two top
Arellano Felix brothers and an apparent resolve to target the cartel
after Patino's death, Mexican authorities have yet to charge anyone
specifically with his killing.</TE>
<TE>   And that too bears a message.</TE>
<TE>   "It's demoralizing for other prosecutors when they see that happen
to the Patinos, to be mistreated by their own government," said Jose
Luis Perez Canchola, a former Baja California state attorney general
for human rights based in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. law enforcement official said: "If that happened to
a U.S. law enforcement officer, we'd leave no stone unturned--legal
or illegal--to find out who did it.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem is cultural. In Mexico, people don't think
people get killed for doing the right thing."</TE>

City.</TE>

<HD>Davis Seeks Tax Hikes to Bridge Gap</HD>
<DH>Budget: Levies would target drivers, smokers. Deep cuts in
health programs for the poor are also part of package.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis proposed raising taxes Tuesday on smokers and
motorists to help overcome what has grown into a $23.6-billion budget
shortfall, saying there was no other way to protect schools.</LD>
<LD>   The move reversed a promise Davis made in January not to ask for
tax increases.</LD>
<LD>   The tax hikes--an $84 increase in the average vehicle license fee
and a boost of 50 cents per pack in the cigarette tax--would total
$1.75 billion, according to Davis' estimates. But although they
probably will account for most of the Capitol's budget debate in
coming weeks, they represent only a share of Davis' plan to fill the
budget shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the gap would be closed by $7.6 billion in spending
reductions, including deep cuts in health programs for the poor.
Davis also relies heavily on various accounting shifts, budget
transfers and loans, such as borrowing $4.5 billion against the
state's future share of the national tobacco settlement and
postponing some payments to schools.</TE>
<TE>   His fourth budget as governor surely isn't the one Davis hoped to
propose as he seeks reelection. It represents a dramatic reversal of
fortunes in just two years. In May 2000, Davis presented a budget
that featured an unanticipated surplus of $12.3 billion and offered
tax rebates along with new spending on education and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of cuts and new taxes outlined Tuesday would allow
the state to protect spending on public education, meeting the
voter-mandated guarantee of $47.2 billion for schools in the fiscal
year that begins July 1, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor defended his call for higher taxes, saying the size
of the budget gap left him no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-four billion dollars crosses the line," he said. "I had to
find other ways to close this gap. I'm not going to sacrifice the
future of our children, particularly in public education. Without
some revenue increases, I would have had to do that."</TE>
<TE>   But the governor's plan puts Davis and fellow Democrats on course
for a prolonged budget battle with Republican lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The budget needs a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and Assembly
to pass, so Democrats need at least four Republican votes in the
Assembly and one in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said he
knew of no lawmaker in his party who would support the tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Timing of Hikes Is Questioned</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent reference to the proposed increase in the vehicle
license fee, which would not take effect until Jan. 1, Brulte said
that if Davis really wants a tax increase, "he ought to have the
political courage to propose that it take effect before the Nov. 5
election rather than after the election."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blame the state's fiscal woes on Davis' spending
habits. By Davis' own account, general fund spending has grown by 32%
during his first term in office. That represents lower growth than
during all but two of the 10 previous gubernatorial terms.</TE>
<TE>   Davis cited an economic downturn compounded by the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 and the state's tax structure as reasons for
California's fiscal headaches. He said the top 5% of taxpayers
account for 70% of state revenues.</TE>
<TE>   That structure lifted the state's budget during the dot-com boom
and coinciding bull market.</TE>
<TE>   The state is now feeling the flip side, however, since the burst
of the Silicon Valley tech bubble and a downturn in the stock market,
which has left wealthy Californians unable to take advantage of stock
options or capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues from the stock options and capital gains are expected to
plummet from a peak of $17.6 billion in 2000 to $8.2 billion in 2001
and $7.2 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   The $23.6-billion shortfall estimate represents nearly a doubling
of the state's budget woes since January, when California faced what
was thought to be a $12.5-billion problem.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Davis called for $5.2 billion in budget cuts. The
revised budget adds an additional $2.4 billion in cuts as well as the
tax increases. New trims target libraries, mental health and juvenile
justice programs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also proposed borrowing $4.5 billion against the state's
tobacco settlement, nearly twice as much as the $2.4-billion sum he
floated in January.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John Burton, the San Francisco Democrat, said he
doubted members of his caucus would go along with cuts in crime
prevention programs for juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to find the revenues and make it work," said
Burton, who wants to raise taxes on high-income Californians. "Now
that the issue of taxes is on the table ... it's like being a little
bit pregnant. They are on the table and the need has been
acknowledged."</TE>
<TE>   Criticism Comes</TE>
<TE>   From Tax Targets</TE>
<TE>   The revised budget released Tuesday was quickly criticized by some
of those who would be taxed, as well as some who would see their
programs cut.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris spokesman Tom Ryan criticized the cigarette tax,
saying California smokers already pay some of the highest levies in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fundamentally unfair to single out smokers to balance the
state budget," Ryan said. "The taxes on cigarettes are already the
highest of any consumer product. It's bad public policy. This is a
tax directed at roughly 20% of the population. A good tax, a fair
tax, is evenly spread out throughout the population."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor complained that the most vulnerable members
of society appeared to be taking the biggest hit.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Keddy of the Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a
coalition of faith-based groups that has lobbied to expand health
coverage for the uninsured, said the cuts will have a damaging effect
on California's social safety net.</TE>
<TE>   "It's worse than I expected," Keddy said. "The bottom line is that
poor people in California are going to have a harder time getting
health care."</TE>
<TE>   "The indirect impact of scaling back [social services]
administration is that people will be facing longer lines," added
Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Projects, a
group that advocates for the poor during the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their problems with some of Davis' proposed cuts, Ross,
Keddy and Democratic lawmakers rallied around the governor, whom they
praised for being willing to talk taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "In an election year, for him to make these very tough
recommendations on the cuts side but also the revenue side, [is] a
testament to his responsibility and strength," said Assemblywoman
Jenny Oropeza, the Long Beach Democrat who chairs the Assembly Budget
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Trauma Care Is</TE>
<TE>   a Prime Concern</TE>
<TE>   Oropeza said her caucus remains concerned about funding for trauma
care and that a health insurance program for children be expanded to
include their parents.</TE>
<TE>   The new Davis spending plan assumes that the state will float
bonds to repay the general fund for the more than $6 billion spent on
electricity during last year's energy crisis. It also assumes that a
plan to borrow about $7.5 billion to avert a cash crunch this summer
passes muster with Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's revised budget relies on about $1 billion in
increased funding from the federal government for health, security
and other expenses. It counts on another $1 billion being freed up by
refinancing the state's debt. It also defers for two years a program
that allows businesses that lost money in one year to avoid paying
income taxes on certain future earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The change is expected to save the state $1.2 billion in the near
term but cause additional pressure on state finances in future years.
Another $3.5 billion is found through loans and by shifting and
transferring funds.</TE>
<TE>   Local government officials said they were relieved that Davis had
not resorted to shifting large sums from cities and counties to fill
the state's budget gap, as Gov. Pete Wilson did a decade earlier to
maintain education spending. Many local government advocates were
worried that Davis would stop payments to cities and counties that
are intended to make up for money the locals lost when vehicle
license fees were cut a few years ago. But they were troubled by an
array of program cuts that passed costs down to them, including more
than $30 million in subsidies meant to help save farmland from
development, and an array of health and mental health reductions.</TE>
<TE>   State officials estimated the cuts and funding deferrals would
result in $1 billion less for counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a billion seems to be a large amount," said Steve Szalay,
executive director of the California State Assn. of Counties. "We are
especially concerned about cuts that shift costs to us, because that
hits us hard. Is it intended to be a cost shift to counties, where
counties make it up, or a loss of services to poor people? Both are a
problem to us. The counties can't afford to take on those costs."</TE>
<TE>   By choosing to apply his paring knife to social services and other
programs, Davis once again staked out education as a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   The governor proposed roughly $1.7 billion in funding shifts
between the current fiscal year and the upcoming one to avoid
suspending Proposition 98, the 1988 ballot measure that dedicates
about 35% of the state general fund for public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Payments due to schools in the current fiscal year for programs
such as summer school would be delayed until after the start of the
new fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "To us, this is an ingenious way to protect education funding
between the two years and [help] solve the overall problem that the
state faces," said Barbara Dean, president of the California Assn. of
School Business Officials.</TE>
<TE>   Added Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn.:
"Given the gravity of the budget deficit, this is a good budget."</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who handles
budget matters for his caucus, described the funding shifts as "an
accounting trick."</TE>
<TE>   California's college and university systems also were largely
spared from serious cuts. Officials said the comparatively ample
funding would rule out student fee increases for the coming school
year, except for previously planned hikes for non-California-resident
students attending schools in the University of California and
California State University systems.</TE>
<TE>   College administrators said the budget trims also avoided cutbacks
in instructional programs.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-campus Cal State system was targeted for a proposed $50.4
million in cuts from its proposed $2.76-billion budget. Cal State
officials said the cuts mainly would affect such areas as maintenance
and library purchases.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting of the CSU's Board of Trustees in Long Beach, Richard
West, the system's chief financial officer, termed the cuts
"manageable."</TE>
<TE>   "Higher education, and education in general, has been pretty well
protected," West said.</TE>

<HD>Governor Throws Down the Gauntlet</HD>
<DH>Budget: In making hard choices, Davis issues a challenge to
Capitol Republicans and rival Simon to show where they would cut
instead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By raising taxes and slashing programs for the poor, the budget Gov.
Gray Davis outlined Tuesday provides an opening for his opponents,
Democrat and Republican alike.</LD>
<LD>   But it also shows a willingness to take unpopular stands,
something not usually associated with a governor who has long found
solace in the center and often delayed--recklessly, critics
say--inevitably tough decisions.</LD>
<LD>   While it is too soon to gauge the political impact, Davis' plan
effectively throws down the gauntlet, to use the words of one
campaign advisor. In both word and deed, the governor challenged
Republicans in the Legislature as well as their gubernatorial
candidate, Bill Simon Jr., to come up with a less painful way of
closing the $23.6-billion gap.</LD>
<TE>   "If someone can produce a better budget, I'd be happy to look at
it," Davis said. "If they don't present a comprehensive budget that
balances and adds up, then I'm going to stick with mine."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Paul Maslin, the governor's pollster and a senior political
advisor, put it, "They can either be part of a constructive process,
or they can blow the whole thing up with political demagoguery and an
irresponsible plan. And if they choose the latter, we're going to
make sure that sees the light of day over and over and over."</TE>
<TE>   Simon quickly took up the challenge. Even before Davis unveiled
his budget, the GOP nominee held a press conference in Los Angeles to
criticize the governor.</TE>
<TE>   He said Davis should have anticipated the looming shortfall and
trimmed state spending accordingly. Instead, Simon went on, "Gov.
Davis has been more interested in his campaign treasury than the
state's treasury.... Because Davis is so focused on fund-raising,
he's neglected his responsibility to provide leadership on the
budget."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has issued a patchwork of proposals, including a 15% cut in
operational spending and reductions in health care and education
programs, as a means of closing about half the budget gap. He has
also called for trimming the state tax on capital gains and a
reduction in homeowners' taxes, without saying how he would offset
those further reductions in state revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Simon has yet to issue the sort of detailed document that
Davis was forced to produce on Tuesday, and has no intention of doing
so, said spokesman Jeff Flint.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll certainly talk about some of the proposals Bill has made
before," Flint said, as well as "the principles and methods" Simon
would use in approaching the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Even absent those details, the Davis camp was quick to invite
comparisons between the two plans, offering its own highly partisan
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, you don't want a budget deficit in an election year,"
Maslin said. "But it also offers a very clear choice between
responsibility and irresponsibility, between a balanced approach and
one that would cut the life out of education, health care and
policies for the aged."</TE>
<TE>   Gale Kaufman, a Democratic consultant who has frequently faulted
Davis for equivocating, praised the governor on Tuesday for taking
"some tough and risky steps."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're cutting things and raising taxes ... I think you have
to call that leadership," Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, of course, found other words and in that way the
budget battle--and a critical phase of the gubernatorial
campaign--was joined.</TE>
<TE>   Like any budget, the spending blueprint the governor outlined is a
political document. The revised budget is structured in a way that
provides Davis with maximum protection. By far the bulk of
Californians won't notice any tax hike until after November's
election. An increase in the vehicle registration fee, for instance,
won't kick in until Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   There are major cuts, particularly in Medi-Cal--the main health
care program for poor people--and welfare recipients won't receive
cost-of-living increases under Davis' plan. There may even be layoffs
of state workers, as many as 4,000 by administration estimates. But
within the Capitol, welfare and Medi-Cal recipients aren't viewed as
likely voters, and state public safety workers aren't among those who
face pink slips.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say there won't be pain, or that the budget will
pass without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Davis needs two-thirds votes in both houses to gain legislative
passage, meaning he must hold on to Democratic lawmakers--who may
balk at many of the spending cuts--and win over at least a handful of
Republicans--who have every reason to prolong the agony.</TE>
<TE>   "Far more damaging than the nastiest attack ad is a steady stream
of headlines about the horrible, ugly things Gray Davis will have to
do to fix this mess," said Dan Schnur, who was communications
director for Gov. Pete Wilson in the early 1990s, when the Republican
imposed deep cuts and raised taxes to close a $14-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Schnur envisioned a ghastly series of imagined stories: "'Governor
Cuts Programs For Children' ... . 'Governor Cuts Programs for Poor
Children' ... 'Governor Cuts Programs for Poor Handicapped Children'
.... After awhile, there is a cumulative effect."</TE>
<TE>   Davis--and California--are hardly alone in their fiscal straits.
Roughly 45 governors across the country, both Democrats and
Republicans, are facing significant budget shortfalls. Many political
analysts say California's deficit, vexing and painful as it may
prove, is not enough to recast the dynamic of the governor's race--at
least not yet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another thing, like the energy problems, like the perception
of ethical questions," said John Kohut, who handicaps gubernatorial
contests across the country for the Cook Political Report, a
nonpartisan Washington publication. "You could sit down and make a
list of two dozen factors and go, 'Wow.' In another state, two or
three alone could kill the incumbent. But in California the
circumstances are different."</TE>
<TE>   The state is so overwhelmingly Democratic, Kohut said, that a
candidate with Simon's conservative stance on social issues such as
guns, the environment and abortion--which the candidate
downplays--faces a built-in disadvantage even when times turn sour.</TE>
<TE>   That said, a prolonged budget standoff could hurt Davis in ways
both subtle and immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "It relates to the competency issue, the thing that hurt him in
the energy crisis," said Tony Quinn, a GOP analyst in Sacramento. "It
looks like he spends all his time raising money and isn't minding the
store."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Quinn said, the budget is "an ethereal thing. It's in
the newspaper, but it doesn't affect people. [But] if police officers
aren't paid, if the Highway Patrol isn't on the street, if people
aren't getting their pension checks, that's different. If this drags
into the summer, it could be like those blackouts last year, which
very much affected people in a personal way."</TE>

<KH>THE 2000 CENSUS</KH>
<HD>Data Belie L.A.'s Auto Image</HD>
<DH>Census: City is not tops in cars per household and has
above-average rate of transit use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing numbers of poor, longer commute times and better public
transit may be cutting into L.A.'s love affair with the car.</LD>
<LD>   New census data released Tuesday show that Los Angeles has fewer
cars per household than other big cities in California. And the
percentage of Los Angeles commuters who rely on mass transit is
double the state average, according to Census 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Among the state's big cities, L.A. ranks sixth in mass transit
use, behind such transit-reliant cities as San Francisco, Berkeley
and Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   Although the number of commuters is up, there was almost no change
in the proportion of people statewide who use mass transit (5%) or
carpools (15%). California has spent at least $12 billion on mass
transit and adding 800 miles of carpool lanes between 1990 and 2000.
That is in addition to local and federal mass transit spending.</TE>
<TE>   A lion's share of the state transportation money was spent in
Southern California, on the 59-mile Metro Rail system in Los Angeles
County and the 416-mile commuter rail network that stretches from
Ventura County to San Diego County. Together, the two systems cost
nearly $8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite new commuting options, about 72% of Californians still
drive to work alone; the average commute time has increased about
three minutes since 1990, to 28 minutes one way.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, about 76% of commuters drive alone, spending 27
minutes on average to get to work, about two minutes more than in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, Orange County has spent much of its
transportation money on expanding a freeway system that is
increasingly filled with workers from the Inland Empire, said George
T. Urch, spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority. He
said construction delays and new commuters from Riverside and San
Bernardino counties help explain why Orange County commuters are
spending so much time on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We've expanded virtually every freeway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Urch said he expects local mass transit use to increase in the
next few years as his agency considers adding rapid bus lines and new
commuter rail extensions. "We are trying hard to come up with
alternative transportation growth," he said, "not just freeways."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation experts said Californians continue to rely on cars
to get to work partly because of relatively low gas prices and a good
economy. But transit officials predict that mass transit use will
grow as freeways become more crowded and demographic changes bring
more low-income transit riders into the work force.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 census found that L.A. County's median household income
fell since 1990, prompting many to seek more affordable public
transportation, said transit planners. Nearly 7% of commuters in the
county travel to work by bus or rail. In the city of Los Angeles,
more than 10% of commuters use public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Commute times have increased nearly three minutes in L.A. County,
to 30 minutes one way, and county transit officials are upbeat about
luring more commuters out of their cars. They note that the county
has higher average transit use than the state, and they predict more
passengers in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Jim de la Loza, executive planning officer for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, said the census data collected in early
2000 do not reflect a dramatic growth in local transit ridership over
the last two years. Since March 2000, he said, ridership on the Metro
Rail subway line has more than doubled, from 63,750 boardings per day
to 130,293.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past couple of years we have made some major
improvements," De la Loza said, and more are planned, including new
rail extensions and rapid bus service.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having some of the nation's worst traffic congestion, Los
Angeles drivers do not have the longest commutes. That title goes to
the desert community of Lake Los Angeles in the northeast corner of
the county, where commute times average 53 minutes one way.</TE>
<TE>   Workers in Palmdale have the longest commute times among cities
with a population of 100,000 or greater. Drivers there spend an
average of 43 minutes getting to work.</TE>
<TE>   Census data show that such a commute time may be driving Palmdale
residents to mass transit. In 1990, the census showed 271 Palmdale
commuters used public transit. That number jumped threefold by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Budlong, executive director of the Antelope Valley Transit
Authority, said his agency was launched in 1992 to serve those
commuters.</TE>
<TE>   The bus service carries about 500 commuters per day on 14 buses,
and Budlong said demand continues to grow.</TE>

<HD>Budget Plan Called Unfair to Poor</HD>
<DH>Medi-Cal: Advocates say deep cuts would mean the loss of
health care for many people.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Health advocates said Tuesday that Gov. Gray Davis' plan to balance
the state budget would obliterate the safety net for poor adults and
have a devastating effect on an already teetering health system.</LD>
<LD>   The governor has proposed cutting $758.3 million in general fund
payments for Medi-Cal, which provides medical services primarily to
poor children, pregnant women, senior citizens, and blind and
disabled people.</LD>
<LD>   Because Medi-Cal is jointly funded by the state and federal
governments, the state's cutback would lead to the loss of an
additional $350 million in federal matching funds.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not reasonable to put the burden of the budget cuts on the
backs of the working poor, of the working families," said Anne Marie
Flores, co-chairwoman of the PICO California Project, a faith-based
group that advocates increased government support for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians said their colleagues are likely to stop taking
Medi-Cal patients because the average reimbursement rate will fall
from $20 per office visit to $16, the same rate as 1985. That is the
lowest rate in all 50 states, according to the California Medical
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see how physicians are going to be able to continue
to see these patients, unless they get a miraculous increase from
someplace else," said Dr. John Whitelaw, president of the doctors
group.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said they could not please everyone with their
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a very rich package of benefits under the Medi-Cal
program, and we've tried to sustain that as long as we can," said
Grantland Johnson, secretary of California's Health and Human
Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're faced with this daunting revenue shortfall, you have
to take measures that you otherwise would not take in better economic
times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In total, the changes would reduce the Medi-Cal enrollment by
490,600, or about 7% below what Davis had previously estimated, state
officials said. The proposed cuts in health care would:</TE>
<TE>   * Postpone an expansion of health coverage for 300,000 adults.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Bush administration approved a plan to
expand coverage beginning in July for parents of low-income children
who are currently eligible for government health programs. The adults
involved would be working parents earning up to twice the federal
poverty level, which equals about $35,300 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   * Postpone "express lane eligibility," slated to begin July 1, in
which the state would have allowed school districts to automatically
enroll children in Medi-Cal through the free and reduced lunch
program.</TE>
<TE>   * Reinstate procedures in which adults need to fill out forms
every quarter to remain enrolled in Medi-Cal. Adults currently need
to fill out paperwork annually. Added paperwork has been shown to
reduce enrollment in public insurance programs because people forget
to re-enroll or consider it too cumbersome.</TE>
<TE>   The state expects this change to remove 247,000 adults from
Medi-Cal rolls next year.</TE>
<TE>   * Eliminate dental, chiropractic, acupuncture and podiatry
services for adults in the Medi-Cal program.</TE>
<TE>   * Reduce the number of covered dental exams for children from two
per year to once a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the income requirements for two-parent families to
enroll in Medicaid if their children are enrolled. Families would not
be allowed to enroll unless they earn less than 67% of the federal
poverty level. Currently, all families earning less than the poverty
level are eligible. A family of three would now need to earn less
than roughly $9,800 to be eligible.</TE>
<TE>   That would prevent enrollment of 146,000 parents who otherwise
would have joined in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   * Increase by $86 million, to $136 million, the fee the state
takes from hospitals that provide health services to large numbers of
low-income and uninsured patients.</TE>
<TE>   The response from health groups was near-universal disappointment.
They agreed that the governor had to make difficult decisions, but
said he should have opted to raise taxes or fees in order to spare
cuts for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an ugly day," said Anthony Wright, organizing director for
the health-reform group Health Access. "We're going through it [the
budget], and it looks very ugly. At the end of the day, children,
seniors and working families will not have access to the health care
they need under these cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said the increased take-aways from safety-net
hospitals would cause some facilities to close services. The cuts
come in addition to $184 million in cuts expected later this year
from the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   At Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in San Bernardino County,
administrator Mark Uffer said he might have to close nine primary
care centers, which attempt to prevent emergency room visits.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I think this is a game of chicken," Uffer said.
"You're taking a system that's very fragile, and you're going to make
it more fragile, and sooner or later, it's going to collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dinesh Ghiya, a Whittier pediatrician who sees Medi-Cal
patients, said he may drop out if the lower rates are approved.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't afford to see those patients," he said. "It costs me at
least $35 to $36 to see each patient. If I'm already subsidizing [the
cost], it's going to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Dentists likewise complained about the elimination of dental
benefits for adults. If adults can't get their dental exams covered,
they are unlikely to take their children to the dentist, said Liz
Snow, director of public policy for the California Dental Assn. In
addition, she said, poor dental health has been linked to other
ailments, including heart disease and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire focus of dental care is prevention, and that focus
would be entirely eliminated," Snow said. "That is the devastating
approach."</TE>

<HD>Orange County Less Suburban, More L.A.</HD>
<DH>Trends: An influx of immigrants in the '90s and a growing
divide between rich and poor have erased some of the differences
between the regions, new data show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and RAY F. HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade of immigration and dwindling middle-class jobs shredded the
divide separating Orange County--once the epitome of white
middle-class suburbia--from Los Angeles County, its urban,
multiethnic neighbor to the north, newly released census figures
show.</LD>
<LD>   During the '90s, Orange County underwent a shift in economics,
language and education, with increases in the number of wealthy,
educated citizens and in the ranks of poor, low-educated immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   "Orange County is now sharing the same benefits and challenges as
L.A. County has, in becoming a destination of new immigrants in the
1990s," said William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of
Michigan's Population Studies Center and the Milken Institute in
Santa Monica. "Part of the challenge is the growth at both ends of
the 'barbell' economy in terms of skill sets, occupations and
incomes."</LD>
<TE>   More broadly, the growing diversity of the region signals "the
popping of the Orange County stereotype as the bastion of white
flight," said Scott Bollens, chair of the department of urban and
regional planning in UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology.</TE>
<TE>   The changes can be heard as well as seen: More than a million of
the county's 2.8 million residents--41.4%--now speak a language other
than English at home, a radical shift underscoring a fast-evolving
demographic profile.</TE>
<TE>   In this and other ways, the census shows that Orange County has
lost the insularity that once defined it and separated it from Los
Angeles County, where the number of people speaking a language other
than English at home reached 54% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County census figures also sharply define the class
split between the older northern cities, where the less affluent are
concentrated, and the newer suburban areas of south Orange County,
where the upper middle class and the wealthy have flocked.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange Curtain is now within Orange County, instead of
separating Orange County from Los Angeles," Bollens said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's changing face is detailed in new census data gleaned
from long forms filled out by more than 130,000 of Orange County's
935,000 households during the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   The demographic changes underscore the tasks facing educators and
economic developers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the challenges is: How do we create a diverse community
and have affordable housing and everything else for everyone who
wants to live and work here?" said William M. Habermehl, county
superintendent of education.</TE>
<TE>   The changes show the county "is not the suburbia it used to be,"
Frey said.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see in the economic and education data suggests the same
kind of divisions in this suburban county that we used to see only in
big, urban cities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those divisions fell largely along development lines. Newer--and
more expensive--areas of the county tended to be home to the
wealthier and better-educated, and low-income and less-educated
families poured into older neighborhoods in the county's core cities
of Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove and Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   "This ... creates the fear that we're becoming two counties, one
rich and one poor," said Stan Oftelie, president of the Orange County
Business Council.</TE>
<TE>   The divide is felt in myriad ways.</TE>
<TE>   "People here don't think of themselves as being a part of Orange
County," said Dee Higby, 56, at the end of a round of golf at Tustin
Ranch Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   "They think of themselves as living in Newport Beach, or living in
Santa Ana. The county is balkanized."</TE>
<TE>   Higby, who lives in a 3,200-square-foot, four-bedroom home on
Newport Beach's Lido Isle, sees the divide as economic rather than
racial--and porous for those with the drive to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   The division in education is striking. In Santa Ana, for instance,
56.8% of the population over age 25 had not graduated high school, up
from 50.3% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of educational deterioration was greater in Tustin, where
51.8% lacked high school diplomas, up 25% from 10 years before. In
Stanton and Garden Grove, about one in three adults over age 25
didn't have one, up about 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet three of four adults in Newport Coast had college degrees, as
did more than half the adults in Irvine, Las Flores, Villa Park,
Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Coto de Caza.</TE>
<TE>   The demographic changes swept most prominently over Tustin, a
former farm town in central Orange County consumed by suburban sprawl
in the '80s and a flow of immigration in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   There, people speaking a language other than English in the home
nearly doubled, from 27.8% in 1990 to 46.6% in 2000. Over the same
span, the number of foreign-born residents increased from 21.6% of
the population to 33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "With that many languages spoken, it creates a tremendous set of
challenges for K-12 education, trying to accommodate the primary
language spoken at home, while at the same time teaching English,"
Bollens said.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, median family income dropped from $66,755 to $64,611,
and even the well-to-do say their wealth is largely on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Rubery, 34, a city planning consultant, and his wife,
Stephanie, an Irvine city planner, earn about $135,000 a year.
Statistically, they are in Orange County's upper middle class, and
they live in a 1,600-square-foot condo in Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "By federal standards, we're incredibly rich," he said. "With the
cost of living in Orange County, we don't feel particularly rich."</TE>
<TE>   With the continuing erosion of the middle class, he said, the
county's political and social pressures will increase.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised if down the road there's an attempt to
break off one section of the county from the other along the lines of
the secession movement in L.A.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mike Anton and Milton Carrero Galarza
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>   The Catholic Archdiocese of Boston knew in the early 1990s that a
local priest facing charges of child rape was psychologically damaged
"beyond repair," medical records show, but still approved his work
with youths at a church-affiliated hostel.</LD>
<LD>   Medical and psychiatric records released in connection with a
civil suit show that archdiocesan officials and doctors exchanged
correspondence in the 1990s about Father Paul Shanley in which they
expressed concern over his psychological condition and whether he
might cause further harm.</LD>

<LD>   Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged thus far in connection
with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has appealed to a U.S. Court of
Appeals to overturn an order requiring him to undergo a mental health
exam and another order naming his defense attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   According to court documents filed in Richmond, Moussaoui--who
wants to represent himself--opposes U.S. District Judge Leonie
Brinkema's April 22 order for a mental health evaluation.</LD>

<DL>COOSAWHATCHIE, S.C.</DL>
<LD>An Amtrak train struck a log truck at a crossing Tuesday morning,
derailing all 10 cars and the engine and injuring 14 people,
emergency officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Two people were seriously injured. Most of the injuries involved
neck and back problems, with some people complaining of stomach
injuries from when the engineer attempted to stop, said Mike Hodges,
emergency management director for Jasper County.</LD>
<LD>   The train was traveling from New York to Miami when it derailed at
9:07 about 35 miles north of Savannah, Ga., said Amtrak spokesman
Bill Schulz There were 103 passengers and 10 crew members on board.</LD>
<TE>   The train was going 79 mph when it hit the rear of the truck,
separating the bed from the cab, said Cpl. Chuck Wise of the South
Carolina Highway Patrol. The driver, who told police he did not see
the train, was not hurt. He was in the truck cab when the train hit.</TE>
<TE>   Wise said the engineer applied the train's emergency brakes, and
the train had its lights on and the horn sounding. The crossing is
surrounded by woods but there is visibility down the tracks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marion C. Blakey, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said the NTSB would send staff members to investigate the
crash.</TE>

<HD>Ethnicity Influences Diabetes Damage, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The link between ethnicity and complications from diabetes is more
consistent than researchers had previously thought, even when all
patients have equal access to health care, a large-scale study has
found.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser Permanente researchers studied more than 62,000 diabetes
patients in California and found that whites were more likely than
blacks, Asians and Latinos to experience heart attacks but less
likely to suffer kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers say the study provides the first definitive data about
disparities in how diabetes affects different ethnic groups.</LD>
<TE>   "When people do have fairly consistent access to health care,
ethnic disparities diminish or are dramatically different" than
previously reported, said Andrew Karter, an epidemiologist with
Kaiser Permanente in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The differences probably have a genetic link, said Karter, the
lead author of the study, which is to be published today in the
Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Karter said most research comparing the incidence of disease among
different ethnic groups includes insured and uninsured patients,
sometimes leading to inconclusive results.</TE>
<TE>   "You may get a biased look at complications in these national
studies," he said, adding that if a disparity exists, "you can't
really tell if that's due to biology or quality of care."</TE>
<TE>   The study compared the rates of incidence of major complications
among the HMO's patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes from 1996 to
1999. Type 1 patients require insulin treatments to control the
disease, while those with Type 2 often can combat symptoms through
diet and exercise.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the finding about heart attacks, researchers found
that whites and blacks were at equally greater risk of developing
stroke or congestive heart failure than were Asians and Latinos,
Karter said. Asians were least likely to require amputations.</TE>
<TE>   But blacks, Latinos and Asians were far more likely than whites to
experience kidney failure. The mortality rate is 50% in the first
five years of kidney disease, Karter said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers described the paper as important and say it opens up
questions for study.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look at the disparity and not assume whites are going
to do better," said Dr. Richard Hamman, chief of preventive medicine
at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   He warned, however, that minorities develop Type 2 diabetes at a
higher rate than do white patients. A larger number of members of
ethnic groups are at risk overall as a result.</TE>
<TE>   For different ethnic groups, this confirms that "there are certain
intrinsic differences," said Dr. Mayer B. Davidson, diabetes
researcher and director of the clinical trial unit at Charles R. Drew
University of Medicine and Science.</TE>

<HD>Photo Fund-Raiser Causes a Flap</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP will offer a Sept. 11 picture of
President Bush to donors. Democrats, including Al Gore, say it
exploits the tragedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush is allowing congressional Republicans to
solicit money by selling a photograph of him talking on the telephone
with Vice President Dick Cheney just hours after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, a fund-raising technique that Democrats say
exploits the tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats also accused Bush of being hypocritical after saying for
eight months that America's war on terrorism is not a political
issue.</LD>
<LD>   Among those who weighed in Tuesday was former Vice President Al
Gore, Bush's opponent in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "While most pictures are worth a thousand words, a photo that
seeks to capitalize on one of the most tragic moments in our nation's
history is worth only one--disgraceful," Gore said in a statement
issued by his office. "I cannot imagine that the families of those
who lost their lives on Sept. 11 condone this--and neither should the
president of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The White House flatly rejected such criticism. Spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Bush has no problem with the GOP's latest fund-raising
effort because the photo is nothing more than "a representation of
the president ... doing his job for the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer also argued that the furor merely highlights the
Democrats' lack of more substantive issues with which to confront
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Democrats are having a very difficult time coming to
grips with the fact that this is a very popular president," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The partisan flap erupted just hours before the Republican
National Committee's annual presidential gala, which was expected to
raise about $30 million. That amount would break the single-night
record for political fund-raising of $26.5 million, set in 2000 by a
Clinton-Gore event here.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night's black-tie dinner in Washington provided the GOP
with one of its final opportunities to raise a huge amount of "soft
money" donations, soon to be banned by recently enacted campaign
finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,500 people were expected at the gala, according to Ricardo
Bernal, an RNC spokesman. He said there would not be an immediate
breakdown of "hard" and "soft" money donations from the event.</TE>
<TE>   Hard money is given directly to candidates for federal office,
while soft money goes to political parties for party-building
activities. Current law limits hard-money donations to $1,000 per
donor, per candidate, while soft money will remain uncapped until
late this year.</TE>
<TE>   The shot of Bush aboard Air Force One on Sept. 11 was taken by a
White House photographer. It was released to the news media, which
then widely disseminated it.</TE>
<TE>   The other two pictures were taken by news photographers, according
to Fleischer--one during Bush's inauguration in 2001 and the other
during his State of the Union speech in January.</TE>
<TE>   All three photographs were purchased by a commercial vendor,
Corbis, which sold them to the party. They are being offered by the
Republican House and Senate campaign committees.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP pitch touts the photos as demonstrating "the gritty
determination of our new president at his inauguration; a telephone
call from Air Force One to Vice President Cheney the afternoon of
Sept. 11, 2001; and President Bush's historic State of the Union
speech before a joint session of Congress that united a nation and a
world."</TE>
<TE>   The minimum price for the three-picture set is $150. Along with
the photographs comes an invitation to a June dinner hosted by the
two campaign committees.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a message from Cheney, who touted the dinner as, in
part, a chance to honor Bush "for his courageous leadership during
this historic time.... "</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's fund-raising activities also have been
criticized by watchdog groups. On the eve of last year's presidential
gala, he held a reception for about 400 top GOP donors at his
government-provided vice presidential mansion.</TE>
<TE>   The party's marketing of Bush's Sept. 11 photo surprised even some
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign of sloppiness," said one GOP strategist. "Why use a
picture that's going to cause a controversy when there are 2 million"
others available, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign,
added: "Every piece of direct mail that goes out needs to be looked
at ... on how it would play vis-a-vis the occupant of the White
House."</TE>
<TE>   None of the photographs was run past the White House, Fleischer
conceded, adding: "The party committees made their decision; the
White House did not object" to their use for political purposes.</TE>
<TE>   As the November elections approach, and with the control of both
houses of Congress in the balance, the president has been increasing
his appearances around the country for GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   In those speeches, Bush has not deviated from his rhetoric on the
war against terrorism, saying consistently that America is united in
that effort.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his chief political strategist, Karl Rove, gave critics an
opening by telling the winter RNC meeting: "We can also go to the
country on this issue because they trust the Republican Party to do a
better job of protecting and strengthening America's military might
and thereby protecting America."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Democrats let loose.</TE>
<TE>   "For the congressional Republicans to sell an historical
photograph of President Bush talking to Vice President Cheney on
Sept. 11 is nothing short of grotesque," said Terry McAuliffe,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's the Republicans' strategy to use the war for
political gain, but I would hope that even the most cynical partisan
operative would have cowered at the notion of exploiting the Sept. 11
tragedy in this way. White House photographs are meant to create,
present and document a real-time historical record. This potentially
illegal misuse of a White House photograph is incredibly
disrespectful to the families of the thousands of Americans who lost
their lives just hours before this photo was taken."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed a bill Tuesday meant to screen out terrorists
by using high-tech passports and 400 more border enforcers to check
the millions of people who enter the United States each year.</LD>
<LD>   The new law also will mean closer monitoring of foreign students
here.</LD>
<LD>   The law will require that passports issued after 2003 contain
fingerprints or facial recognition technology and be tamper-proof. It
will bar the use of certain visas by people from countries listed as
terrorism sponsors.</LD>
<TE>   The State Department's list includes Iraq, North Korea, Iran,
Sudan, Cuba, Libya and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   The law strengthens requirements that planes and passenger ships
traveling from other countries provide lists of passengers and crew
members before arriving, and it reiterates the need for a database of
suspected terrorists. It will also record and track noncitizens at
educational institutions and the issuance of student visas.</TE>

<HD>'63 Bombing Suspect Said to Brag</HD>
<DH>Courts: Trial opens with claim the ex-Klansman boasted of
his role in fatal crime at church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>When it came to the church bombing, Bobby Frank Cherry was a
braggart, prosecutors said, boasting at family reunions, telling
neighbors, even once sharing the story with a stranger laying carpet.</LD>
<LD>   "Over the years, Bobby Cherry has worn this crime on his chest
like a badge of honor, like a Klan medal," said prosecutor Robert
Posey. "He said his only regret was that more people didn't die."</LD>
<LD>   With that, the prosecution opened the long-awaited trial Tuesday
of the last remaining suspect of the deadliest crime of the civil
rights era, the dynamiting of a Birmingham church on Sept. 15, 1963,
that killed four black girls.</LD>
<TE>   On day one, there was testimony about Klan robes and schoolhouse
beatings; video footage of seething mobs wearing tight, white
T-shirts rolled up at the sleeves; and old civil rights leaders
hobbling up to the witness stand to hunch over the microphone and
talk about the battle for equality.</TE>
<TE>   An ex-Marine trained in explosives, Cherry was 33 at the time of
the bombing and a member of the Eastview Klavern 13, an especially
violent cell of Birmingham's Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, prosecutors played a newsreel clip from 1957 that
showed Cherry taking a swing at a black minister.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, now 71, swiveled in his chair to watch. He looked bored.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby's just an old guy who's completely innocent and wants this
to be over," his lawyer, Mickey Johnson, said earlier. Cherry faces
four counts of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution focused on the hatred of the times, with opening
statements heavy on history.</TE>
<TE>   Posey reminded jurors--a 16-member panel including four
blacks--that this was the Alabama of George C. Wallace, the governor
infamous for vowing: "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow,
segregation forever!"</TE>
<TE>   And it was the Birmingham of Bull Connor, the police chief who
unleashed dogs and fire hoses on marching kids.</TE>
<TE>   As Posey spoke, occasionally using visual aids, there were tears,
gasps and long silences. At one moment, an elderly white female juror
stared at the video screen, transfixed by a picture of Carole
Robertson, 14, wearing a white dress, a single rose in her hands.</TE>
<TE>   She was among the four killed, some so badly burned in the bombing
they had to be identified by their shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an awful sound, like something shaking the world all
over," testified Alpha Robertson, Carole's 83-year-old mother.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents quickly zeroed in on four suspects, all known
Klansmen--Robert Chambliss, Herman Cash, Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and
Cherry. But the bureau didn't file charges. A white jury would never
convict them, then-director J. Edgar Hoover said.</TE>
<TE>   But, in 1977, an Alabama prosecutor went after Chambliss, known as
"Dynamite Bob," convicting him and sending him to prison, where he
died eight years later. The key evidence: family members'
recollections of Chambliss discussing the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Cash died in 1984 without being charged. He was seen with the
three others near the church the night before the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Blanton was put on trial. Federal prosecutors, the
same ones trying Cherry, handled the case. It took the jury 2 1/2
hours to find Blanton, 63, guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Cherry case is expected to be more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The defense has painted the evidence as "mostly hearsay." There
probably won't be any evidence as damaging as the old audio tapes on
which Blanton was heard saying: "I like to go shooting, I like to
fishing, I like to go bombing."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Cherry is older and concerns about his mental competency
nearly derailed the trial.</TE>
<TE>   One of the choicest bits of testimony Tuesday was from a boyhood
friend of the Cherrys who said he passed through their house a few
days before the bombing, saw Cherry and three men sitting at the
kitchen table and heard the words "bomb" and "16th Street." But he
didn't know who said them.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they will put on members of Cherry's family and a
man who was laying carpet with Cherry in a Dallas apartment in 1982
(Cherry has lived in Texas for more than 30 years) who heard him own
up to the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The defense has said it will attack witnesses' credibility. In his
statement, Johnson dismissed the case as a "blank fingerprint" and
reminded jurors there is no eyewitnesses or forensic evidence. "This
has never been a true investigation," Johnson said, "but a target."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he would like Cherry to take the stand, "to tell his
story," but he's not sure whether he's lucid enough.</TE>
<TE>   Among those sitting in the front row are parents of the four
girls, often holding hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, honey, it's hard to be here," Alpha Robertson said as she
closed her eyes and her mind seemed to spin back to that dreadful
moment. "But you can't just go on. If you keep things like this
dangling, they haunt you. Forever."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Deals Setback to Lindh's Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Trial: Prosecutors reject direct questioning of prisoners
in Cuba, citing national security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Government lawyers on Tuesday rejected direct questioning of military
detainees in Cuba by attorneys for John Walker Lindh, the American
who fought on the front lines with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   The defense team should submit written questions to Defense
Department interrogators, who would pose them without informing the
prisoners that they originated with lawyers for their fellow foot
soldier, the written pleading said.</LD>
<LD>   "If detainees learn that they can communicate with one of their
number through the American criminal justice system, including
through defense counsel, their continued willingness to cooperate
with interrogators may be severely compromised," the motion said.</LD>
<TE>   Defense lawyers sought face-to-face interviews with prisoners who
could potentially help Lindh's assertion that he did not kill
Americans and, specifically, played no role in the killing of a CIA
agent during a prison uprising in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors originally countered with a proposal for written
questions and answers.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's filing, they went further but rejected a live video
hookup suggested by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who said that
he would impose a solution at a May 28 hearing if there is no
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The filing contended that the procedure would not allow enough
time for Pentagon monitors to screen questions to protect national
security information.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would provide for:</TE>
<TE>   * Department of Defense teams, separated from prosecutors, to
question the prisoners based on the written questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Written summaries of the responses, furnished to the defense
counsel as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   * Opportunity for follow-up questions by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   * Audio/video recordings of the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   A government review team would screen the questions to ensure that
they are relevant to the criminal prosecution and guard against the
release of sensitive information.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, 21, who grew up in Marin County, is charged with conspiring
to murder U.S. nationals; providing support and services to foreign
terrorist organizations, including the Al Qaeda terrorist network;
and using firearms and destructive devices during crimes of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the 10 charges carry maximum life sentences; the other
seven have prison terms of up to 90 years.</TE>

<HD>Mormons Seek Parcel of Public Land</HD>
<DH>Congress: Wyoming site is significant to the church. But
some see a sale as a bad precedent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill in Congress, opposed by conservationists and history buffs,
would allow the Mormon Church to buy a chunk of historic public land
beside four pioneer trails southwest of Casper, Wyo.</LD>
<LD>   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wants to buy a
1,640-acre site known as Martin's Cove, where at least 56 Mormon
immigrants died in a blizzard in 1856.</LD>
<LD>   But conservationists worry that the U.S. Department of the
Interior would set a dangerous precedent by selling the land to a
religious group without a guarantee of public access or assurances
that the area's secular history will be honored.</LD>
<TE>   The site, which also contains Native American artifacts and
campsites of pioneers who traveled the nearby Oregon, California and
Mormon trails, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Bureau of Land Management, the Interior Department division that
manages the site under a land-use plan that preserves the area, is
opposed to the sale. The bureau has turned down previous offers to
swap the parcel with the church, which could not find a site of equal
historic value to exchange, according to agency officials.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-level officials at the Interior Department, however,
recently overruled the BLM's stand and backed the sale, although it
asked that the sale be limited to the smallest amount of land
necessary and that easements be included to ensure public access and
prevent development.</TE>
<TE>   "The department recognizes the unique significance of Martin's
Cove to the church and understands and supports the intent of this
proposed legislation to enable the church to manage the site's
historic resources,'' Kit Kimball, the department's director of
external and intergovernmental affairs, testified during a field
hearing two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's about stewardship,'' said Interior spokesman John Wright.
"We believe over the years the church has been a good steward.''</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see a reason for it. The church could accomplish what it
wants with a long-term lease with the BLM,'' said Randy Wagner,
national president of the Oregon-California Trail Assn. "I don't know
what the gain is if they own it. They already control access. They
own all the private land around it.''</TE>
<TE>   The church says it would allow access to any members of the
public, though church officials have declined to talk about plans for
the site. The church oversees the site under BLM supervision and
built a public-access path from an adjacent ranch it bought five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a whole lot that we would do differently there,
because most of what's been done there [by BLM] now has been done on
our recommendation,'' said Lloyd Larsen, LDS stake president for
Riverton, Wyo. "The concern is, will we always be able to do that?
History has shown from administration to administration and Congress
to Congress, public land policy has changed.''</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James V. Hansen (R-Utah), chairman of the House Resources
Committee and a Mormon, introduced the Martin's Cove bill and will
conduct hearings on it in Washington on Thursday. Six other Mormon
congressional members, none of whom are from Wyoming, are
co-sponsoring the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing nefarious going on,'' said Hansen spokeswoman
Marnie Funk, who added that she sees no conflict of interest in the
congressman's effort on behalf of his church. The church, she added,
is "very open about it and willing to accommodate the concerns of
local residents.''</TE>
<TE>   The Department of the Interior has returned public lands to tribes
that have expressed religious concerns over the parcels, and recent
law allows federally owned lighthouses listed on the National
Historic Register to be sold to preservation groups, Funk noted.</TE>
<TE>   Several tribes are closely watching the proposed sale, in hopes
that other publicly held areas of religious significance to
them--Devil's Tower in northeastern Wyoming among them--may one day
be returned to them.</TE>
<TE>   Already, trail enthusiasts complain that the ranch adjacent to
Martin's Cove, which the church converted to a public visitors'
center, focuses on the Mormon emigration while giving short shrift to
the history of other trails.</TE>
<TE>   The site memorializes 150 to 200 poorly equipped British converts,
led by Capt. Edward Martin, who died while pushing handcarts to Utah
when an early snowfall hit Wyoming's high plains in 1856. The
emigrants, at least 56 of whom died, found refuge in a small niche in
the Granite Mountains that bears Martin's name.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Is Reelected in Bitter N.J. Race</HD>
<DH>Election: Newark's Sharpe James fights off Ivy Leaguer's
challenge to win his 5th term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Mayor Sharpe James fended off a furious challenge from an Ivy Leaguer
half his age Tuesday to win an unprecedented fifth term after a
bruising campaign filled with charges of vandalism, voter
intimidation and race-baiting.</LD>
<LD>   James, 66, and Cory Booker, a 33-year-old freshman city
councilman, had waged a ferocious battle to lead New Jersey's largest
city as it sheds its national image as a community blighted beyond
hope.</LD>
<LD>   With 99% of precincts reporting, James had 28,363 votes, or 53%,
and Booker had 24,869 votes, or 46%.</LD>
<TE>   About 300 supporters chanted "Cory! Cory!" as Booker conceded.</TE>
<TE>   "We fought one hell of a fight," Booker said. "We fought for our
values, for our children and for what we believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of James supporters began hugging each other and crying
"Four more years!" in a glittering hotel ballroom filled with red,
white and blue balloons and signs bearing his reelection slogan: "The
Real Deal."</TE>
<TE>   "We must come together to continue to rebuild our city," James
said. "This election was not about Sharpe James. It's about the
future of Newark. Tomorrow we go forward as a family."</TE>
<TE>   The months-long campaign was so nasty that federal prosecutors
posted observers at the polls to watch for fraud and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Chris Christie said there were dozens of complaints but
no reports of people being prevented from voting. Police arrested a
25-year-old cousin of Gov. James E. McGreevey's wife for allegedly
vandalizing James' campaign signs. Booker called the arrest "purely
political."</TE>
<TE>   The tense election capped a campaign that had drawn national
attention and outside money as James and Booker offered starkly
different visions of Newark's future.</TE>
<TE>   While both men are black Democrats in a mostly black city, the
lighter-skinned Booker said James questioned his black authenticity
by calling him a "white boy" and accusing him of taking campaign
donations from the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   James spokesman Rich McGrath called the allegations "ludicrous"
and said Booker was trying to distract voters from the issues.</TE>
<TE>   A cartoon on the mayor's Web site portrayed Booker on an assembly
line behind black Republicans such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, under the
headline "Neo-Black Politicos."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates accused each other of breaking into their campaign
headquarters, and a James aide at one point got into a shoving match
with a documentary filmmaker James said worked for Booker.</TE>

<HD>No Mideast Link Seen in Mail Bomb</HD>
<DH>Crime: The device hurled shrapnel when it exploded Monday
in Philadelphia, but it hurt no one. A similar note without a bomb is
found nearby Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA --There is no evidence that a bomb found in a Postal
Service mailbox was related to Middle Eastern terrorists, despite a
note on the parcel that read "Free Palestine now," authorities said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "No terrorist group has owned up to it. There is no indication at
this point that it was terrorist related," said John Sinnen,
assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The device, which contained a foam box packed with nails and an
explosive charge, was detonated Monday when a police bomb squad shot
the package with a water cannon.</LD>
<TE>   The blast hurled shrapnel 100 feet but injured no one.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber's intended target was not immediately clear,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators described the device as more sophisticated than the
series of crude pipe bombs that injured six people in the Midwest
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The package carrying the bomb, found by a letter carrier in a
Philadelphia mail drop, was not addressed and bore no postage.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the note, which also mentioned the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, the parcel had protruding wires, Sinnen said.</TE>
<TE>   The note and wires caught the attention of letter carrier Matthew
Widmeier, who found the package and immediately phoned authorities.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the bomb squad was called after someone placed a pair
of sneakers inside a mailbox outside a synagogue, along with a note
that also mentioned Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   It was found two miles from the box where Monday's bomb was
discovered; both boxes are served by carriers from the Fox Chase
Station post office.</TE>
<TE>   Police don't yet know whether the two incidents are related.</TE>
<TE>   Sinnen said investigators didn't have a suspect but are exploring
several theories, including the possibility that the bomb might have
been placed by a "copycat" inspired by the Midwest attacks. A
21-year-old art student from Minnesota has been charged in the string
of mailbox bombings. Luke J. Helder is being held without bail in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly could be that--a publicity stunt. It could be
someone who wants that sort of attention," Sinnen said.</TE>

<HD>Race Upheld in Admissions Case</HD>
<DH>Rights: Federal court issues a 5-4 decision in a suit over
rejection by a Michigan law school. It may bring the first high court
ruling since Bakke.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharply divided federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the use of
race as a factor in admissions at the University of Michigan law
school, saying that the school has a compelling interest in achieving
a diverse student body.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-4 ruling in the case, whose progress has been watched
closely by universities nationwide, reversed a lower court decision
that the law school's affirmative action policy violated the U.S.
Constitution by discriminating against white applicants.</LD>
<LD>   Legal scholars said it probably sets the stage for the U.S.
Supreme Court to take up the issue of race-based policies in college
admissions for the first time since its landmark 1978 decision in the
case of Allan Bakke. Bakke, a white student, sued UC Davis in 1973
after he was rejected twice for medical school. That ruling banned
racial quotas but allowed universities to use race as one factor in
admissions decisions.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly a quarter-century later, after a series of conflicting
decisions on the issue from appeals courts nationwide, the high court
should step in again to resolve the affirmative action question,
several legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Supreme Court has an obligation to take the case [because]
the issue is so important, affecting so many people and so many
interests,'' said Jesse Choper, a constitutional law professor at UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   ''There may be a limit to how many times the Supreme Court can
duck the issue,'' said Stanford University law professor Pamela
Karlan, who served as law clerk to the late Justice Harry A.
Blackmun.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that four federal appeals courts in the last six years
had issued conflicting decisions on the issue. The Supreme Court has
declined to review any of them.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's ruling, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals said
the Michigan law school was justified in its use of race as one of
many factors in choosing students. The admissions policy gives
special consideration to black, Latino, Native American and other
groups that have been ''historically discriminated against.'' The
appeals court found that the school did not make use of the quotas
that were specifically barred in the Bakke decision.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling by the Cincinnati-based court came in one of a pair of
lawsuits brought on behalf of white applicants who had been rejected
at the University of Michigan, at the law school and in undergraduate
admissions. They argued that the university's preferential policies
discriminated against them and favored less-qualified minority
students.</TE>
<TE>   The court said it would rule later on the undergraduate case.</TE>
<TE>   The law school case was brought on behalf of Barbara Grutter, a
white mother of two, who charged that she was denied admission
because minority students were given preferential treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The five judges who affirmed the lower court decision were
appointed by Democratic presidents. Three of the four dissenting
judges were appointed by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   University of Michigan officials hailed the ruling as a victory
for all American colleges, many of which have lined up to support
Michigan in "friend of the court" briefs.</TE>
<TE>   Former University of Michigan President Lee C. Bollinger, now the
president-elect of Columbia University, called the court's decision a
sensational victory and one that could not have been predicted when
the lawsuits were filed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   ''Many people were saying then that the task of resisting what
seemed like a tide [against affirmative action] was hopeless,'' said
Bollinger, an affirmative action proponent who is still listed as the
lead defendant in the Michigan cases.</TE>
<TE>   ''Society has struggled with this issue and even agonized about
it,'' he said. ''This is one of those times when the Supreme Court
should speak to the issues that society is wrestling with.''</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Individual Rights, a conservative Washington-based
public-interest firm that launched the Michigan challenge and many
others attacking affirmative action, said it is already at work on an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   ''We think it's significant that Michigan only managed to eke out
a 5-4 decision in this case, which confirms our view that the law is
very murky on this issue,'' said Terence Pell, the center's chief
executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   ''The court is very sharply divided about what the law is here,
and we believe very strongly that it will go to the Supreme Court,''
Pell said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the center succeeded in ending affirmative action at the
law school of the University of Texas, setting a legal precedent that
affects public colleges in several Southwestern states. The Supreme
Court declined to hear that case.</TE>
<TE>   Other appeals courts have upheld a race-conscious admissions
policy at the University of Washington and rejected a similar policy
at the University of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   University of Texas President Larry Faulkner applauded the
Michigan ruling Tuesday and said he hoped it would land at the
nation's top court.</TE>
<TE>   ''We need a national resolution of the issues involved. It is
patently not right for the law to be different in one part of the
country from what it is in another, and that is very much the case
now. This has to be resolved.''</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Supreme Court were to uphold Tuesday's ruling,
California's public universities would not be immediately affected.</TE>
<TE>   Public schools in California have been barred from using
affirmative action in admissions or hiring since voters banned such
practices in 1996 by passing Proposition 209.</TE>
<TE>   Several scholars cautioned that an affirmation by the Supreme
Court in the Michigan law school case would mean it was
constitutional for the university to adopt such an affirmative action
plan, not that it was compelled to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in contradictory decisions, one federal judge in
Detroit upheld the use of race in Michigan's undergraduate admissions
while another struck it down in the law school case.</TE>
<TE>   The university has argued that diversity enhances the education of
all students and that it considers race as one factor among many in
its selection of students, including a student's economic status and
academic record.</TE>
<TE>   In a strongly worded dissent, one member of the court, Judge Danny
L. Boggs, described the law school's policy as a ''straightforward
instance of racial discrimination by a state institution.''</TE>
<TE>   The law school's policy ''does not seek diversity for education's
sake,'' Boggs wrote. ''It seeks racial numbers for the sake of the
comfort that those abstract numbers may bring. It does so at the
expense of the real rights of real people to fair consideration.''</TE>
<TE>   Circuit Judge Eric Clay, an African American appointed by former
President Clinton, wrote in an opinion concurring with the court
majority that the evidence supported the argument that diversity is a
compelling government interest.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a study by professor Patricia Gurin that found ''students
learn better in a diverse educational environment and they are better
prepared to become active participants in our pluralistic, democratic
society once they leave such a setting.''</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of affirmative action said the case is about more than
the broad concept of diversity. It is about race.</TE>
<TE>   ''In all candor, what we are really talking about is the need to
have racial integration at the flagship state institution that will
be creating leadership for the next generation,'' Karlan said.</TE>
<TE>   John C. Eastman, associate professor at Chapman University law
school in Orange, vowed to file a "friend of the court" brief urging
that the 6th Circuit decision be reversed.</TE>
<TE>   ''What we have now is a decision by the 6th Circuit that has taken
a position contrary to several recent Supreme Court decisions,''
Eastman said. ''What the University of Michigan has done here is
explicitly use race to give some people preferential consideration in
a highly competitive admissions process."</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said Tuesday's majority
opinion followed the basic reasoning of the Bakke decision, and
''Bakke is still the law until the Supreme Court overrules it.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Having been a law professor for 22 years, I believe diversity in
the classroom is a compelling interest. Having taught constitutional
law in classes that are all white and taught it with many minority
students, I can tell you it is very different class, particularly
when teaching about race and policing.''</TE>

<HD>Priest Accused of Abuse Is Shot</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>BALTIMORE -- Authorities charged a man Tuesday with shooting a former
Catholic parish priest who he claimed had molested him over a
three-year period in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Dontee Stokes was arrested Monday night after allegedly shooting
Father Maurice Blackwell several times, wounding him in the hand and
near his left hip, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwell, 56, was listed in serious but stable condition Tuesday
night at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center.</LD>
<TE>   Stokes was charged with attempted murder, first- and second-degree
assault and handgun violations. His arraignment is scheduled for
today.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal William Keeler, who led a meeting Tuesday of the
archdiocese's 175 priests to discuss the sexual abuse scandal, said:
"I am appalled that another act of violence has occurred in the city
of Baltimore, and that tragedy touches a person that I have known."</TE>
<TE>   Victims of sexual abuse by priests have gone public and taken
legal action against their alleged molesters and the church, but
until Monday none was known to have taken violent action against an
accused priest.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes, a 26-year-old barber, told police Monday night that
Blackwell had inappropriately touched and fondled him over three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes approached Blackwell in front of his house about 6 p.m.
Monday, he told police. When the priest refused to speak with him,
Stokes shot Blackwell several times, wounding him in the hand and
near his left hip, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting took place in a rundown west side neighborhood, where
the men live two blocks from each other.</TE>
<TE>   According to police records and family members, Stokes first
reported allegations of abuse in 1993, when he was 17.</TE>
<TE>   Police and a special church commission had dropped their
investigations of Stokes' initial claim of abuse, and Blackwell was
allowed to continue serving as pastor of St. Edward Catholic Church
in west Baltimore until 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "This is retaliation," said Lionel Pauling, 39, who works at a
nearby convenience store. "Dontee said the law didn't do what they
were supposed to."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did the church, Pauling and others said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, after Blackwell confessed to having a sexual
relationship with a teenage boy in 1974, before he was ordained,
church officials removed him from St. Edward, a small, urban parish.</TE>
<TE>   The church holds just two masses a week, both on Sunday, and on
Tuesday the sanctuary was dark and empty except for a woman setting
up for a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. At the rectory, a man who
refused to give his name said the church would have no comment on the
shooting, the allegations against Blackwell or his 19-year ministry
at the church.</TE>
<TE>   At Stokes' home, which like Blackwell's sits between two
boarded-up row houses, family friend Tanya Bryant referred to the
shooting as "a tragedy. But maybe now someone will listen."</TE>
<TE>   She described Stokes as "a wonderful father" and said Stokes and
her cousin were engaged to be married in August, on their daughter's
second birthday.</TE>
<TE>   For some, Stokes' allegations and shooting of Blackwell only
deepened their hurt and confusion about the doctrines and policies of
their church.</TE>
<TE>   "They say priests are married to God," said Joseph Marine, a
27-year member of St. Edward who remembered Blackwell for the kind of
preaching "you didn't go to sleep on."</TE>
<TE>   "And they say God is male," continued Marine, who is 89 years old.
"So priests are married to a man? It is a difficult situation."</TE>

<HD>Tutor's 'Confession' at Issue in Skakel Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors at the murder trial of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel
sought Tuesday to show that a family tutor once considered a suspect
in Martha Moxley's death never confessed to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel and Moxley were both 15 when she was beaten to death with a
golf club and stabbed through the neck with the broken shaft. The
slaying happened Oct. 30, 1975, the night after tutor Kenneth
Littleton moved into the Skakel household.</LD>
<LD>   On the stand Monday, Littleton made conflicting statements. Asked
about a drunken conversation he allegedly had in 1984, he said he
once told his former wife that he had stabbed Moxley. But he also
testified he didn't kill the girl.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the ex-wife, Mary Baker, testified that Littleton
never confessed to the crime. She said she was working with
investigators when she falsely told Littleton he had confessed during
a blackout and had graphically described the murder. At the time,
Littleton was a suspect in Moxley's murder and police were hoping he
might make incriminating statements if prompted.</TE>
<TE>   Baker also read a lengthy transcript of a secretly recorded
conversation she had with her former husband in 1992 at the behest of
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In that conversation, Littleton repeatedly denied having anything
to do with the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I never ever hurt a woman or child in my life," he said,
according to the transcript. Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman,
estimated Baker had taped about 300 conversations. "Why would you do
that? This is the father of your children," he said. "They have no
evidence against him."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said she had hoped the tapes would exonerate Littleton.</TE>

<HD>Senate Defies Bush Team With Trade-Authority Vote</HD>
<DH>Politics: A bill to boost the president's ability to make
overseas deals is endangered by an amendment giving lawmakers a say
in talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defying the Bush administration and business lobbyists, the Senate
approved a proposal Tuesday that could derail legislation to expand
presidential power to negotiate international trade deals.</LD>
<LD>   With their vote, the lawmakers may have jeopardized a trade bill
that only last week had seemed likely to become law.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment would change the central provisions of the trade
bill, a major priority for the administration. The measure, known as
trade promotion authority, would let the president negotiate trade
pacts and present them to Congress for approval on an up-or-down
vote, with no changes allowed.</LD>
<TE>   The amendment, however, would allow Congress to alter portions of
trade deals if lawmakers believed the pacts would weaken
"anti-dumping" statutes and other laws designed to protect U.S.
industries from imports.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, holding the power to cast such votes would give
Congress a seat at the table when trade deals are negotiated. Critics
of the amendment say that would undermine the next big round of
global trade talks. To win support of other countries for these
negotiations, the United States agreed last year at Doha, Qatar, to
consider possible changes in its trade laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Make no mistake about it: The amendment nullifies trade promotion
authority," said Calman J. Cohen, president of the Emergency
Committee for American Trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's refusal to bend on the amendment reflects political
and institutional realities.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, support in Congress runs deep for trade laws that
protect U.S. industries perceived as vulnerable to foreign imports.
The Bush administration itself used such laws this year to raise
tariffs on imported steel and lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers would like to add other products to the list. Sen. Larry
E. Craig (R-Idaho), a co-author of the amendment who is generally a
staunch Bush supporter, said he was worried about foreign competition
hurting semiconductor production in his state. Sen. Mark Dayton
(D-Minn.), the other co-author, is seeking to guard Minnesota farmers
from cheap Canadian wheat and corn.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), with an eye on the lumber, shoe and
textile industries in her state, supported the amendment despite
strong administration appeals to vote against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been very heavily lobbied on this issue," Collins said.
But she added: "I have not heard anything from the administration
that has changed my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Institutionally, the vote showed the Senate's reluctance to cede
power to the executive branch. The Constitution gives Congress
explicit authority to regulate foreign trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved the Craig-Dayton amendment on a voice vote.
The action came after backers of the amendment triumphed on a
procedural vote, 61 to 38. Sixteen Republicans, breaking from their
party leaders, joined 44 Democrats and one independent in supporting
the amendment. California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer
and Dianne Feinstein, were among those backing it.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the amendment's opponents said they would seek to kill
it when the House and Senate write a final version of the trade bill.
The House in December narrowly passed the version of the bill Bush
wants.</TE>
<TE>   Administration allies seemed caught off-guard by the push for the
Craig-Dayton amendment and launched a last-minute effort to thwart
it. They released a letter from Commerce Secretary Don Evans and U.S.
Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick strongly opposing the
amendment and threatening to recommend a veto by Bush of the overall
bill if it passed.</TE>
<TE>   After the Senate's vote, Zoellick criticized the amendment as
"protectionism under a procedural cover." He added: "It would cripple
America's ability to open markets around the world, and therefore we
will work to ensure it is not in the final bill."</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders, such as Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said they will urge Congress to shelve the bill
unless the amendment ultimately is withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to expanding Bush's trade negotiating power, the bill
would extend preferential trade treatment for imports from four
Andean nations: Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's action appeared to slow momentum that the trade bill had
only recently regained. Last week, Senate negotiators announced a
deal to offer expanded government aid, including a large subsidy for
health insurance, for some workers who lose their jobs because of
competition from foreign trade.</TE>
<TE>   Now, assuming that the Senate soon passes the modified trade bill,
lawmakers face difficult negotiations with the House.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Social Security benefits would be increased for about 120,000 widows
and divorced women under legislation passed unanimously Tuesday by
the House, although Democrats say millions more women should be
helped.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said the measure represents a first
step toward a more comprehensive overhaul of Social Security that
improves benefits for a limited but particularly vulnerable part of
the elderly population.</LD>
<LD>   "There is more we need to do for women, and we will," said Shaw,
chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security.</LD>
<TE>   The 418-0 vote sent the bill to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Women tend to live longer and earn less than men, and those who
work outside the home frequently take time away from work to care for
children. Four in 10 depend on Social Security for their retirement
income; the poverty rate among widows was 15% in 2000, compared with
8.5% for all elderly recipients.</TE>
<TE>   The changes, which would cost $4 billion over 10 years, would
increase the benefit limit for widows whose spouses retire or die
before they reach full retirement age. They also would update
eligibility requirements for disabled widows and repeal the two-year
waiting period for divorced women who remarry to receive benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats favored Shaw's bill, as did such groups as AARP and the
National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Yet
Democrats also accused Republicans of using the bill for political
cover on an issue central to this year's congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   "You can just see how afraid they are of debate on that issue,"
said House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said Republicans blocked
Democrats from offering a broader version providing a "widow's
guarantee" that a spouse would receive 75% of a couple's combined
benefits instead of as little as 50% when one died.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Chalk this one up--actually, break out the extra chalk and give this
whole series--to the Laker attitude.</LD>
<LD>   If the old "Wall Street" motto was "greed is good," then the new
Laker mantra is "cocky is cool."</LD>
<LD>   It prevailed again in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals
and helped the Lakers to a 93-87 victory to clinch the series.</LD>
<TE>   They feel that they can get back into any game, regardless of the
score or situation--and deep inside they clearly believe the San
Antonio Spurs can't stand up to the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs waited a year to erase the tag that they had no heart,
only to compete in each and every game this series--and earn the new
label of chokers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Lakers have an attitude that juts out in the air
like Rick Fox's jaw.</TE>
<TE>   I've always said that Phil Jackson wears his arrogance well, that
somehow it's becoming on him. It suits the Lakers too. They shake off
deficits, breeze through pressure, then lean on the game's most
clutch player, Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely have a swagger about ourself, a little bit more
confidence about ourself," said Bryant, who scored 10 of his 26
points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers talked a lot about their confidence after their victory
in Game 4, when they overcame a 10-point deficit midway through the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "When you win championships you have egos, that you're not going
to lose regardless of the score," Robert Horry said. "I think that
helps us out, because a lot of times, we're down, we'll be like
[forget] it, we're just down. All we've got to do is go out and play
D, we're going to win this thing. We just have confidence."</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers went in the tank again, holding their breath and
staying submerged while the fans worried and wondered when they were
coming up for air.</TE>
<TE>   They pretty much started underwater with a 15-point first quarter.
The Lakers have had at least one sub-20 point quarter in every game,
but this time there was a rare quarter in which Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal scored only two points apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were down long enough to fall behind by 13 points in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   They scored the last six points of the quarter to make the deficit
a respectable six points at halftime. Then, two minutes into the
third quarter, it started again. The Spurs missed six straight shots
and committed two turnovers and bango, the Lakers had the lead.</TE>
<TE>   But even in their comeback the Lakers played more like Cool Hand
Luke than Desperate Dan. A bad pass by Tim Duncan bounced past Tony
Parker and into the backcourt. Bryant chased after it, but didn't
give it the all-out effort and settled for possession instead of a
chance for a fastbreak. (The Lakers wound up scoring on a basket by
O'Neal.)</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich had an air of desperation about him. He
left Duncan in the game for more than two minutes even though Duncan
got his third foul with 3:20 to go in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, with 10 seconds left in the third, Bryant decided that it
was close enough to the fourth quarter to do his thing. He went to
work and scored on a jumper in the lane that dropped through with 7.3
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had the lead. Just as they expected.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the team's composure comes from "Experience in these
situations. A calmness. A poise that comes with having done this
before, especially with having success against [the Spurs], believing
that it's just a matter of time."</TE>
<TE>   The unsaid continuation of that quote is: " ... before the Spurs
choke."</TE>
<TE>   Every team in the NBA gives up big leads, but most good ones can
at least recover and close out a game. Few champions (the Spurs are
the Midwest Division champions, remember?) get as tight in crunch
time as this group.</TE>
<TE>   Did you see the shot chart for the Spurs' fourth quarter in Game
4? There were so many white circles indicating misses it looked like
someone had dumped the contents of a hole-puncher on the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   This time the Spurs hung in there. For most of the fourth quarter,
the only thing small about them was their lineup, which featured a
backcourt of the 6-foot-2 Parker and 6-4 Antonio Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   They matched the Lakers point for point--up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 83-83, Bryant scored. O'Neal blocked a Duncan
shot in the lane, but curiously shot a weak fallaway jumper at the
other end, with Duncan guarding him and burdened with five fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan missed, Brian Shaw grabbed the loose ball and fed Fox for a
fastbreak layup to give the Lakers a four-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' last real shot at the series was a three-point attempt
by Parker. It came up short.</TE>
<TE>   Then Horry made a three-pointer from his new favorite spot, the
right corner and the Spurs were done, down seven with 56.2 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   "Another frustrating defeat at the hands of the Lakers," Spur
forward Malik Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what it takes to win games," O'Neal said. "Even though we
played ugly, we just had to grind our teeth and just play a little
bit harder, collect our poise and play a little bit harder."</TE>
<TE>   It's fitting that Horry made the two biggest shots to close out
the first two series. He's the guy who never looks worried at all,
who seems so carefree until the pressure is at its highest.</TE>
<TE>   Sound like any team you know?</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to win every game," Bryant said. "The game is close in
the fourth quarter, we expect to win. We play to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Some teams play to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm, sound like any other team you know?</TE>

<HD>Clemens Earns Milestone Victory</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Clemens keeps climbing the career victory list, catching one
Hall of Famer after another.</LD>
<LD>   The Rocket won his fifth consecutive start, Jason Giambi and Jorge
Posada hit consecutive home runs, and the New York Yankees defeated
Tampa Bay, 10-3, Tuesday night at New York for their seventh victory
in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens (6-2) cruised to his 286th victory, tying Hall of Famer
Robin Roberts for 23rd place. Clemens has an action photo of Roberts
in his locker, along with pictures of some of the other pitchers he
has passed this season such as Jim Kaat and Ferguson Jenkins.</LD>
<TE>   "To have the opportunity to chase down some great names this year
like I have makes it fun," Clemens said. "I still enjoy challenges.
To hear interesting stories about these guys, I'd love to have more
of a chance to visit with these guys and find out more."</TE>
<TE>   The benches and bullpens emptied after Derek Jeter took exception
to a high-and-tight pitch from reliever Jesus Colome in the eighth
inning. No punches were thrown.</TE>
<TE>   "[Colome] almost killed [Alfonso] Soriano," Jeter said. "When I
stole third he was staring at me and when I scored he was staring at
me. It wasn't like I was going to charge the mound, I was just trying
to make a point."</TE>
<TE>   Colome said he wasn't throwing at anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised over Jeter's reaction because I didn't mean
to hit anybody. I just couldn't throw strikes," Colome said through a
translator. "I think maybe Jeter is overreacting. That is the kind of
player Jeter is, he's very intense, very competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Baltimore 5--Matt Lawton hit a two-run homer with two
out in the bottom of the ninth and the Indians rallied for four runs
in their final at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton hit a 2-and-2 pitch from Jorge Julio (2-2) over the wall in
right field to end a three-game losing streak for the Indians, who
were one out away from their 20th loss in 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Oakland 2--Rickey Henderson drove in two runs at Boston
in place of the injured Manny Ramirez, and John Burkett (4-0) gave up
nine hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston started a 13-game homestand by winning for the ninth time
in 11 games and improved baseball's best record to 26-9.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hudson (3-5) walked six in 51/3 innings and has lost three in
a row for the first time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Seattle 3--Tom Wilson homered twice and hit a go-ahead
single in the sixth inning at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first multihomer game for Wilson, who had a career-high
four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 8, Minnesota 1--A.J. Hinch homered and tied a
career-high with four RBIs, and slumping Chuck Knoblauch also hit a
home run for the Royals at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Knoblauch, batting .184 entering the game, connected against Matt
Kinney (1-3) for the 30th leadoff homer of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 15, Texas 4--Tony Graffanino had two homers and six RBIs
at Chicago, and Mark Buehrle won his AL-leading seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   Graffanino tied his career high with four hits, helping the White
Sox end a four-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   After going 54 games without a homer, Graffanino has hit three in
his last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Buehrle (7-2) gave up four runs--three earned--and six hits in
seven innings.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Sparks Angels but Thinks Nothing of It</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon is hitting .250.</LD>
<LD>   Five years ago, that would have been cause for concern. Five weeks
ago, that would have been cause for celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Today, it's a nice little milestone on the comeback trail and a
batting average higher than he had at any point last season. Salmon
had three hits and drove in four runs to lead the rampaging Angels to
a 9-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Salmon often indicts himself on the charge of paralysis by
analysis. After hitting home runs in consecutive games for the first
time this season and extending his hitting streak to six games,
Salmon declined to think about--or talk about--an explanation for his
recent success.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been too mental for a year now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won their sixth consecutive game, with Salmon and Troy
Glaus hitting home runs and Kevin Appier winning his fourth
consecutive decision. They also won for the 15th time in 17 games,
matching the best 17-game stretch in franchise history and closing
within 41/2 games of the first-place Seattle Mariners in the American
League West.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same Angel outfit that lost 14 of its first 20 games,
the worst start in club history. So relaxation is in order, but
celebration is not.</TE>
<TE>   "We were good about not panicking when things were going real bad
at first," Appier said. "It's a lot different now. You feel a lot
more confidence in here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not cockiness. We're not presumptuous. We don't know we're
going to kick everybody's butt. But we do have a lot more
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, 33, had plenty of confidence during the first eight
seasons of his career, when excellence and consistency were his twin
hallmarks. You could count on Salmon to hit .290 with 30 home runs,
just as surely as you could count on Yankee fans to drown out Angel
fans at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   But Salmon limped to a .227 average and 17 home runs last season,
both career lows, in a miserable season attributed largely to
injuries. In the first 15 games this season, with no injuries to
blame, he hit .135 with no home runs and three runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia dropped him in the batting order but refused
to bench him outright. Scioscia said Salmon's strength and bat speed
were much improved from last season and consistently reiterated his
belief that he would come around.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times when I was looking at him, thinking, why are you
playing me?" Salmon said. "But that was me getting down on myself.
That's a negative attitude....</TE>
<TE>   "I can appreciate some of the things he does to keep me motivated.
When you've got a player you're counting on and he's not producing, I
can understand the frustration. From that standpoint, I would say
he's hung in there with me. There are managers that would have put
you in the doghouse."</TE>
<TE>   In his last 20 games, Salmon is hitting .338 with five homers and
21 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   He offered no analysis but did tip his cap to batting coach Mickey
Hatcher, from whom never is heard a discouraging word.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the eternal optimist," Salmon said. "He's the guy that kept
me going all last year. You can't say enough about what that means to
a player.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're not performing well, you're beating yourself up. The
fans are beating you up. The media is beating you up. To have the
hitting coach pick you up, that's big."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Hatcher said he hadn't done anything more
significant than show Salmon two videos side-by-side--one with him
hitting in 1997, the other with him hitting earlier this year. Salmon
figured out he was holding his hands too high in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he got his hands lowered, his swing changed dramatically,"
Hatcher said. "It was awesome to see."</TE>
<TE>   Appier has been awesome to see all season. The Angels staked him
to a 5-0 lead Tuesday, and he held the Tigers to three hits over
seven innings. In his last four starts, he is 3-0 with a 1.35 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Appier, 34, cannot survive on his fastball alone, not this far
into a major league career that started in 1989. Some pitchers cannot
adapt without a lively fastball, but Appier might be getting better.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like he's inventing pitches out there," Salmon said.
"He'll never throw the same pitch twice to a batter. Those kinds of
days can screw up an offense."</TE>

from the Walt Disney Co., has retained former Angel president Richard
Brown as a consultant.</LD>
<LD>   After making a preliminary offer of $250 million for the Angels in
March, Watkins has retained bankers, accountants, lawyers and other
business advisors in evaluating a potential deal. His representatives
wanted to add someone with baseball experience and floated several
names before Commissioner Bud Selig, who agreed that Brown would fit
the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins and Brown met Friday in Los Angeles. Watkins did not
extend Brown any promise of employment with the Angels should he
succeed in buying the team.</LD>
<TE>   Jonathan Rose, the attorney for Watkins, confirmed Brown's
involvement with the bid but declined to comment further. Brown also
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Brown served as the Angels' president from 1990-96, before Disney
bought the team and installed Tony Tavares as president. He then
returned to practicing law, with entertainment and sports
transactions among his specialties. In April, Los Angeles Mayor James
Hahn appointed him to the city's planning commission.</TE>

<TE>   Get older fast, get better fast: The post-Sept. 11 visa crackdown
revealed</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz is 29, not 26. After two inconsistent seasons in the
Angels' starting rotation, Ortiz has blossomed into one of the top
pitchers in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown also revealed that minor league right-hander Hatuey
Mendoza is 23, not 21. Mendoza, who won one game above the Class-A
level in the first five years of his pro career, pitched a no-hitter
Monday for the Angels' double-A Arkansas affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz had thrown the last no-hitter by an Angel minor leaguer, at
Class-A Cedar Rapids in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Benji Gil and reliever Donne Wall could begin minor
league rehabilitation assignments this week. With Angel relievers
pitching remarkably well--the bullpen has a 1.85 earned-run average
over its last 39 innings--there is no immediate need for Wall.</TE>
<TE>   Wall posted a 10.03 ERA in nine appearances before a sore right
arm put him on the disabled list, but Manager Mike Scioscia believes
the injury accounts for much of the poor performance. Wall, 34, won a
job in spring training, when the Angels wanted to add a veteran long
reliever, and Scioscia says that job will be waiting for Wall when he
is ready to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the visions we had for Donne have changed,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, shortstop David Eckstein hit into
a double play. He entered play Tuesday with 145 at-bats, the most of
any major leaguer who had not hit into one.... Third baseman Troy
Glaus drove in two runs, and his 36 runs batted in rank second in the
league, behind Alex Rodriguez. The Angels are 16-3 when Glaus drives
in at least one run.</TE>

<HD>Report: Mets Ask for Shea Repairs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With negotiations for new stadiums on hold because of the city's
looming deficit, the New York Mets are asking for structural
improvements at Shea Stadium that could prolong the ballpark's life
20 years, the Daily News reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Citing details from an internal city engineering report, the
newspaper said that Shea's steel-and-concrete construction is
"generally in good condition." But the engineering report targeted 16
areas requiring "immediate corrective action" because of potential
"life safety" issues, from buckling asphalt to cracked or broken
exterior bricks.</LD>
<LD>   "Now that we don't anticipate a deal on a new stadium in the near
future, it's time to address many of the issues ... in the
engineering report," Met senior Vice President Dave Howard told the
paper.</LD>
<TE>   He said Shea is "not in the condition we would like to see it in,"
and added the team feels "there are issues that perhaps were put off
while we were discussing a new facility, but we feel now is the time
to address many of these issues."</TE>
<TE>   The report, completed in March, cited an additional 17 projects as
essential to bringing the stadium into a "a state of good repair."
These included patching concrete to reviewing the fire alarm system
to replacing the center-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen other repairs, including replacing handrails and
joints in the field seats--were listed as "nearing end of life
cycle," the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota ace Brad Radke was put on the disabled list, one day
after pulling his right groin against Kansas City.... Outfielder
Manny Ramirez was put on the disabled list by Boston because of a
broken left index finger. He is expected to be out at least four
weeks.... Detroit activated first baseman Dmitri Young, sidelined
since April 18 because of a hernia, from the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-time hits leader Pete Rose has a new backer in his bid to
reach the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisements in magazines and on billboards featuring Rose and
saying, "Why Isn't Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame?" will soon appear
and run for three months, said David Schulte, president of athletic
shoe company Pony.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice for me to know that someone's in my corner," Rose said.</TE>

<LD>Here is a piece of advice that by suggesting, we are not taking
ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Boycott Mike Tyson.</LD>
<LD>   Don't listen, don't watch, don't even discuss him.</LD>
<TE>   As David Whitley writes in the Orlando Sentinel: "Tyson is this
generation's Rosemary's baby. He cries, and society recoils. Then we
dish out $54.95 for the next pay-per-view bout....</TE>
<TE>   "Now Tyson has become a combination of O.J., Princess Di, the
Ebola virus, Clinton's love child and the Elephant Man. We hate to
look. We hate ourselves for looking. But we can't help ourselves....</TE>
<TE>   "What can stop him? [Lennox] Lewis will, please, oh please. And
you could do your part by ignoring Tyson."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speech analysis: Academics had some interesting things to say
about Tyson's extreme use of profanity when they were consulted by
Sally Jenkins of the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown, said
Tyson's intent is partly simply to shock, and partly to denigrate
women.</TE>
<TE>   "Calling attention to a sexual being is compromising to women in a
way it's not to men. And if you take it to the most extreme, there's
an implied statement that you can be raped," Tannen said.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhold Aman, a philologist who edits Maledicta, a journal
devoted to the study of profanity and other types of cultural
graffiti, sees it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "He has very little self control," Aman said. "It's not that he's
doing it on purpose. It's almost at the point of Tourette's
syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What do Mia Hamm, Lisa Leslie and Gordie Howe have in
common?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horse sense: By now you know trainer Bob Baffert and Prince Ahmed
Salman of Saudi Arabia "bought" the Kentucky Derby when they picked
up War Emblem in April.</TE>
<TE>   Others passed because of suspicious X-rays. Not the maverick
Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   "Baffert is by Unconventional out of an Iconoclastic mare," writes
Rick Bozich in the Louisville Courier-Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "He does things his way. Always has. Always will."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sock it to him: Not that his sport doesn't get any respect, but...</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis is being touted as a potential breakout star for the
U.S. team in the upcoming World Cup. He was passing through the lobby
at a hotel where the Montreal Canadiens also were staying when a
woman stopped him.</TE>
<TE>   "My future son-in-law is an avid hockey player and fan," the woman
said. "Can I have your autograph?"</TE>
<TE>   Mathis politely obliged, the New York Times reports, then did a
double-take.</TE>
<TE>   "Did she say hockey?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A fine whine: There's a tiny bit extra riding on Game 7 of the NHL
Western Conference semifinal series between the San Jose Sharks and
Colorado Avalanche tonight.</TE>
<TE>   It's the value of the limited edition 2002 S.J. Sharkie's
Chardonnay produced by Emilio Guglielmo Winery in Morgan Hill.</TE>
<TE>   If the Sharks lose, it might be time to drink the memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: All wear--or wore--No. 9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tyson, eloquent as usual, on the boxing ability of
Lewis:</TE>
<TE>   "His accomplishments talk for itself."</TE>

<HD>Celtics Oust Pistons</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Defense proves stingy again as they win,
90-81, to reach the conference finals for the first time since 1988.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>It was appropriate the Boston Celtics had to beat an opponent from
their most recent glory years to get back to the Eastern Conference
finals.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Pierce scored 18 points as part of a balanced attack as the
Celtics defeated Detroit, 90-81, Tuesday night to advance to the
conference finals for the first time since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Boston got this far, they lost to the Pistons. The
last time the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals was in 1987 when
they eliminated Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   Both teams were in the second round of the playoffs for the first
time since shortly after their championship years, when they often
met in May.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit and Boston split four playoff series between 1985 and '89,
and last met in 1991 when the Pistons beat the Celtics in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great source of pride for these players and this coaching
staff to have this franchise back where it belongs," Boston Coach Jim
O'Brien said just before boarding the team bus. "We've accomplished a
lot of things we haven't done in a long time, but there's still a lot
that could be accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics will play the winner of the New Jersey-Charlotte
series. The Nets lead, 3-1, and play host to the Hornets tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have a great chance to go the Finals," Detroit's
Jerry Stackhouse said of the Celtics. "If it's New Jersey, which it
looks like it's going to be, I think they match up really well."</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons clearly did not have answers to many of the problems
Boston presented in the series.</TE>
<TE>   After beating a weary team by 12 points in Game 1, the Pistons
lost four in a row while shooting under 40% in each game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the same defense we've been playing all year, but you
never expect to hold one of the best shooting teams down like that,"
O'Brien said. "We made them struggle for a shot on every possession
and that tires a team."</TE>
<TE>   While Detroit couldn't seem to make a key shot or stop, the
Celtics made many from several sources.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Anderson added 17 points, Antoine Walker, who fouled out,
had 16, Rodney Rogers scored 14 and Tony Battie added 10 as the
Celtics improved to 21-0 in series in which they held a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We grew as a team," Walker said. "It was big tonight. We got
different contributions from everybody and this is a total team
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought at the beginning of the playoffs, we had an opportunity
to do something special, but obviously we had to put it together. I
think the Philly series really taught us a lot. I think right now we
have an opportunity of a lifetime and we have to take full advantage
of it. Being in the Eastern Conference finals is going to be huge for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Chucky Atkins scored 22 points, Corliss Williamson
scored 15 of his 17 points in the final quarter to bring the Pistons
back briefly and Michael Curry added 15.</TE>
<TE>   While Celtic stars Walker and Pierce were in foul trouble,
Detroit's lone star--Stackhouse--had an off night, scoring eight
points on three-of-18 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough thing to swallow for me because scoring has been
something I've hung my hat on," Stackhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons joined a long list of teams unable to overcome a 3-1
deficit. Only six teams in NBA history have won playoff series after
trailing, 3-1.</TE>

<LD>   What: "BEST Baseball Survival and Endurance Training" video</LD>
<LD>   Producer: Group 1 Productions</LD>
<TE>   Price: $29.95</TE>
<TE>   The opening gives the first hint that this isn't a routine
baseball instructional video. A group of older players is given a
mission--to show a group of younger players what it takes to become
proficient at the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The older players, led by Coach Peter Bennett, the host of the
video, are whisked away by helicopter, then meet the younger players
after landing at Arce Field on the campus of Claremont McKenna
College.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Bennett and his helpers show exercises and drills that
can be useful to players of all ages. The title may suggest a tough
regimen, but the 83-minute video features demonstrations that are
easy to follow and drills that are fun to do.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other baseball instructional videos, shot in one day
with a coach simply talking in front of an unsteady camera, this
high-quality video was weeks in the making. Bennett has worked as a
journalist for The Times and was the managing editor of a lifestyle
magazine. He has also been a public-relations and marketing
executive. He has been coaching youth baseball for more than two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   He now is vice president of business and community development for
Sports Educators of America, which conducts baseball clinics
throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's passion for baseball comes through in every drill and
demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   The video can be ordered through www.bestbaseballvideo.com or by

<HD>Dodgers Are Turning Into Masters of None</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Dodgers haven't hit rock bottom offensively, they better hope
they're close, because things can't get much worse than they did
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Reaching new depths for an offense that has been in an excavation
mode since opening day, the Dodgers managed a season-low two hits
against New York Met pitcher Pedro Astacio in a 3-0 loss before
28,610 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Astacio, a former Dodger, struck out nine and walked two in
improving to 6-2 and lowering his earned-run average to 2.48, putting
an exclamation point on his shutout by striking out the side in the
ninth inning.</LD>
<TE>   The veteran right-hander had "great stuff," in the estimation of
Dodger cleanup batter Paul Lo Duca, but the Dodgers hardly put up a
fight in suffering their major league-leading seventh shutout of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 18 balls the Dodgers put in play, only five or six were hit
hard, and one of those resulted in their major league-high 49th
double play. The Dodgers have scored three runs or fewer in 22 of 39
games, including 13 of their last 14, and they have only six homers
in their last 21 games. They rank 13th in the National League in
runs, 15th in home runs, 13th in walks and 14th in stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Shawn Green, who hasn't hit a ball out of the
infield in two games against the Mets, is batting .245 with three
home runs and 21 runs batted in, a 12-homer, 87-RBI pace that is far
off his 49-homer, 125-RBI season of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries and Eric Karros' career .071 average (one for 14) against
Astacio forced Manager Jim Tracy to juggle Tuesday's lineup, which
featured Hiram Bocachica batting second and playing center field in
place of Dave Roberts (strained right quadriceps), Lo Duca, the
regular catcher, playing left field--his 14th career outfield
appearance--in place of Brian Jordan (strained lower back), Dave
Hansen batting fifth and playing first in place of Karros, and
catcher Chad Kreuter, he of the .143 average, hitting eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers responded with their most feeble attack of the season.
Bocachica doubled to lead off the fourth and never advanced, as Green
popped to the catcher, Lo Duca flied to right and Hansen struck out.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis singled with one out in the sixth but was thrown out
trying to steal second. That was the extent of the Dodger offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later we have to break out," Lo Duca said. "We'll hit a
little streak where we'll get some broken-bat hits, some hits to fall
with guys on base. It's going to happen. We just need a couple of
breaks to go our way."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Andy Ashby gave up two runs--one earned--and six
hits and struck out three in six innings, giving the Dodgers their
27th quality start (six innings or more, three earned runs or fewer)
in 39 games, but the right-hander's fielding error contributed to the
Mets' run in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   After Timo Perez's one-out single, Roberto Alomar dribbled a slow
roller down the first-base line. Ashby fielded the ball as Alomar ran
by, but in his attempt to clear Alomar with his throw, Ashby tossed
the ball over Hansen at first and into right field, enabling Perez to
score.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets made it 2-0 in the fourth when Alomar led off with a
single to right-center and took third on Mo Vaughn's single to
left-center.</TE>
<TE>   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a slow roller toward first. Ashby
couldn't reach the ball, and Hansen was playing so deep that by the
time he got to the ball, he had no play.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar scored on the infield single, and after Jeromy Burnitz
flied to right, Ashby hit Vance Wilson with a pitch to load the bases
with no outs. But Ashby stopped the rally when he got Rey Ordonez to
pop to short and Astacio to fly to center. Roger Cedeno homered off
Dodger closer Eric Gagne in the ninth for the Mets' final run.</TE>

<HD>Dreifort Takes a Small Step</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left fielder Brian Jordan sat out Tuesday night's game against the
New York Mets because of a lower back strain, center fielder Dave
Roberts didn't start because of a quadriceps strain, reliever Jesse
Orosco was unavailable because of a strained rib-cage muscle suffered
in batting practice, and catcher Paul Lo Duca moved to left field
because his left hand is sore from being hit with a bat last week.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the gloom in the Dodger training room came a medical ray of
hope: Pitcher Darren Dreifort threw off a mound Tuesday for the first
time since undergoing elbow reconstruction surgery in July, tossing
about 12 pitches in the bullpen after a lengthy warmup.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a starting point--there's still a long way to go," said
Dreifort, who had been throwing off flat ground the last two months.
"It's just another step. I moved up one rung on the ladder, which is
nice. But I know what lies ahead--time."</LD>
<TE>   Dreifort, in the second year of a five-year, $55.4-million
contract, has been down this road before. He missed the 1995 season
because of elbow reconstruction surgery and is trying to bounce back
from the same procedure again.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' target return date is sometime around the All-Star
break, and if Dreifort makes it back, "it will almost be like
acquiring one of baseball's best sinkerball pitchers," General
Manager Dan Evans said. "It's really encouraging because he's
comfortable and pain-free. He's showing all the signs of making a
full comeback."</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, who tore a ligament and tendon in his right elbow at San
Diego on June 29 and had surgery on July 9, isn't getting his hopes
up too high, because he knows with rehabilitation comes the potential
for setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't share their enthusiasm so much because [rehabilitation]
is like a baseball season, and I'm only in spring," Dreifort said.
"This is a marathon. It's hard to get excited about one day because
you never know what the next day will hold. I want to go from flat
ground to the mound, to batting practice, simulated games and a
[minor league] rehabilitation assignment. It's like the Tour de
France. There are several stages left."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Screnar, the Dodgers' physical therapist, said Dreifort is
"progressing smoothly," and that the next few weeks will determine if
the right-hander can return in July. Dreifort, who will likely have
to pitch out of the bullpen, prefers not to set a specific target
date.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Jordan to the long list of critics of Dodger Stadium's
rubber-like warning track. The Dodger left fielder, who is already
suffering from tendinitis in his left knee, injured the left side of
his lower back Monday night after fielding Timo Perez's ninth-inning
shot down the line, planting himself on the warning track and making
a long, hard throw to second to hold Perez to a single.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan underwent treatment Tuesday but said his back was "real
tight." Jordan doubted the injury was serious enough to put him on
the disabled list, but he could miss several games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers replaced the dirt warning track with a rubber-like
surface at the beginning of the 2000 season, and several players have
complained about it.</TE>
<TE>   "That rubber [stinks]," Jordan said. "And stopping on that didn't
help my knee, either. That's for track athletes, not baseball
players."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Roberts tested his strained right quadriceps with several
wind sprints and cutting drills Tuesday and felt no discomfort. He
was available as a pinch-hitter Tuesday night and could return to the
lineup tonight. Orosco is questionable after he felt a twinge in his
left side during batting practice Tuesday. "I was really feeling good
on the mound, so I hope this isn't serious," said Orosco, who has a
3.12 earned-run average in 14 games. "I'm sure they won't have me
taking batting practice any more."</TE>

<KH>SAN ANTONIO vs. LAKERS</KH>
<HD>GAME 5 REPORT</HD>
<DH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Basketball really is a simple game. Putting the
ball in the basket can be difficult, however. Ask the Spurs, whose
poor shooting in the fourth quarters of this series was the No. 1
reason they trailed, 3-1, going into Game 5. Of course, there
wouldn't have been a Game 5 if the Lakers hadn't messed up the second
quarter of Game 2 and lost. We would all be at Dodger Stadium
watching the home team take on Mo Vaughn and the Mets. At any rate,
the Lakers fell into a downward spiral after taking a 2-0 lead
because they couldn't make the shots they were making in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: A valid reason for the Lakers' lackluster
start. Staples Center crackled with excitement from the fans, who
were ready to be done with the Spurs and looking forward to thumping
the Sacramento Kings in the conference finals. The Spurs had other
ideas, however, giving the Lakers pause. The Spurs showed they
weren't demoralized by their Game 4 fade.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: The Spurs' 56.3% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Lakers' 35% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Rick Fox 7; Spurs--Tim Duncan 9, Bruce
Bowen 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Kobe Bryant 4, Robert Horry and
Shaquille O'Neal 1; Spurs--Duncan 6, Malik Rose 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Despite chants of "MVP, MVP" each time O'Neal
stepped to the free-throw line, it's Duncan's world in the second
quarter. Everyone else is merely along for the ride. He outscored
O'Neal, 13-11, and took 10 rebounds to O'Neal's one. That's better
than a good many players will average in their careers. In the
quarter, Duncan made three of five shots and seven of eight free
throws. It also begged the question: Did Duncan hit his peak
efficiency too early? The Spurs owed their six-point halftime lead to
Duncan. Whether he could maintain his superb play for the next two
quarters was critical to the Spurs' survival in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Horry had no points by halftime, missing the
only shot he attempted. Certainly, the Lakers can win without their
starting power forward scoring 20 points. Horry is a vital part of
their offensive diversity, however. O'Neal and Bryant can't do it all
by themselves all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Twenty-one, Duncan's uniform number.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Lakers missed 11 of 18 shots in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 11, Bryant 7; Spurs--Duncan 13,
Rose and Antonio Daniels 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant 4; Spurs--Duncan 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Spurs lost the lead in the quarter, regained
it and lost it again. Bryant's short jumper late put the Lakers ahead
by a point entering the final quarter. There was nothing special
about the play. It's one Bryant has made thousands of times, but it
proved (again!) the Spurs cannot guard him. With the seconds ticking
away, San Antonio's rookie point guard Tony Parker freed himself and
launched a short jumper that missed the mark at the buzzer. The two
plays pretty much summed up what has happened in four games plus
three quarters of this series. The Lakers have accomplished what they
have needed to so far. The Spurs keep coming up short.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A reason for the Spurs to give up. They're
right with the Lakers (again!). Luck, for lack of a better term,
hasn't been on their side in the series. But they don't seem ready to
pack it in just yet. These aren't the Trail Blazers and this isn't
the opening round, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Seven more points and five rebounds for Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Spurs missed 12 of 18 shots and Duncan picked
up his fourth foul.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 7, Horry and Derek Fisher 5;
Spurs--Duncan 7, Danny Ferry 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 5, Horry 2; Spurs--Duncan 5,
Parker 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Brian Shaw passed to Rick Fox, who was sprinting
down the left wing. Fox never hesitated in taking the ball to the
basket, scoring against Bowen to give the Lakers an 87-83 lead with
1:27 to play. Tony Parker's three-pointer was off the mark and Horry
made his signature three-pointer at the other end with 56.2
remaining. Didn't Horry do that to eliminate the Trail Blazers in the
last series? Game over. Series over. Bring on the Kings. Game 1 is
Saturday at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: What it will mean for the Kings to have
home-court advantage in the conference final against the Lakers.
Probably not much in the final analysis. Crowds don't guard opposing
players. Or score baskets for the home team. They might get on the
visitors' nerves and make it difficult to hear their coach yelling
instructions. But, honestly, when have you seen Phil Jackson get off
the bench to say anything to Bryant or O'Neal?</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Eight, the number of victories the Lakers need to
complete their three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Duncan scored only five of his 34 points in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 10, Fox 6; Spurs--Daniels 9,
Parker 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Shaw and Samaki Walker 2;
Spurs--Duncan 4, Bowen 2.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Best of the Spurs Still to Come</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a time for the San Antonio Spurs. It's just not now.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, the Lakers took home-court advantage away from them
and ran them over like road kill. This season, the Spurs took
home-court advantage from the Lakers, and the Lakers turned around to
win the next three, however agonizing, two of them in the Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   There's a lesson in there:</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers are better.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have two superstars, one 30 and the other 23. The Spurs
have one, 26, and a former one, 36.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Spurs have a 19-year-old who looks pretty good ...
and rights to a good-looking Argentine guard now playing in Italy ...
and a lot of cap space coming in 2003, so, while they're leaving us
now, they showed the Lakers they're still viable rivals and they may
be back.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old is, of course, Tony Parker, their rookie point
guard from Paris, who just completed a postseason that was even more
amazing than his remarkable regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie point guards are not supposed to thrive in their first
playoffs, let alone 19-year-old Parisians. If Parker's name had been
Kenny Anderson, and he'd been the No. 3 pick in the draft, instead of
the No. 28 pick, and he was from Brooklyn, instead of Europe, this
still would have been an astonishing performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Outstanding," said Magic Johnson. "His IQ of the game and his
quickness....</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to make you a shot. What we lost in the game today,
guys don't make other guys shots, in terms of driving, makes you have
to help, knows when to kick it. There's only a couple guys left that
can do that and he's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Parker started almost from the get-go, a tipoff he was special,
since the Spurs are a veteran team and an elite one, and Gregg
Popovich is anything but a young players' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Parker hit the wall at midseason, as rookies often do
but then, he kicked it up another notch at the end of the season, and
in the postseason, another notch still.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I didn't wonder that [how Parker would handle playoff
pressure] at all," said Popovich. "Because, if I did or didn't wonder
it, did it matter? He was still going to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's been great, considering the position he's in and the
experience he has, both in life and in the league with these players.
I think he's been fantastic. Couldn't ask for any more. I will, but,
you know for right now...."</TE>
<TE>   With Parker at the point, everything seemed to change.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan, who almost went to Orlando as a free agent in 2000,
has an out in his contract in 2003, and before this season, when the
rest of the roster seemed old and/or mediocre, there was speculation,
within San Antonio and outside, that the next time, when David
Robinson was old, Duncan would actually leave.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the general suspicion is that Duncan will stay, since he,
Parker and a prime 2003 free agent would add up to a pretty fair
contender.</TE>
<TE>   Game to the end, the 2001-2002 Spurs sucked it up after their Game
4 giveaway, labeled the Mother's Day Choke in their hometown paper,
and made Game 5 a contest, leading by 12 points in the second quarter
and 10 in the third before succumbing to the usual Kobe Bryant-led
rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it's a tough loss and as much as it hurts at the time it
happens, they're a pretty resilient group," Popovich said before the
game. "Very intelligent, very mature, and they were able to come back
and work at it the next day and understand what went on.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we went through the film and faced our demons. You know,
you can't just ignore it and say, 'Oh, bad break, fellows, let's go
on.'</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't work. At least, not with our group. we face what we
do well and what we do poorly and move on. They're used to that so I
expect them to come out tonight and play just as they have."</TE>
<TE>   That's what they did, professionals to the end, just out-gunned
professionals</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers played like champions the last four, five minutes of
every game they played and took the series," Popovich said afterward.
"Hats off to them....</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a situation--we'll put it in perspective when we
prepare for next season, but I'm very happy with the competitiveness
we showed on the court ... against that basketball team. I can't
fault the guys.... But it doesn't make the loss any easier."</TE>
<TE>   So now it's summer in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get a Shaq Pack," said Popovich, pride and sense of
humor intact.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By the time the 2003 Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita rolls around, six
years will have passed since thoroughbred racing's richest day had
been held in California.</LD>
<LD>   Bet On Sunshine, a gelded son of Bet Big, was here for the last
one, finishing third behind Elmhurst and Hesabull in the Sprint in
1997 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   It wouldn't be too surprising to see the Florida-bred out west
again next year.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by David P. Holloway Racing and trained by Paul McGee, Bet
On Sunshine is scheduled to make his first start as a 10-year-old in
today's ninth race at Churchill Downs. A winner of 22 of 43 lifetime
and more than $1.4 million, Bet On Sunshine will be favored in the
$58,500 allowance race, breaking from the outside in the field of six
under Pat Day.</TE>
<TE>   The old-timer has trained well for his return, which marks his
first race since he won by 71/4 lengths over a sloppy track on Nov.
24 at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   That race was at 11/16 miles, but he always has been best as a
sprinter and has been especially effective at 61/2 furlongs, the
distance of today's race. He has won 13 of 19 at the distance and
hasn't finished worse than third.</TE>

<LD>There was a time when Kobe Bryant might have chafed at the whole
Shaq-and-his-little-buddy routine.</LD>
<LD>   That's when people wanted Bryant to be Shaquille O'Neal's Boy
Wonder, or supporting cast, or little brother, or whatever.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not important to me," he said. "What's important is
continuing to do what this team needs me to do.</LD>
<TE>   "I can be his sidekick. I'm fine with that. Shaquille is the most
dominant player in the world. As long as he's here, our offense is
going to run through him. Because he's here and because he plays,
that clears me up for easier opportunities that other players in the
league might not get."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins, at the Hall of Fame Luncheon Club in
Massillon, Ohio on Monday, according to the local paper there: "Phil
Jackson may be a pretty good coach, I don't know. It's hard for me to
tell. The guy never gets up. I'm surprised he gets up at timeouts. He
just sits there with his legs crossed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've listened to Phil. He's got a lot of answers. But I'm not
sure if Tim Floyd wouldn't have been a good coach if he'd have had
Michael Jordan. When Michael Jordan left, Phil Jackson kind of quit,
took a year off, go to Wyoming. I don't know what Phil does. He used
to go off into the woods and eat berries and stuff like that. And
then he just happens to get a job with Kobe Bryant and Shaq. I know
this, when I've had really good teams with really good players, at
the end of the game, you usually throw them the ball. I don't know
how smart you have to be to do that."</TE>
<TE>   So uncalled for: He goes to Montana.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After playing 18 minutes in the previous six games, Lindsey Hunter
played 10 in Game 4 and nine in Game 5, and played well enough
against rookie Tony Parker that he could get more time against a
quick guard such as Sacramento's Bobby Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a great deal of faith in Lindsey's ability to get
out and defend," Jackson said. "The counterpoint is it's tough to
play four guards in a playoff situation when you're trying to keep
everybody in rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter has taken only seven shots in the playoffs, making two,
including a three-pointer against the Spurs on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who said he'd undergo a secret treatment on his ailing
ankles before Game 5, changed his mind and went with the usual
therapy.... Derek Fisher, who bruised his knee in Game 4, received
physical therapy for two days and was not hindered in Game 5.
"There's no problem at all," Fisher said early Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS LAKERS 93, SPURS 87</KH>
<HD>Kings Get the Kings</HD>
<DH>Game 5: Matchup with Sacramento in the conference finals is
next after Bryant, Fox and Horry help finish off San Antonio down the
stretch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Antonio Spurs were barely out of the Western Conference
semifinals, and not nearly out of the building yet, when
conversations in the hallways of Staples Center found their ways to
the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers finished the Spurs, 93-87, on Tuesday night, their 10-4
run to end the game the presumed method even before it began. The
best-of-seven series was done in five games because the Lakers
carried every fourth quarter, finally with their series-high 31
points in the last period.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant scored 10 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, and
Shaquille O'Neal had 21 points and 11 rebounds, and Rick Fox had 17
points and seven assists.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 34 points and a career playoff-high 25 rebounds for
the Spurs, overrun at the end by the twice-defending NBA champion
Lakers, who shot terribly for three quarters before shooting 57% in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers renew the defense of those championships with the
Kings in the conference finals, beginning Saturday in Sacramento.
They beat the Kings in the first round two years ago and the second
last year, and three times in four regular-season meetings this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the underdogs because we are starting out this series on
the road," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "They are a very
competitive team against us."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is the Lakers who play beneath banners, who have won 10
consecutive playoff series and 23 of 25 playoff games and 11 in a row
on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who vanquished the Utah Jazz in the first round and the
Dallas Mavericks, against many predictions, in the second, won
home-court advantage with 61 regular-season wins and the Pacific
Division championship.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's game, a sheet of paper was taped to O'Neal's
locker. On it, there was a photograph of King center Vlade Divac and
a midseason quote from Divac, "If [the Lakers] don't have home-court
advantage this year, they're not going to win it."</TE>
<TE>   Divac's assignment in the coming series will be O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear and see everything," O'Neal said. "I'm the po-lice."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he did not know who affixed the quote to his locker.
Fox thought O'Neal himself had done it. Bryant shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see it," Fox said. "But I suspect it. He's been talking
about it for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant chuckled, because he knows how O'Neal gets about these
things.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille, he feeds off motivation like that," Bryant said. "That
gets him charged up."</TE>
<TE>   That would be good for the Lakers, not so much for the Kings.
O'Neal has played the first two series with various ankle and toe
injuries, along with the stitches in his shooting index finger. The
Spurs crowded him and shoved him, so other Lakers, Bryant in
particular, were more assertive on offense.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings would demand a better offensive effort from the Lakers,
who didn't score 100 points in the series, and have done so only once
in eight postseason games. The Kings went for at least 102 five times
in five games against the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be the underdogs and that is fine," Bryant said. "We are
comfortable with that. Going to Sacramento is a tough task. They are
in a place they've never been before, and that's the Western
Conference finals. They are going to be pumped up, they are going to
play their best. They are a very emotional ballclub and we have to be
ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   Then Bryant rethought his premise.</TE>
<TE>   "I never feel like an underdog," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A night after they cried "Beat L.A." in Sacramento, they shouted
"Three-peat" in Los Angeles. At the end of the Spurs' season, and
with all of Sacramento watching, the Lakers took an 83-83 game to
90-83, on a Bryant layup, a Fox layup, and a Robert Horry
three-pointer, from the right corner, with 58 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers played like champions in the last four or five minutes
of every game we played," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said. "The Lakers
got it done. Kobe was great again down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, played straight-up for much of the game again, scored 12
points in the second half, but needed 12 shots for them. He missed
eight. The Spurs led by as many as 10 points in the third quarter,
but gradually lost the lead, and then the series, as the Lakers
stayed in their clutch character.</TE>
<TE>   "We still didn't get it done," Malik Rose said. "We scored down
the stretch, I guess, but we didn't stop anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Now the style changes, from the grind-it-out Spurs to the wildly
up-tempo Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough," Horry said. "Sacramento is playing
really well right now. They have the best team in basketball, so
we've got to get ourselves together and try to get a win.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beat up and buried, but we're going to go in there and try
to quiet the crowd and play hard."</TE>

series against San Antonio in five games, but were not
impressive in doing so. A comparison of key statistics

<HD>Kobe Hands Out a Nice Assist</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Chance meeting with San Antonio youth means
everything, when all the facts come to light.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Tyson met Kobe Bryant last weekend in an Italian restaurant in
San Antonio--just walked up and stuck out his hand--and Bryant smiled
and did the same.</LD>
<LD>   For a few minutes, while Bryant's bodyguards ate, Steve and Kobe
talked, about Gary Payton, Steve's favorite player, and about the
senior prom Steve was headed to, and about the playoff series against
the local team, the San Antonio Spurs, and Steve hardly coughed at
all.</LD>
<LD>   They took a picture, Steve and his date, Megan, and Kobe Bryant,
who laughed and shook Steve's hand one more time and wished him luck.
Steve returned the sentiment, and hardly coughed at all, and
everybody said goodbye.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant could not have known that Steve Tyson had all but sneaked
away from Room 964 at Wilford Hall Medical Center on the Lackland Air
Force Base a few hours earlier. Tyson had disconnected the IV bag
above his head, then coiled the line beneath the sleeve of his tuxedo
shirt, told a nurse he was going and left.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant could not have known that Steve sometimes coughs with
nearly every breath, and that a tube allows nutrients to be pumped
into him overnight, every night.</TE>
<TE>   Or that Steve weighs 110 pounds on a good day, because he has
cystic fibrosis, a disease that affects the respiratory and digestive
systems. Is dying from it actually, something his parents have known
every day since Steve was a month old.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson just stuck out his hand, and Kobe took it, and Steve
grinned. Later, his parents wept when he called them, at 1:30 a.m.,
from Room 964.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no clue," Steve said. "He was just being nice to a normal
person."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Steve's father, also Steve, wrote the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thankful that someone like Kobe had taken the time to spend
some of his time on a busy Saturday night with my son," the elder
Tyson wrote. "Kobe did not know who he was ... but he treated him
like a real friend and gave Steve a memory he will always cherish.
The 10 minutes Kobe spent with my son did more for him than any
medicine could have done. As we watched Kobe dominate the final few
minutes of the game [Sunday], we remembered how nice Kobe had been to
our son, and we realized it's possible to be a gentleman and also be
aggressive on the floor and have a tremendous will to win. We just
became Kobe fans."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant put down a hard copy of the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I have chills," he said. "I have chills right now. I'm so happy I
picked up his spirits. It's better than any game-winning shot I ever
hit."</TE>
<TE>   Steve, the son, is 19. He will walk through graduation ceremonies
with his friends at Marshall High in San Antonio in June, then
graduate in December.</TE>
<TE>   He'll spend about four months of every year in the hospital, in
Room 964, or one like it. He has a cell phone, and Megan calls, and
his parents call. But the room TV does not carry cable channels, so
Steve, a fan of all sports, can't watch all the games he'd like.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been in the hospital for a week when it was time for the
prom, and doctors thought it best he not go.</TE>
<TE>   "We had such a bad week," the elder Tyson said. "The doctors
didn't want to let him out."</TE>
<TE>   But he had to go, was willing to run off to do it, and enough
people looked the other way to allow it.</TE>
<TE>   Steve arrived at Paisano's with 15 other couples. Bryant was in
the corner. Steve hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to bother him," Steve said. "But if I didn't at
least say hello, if I left, I would have been kicking myself
forever."</TE>
<TE>   So he walked over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing, because he's got this fatal disease," Steve, the
father, said. "But he's the bravest kid I've ever met. He has no fear
of doing something like that."</TE>
<TE>   There are greater things to fear, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fatal," Steve, the father, said of the disease. "But, the
good thing is, the life expectancy is better. It used to be 18, 19
was all they'd give you. Now, it's in the mid- to late-20s."</TE>
<TE>   Everything, then, means something.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe could have blown it," the father, said. "He could have been
a jerk. But, he talked to him. He took a picture with him. He invited
his date over. It meant everything to Steve."</TE>
<TE>   Steve watched on television Sunday afternoon, when the Spurs were
on one of the local channels. And when Bryant was introduced, the kid
in Room 964 cheered for his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I met him," Steve said. "It feels different now."</TE>
<TE>   Then Steve hung up the telephone after five minutes. He hadn't
coughed once.</TE>

<HD>Mogilny Puts Leafs in Seventh Heaven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The resilient Toronto Maple Leafs keep advancing in the playoffs
because Alexander Mogilny continues to score big goals in Game 7s.</LD>
<LD>   Mogilny was at it again Tuesday night, scoring twice in a 3-0
victory over Ottawa that advanced the Maple Leafs to the Eastern
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis Joseph stopped 19 shots and Bryan McCabe also scored for
the Leafs, who will face the Carolina Hurricanes in a best-of-seven
series that starts Thursday at Raleigh, N.C.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive seven-game series victory for
Toronto, which eliminated the New York Islanders with a 4-2 victory
in Game 7 in the opening round.</TE>
<TE>   And it was the second consecutive Game 7 in which Mogilny scored
twice.</TE>
<TE>   While the Air Canada Centre was still buzzing with "Go Leafs Go"
chants, Mogilny sounded almost subdued.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what the fuss is all about," Mogilny said.
"There's a bigger hurdle coming up. I don't know why everybody's so
excited. The last time I checked you have to win four series."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, the excitement comes because nearly everyone counted out
the banged-up and weary Maple Leafs, who were without six regulars,
including captain Mats Sundin (broken wrist), and were playing their
12th game in 22 days.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever we face adversity, we don't pack it in at all," center
Alyn McCauley said. "It seems the longer the series goes on, the
longer the game goes on, the stronger we get. I don't know if that's
the team character or conditioning, but it seems that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we're just the marathon runners and not the sprint
runners."</TE>
<TE>   The same cannot be said about the Senators, who continued to live
down to their reputation of folding under playoff pressure, blowing a
3-2 series advantage, and squandering leads in its three previous
games--including a 2-0 lead in a 4-3 loss in Game 6 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Senators have never advanced past the second round and have
been eliminated by Toronto in three consecutive playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Failure to get it done. We had them on the ropes a few times,"
Ottawa defenseman Wade Redden said. "You can look back at a number of
things throughout the series."</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny opened the scoring with a power-play goal 11:49 into the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting with the puck in the right corner, Mogilny tried to thread
a pass through the middle to McCabe, who was sneaking in from the
point. Instead, Mogilny's pass hit the side of Ottawa defender Sami
Salo's skate, and bounced in.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny made it 2-0, scoring on a delayed penalty 5:14 into the
third period. After Ottawa's Todd White bowled over Joseph, Tomas
Kaberle led a rush up the right side.</TE>
<TE>   Kaberle's cross-ice pass found Mogilny, who lifted a shot over
diving Ottawa goalie Patrick Lalime.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe sealed the victory with 5:56 left.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny refused to be referred to as a clutch performer.</TE>
<TE>   "I never was," Mogilny said. "I'm just a hockey player. I'm not
Steve Yzerman or Mario Lemieux. I'm Alex Mogilny.... I accept who I
am and I'm just trying to be part of the group."</TE>

<HD>Stoudamire Enters Plea</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire pleaded innocent Tuesday
to a felony charge of possessing marijuana in Oregon City, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Stoudamire's attorney, Stephen Houze, said he would challenge the
legality of a police search of Stoudamire's home in Lake Oswego, a
wealthy Portland suburb.</LD>
<LD>   Bail for Stoudamire, 28, was set at $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the law is clear and we intend to fight this all the
way," Houze said.</TE>
<TE>   According to published reports, police found a pound of marijuana
at Stoudamire's home on Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a burglar alarm, police found a door ajar, called
for backup and entered the home, according to the reports.</TE>
<TE>   Houze is challenging the charge on the basis of a ruling last week
by the Oregon Court of Appeals. In that case, the court ruled a
warrantless search of a house with an open door was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   According to an indictment returned on Monday, Stoudamire is
charged with possessing 150 or more grams of marijuana--a Class B
felony.</TE>
<TE>   Charges were dropped against Stoudamire's father.</TE>

<TE>   Philadelphia 76er chairman Ed Snider made it clear that he wants

<TE>   Speculation has centered on Brown leaving because of his
tumultuous relationship with Allen Iverson, but Brown has said often
that he planned to return and that the final decision would be made
by Snider.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has three years left on his contract, reportedly worth about
$6.25 million per year plus stock options.</TE>

<HD>Venus Pulls Out at Italian Open</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venus Williams pulled out of her second-round match against Anna
Kournikova in the Italian Open at Rome on Tuesday night because of a
wrist injury, with the stadium already half-full for the highly
awaited encounter.</LD>
<LD>   The world's top-ranked player said she injured her right wrist
picking up her bag at practice this week. Williams apologized to the
crowd minutes before the match was to begin.</LD>
<LD>   Williams said she told the WTA about her withdrawal half an hour
before the match was scheduled to start.</LD>
<TE>   "It happened this week," Williams said at a news conference. "This
morning in practice it hurt and then during the day it got worse with
more swelling. I could have played with the pain, but it did not seem
correct."</TE>
<TE>   The injury comes at a bad time for Williams, with the French Open
less than two weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   "It really makes me somewhat nervous about the French, that I
won't be able to play this week, that I'll have two weeks that I
can't play a tournament," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Williams pulled out of a semifinal match against her
sister Serena in similar fashion in a tournament at Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials released a statement saying the injury had
been certified by the WTA but that the tournament doctor and a WTA
trainer would re-evaluate the injury today.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova, a former top 10 player seeking her first tournament
title, defeated Williams' replacement, Lilia Osterloh, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out five minutes before the match," Kournikova said.
"It's a pity. It's a little disappointing to find out just a few
minutes before the match for the fans and everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Second-ranked Jennifer Capriati needed only 50 minutes to beat
Slovenia's Maja Matevzic, 6-2, 6-1.</TE>

<TE>   Andy Roddick swept past veteran Todd Martin, 7-6 (4), 6-2, in the

6-3, 6-3, for his first victory in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Former USC power forward Sam Clancy, last season's Pacific 10
Conference player of the year, is looking at possible surgery after
dislocating his left kneecap and tearing a tendon during a workout
with the Phoenix Suns on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I went up to block a shot, came down and it popped out on me,"
Clancy said. "I don't even know how I landed. I had an MRI and I'm
supposed to see the Lakers' doctor [today], but they're telling me I
should be out three months total."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, a projected mid-to-late-first-round pick in June's NBA
draft, said he suffered the same injury to the same knee as a high
school sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio University 6-foot-7 forward Brandon Hunter, a two-time
All-Mid-American Conference first-team selection, confirmed he has
made himself available for next month's NBA draft. Hunter will not
retain an agent, keeping open the option of returning to school for
his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA said it will use basketballs made of synthetic materials
next season because animal-rights activists complained about the use
of leather. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has begun
talks with the NBA about switching its basketballs to the synthetic
ones, already in use by most major colleges and universities. The
WNBA uses a ball made from pleather, a synthetic leather.</TE>

<TE>   Trainer Ronnie Barnes estimates that 20 New York Giants used
supplements containing ephedra after the stimulant was banned by the
NFL in September.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes told the New York Daily News that he believes 75% of the
players on the Giants' active roster--40 of 53--used the substance
before it was banned.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the NFL announced it will conduct year-round random
testing for ephedra starting July 1. It is the first U.S. pro sports
league to ban ephedrine, a substance that also often is found in
strength-building food supplements and can cause seizures, strokes
and death.</TE>

operations for the Cleveland Browns, said he wasn't going to sit by

<HD>NFL Puts L.A. Team in Its Sights</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Commissioner to head up group of owners and
considers possibility of expansion team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Taking cautious, but substantial, first steps toward returning the
NFL to Los Angeles, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Tuesday appointed
a group of prominent team owners to study such a move and for the
first time raised the possibility of granting L.A. an expansion team.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the end of the league's one-day spring meeting,
Tagliabue said he will chair the so-called L.A. investigative unit, a
panel that will include the Miami Dolphins' Wayne Huizenga, the
Cleveland Browns' Carmen Policy, the Carolina Panthers' Jerry
Richardson, the Pittsburgh Steelers' Dan Rooney and the New England
Patriots' Bob Kraft.</LD>
<LD>   "The main purpose of the group," Tagliabue said, "is to work with
me as a sounding board to identify the realistic alternatives, an
intermediate group that brings a lot of expertise to the discussion
as we go forward."</LD>
<TE>   In other developments Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council
introduced several motions that could help ease the way for the NFL's
return and the construction of a new stadium, possibly in downtown
Los Angeles. The measures introduced would allow the use of public
money to help build a stadium as long as the city is repaid, help
find potential stadium sites and create an ad hoc sports franchise
committee that would be a "vehicle for city representatives to work
with the National Football League."</TE>
<TE>   Among the teams considered likely candidates to move to Los
Angeles are the San Diego Chargers, Minnesota Vikings, Arizona
Cardinals, New Orleans Saints, Indianapolis Colts and, yes, the
Oakland Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Despite much recent talk about the Chargers, one source, after
listening to speculation by various owners, said the Colts are the
front-runners.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones envisions a team in Los Angeles
"sooner" than five years, but Tagliabue wouldn't put a time frame on
the mission of his new group.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner said that, although he is enthusiastic about the
interest of Staples Center owner Philip Anschutz in building a
football stadium in the downtown L.A. area, Anschutz is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several others [with similar plans] in the private
sector, would be my guess," Tagliabue said. "But it's an educated
guess."</TE>
<TE>   Though he picked his words carefully and remained vague on many
issues, Tagliabue was firm on one. Asked if the renovation of the
Coliseum remains a viable option, the commissioner answered, "No."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the competition for the league's 32nd and, supposedly,
final team for the foreseeable future came down to L.A. and Houston,
with Houston being awarded the franchise when owner Bob McNair
offered $700 million to cinch the deal. The Houston Texans begin play
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an assumption that, when we went to 32, that was it for
a while," Tagliabue said. "I don't see another team for the next
decade, but whether anybody [in the working group] will have an idea
to make an exception will be addressed in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Open speculation about adding a new team could be a ploy to blunt
criticism that the league has formed a group that will devise a way
to abandon one of its current cities, some observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want a situation where they would have to ask a market
to support a team that is going to be gone in a few years," said Marc
Ganis, who heads a Chicago-based sports consulting firm. "This way,
they can hold out the possibility that a team will not have to
relocate."</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue may have downplayed the role of the new group, but Kraft
made it clear its mission must be a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting a team in Los Angeles," the Patriot owner said, "will be
one of the most important accomplishments of the next few years. Los
Angeles is the gateway to all of Asia. It is the second-biggest city
in the country. The league belongs there."</TE>
<TE>   Policy, on the other hand, sees the mission differently.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had a crystal ball," he said, "and could see that there
will never be an NFL team in Los Angeles, I think the commissioner
would still have formed this committee to pay attention to the fan
base and the business community there.</TE>
<TE>   "This committee is designed to enhance interest in the Los Angeles
market, but I am not going to say that we will play a direct role in
bringing a team there."</TE>
<TE>   While the guessing game over who will make the big leap was the
hot topic at Tuesday's meeting at the Inter-Continental hotel,
Charger President Dean Spanos stood in the lobby and did his best to
downplay rumors that it will be his team. That speculation gained
momentum because of the team's decision to move its training camp to
Anschutz's new training complex in Carson in 2003. But Spanos
insisted he wants to keep the team in San Diego and said the training
camp move had long been considered as a way to avoid distractions at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's bad timing, but one is not tied to the other," Spanos
said.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos said the Chargers have hired Mark Fabiani, a political
consultant who worked for both President Clinton and on Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, to find a way to keep the
Chargers in San Diego. And that means finding a way to get a new
stadium built.</TE>
<TE>   "All we want is to be competitive with the rest of the league,"
Spanos insisted. "Qualcomm Stadium is one of the two or three oldest
in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Spanos predicted that "in the next five or six months, we should
have a realistic idea if we can go forward. We will take our time to
do what's in the best interests of our team and, hopefully, we'll be
able to work it out in San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   But if not, Spanos now has a group of fellow owners to help him
evaluate his L.A. options.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody will move to Los Angeles, said Jones. "I have blind faith
it will happen."</TE>

<HD>Hitchcock Is Hired by Flyers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Philadelphia Flyers fired Bill Barber two weeks ago, they
planned to conduct a long, exhaustive search to find a new coach.</LD>
<LD>   It took only one interview.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Hitchcock, who led the Dallas Stars to a Stanley Cup
championship in 1999, was hired Tuesday to lead the Flyers. He was
the only candidate to meet with the team.</LD>
<TE>   "When we made that statement, we were worried that Ken was on his
way to the [New York] Rangers," team chairman Ed Snider said.
"Fortunately, that wasn't the case. We jumped in right away. He's
exactly the coach this team needs."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock, 50, an assistant with the Flyers from 1990-93, was
fired by the Stars in January. He is the fifth coach hired by General
Manager Bob Clarke since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   A demanding coach whose philosophy centers on defense, Hitchcock
said there are many things alike between the Flyers and the Stars.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a similar situation of a desperation to learn and the
commitment that the players have reached the stage where they
hopefully are willing to listen and learn," Hitchcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock has a 277-160-60-6 regular-season record, 47-33 in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina defenseman David Tanabe skated for the first time since
breaking his right wrist a month ago, but his return for the Eastern
Conference finals remained questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Tanabe has been sidelined since being injured in Game 1 of the
opening-round playoff series against New Jersey. Tanabe has been
fitted with a soft cast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not 100%, but it's definitely getting there," Tanabe said.</TE>

<HD>Hermansen Provides Pirate Clout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is one comeback for which the Pittsburgh Pirates were waiting.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Hermansen's two-run homer backed Kip Wells' effective
pitching over 61/3 innings, and the Pirates rebounded from their most
lopsided shutout loss in nearly seven years to defeat Arizona, 2-1,
Tuesday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Hermansen, who rejoined the Pirates on Saturday to get another
shot at winning the starting job he couldn't keep in 2000, followed
Wells' one-out single in the third by homering into the left-field
seats on a 3-and-2 fastball by Brian Anderson (0-3).</LD>
<TE>   Hermansen, who batted only .193 in 74 games in three previous
seasons, is five for 11 with two extra-base hits in three starts
since being activated from the disabled list. One at-bat after
homering, he showed his versatility by easily beating out a bunt.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows what we have to have, and that's consistency," Manager
Lloyd McClendon said. "He's been great with the bat, a lot more
aggressive and now we've got to keep him that way."</TE>
<TE>   Hermansen is out of minor league options and seemed on his way to
another team until catching the Pirates' eye by batting .382 with
three homers in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 11, Chicago 2--Garrett Stephenson returned to the
Cardinal rotation with four solid innings at St. Louis, helping
extend the Cubs' losing streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson pitched for the first time since April 14, when he was
sidelined with a back strain.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out five, walked three and gave up five hits.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Juan Cruz (0-7) gave up four runs in 32/3 innings, becoming
the first Cub starter to start a season with seven losses since Mike
Morgan in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   No Cub starter since 1900 has started 0-8.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, Philadelphia 1--Morgan Ensberg hit a bases-loaded
triple in the eighth inning at Houston and the Astros won their third
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Wolf (2-2) gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings
for Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, Milwaukee 3--Pitcher Jose Acevedo (4-1) hit a
two-run double at Milwaukee, and the Reds improved to 5-0 against the
Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dunn's two-out triple began the Reds' rally in the fourth
against Ruben Quevedo (1-5).</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Colorado 2--Derrek Lee hit a tiebreaking triple in the
seventh inning and Josh Beckett gave up three hits in six innings,
and the Marlins ended the Rockies' seven-game home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Beckett (1-2) made his first start since April 28 after a stint on
the disabled list because of a blister on the middle finger of his
pitching hand.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 2, Atlanta 0--Reggie Sanders hit a two-run single in
the eighth inning, and Ryan Jensen gave up five hits in eight innings
at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen (4-2) won his third consecutive start for the Giants, who
have won 12 of their last 15.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Montreal 4--D'Angelo Jimenez's bases-loaded, one-out
single in the bottom of the ninth inning lifted the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero hit a 431-foot homer into the second
deck in left field in the third inning, the 34th hit there in
Qualcomm Stadium's 34-year history.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego tied the score, 4-4, on Deivi Cruz's two-run double in
the seventh.</TE>

<HD>Now Comes Real Playoff Pressure</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you hear that sound? It filled the Staples Center on Tuesday,
buried underneath the cheers, but alive nonetheless, ringing in the
minds of those who understood.</LD>
<LD>   Yep. Cowbells.</LD>
<LD>   Did you feel that chill? Late in the Lakers' playoff game against
the San Antonio Spurs, it raised a little shiver in those who had
been expecting it.</LD>
<TE>   Yep. Arco.</TE>
<TE>   Did you get a taste of that whine? It was added to the concession
menu immediately after the game, but one could already imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Yep. Webber.</TE>
<TE>   All of which is to say, there were three teams on the court
Tuesday in the fifth and clinching game of the Western Conference
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Lakers 93, Spurs 87, Sacramento Kings next.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a place now where we wanted to be all along," Kobe
Bryant said afterward. "We have a tough task ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Tuesday's Laker victory and four-game-to-one series win
was not about ordinary basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Despite getting pushed around by the Spurs until the final
moments, this was calisthenics. It took longer only because it was
difficult playing one team while thinking about another one.</TE>
<TE>   (At least that is what we can tell ourselves, now that the Spurs
have returned to their steamy little cantina for the summer.)</TE>
<TE>   The awful first quarter, when Rick Fox scored twice as many points
as any other two Lakers combined?</TE>
<TE>   Push-ups.</TE>
<TE>   The second quarter, when the Lakers shot only 39% and trailed by
as many as 13 points?</TE>
<TE>   Jumping jacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, when the Lakers finally played defense and
the Spurs missed six consecutive shots and the game became even,
those cheers were about relief.</TE>
<TE>   Then, finally, in the fourth quarter, when Bryant was again
stunning and Fox was again swarming and Lindsey Hunter appeared out
of absolutely nowhere, the cheers were about Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the fans actually said it.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody was chanting "Beat Sacramento!" perhaps because of the
degree of syllable difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, perhaps, nobody was following Phil Jackson's
lead in chanting, "Beat the Semi-Civilized!"</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't matter what anybody says, really. The time for talking is
finished even before it starts.</TE>
<TE>   Here comes the team with the NBA's best record, the only team that
has ever had a viable chance of dethroning the Lakers, a team that
will immediately paint themselves as poor little underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having home-court advantage in the loudest arena in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the momentum of an impressive second-round series win that
included an overtime victory in Dallas with their three best players
on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having two players for whom the Lakers suddenly have no
match--Chris Webber and Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Underdog, schmunderdog.</TE>
<TE>   "They are coming out of that series like they are invincible,"
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   No, he wasn't talking about his team.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not time to celebrate," Shaquille O'Neal said late
Tuesday. "We know what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   The first time these teams met in the playoffs two years ago, in
the first round, the Kings were badly overmatched but used surprise
as a weapon in pushing the Lakers to a deciding fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Kings were more skilled, but the Lakers were more
cautious, and swept them out of the second round.</TE>
<TE>   This spring?</TE>
<TE>   If you are judging the regular season, the Kings were a better
team. Three games better, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   If you are judging the postseason, the Kings are a better team. Or
have you been tuning in only for the fourth quarters?</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten results, but we're still searching for the type of
rhythm that separates us from the fray," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have indeed the aura. But the Kings have spent two
postseasons staring up at that aura, long enough to recognize its
flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic, who averaged 18 points against the Lakers, could
be missing with a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings know O'Neal has twice that many injured feet.</TE>
<TE>   Webber always seems to have big-game problems, with or without
Tyra Banks at his</TE>
<TE>   side.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings know that Bryant has emerged this postseason as the
Lakers' only consistent pressure threat.</TE>
<TE>   And they feel they have at least an occasional answer for him in
defensive specialist Doug Christie.</TE>
<TE>   The most important thing about the Kings is that, for the first
time ever, they may actually feel they can beat the Lakers in a
seven-game series.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, no team in the NBA has felt like that.</TE>
<TE>   But how much will that matter?</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of teams have said they have resolve," Fox said. "But the
results are still the same."</TE>
<TE>   Upon finishing off the Spurs on Tuesday night, the Lakers walked
off the court with few smiles amid the confetti.</TE>
<TE>   As well as they understand the fourth-quarter clock, they also
understand a calendar.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs start now.</TE>

<DH>Salman has faced resentment since Kentucky Derby victory,
but others describe the Saudi Arabian prince as a shrewd horseman</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>As the Kentucky Derby neared two weeks ago, the buzz building along
Churchill Downs' backstretch was that this might be Sheik Mohammed's
turn to win the race.</LD>
<LD>   The stars weren't necessarily aligned, but the
Dubai-takes-the-Derby theorists were mounting their case: Essence Of
Dubai was the only horse in the field to have already won at the
11/4-mile Derby distance; his trainer, Saeed Suroor, said that this
was the best horse the sheik had ever sent to Churchill, and the
field, considered less than formidable, lacked a stick-out favorite.
There was even a balance-the-scales hook: The sheik's star filly,
Tempera, who had been one of the favorites for the Kentucky Oaks, had
died five days before the race.</LD>
<LD>   An Arab won the Derby, all right, but it wasn't Sheik Mohammed.
Essence Of Dubai, breaking to the right and bumping Medaglia d'Oro
leaving the gate, never reached contention before finishing ninth.
The winner, War Emblem with a rare wire-to-wire Derby trip, belonged
to Ahmed Salman, a brash Saudi Arabian prince who is six years Sheik
Mohammed's junior. Now War Emblem will aim for the second jewel in
the Triple Crown in the Preakness on Saturday at Pimlico.</LD>
<TE>   Salman, 43, is not exactly a bargain-basement shopper, and
certainly no Derby neophyte. He had Point Given, the beaten favorite,
last year and War Emblem was his fourth Derby starter. Even so, Sheik
Mohammed has been chasing the roses longer. Sheik Mohammed ran two
horses--one the overrated Arazi--in the 1992 Derby, two years before
the germination of Salman's California-based Thoroughbred Corp.
Salman didn't run a horse in the Derby until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Sheik Mohammed paid a reported $5 million for a
horse--Worldly Manner--who finished seventh in the 1999 Derby, Salman
bought in this year at a cost of $900,000 for a 90% interest in War
Emblem, a colt purchased only 23 days before the race. But it's not
as if Salman was winning on the cheap. At auction in 2000 and 2001,
he had spent more than $17 million on horses of this 3-year-old
generation, only none of them panned out.</TE>
<TE>   Teased along by Point Given's frustrating fifth-place finish a
year ago, Salman had his antennae up for a last-gasp purchase, and
after watching on television from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on April 6,
the day War Emblem won the Illinois Derby, he empowered trainer Bob
Baffert and Thoroughbred Corp.'s hard-nosed racing manager, Richard
Mulhall, to fly to Kentucky for an inspection.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem's original trainer, Bobby Springer, was candid about
the colt's ankle and knee problems, but the prince was undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got [bone] chips," Baffert told Salman. "He won't vet out."</TE>
<TE>   "Go get him," Salman said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Derby, it was easy to say, so Salman said it: "I thought
the price was extremely reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added: "I've been breeding horses, I've been buying
yearlings and [unraced] 2-year-olds in training, and I've even been
buying horses in Argentina. Just about everything you can imagine. So
when you get the chance ... I know people are saying that we just
bought the horse before the Derby, but I think it's much smarter to
buy a horse four weeks before the race than it is to try to raise a
Derby winner."</TE>
<TE>   Like Sheik Mohammed, Salman is more than a patron of the equine
arts. The prince is a major international publisher--his daily,
Asharq Al-Awsat, is said to be the leading newspaper of the Arab
world--but he spends a lot of time at his small farm in Bradbury, and
he and Mulhall, who trained horses for 36 years, are familiar
seatmates as they ogle horseflesh, pore over pedigrees and compare
notes at the high-priced horse sales. A few years ago, they hitched
their wagon to Baffert, who was already a two-time winner of the
Derby and a short-order Triple Crown mainstay.</TE>
<TE>   "The prince is a horseman," said Gary Stevens, who rode Point
Given to wins in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes after that crushing
setback in the Derby. "He understands horses and race strategy."</TE>
<TE>   Point Given, whose only 2001 loss was in the Derby, later was
voted the Eclipse Award as best 3-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Salman has won three Breeders' Cup races, in the Distaff with
Jewel Princess and Spain, and in the Juvenile with Anees. The day
before this year's Derby, Spain won a stakes at Churchill and, with a
total of $3.3 million, surpassed Serena's Song as the female record
holder for career earnings. Another of Salman's fillies was Sharp
Cat, who was retired in 1998 with $2 million in purses.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Lukas, who trains Spain for Salman, also originally trained
Sharp Cat, before she and most of the Thoroughbred Corp. horses went
to Wally Dollase. After Dollase lost Salman as a client--in an
emotional, barn-clearing display at Dollase's Santa Anita barn in
March 1999--Alex Hassinger Jr. became Salman's prime trainer, but
after winning the 1999 Breeders' Cup Juvenile with Anees, he also
moved on.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit by Dollase against Thoroughbred Corp., for the money he
claimed was owed for the balance of his contract, was settled out of
court.</TE>
<TE>   "My problems were with Mulhall, not the prince," Dollase said
Tuesday. "The prince was an OK guy. People who say that he bought the
Derby are just jealous. I think there's a lot of resentment toward
all of the Arabs because they go to the sales, buy the cream and then
beat us with it. But the prince bought War Emblem and pulled off the
Derby, so I say, more power to him."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Sept. 11, Salman, who is a nephew of King Fahd,
donated the cost of one breeding season to Point Given--$125,000--to
the New York Heroes Fund, but he will not be drawn into using the
Triple Crown as a political forum. At least one columnist tarred War
Emblem's Derby win by writing that 15 of the 19 terrorists on Sept.
11 had held Saudi passports, and trainer John Ward Jr., who will try
to beat the Derby winner with Booklet in the Preakness, noted that
there was not "the usual emotional outburst" at Churchill Downs when
Salman's horse won.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a businessman," Salman said after the Derby. "I leave
[U.S.-Arab relations] up to our politicians and American
politicians."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lukas will run Table Limit as well as Proud Citizen in the
Preakness. Mike Smith, second with Proud Citizen in the Kentucky
Derby, will be aboard again, and Stevens has the assignment on Table
Limit.... With Sunday Break, who would have been the third or fourth
choice, not running, the Preakness field is at 13.</TE>

<LD>The Southern Section Southern Regional individual golf tournament,
canceled Monday at Tijeras Creek Golf Course because of a fire in the
Rancho Santa Margarita area, has been rescheduled for Thursday at
Coto de Caza Golf and Country Club.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament, a qualifier for the section finals Monday at
Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs, will be a shotgun start at 2:30
p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "For Coto to pull this off with two days notice is unbelievable,"
tournament manager Bob Bosanko said. "We could have had them playing
at some par-three course."</LD>
<TE>   The tournament began Monday before the fire started, but was
called off after about 90 minutes. The Orange County Sheriff's Dept.
evacuated the course because helicopters needed access to the
course's lakes for water to combat the fire.</TE>

<HD>Chatsworth Plays Large in Victory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Size matters in high school volleyball, especially when a team has
three tall and powerful players the caliber of Chatsworth High's Matt
Cornell, Paul George and Doug Turner.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-4 Cornell had 27 kills, the 6-5 George, who is bound
for UCLA, had 11 kills and three blocks and the 6-4 Turner finished
with 13 kills and six blocks to help Chatsworth defeat Los Angeles
University, 15-5, 15-7, 15-11, Tuesday night in a City Championship
semifinal at Chatsworth.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Chancellors (13-0), seeking their first City title
since 1989 and fourth overall, will play defending champion Woodland
Hills Taft on Friday night at Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   Taft, which has already lost to Chatsworth in West Valley League
play, defeated Granada Hills, 15-12, 15-2, 6-15, 15-3, in the other
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Greg Saltzberg, in his third season, always scours the
Chatsworth campus for tall students, then tries to talk them into
playing volleyball. Five of his six starters are 6-2 or taller.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," he said of his giant lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth was in control except for a brief time in the third
game when the Chancellors lost focus and fell behind, 9-6. But
Cornell was the dominant player throughout. University had no answers
for his consistent play in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "They beat us at the net," said University Coach Neal Newman,
whose teams have won seven City 4-A championships. "They should win
the City title."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>

<TE>   In Southern Section boys' volleyball playoffs:</TE>
<TE>   Placentia Valencia d. Torrance 15-12, 4-15, 15-13, 8-15,
16-14--Rob Aguilera broke a 14-14 tie in the fifth game with a block
and kill for Valencia (18-1) in a Division III second-round victory
at Torrance (13-13). Aguilera and Dan Bonkoski had 16 kills each for
Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Union d. Irvine 14-16, 15-10, 15-6, 15-10--Matt Vlasach
had 34 kills, a school record for four games, to lead the Sea Hawks
(22-10) in a Division III match at Redondo.</TE>
<TE>   In softball:</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro 7, Verdugo Hills 0--Ashley Esparza (20-2) pitched her
14th shutout, allowing four hits and striking out nine, to lead
top-seeded San Pedro (25-2) to a semifinal victory over fifth-seeded
Verdugo Hills (17-12) in the City Championship playoffs at South Gate
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Esparza had three hits and drove in a pair of runs, while teammate
Jackie Conlin had three hits and one run batted in for the Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Carson 6, Woodland Hills El Camino Real 1--Shaterra Davis had two
hits, including a home run, and drove in two runs for the Colts in a
City Championship semifinal at South Gate Park. Adrienne Alo had a
triple and three RBIs for Carson and Danica Iolamo pitched a
four-hitter with eight strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Carson will play San Pedro in the final for the third consecutive
year. San Pedro has won each of the last two, including a 20-inning
marathon in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Phelan Serrano 14, Apple Valley Granite Hills 13--Taylor Long
capped a five-run rally in the eighth inning with a run-scoring hit
over the right fielder's head to give the Diamondbacks (13-9-1) a
victory in a wild-card game of the Southern Section Division III
playoffs. Granite Hills scored four runs in the top of the eighth to
break a 9-9 tie. Serrano then rallied for three runs and had the
bases loaded when Daniel Flores drove in a run with a squeeze bunt.
Long then delivered the game-winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   Redlands East Valley 3, Moreno Valley Valley View 2--Carlos
Cardenas scored on a wild pitch with one out and the bases loaded in
the bottom of the ninth inning to give Redlands East Valley (20-7) a
Division I wild-card victory over Valley View (16-11).</TE>
<TE>   Matt Millett of Redlands East Valley struck out eight, allowed
four hits and gave up one earned run through eight innings but did
not get the decision.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola 4, Ventura Buena 2--Trey Martin (7-3) gave up one
earned run as he pitched a five-hitter with 13 strikeouts to lead the
Cubs (17-9) to a Division II wild-card victory over the visiting
Bulldogs (10-14).</TE>
<TE>   Fred Roche had a two-run double in the second inning and Cooper
Bergdahl had a run-scoring double in the third and added a run for
Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma 12, Moreno Valley Rancho Verde 11--Alta Loma (13-14)
scored all its runs in the first three innings then held on in a
Division I wild-card game at Alta Loma.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Weddle had four hits, including a triple, and Steve Ward had
a triple and two RBIs for Alta Loma.</TE>

<DH>Now that Selanne has adjusted, Sharks have higher hopes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oozing confidence, Teemu Selanne saw an opportunity, followed his
instincts, made the right decision and was able to finish.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose Sharks only wish his moves on the ice were so smooth.</LD>
<LD>   The Sharks were waiting for the Colorado Avalanche to finish off
the Kings in their first-round playoff series. There were a few days
to kill and there was no shortage of golf courses. Selanne merely
wanted to play a couple of relaxing rounds.</LD>
<TE>   Trouble was, Sirpa, his wife, stood like Rob Blake on the blue
line. Getting some golfing time was going to take some doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was planning to play Saturday and Sunday, but Sunday my little
one was having his second birthday," Selanne said. "I told my wife,
'I'd like to play Sunday too. Instead, I'll play 36 holes on
Saturday, and Sunday is the day for the family.' It's all how you
sell it."</TE>
<TE>   Few can sell as well as Selanne, whose star-presence is as
mesmerizing today as it was during his five-plus seasons with the
Mighty Ducks. He holds court daily in the Sharks' dressing room,
filling up notebooks with insight and humor, providing both with a
savvy innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, selling has had little to do with turning around a season
that early on seemed destined for the nearest Jerry/Sally/Ricki
afternoon talk show.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne got a new lease on his hockey life when he bought into
Shark Coach Darryl Sutter's way after a fountain-of-hockey-youth
experience playing for Finland in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He quit counting the minutes (of ice time he was getting) and the
days (until July 1, when he will be an unrestricted free agent).
Selanne did the math and things added up.</TE>
<TE>   The light at the end of his tunnel was the shine of the Stanley
Cup, which did wonders for the old confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, I'm on a team where we have a chance to go
all the way," Selanne said. "This has been the easiest season of my
life. Mentally, it was very tough with the Ducks. There was so much
pressure on our line that you knew you had to bring your A-game every
night. You had to give everything you had just to make the playoffs.
Then you couldn't raise the bar and play at another level. You were
just too tired.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone on this team knew for sure we were going to be in the
playoffs. The question was only what seed we would be."</TE>
<TE>   The question that lingers is: Just how far can the Sharks go?
Selanne has provided some answers in their second-round series
against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   He scored two goals in a Game 1 victory over the Avalanche, ending
his 11-game goalless streak in the playoffs. In the third period of
Game 3, he got off a one-timer from a tough angle that beat Patrick
Roy to tie the score, 4-4. The Sharks won, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne has five goals through the first six games of the series,
which concludes tonight in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he is here for," Shark left wing Mike Ricci said.
"It's tough for goalies, because he just snaps the puck quick and
gets it in good spots."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne has been tough on goalies since the Olympics. He finished
the regular season with 29 goals, the lowest total of his career for
a full season, but his contributions picked up after Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   He laughs at the notion, but the moment his season swung upward
might have been when he slammed Chris Pronger's face into the glass
during an Olympic game against Team Canada.</TE>
<TE>   If Selanne had any doubts about how his teammates felt about him,
they were cleared up when the Sharks' Owen Nolan, who played with
Pronger on Team Canada, spoke up. Nolan said that if Pronger had a
problem with Selanne in future NHL games, then "[Shark forward] Scott
Thornton or I will handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Selanne, "The Olympics was when I knew everything was going
to be great for me. I really got my heart back. Hockey was so much
fun again. My confidence was back."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne had labored in Sutter's system at first.</TE>
<TE>   The weight of the team had always been on him and Paul Kariya in
Anaheim. Selanne thrived on the 25-minute games, regardless of how
taxing each season had become.</TE>
<TE>   When he was shown the way to San Jose a year ago, in a deal for
forward Jeff Friesen and goalie Steve Shields, he arrived in good
spirits, joking with his new teammates that they could relax because
"I brought the quotes with me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ricci, "He is such a great person, as well as a great player.
We love having him in our dressing room."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne was in San Jose for more than lip service though. He was
to be the last stone in a foundation for playoff success. Those hopes
seemed to evaporate when he failed to rain down goals. He had only
five in the first 22 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of playing time, Selanne said, was causing his lack of
production. And although he didn't have a stopwatch around his neck
during games to chart his time, the clock was ticking in his head. He
would be an unrestricted free agent this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing 14 minutes a game is not really how you're going to get
your confidence back," Selanne said. "At the same time, you can do
something good when you are out there. The first half of the season,
nothing was there. I don't even want to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   But he did want to talk about it ... then. Selanne complained
about his short ice time and a Sutter-Selanne feud was born, although
both credit the media with an assist.</TE>
<TE>   It was reported that after a poor game against the New York
Rangers in January, Sutter told the car-crazy Selanne, "I don't care
if you get into your Porsche and drive back to Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne, who was wallowing in what became a 10-game goalless span,
replied, "The Porsche is in Finland."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sutter, "It was an issue that no one ever talked to Teemu or
me about. They talked to everyone else. Teemu and I laugh about it.
Everyone else wanted to make a big deal about it. It was very simple.
I think it was just the adjustment of coming to a different club."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne supports that stance.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never had any problems," he said. "I haven't had problems
with any coach before. I don't know where those rumors started. Of
course, [Sutter] does give me a little [grief] all the time when I'm
not playing well. But that's nothing personal."</TE>
<TE>   If there were any hard feelings between player and coach, they did
not last the season. Sutter did all that he could to get Selanne his
30th goal in the season finale, playing him extensively in the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a more focused player going into the Olympics and became
one of our better players," Sutter said.</TE>
<TE>   The post-Olympic run has been good for the Sharks, who are trying
to advance past the second round for the first time in their 11-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   It has also been good for Selanne, who is showing potential
suitors that he still has some bite left. He is making $9.5 million
this season, about $3 million of which is paid by the Ducks, and may
have to take a pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   He has his home in Southern California, which fueled speculation
by tortured Duck fans that he will return. The Kings, too, may look
at him to boost their scoring, if the price is right. Of course, the
playoff success, and Selanne's part in it, could keep him in San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sharks have something besides money to put on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't beat the feeling when you're winning," Selanne said.
"Everyone is in a good mood, the practices are easy. It's like a
country club.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to win the Cup at least once. For the first 10 years [in
the NHL], I didn't get close. I want to win it, then you can think
about something else."</TE>
<TE>   Like another round of golf ... if he can sell it.</TE>

<HD>Stopping Webber Is Easy: Just Make a Banks Shot</HD>

<LD>In preparation for the start of the next playoff series against
Sacramento, and with the intention of helping the Lakers, I've done
some homework.</LD>
<LD>   Tyra Banks is 5 feet 11, with greenish-brown eyes,
351/2-231/2-351/2, and probably the key to knocking Chris Webber off
his game.</LD>
<LD>   The guy flipped earlier this season when the Sacramento Bee
mentioned the supermodel and Webber were an item. If I flipped every
time Salma Hayek and my name were mentioned together in The Times,
I'd never get a column written</LD>
<TE>   The guy is obviously emotional. That's why I hesitate now to ask
him about the "nude picture gallery of Tyra Banks," I found on the
Internet. It's my job, of course, to get to the bottom of things, but
it will make it awkward if Webber happens to ask me if I've seen Tyra
recently.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS WEBBER goes, so go the Kings, and they say he's playing some of
his best basketball right now. The Kings are 4-0 on the road in the
playoffs, and it might be time to have well-known Laker fan Chris
Rock redo a Li'l Penny commercial and put him on the overhead
scoreboard scolding Webber: "That's Tyra Banks, Fool!"</TE>
<TE>   Might as well tell him right away he's in over his head when he
gets here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TYRA WAS born in L.A., and everyone tells me she was a Laker fan
until she became an item with Webber. Wouldn't it be something if
Webber went up for a shot only to be stuffed by Shaq and then caught
Tyra losing control in the stands and cheering her hometown team. He
might begin to wonder if he'll ever score again.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, of course, has cowbells, so I asked Jeanie Buss, the
Lakers' marketing guru, if the team has given thought to passing out
pictures of Tyra, or borrowing my Victoria's Secret catalog, so the
Staples Center crowd has something to hold up when Webber takes the
court.</TE>
<TE>   I forgot Jeanie has her own revealing photos. I wouldn't want to
give Sacramento fans any ideas, and maybe take Phil off his game, so
let's just keep that to ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway I found a 5 x 7 "Tyra Banks hot sexy open shirt and legs''
on eBay.com for $2.50, and it could be duplicated and given to folks
entering Staples. We don't have to worry about them getting into the
hands of kids because tickets to Laker playoff games are so expensive
only movie stars and recording stars can afford to be here.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Stallone was in the front row Tuesday, and wouldn't it
be a hoot to see Rambo holding a picture of "Tyra Banks hot sexy open
shirt and legs'' in front of his face, and see what Webber does about
it. Or maybe have Jack holding it, and telling Webber as he walks
past him, "You can't handle the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Just trying to help.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN LINDSEY "I can't hit the ocean'' Hunter made a three-point
shot against the Spurs, they had to know they were finished.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SMELL of money reached NFL owners Tuesday in Houston,
prompting Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to appoint a five-man search
group to pursue every possible nickel in Los Angeles if it appears
the city is ready to land a team.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue said the league might add an expansion team, which is
why the commissioner should be hooked to a polygraph machine when he
talks. The league's stated policy is to maintain stability, so
appointing a five-man committee to look into putting a team in the
L.A. market without the mention of expansion would be a violation of
their stated mission. The fun and games are only beginning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MARK FABIANI, special counsel to Bill Clinton during the
Whitewater scandal, director of communications for the Al Gore
campaign, an advisor to Michael Ovitz in his unsuccessful bid to get
an NFL franchise two years ago and a paid image consultant on the
energy crisis for Gov. Gray Davis, apparently intends to continue
this hot streak and work with the Chargers now on obtaining a new
stadium either in San Diego or L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RECEIVED an angry phone call from someone identifying himself as
Harvey Millstein, some muckety-muck with the Santa Monica Little
League, ranting and raving about how the chief of police and the
firemen received individual attention from the Dodgers and couldn't
have been more thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked what this had to do with Tuesday's column about the
Santa Monica Little League kids who were left standing for almost two
hours while the Dodger brass appeared clueless, he said the column
was "offensive and inaccurate, and I was just looking for an excuse
to make fun of Shawn Green."</TE>
<TE>   He's wrong: I don't need any excuse to make fun of Shawn Green.</TE>
<TE>   The ranter and the raver, meanwhile, said the parents of the
T-ballers I talked with were the only ones upset with the Dodgers,
although I received e-mail to the contrary. He said he's worried the
Dodgers might not let the police chief and Little League
muckety-mucks, like himself, go on the field again.</TE>
<TE>   He said he's going to write a letter of "thank you" to the Dodgers
so the muckety-mucks remain in the team's good graces. He also said
he's going to write a letter to Sports Editor Bill Dwyre, I presume
because he has heard Dwyre has always wanted to go on the field
before a Dodger game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from my younger daughter:</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed your sexist remarks in the paper again, dad, and I'd
like to remind you that I got the money to go shopping because I
kicked your butt time and time again when we shot three-pointers for
money."</TE>
<TE>   Only way I could think of to get a girl to practice her shooting.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Japanese World Cup Organizing Committee (JAWOC) is taking
unprecedented steps to assure that the tournament is not marred by
radicals, extremists, hooligans or terrorists. On Tuesday, it
acknowledged that a team of agents from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation will provide some assistance at the May 31-June 30
world championship.</LD>
<LD>   "Japan has invited the FBI to help with ensuring security," a U.S.
source told Reuters. "They will focus on preventing terrorist attacks
during such as a high-profile event. It could be seen as an
opportunity for Al Qaeda."</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, JAWOC announced that it has rented a ferry boat to ship
any hooligans who disrupt the June 7 Argentina-England match in
Sapporo back to Tokyo, a distance of 500 miles.</LD>
<TE>   "We decided to use a ferry because we may have to deal with a
large number of violent people," a Japanese Justice Ministry
spokesman said. Immigration officials and armed Japanese Coast Guard
personnel will be aboard the ferry.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard on Monday held a drill that involved helmeted riot
police driving drunken hooligans to the upper deck of a ship in
Niigata harbor, where they were then doused by water cannons firing
from patrol boats and kept pinned on deck by a low-flying police
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Japanese authorities were thus occupied, Japan's team was
getting a lesson of its own Tuesday in Oslo, where Norway scored
three goals in a devastating 14-minute spell late in the game to
defeat the World Cup co-host, 3-0, and send Coach Philippe Troussier
scrambling to reassess his options on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Three-time world champion Germany also was dealt a reality check
when it was defeated, 1-0, by Wales in Cardiff. Robert Earnshaw
scored the only goal. Germany was without four players from Bayer
Leverkusen, which faces Real Madrid of Spain today in the European
Champions Cup final in Glasgow, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   In other games involving World Cup-bound teams, Saudi Arabia edged
Senegal, 3-2, in Riyadh, and Belgium was held to a 0-0 tie by Algeria
in Brussels, a result that left Belgian Coach Robert Waseigi
bemoaning his team's lack of pace and rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England lost a second potential World Cup starter when Liverpool
midfielder Steven Gerard was told he will need surgery to heal a
recurring groin injury. Liverpool's Danny Murphy will take his place.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sven Goran Eriksson already had lost Manchester United
defender Gary Neville to a broken foot. Newcastle midfielder Kieron
Dyer has been given until Friday to prove his fitness after suffering
a knee injury Saturday when fouled by Southampton's Moroccan defender
Tahar El-Khalej, a foul that has Dyer threatening a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   England is training in Dubai, where midfielder and captain David
Beckham said he finally is able to run again after breaking a bone in
his foot April 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Denis Popov, who had been named to Russia's 27-man World
Cup preliminary roster, had his hopes of going to Korea/Japan '02
dashed when tests revealed he suffered torn knee ligaments while
helping CSKA Moscow win the Russian Cup final on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa said in Buenos Aires that he
believes Glasgow Rangers striker Claudio Caniggia will have regained
full fitness by the May 21 deadline for Argentina's roster to be
named, but if not his place would be taken by forward Gustavo Lopez,
of Celta Vigo in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay captain and goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert is rounding
into World Cup form. The controversial and outspoken Chilavert told a
radio show in Asuncion that Spain, one of Paraguay's first-round
opponents, would not have qualified for the World Cup if it had had
to do so in South America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really easy to get through if you are playing teams like
Andorra, Liechtenstein or Israel," Chilavert said.</TE>

<LD>Coach Gregg Popovich sat his players in front of a television Monday
afternoon, popped a videotape of Game 4 into a VCR and pushed the
play button. Practice would have to wait.</LD>
<LD>   Forgive the Spurs for shifting uncomfortably in their seats as
they relived their fourth-quarter collapse that led to an 87-85
victory Sunday for the Lakers and a 3-1 deficit for the Spurs in this
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series. It wasn't meant to
be punishment, according to Popovich.</LD>
<LD>   "We faced our demons," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Popovich figured his players could learn from it, turning an
agonizing defeat into something resembling a polished showing Tuesday
in Game 5 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say to them, 'Bad break, fellows, let's move on,'"
Popovich said. "It was a tough loss. As much as it hurts, we know
this is a pretty resilient team. They're very intelligent, very
experienced."</TE>
<TE>   Getting smoked, 94-62, in the four fourth quarters of the series
before Tuesday was another "experience" for the Spurs. San Antonio,
making only 29.5% of its fourth-quarter shots, missed 15 of 18 in
Game 4 and squandered a 10-point lead in the final 6:15 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're professionals, we've got to bounce back from that," Malik
Rose said. "Our philosophy is to get back home alive. I think we have
a chance to win [Game 5]. We have won here before."</TE>
<TE>   Popovich was less concerned about the Spurs' shot selection than
about their confidence in taking those shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We let the players know that shots are not controllable," he
said. "We told them to let them fly again."</TE>
<TE>   What troubled Popovich more than anything was the Spurs' tentative
play at the end of the games, particularly in Game 3 and Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Our decision making down the stretch has got to be better," he
said. "The only thing that gives us an opportunity to win against
these guys [the Lakers] is better decision making."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's pregame session with reporters was far too early for
Popovich to answer questions about a much-anticipated
Laker-Sacramento King matchup in the conference final. Instead,
someone asked for his impressions of the Kings' 4-1 series victory
over the Dallas Mavericks, completed Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Dallas would give them a good run," Popovich said. "But
[the Mavericks] didn't seem to have the same flow to their game in
the playoffs as they did in the regular season and, especially, down
the stretch. Maybe Sacramento had something to do with that."</TE>

<LD>Imagine the furor in men's basketball if the top-ranked team in the
nation was sent to a regional across the country for its first-round
game while a third- or fourth-seeded team got to host its first
couple of playoff games.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Sue Enquist knows that probably won't happen in her
sport even though the No. 1-ranked Bruin softball team was sent to
Columbia, S.C., for its regional contests.</LD>
<LD>   Publicly, Enquist has been diplomatic. "Once you get past the
emotion of it, the bottom line is we're UCLA softball--send us
anywhere in the country and we'll roll up our sleeves and have at
it," she said.</LD>
<TE>   But privately, the Bruins--and others--were furious after pairings
for the 48-team NCAA tournament were announced Sunday. Fresno is the
only one of the eight six-team regionals being played in the Pacific
time zone. None of the eight top-seeded teams will play host to a
regional. Only Louisiana State is close to one, at Lafayette, La.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (50-11) is having its best season in years and
is a top-seeded team. But the Titans, who put in a bid to host, were
sent to Fresno in a loaded bracket that includes Stanford (43-18),
California (48-19), Fresno State (49-18) and Pacific (42-15). All are
ranked in the nation's top 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I was speechless," Fullerton Coach Michelle Gromacki said. "It
seems to me that the West Coast is getting attacked every year. We
seem to be moving in a direction where you're not going to have the
best teams make the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Orban, chairperson of the Division I softball committee,
said the NCAA wanted to keep as many teams from flying as
possible--even if it meant putting conference members together in a
regional.</TE>
<TE>   "Our [mandate] was to put as few teams in the air as possible
while trying to balance a bracket, while also keeping our top-seeded
teams with a realistic opportunity to advance out of their respective
regionals," Orban said. "We were told that this is the policy and
make the selections to the best of your ability and that's what we
did."</TE>
<TE>   Gromacki suspects the selections were based on saving money. The
NCAA pays the travel costs for all 48 teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand Sept. 11, but last year they talked about the money
issue," she said. "This year, they have a new excuse and a good one
to hide behind. What will be the excuse next year?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The USC and UCLA women's tennis teams, which split two matches
this year, will be meeting in the NCAA playoffs for the first time in
13 years when they play Thursday in a third-round match at Stanford's
Taube Family Tennis Center.</TE>
<TE>   Each team's victory came on the road, UCLA winning, 5-2, on Feb.
1, and USC striking back, 4-3, on March 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad that we have to play each other this early but I
think it's going to be a great match," UCLA Coach Stella Sampras
said. The match could also decide the inaugural Lexus Gauntlet
all-sports athletic competition between the schools. USC has a
55-52.5 point lead and a Trojan victory would clinch the title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine and UCLA tied for the NCAA West Regional women's golf
team championship Sunday with 54-hole scores of 883 at Stanford Golf
Course.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins made a big move Sunday with a tournament-low 288 among
its four scoring players.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Gina Umeck was the Bruins' top individual performer,
finishing eighth at 219.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Carrie Leary said balance has been a key to the Bruins'
success. "At the beginning of the season, there were a lot of lineup
changes," she said. "All the girls were getting well-prepared for the
key tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's Katherine Hull shot a one-under-par 215 for second
place, tying with USC's Mikaela Parmlid and five shots behind
Arizona's Lorena Ochoa. USC finished in eighth place and also
advanced to the NCAA championships May 21-24 at Auburn, Wash.</TE>

<TE>   George Jenkins will resign as women's crew coach at USC after nine

Athletics softball national tournament for the first time. The Eagles
(43-14) will play Oklahoma Christian in the first round Friday at
Decatur, Ala.</TE>
