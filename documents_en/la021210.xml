<HD>A compassionate mystery of madness</HD>

<LD>Anthony James, narrator of Victor LaValle's intriguing first novel,
"The Ecstatic," is a mess. Massively overweight, flunking out of
Cornell, mentally unstable, suffering bouts of dementia, wearing
nothing but shattered glasses, his hair "a giant cauliflower-shaped
afro," Anthony is unable to care for himself in his off-campus
apartment. Seeing three archangels on his stoop one day, he cries
upon realizing that his mother, sister and grandmother have come to
take him home to Queens. "Why don't you go put on clothes," Nabisase,
his 13-year-old sister, suggests.</LD>
<LD>   What follows is an incisive, if at times madcap, portrait of
mental illness as seen through Anthony's eyes. He doesn't know what
abnormality has claimed him, nor do his family members, but they've
all had experience dealing with similar oddness. "I sure wasn't the
first one in my bloodline to go zipper-lidded," Anthony explains. His
mother had previously suffered from an unnamed mental illness, though
when the story opens, Anthony tells us, she's now "sane and slim."
Uncle Isaac, too, had been afflicted -- until he committed suicide.
"So when they discovered me in that Ithaca apartment Mom and Grandma
recognized the situation. Their boy had become a narwhal." On the
ride home to Queens, his 93-year-old grandmother turns to Anthony:
"We will be fixing you."</LD>
<TE>   Anthony's family members try to help him, each in her own way,
though they feel blame, responsibility and anger. Their affectionate
methods of restoration are sometimes questionable. His mother, for
instance, tries to cure him with dietary adjustments, as if, Anthony
comments, "lentils were a natural antipsychotic." His sister urges
church. Ultimately, these caring women do not hold a cure beyond
love, and that isn't enough to fix him.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Anthony's experiences are not written in the
bittersweet way such subjects are usually handled. "The Ecstatic,"
rather, is gritty and funny, both smart-alecky and dark. The book's
poignancy packs a punch because the heartstrings are tugged so
infrequently, as when Anthony's teen sister, who's often the one
caring for him and their mother, says that if she could ask God one
question, she would want to know "why he made some of the people in
my family get so sick."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the scenes are highly comic but are never insulting.
Anthony dresses his 315-pound bulk in cheap purple or green suits to
go to his jobs cleaning houses and asbestos-contaminated commercial
locations. (Picture Ignatius J. Reilly, the unforgettable character
from John Kennedy Toole's "A Confederacy of Dunces," as a
Northerner.)</TE>
<TE>   Anthony makes friends with Ledric who, like Anthony, wishes to
lose weight but whose methods involve inducing a tapeworm. Anthony's
sister participates in beauty pageants, including the Miss Innocence
contest (open only to girls who have preserved their chastity) and
one pageant in which the winning ticket is not beauty but the ability
to claim a heartbreaking history of strife and hardship. Nabisase,
with her grandmother slung over her back, fabricates a tale of being
orphaned with only her ailing grandmother left as kin; she wins the
contest.</TE>
<TE>   There's the neighborhood loan shark who convinces Anthony to write
a movie script for a horror film. And a pack of wild dogs terrorizes
the community. We realize, as the story unfolds, that Anthony's
mother may not be quite as sane as initially thought.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, no one in this narrative may be quite sane. The
world Anthony inhabits is utterly surreal, leaving the reader to
decide if certain elements are figments of Anthony's fevered brain or
simply the lunacy of contemporary urban life. Or, perhaps, a
combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   In the context of Anthony's eccentric community, his mental
illness is not very out-of-step. With great subtlety, author LaValle
urges readers to see the madness that constitutes much of life as we
know it, even the idiosyncrasies of cities themselves. "I had been to
Baltimore once, that bipolar city," Anthony tells us. "On one block
was the moderately regal Penn Station, then four blocks over a
quadrant of desiccated row houses. The neighborhoods went like mood
swings, good to bad, horrendous to opulent, without warning."</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, LaValle, whose 1999 short-story collection,
"Slapboxing with Jesus," won critical acclaim, doesn't make fun of
Anthony's predicaments, though with all the laughs, there's plenty of
opportunity to do so. Rather, he brings to the writing a huge dose of
compassion. "Was there a way I spoke or looked that made people think
they needed to carry me with tongs?" Anthony wonders, as any of us
might on an off day. "I'd thought I hid my confused state expertly."</TE>
<TE>   Inscribed with a generosity of spirit, LaValle's brazen,
off-center tale transcends stereotypes to uncover the real calamity
at the story's heart: The confusion that marks the human condition is
not limited to those afflicted with mental illness.</TE>

<LD>The clock is ticking on Slick Rick's battle to remain in the United
States. Barring an unlikely last-minute reprieve from federal
jurists, the rapper will be deported to his native England by the end
of next week, his attorney said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old rapper, born Richard Walters, spent his 192nd day
in custody Monday at a immigration detention facility in Manatee
County, Fla., and awaited word from the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta on his request for a stay of deportation.</LD>
<LD>   "Rick is at the mercy of the courts, but it's clear that
[immigration authorities] are doing everything they can to get him
out of the country as quickly as possible," said Alex Solomiany, his
Miami-based lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Immigration authorities have sought to expel Walters under a law
that calls for the deportation of any noncitizen who serves more than
five years in a U.S. prison.</TE>
<TE>   Walters served five years and 14 days after a 1991 conviction on
attempted murder charges for a New York street showdown. He pleaded
guilty to shooting a cousin he said had been extorting money and
threatening Walters' family. Seven months before he walked out of
prison, Walters and his attorneys secured a waiver for him to remain
in the country, where he had been a legal resident since his arrival
in 1976 at age 11. The Immigration and Naturalization Service,
however, continued to pursue the matter and eventually had the waiver
negated.</TE>
<TE>   Walters has said that the confusing twists in his court case left
him oblivious to the fact that his name was on a warrant. Immigration
officials, however, were aware of his status and arrested the rapper
on June 1 in Miami after they came across his name on a cruise ship
manifest. He had been among the performers booked to entertain
passengers on a Caribbean voyage. Six years removed from prison, he
was back in custody for a criminal past he thought he had put behind
him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was devastating," Rick told The Times in a July phone
interview. "You believe you served your time for the mistake you made
and that you've rehabilitated yourself.... I don't believe I'm a bad
person. The whole incident was years ago. I've been out and six years
crime-free. All this now seems like an extreme measure."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous hip-hop luminaries have stepped forward to speak on Slick
Rick's behalf, among them music mogul Russell Simmons and
rapper-actor Will Smith. They have pointed not only to Walters'
peaceful demeanor and his family life in the Bronx but also to his
contributions as a performer. Often a cartoonish Lothario in his
lyrics, the flamboyant performer hit the scene in the mid-1980s with
his trademark eye patch and hits such as "The Show" and "La Di Da
Di."</TE>
<TE>   INS officials in Florida could not be reached for comment Monday,
but the government's case has been straightforward: Neither celebrity
nor character matters in the face of a law that is clearly written.
Solomiany said he also perceives in this case a broader trend in
which noncitizens with criminal profiles face rigid treatment amid
current fears of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to hear his case," Solomiany said, "they don't
want to hear what he or others have to say."</TE>

<LD>A few things got turned upside-down Friday evening at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center's Candlelight Concert -- entertainment
by Kenny Loggins came before dinner, not after, and the trees, well,
some were hanging tips-down from the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   But the numbers were right side up: The 29th annual benefit drew
nearly 500 guests and raised more than $1 million for center
operations and education programs.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving guests saw Segerstrom Hall lobby transformed into a
snowbank topped with snowmen and holiday trees. Pacific Chorale
carolers serenaded party-goers as they sipped cocktails and sampled
hors d'oeuvres whipped up by the Four Seasons Hotel for the gala,
chaired by Marsha Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   The concert by Loggins featured spirited versions of "Heart to
Heart," "This Is It" and"Footloose" and carols from a little-noticed
holiday album he recorded two years ago. "I wanted to keep it a
secret," he joked, "so I recorded it with Columbia -- and it worked."</TE>
<TE>   After Loggins took his bow, Elvis Presley's "Blue Christmas" was
played as the curtain rose on the gala dinner scene, a sea of
inverted white holiday trees suspended over tables spread with blue
chiffon and crowned with wreaths of ornaments and gold-filigree
trees. The gourmet fare included herb-crusted rack of lamb and baked
Alaska with brandied cherries.</TE>
<TE>   Center Chairman Paul Folino welcomed the crowd with news that
would keep them celebrating into the new year: In February, the
center will break ground on its new concert hall, the next phase of
construction in the expansion of the Segerstrom Center for the Arts.</TE>

<HD>Busy Bates does more than brood</HD>
<DH>The veteran British actor is playing eye-catching roles
that depart from the dark characters he was once known for.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They say that if stars survive long enough they get the good fortune
to play scene-stealing character roles. Alan Bates, the prestigious
English actor who held his own as the master brooder back in the '60s
and early '70s ("Whistle Down the Wind," "Zorba the Greek," "Far From
the Madding Crowd," "The Fixer," "Women in Love" and "The
Go-Between"), is a prime example.</LD>
<LD>   He's been ubiquitous on screen lately in a series of eye-catching
minor roles, playing the prim and proper butler on the verge of a
nervous breakdown in last year's "Gosford Park"; the debonair
neo-Nazi in last summer's "The Sum of All Fears"; the paranoid
scientist who can foretell disaster in "The Mothman Prophecies"
earlier this year; and the down-and-out Irish barrister and former
rugby hero in his latest film, "Evelyn," which will open Friday.</LD>
<LD>   As if that weren't enough, the classically trained veteran of
stage and screen recently earned a Tony for his powerful performance
earlier this year as an elderly and superfluous nobleman in
"Fortune's Fool" on Broadway.</LD>
<TE>   "There's only one actor I wanted to play Tom Connolly in 'Evelyn'
-- and that's Alan Bates," says Pierce Brosnan, who used his clout as
the star of the James Bond franchise to produce this labor of love
about a single father's unprecedented fight against church and state
in 1953 to win custody of his children in Dublin. It's a real-life
drama adapted from the book by the eponymous daughter and central
figure that stars Brosnan as the "unfit" father barely able to make
ends meet as a house painter and singer in the local pubs. He enlists
the aid of a solicitor (Stephen Rea), an Irish American lawyer (Aidan
Quinn), and a crusty old veteran of the court full of blarney and
bluster (Bates).</TE>
<TE>   "He's a lovely character and someone who's made certain decisions
about life," Bates explains by phone from England, where he recently
underwent hip replacement surgery. "You know, he likes the challenge,
I mean, he just enjoys that return to the fray. And then when he gets
on to this loophole in the law, he really feels he's justified
himself and that he's as good as he thought he was."</TE>
<TE>   The 68-year-old Bates, who hails from the Midlands suburb of
Allestree, Derbyshire, admits that Connolly is a bit of a departure
from his memorable assortment of on-screen martyrs, misfits and
malcontents. "No, he's not a brooder. But, you know, as you get
older, my God, the parts get more varied. There's a lot of fun to be
had doing a lot of different things."</TE>
<TE>   Bates, who leans more toward the instinctive rather than the
analytical when he's playing a role, says the thick Dublin accent
wasn't difficult to pull off. But he hates to think that he hams it
up in the role. "I don't like to think that's what I do, but I think
a character like that is larger than life. And there are those people
in life that you wish you could be like."</TE>
<TE>   Even Brosnan can't help impersonating Bates' lovable growl and
sharp gestures when discussing his co-star. "I'm doing great playing
opposite Alan in this impressive Georgian house and on an abandoned
rugby field, and when I see the picture I suddenly realize that he's
just taking every moment. And he has this lovely moment in the house
where he does a little stagger. And you know his character has been
drinking to his heart's content all his days, and that's what's
brought his professional world to an end. It's just the little
details of his acting ... like the way he [phrases] those 'howevers'
at the end ... so powerful and memorable."</TE>
<TE>   What Brosnan didn't realize about Bates at first was that he was
always in character, even when he appeared to be having an off day.
"But of course he's having a full-on day," Brosnan says. "He's
keeping the tempo of his character's life and keeping the inner life
going -- all calmly. When you watch him on screen and see his process
at work -- boy, what you see and what the camera sees are two
different things."</TE>
<TE>   Bates says his current string of small film roles is due to the
exposure he got awhile back starring in the off-Broadway drama "The
Unexpected Man." "Your time is limited, so you have to make an
immediate impression," the soft-spoken actor adds.</TE>
<TE>   Of his role as the servant in director Robert Altman's "Gosford
Park," Bates says he liked playing such a "locked-up man in a
conformist way with a lot of turbulence underneath." In fact, he
adds, the man is on the edge of alcoholism and is a conscientious
objector.</TE>
<TE>   "He's smoldering. It was a great company of actors and it's a very
rich film about human behavior. Altman is a wizard, a kind of Merlin
figure. He trusts you and he gives you the setting and the atmosphere
to perform."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Altman says Bates worked the longest and hardest of
any actor in the film. "He's the best. He stood in the background and
was tertiary, but he was there every day, very attentive, working
with our technical advisor on the finer points of being a butler. I
can't think of an American actor who could do that."</TE>
<TE>   With "The Sum of All Fears," Bates got to play a very nasty
Austrian fascist who orchestrates the bombing of the Super Bowl in
Baltimore. His charismatic Web-cam speech is particularly haunting.
"You know in many ways it's a fantasy that's very close to horrific
reality because there are such calculating monsters in the world. In
the end, you have to play with a bit of style and wit, if you can
find it."</TE>
<TE>   The brooding scientist in "The Mothman Prophecies," however, is
much closer to the signature Bates role. "In a way, his character is
not unlike the one I play in 'Evelyn' in the sense that he's opted
out and is brought back in by a particular case. And they're kind of
outsiders, the kind that people cannot deal with. And that's what
makes them interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Always busy, Bates has just completed a comic turn as a has-been
American movie star in "Hollywood North," a Canadian film directed by
Peter O'Brian ("The Grey Fox").</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for his next film and stage roles, the icon of the
'60s English cinema cites "Women in Love" as his favorite because
it's D.H. Lawrence -- and, well, they're both from the same region.
"It was great to be a part of such a classic period and I'm just glad
to keep working."</TE>

<CX>   "Evelyn" screenplay -- The screenplay for the film "Evelyn" was
written by Paul Pender prior to publication of a book about a single
father's fight against church and state to win custody of his
children in 1953 Dublin. An article in Tuesday's Calendar section
mistakenly stated that the screenplay was adapted from the book by

<LD>   "Right now, rock 'n' roll is going through kind of a dark period,
that's why you see so much Goth stuff out there," says Graham, who
owns Shrine, a Melrose Avenue boutique specializing in rock wear from
the dark side.</LD>
<TE>   Although he is clad in black -- from his zippered vest to his
heavy Herman Munster shoes -- tonight's creations are culled from a
slightly broader palette. "We have an industrial vibe where
everything is kind of raw and unfinished," he says. "But there's also
a lot of romantic stuff." Thus, the tight pink bodices for the ladies
and ruby-colored frock coats for the gents. There's even a -- gasp --
white billowy Count shirt and a flowing sun dress.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their first event I've been to, but I like their
clothes," says a blue-haired Deann Morales, wearing a black felt hat,
corset, garters and fishnets. "The stuff here is kind of a mix
between industrial and Goth." (As you'd expect, there are a few jaded
souls in the room, like the young man who disses the whole fashion
parade as "soooo 1996.")</TE>
<TE>   Off the runway, there's more than enough dungeon couture.</TE>
<TE>   In a roomful of New Rock boots, tight vinyl pants and piercings,
the heavily mascaraed Andres Diaz manages to stand out with his
towering pair of pyramid-shaped hair buns. "I'm a clothing designer
too, and I just like to check out what's going on," he says. It's
also, apparently, a schmooze-fest for the demimonde. "Everybody here
knows each other," Diaz says. "It all goes back to the clubs that
happen in Hollywood. Like Perversion and Dungeon."</TE>
<TE>   Not that that should frighten anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Peter Graham's show and party stress an industrial vibe.</TE>

<DH>Can rap star Tyrese's sly, sexy presence rev up 'Fast and
Furious 2'?</DH>

<LD>Miami</LD>
<LD>   "Did you know the guy who invented the hokey-pokey died the other
day?" asks Tyrese, a suspiciously grave look on his handsome face.
It's late in the day here on the set of "The Fast and the Furious 2,"
but as director John Singleton prepares to shoot a scene with Tyrese
and co-star Paul Walker, it's clear that the hip-hop
crooner-turned-actor is just warming up.</LD>
<LD>   "It was really sad at the funeral," he continues. "They were
trying to get him into the casket and his right foot was in, but his
left foot was out. And then his left arm was in, but his right arm
was out." Tyrese begins to do a little soft-shoe as he breaks into
song. "And you do the hokey-pokey."</LD>
<TE>   "It's 4:15 and Tyrese is awake," first assistant director Bruce
Franklin dryly announces. Singleton chimes in: " 'Rese is on set.
Let's roll!"</TE>
<TE>   It was pretty much at this moment that I felt Universal Pictures
could stop worrying about the most pivotal question facing the makers
of the sequel to "The Fast and the Furious": Was the studio crazy
when it told Vin Diesel to take a hike when he asked for $20 million
to reprise his streetwise tough-guy role from the original film?
After all, it was Diesel, Walker's original co-star, who catapulted
to stardom last year in the low-budget, high-velocity street-racing
movie that was the surprise hit of 2001, making $145 million in its
theatrical run and selling 7 million copies of its video when it hit
stores in January.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel may be more of a household name now, but Tyrese, who made
his film debut last year in Singleton's "Baby Boy," has just as much
rippling muscle, more tattoos (nine at last count), a wealth of
under-25 fans from his MTV VJ stints and silky hip-hop records, and
judging from the crowds of girls who materialize wherever he goes,
plenty of sex appeal.</TE>
<TE>   On the set, Tyrese, who's 23, and Walker, who's 29, have enough
chemistry to launch a small rocket. Before shooting a scene one day,
Tyrese impishly mimics Walker's surfer-dude twang, perfectly
enunciating every syllable -- "Oh, hello, what's up there, brother"
-- with Walker coolly responding in his best gang-banger patois:
"Hey, cuz, wass up?"</TE>
<TE>   In the film, where the actors play old friends who use their
street-racing skills to go undercover and bust a Miami drug kingpin,
Tyrese has added his own style of improvised humor. In a scene in
which the two both want to drive the same hot car, Tyrese tells
Walker: "Don't even think about taking the convertible. It might
loosen your mousse." As Singleton explains: "I have a lot for respect
for Vin, but Vin is like Vin. Tyrese is like a kid from the street.
He brings a real flavor and humor to everything. He's as funny as
Eddie Murphy ever was, but mostly, he's just cool."</TE>
<TE>   Also starring ...</TE>
<TE>   For all that Diesel, Walker and the souped-up cars brought to the
party, the real star of "The Fast and the Furious" was its ineffable
sense of cool. "Let's face it, before they saw the movie, kids didn't
know who Vin or Paul was," says "F&amp;F2" producer Neal Moritz, who
produced the original, as well as such youth-culture hits as "XXX,"
"Cruel Intentions" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer." "They liked
the cars and the lifestyle. The movie did $40 million on its opening
weekend for one reason -- it looked cool."</TE>
<TE>   But as anyone who makes products for fickle teenagers knows, cool
is a slippery commodity that melts away just as mysteriously as it
materializes. Virtually every decision Universal has made, including
taking a pass on Diesel, has revolved around the issue of cool.
Letting Diesel go certainly involved economics -- Tyrese is being
paid roughly $750,000, a fraction of Diesel's asking price. But the
film's budget is still twice the original's $38 million, with $8
million to $10 million alone being spent on an armada of 189
specially designed street racers. Even though Walker was signed to a
$2-million sequel option, the actor is getting $7 million, a reward,
in part, for not letting his ego get out of joint when Diesel got the
lion's share of credit for the original film's runaway success.</TE>
<TE>   In today's sequel-happy Hollywood, there was never any doubt that
"The Fast and the Furious," having spawned a new breed of maverick
action heroes, was a franchise in the making. In fact, the studio was
so eager to get a sequel going that it had screenwriters working on
two scripts simultaneously, one with Diesel's character, one without
him. As negotiations with Diesel wore on, the studio became convinced
that it would be impossible for the sequel to have any underdog
appeal with a $20-million star in the lead. (Case in point: "Bad Boys
2," which is paying untold millions in salary and profit
participation to Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, has also been
shooting in Miami for the past few months, but whenever I asked local
kids about the two films, all they wanted to hear about was "F&amp;F2.")</TE>
<TE>   When Diesel departed, so did the film's original director, Rob
Cohen, who joined Diesel and Moritz in making "XXX," which many in
Hollywood saw as a de facto "Fast and Furious" sequel. Universal was
unperturbed, even when Fox TV hastily put a "F&amp;F" knockoff called
"Fast Lane" on the air this fall. One reason the studio's confidence
remained high was a Teen Research Unlimited survey of teenage
moviegoers, which discovered that its respondents' all-time favorite
movie was "The Fast and the Furious," out-polling both "The Matrix"
and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Across ethnic lines</TE>
<TE>   All along, the studio believed that its film's coolness was rooted
in its multiethnic appeal. Although Diesel and co-stars Michelle
Rodriguez and Rick Yune have departed, the new cast hits as many
cross-cultural chords as possible. According to studio surveys,
Latinos made up roughly 40% of the audience for the original film,
one reason why Universal chose to set the picture here. So the sequel
remains heavily ethnic, with lots of Spanglish slang and Latin humor.</TE>
<TE>   When most filmmakers shoot in Miami, they swarm around Art Deco
South Beach; Singleton has been filming his street-racing scenes in
Overtown and Little Haiti. As he puts it: "This isn't going to look
like every Joel Silver movie from the '80s." Cuban-born actress Eva
Mendes ("Training Day") plays an undercover agent romancing both
Walker and his drug-lord foe, played by Cole Hauser, who first worked
with Singleton in "Higher Learning." Singleton cast Chanel model
Devon Aoki as a street racer and hip-hop star Ludacris as a race
organizer. The role of the film's top auto mechanic went to Jin, a
Chinese-American hip-hop artist Singleton discovered "doing freestyle
rapping, shutting all the brothers down" on a BET music show.</TE>
<TE>   Although Singleton's recent movies haven't been as well received
as such early films as "Boyz N the Hood" and "Poetic Justice," the
34-year-old director has a knack for discovering new talent and
coaxing good performances out of young actors. Singleton initially
wanted to direct another Universal project, a sequel to "Pitch
Black," but after Moritz and Universal Co-President Scott Stuber
solicited Singleton's advice on casting Tyrese in "F&amp;F2," they came
back with another question: "What about you?"</TE>
<TE>   Singleton acknowledges that he's a director for hire on this film,
which pulses with far more pedal-to-the-metal action than any of his
previous films. After virtually every take, he asks his script
supervisor how long the scene ran. When a dialogue scene plays for 49
seconds, Singleton jumps into action. "I know you can act, so don't
give me none of those pregnant pauses," he tells the actors. He turns
to me and explains: "Fifteen or 17 seconds is a long time to hold on
anything in this picture. You oughta call this my attention-deficit
movie."</TE>
<TE>   Singleton sees "F&amp;F2" as a "bubble-gum movie" but one that won't
insult the intelligence of its audience. When he spoke to a group of
University of Miami film students the other night, someone asked if
he'd been criticized for making such an "escapist" film. Singleton:
"Nobody can tell me [anything]. I made serious dramas like 'Boyz,'
'Rosewood' and 'Higher Learning.' I have a right to have some fun."
He laughs. "Why should the hack directors get all the good jobs!"</TE>

<KH>CABARET REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Spirited tribute merits repeat performances</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>It's hard to imagine what cabaret would have been like in Los Angeles
during the last decade without J.D. Kessler, manager of the
Cinegrill, and Tom Rolla, co-owner of the Gardenia. Parallel pillars
of support for the music, they consistently use their venues to
spotlight established artists and showcase new talent. They have been
-- and continue to be -- major forces in creating a viable cabaret
environment for the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday at North Hollywood's El Portal Theatre, a Society of
Singers benefit honored Kessler and Rolla with a parade of performers
offering often teary-eyed reminiscences and tributes.</LD>
<LD>   It probably was appropriate that the eclectic array of styles, as
well as the highly variable skill level, reflected the sort of
programming that one might experience on any given night at the
Cinegrill or the Gardenia.</LD>
<TE>   The highlights in a gathering that featured more than 24 starring
performers offered convincing evidence of a sophisticated California
cabaret community.</TE>
<TE>   Among the first act's most engaging players: the husband-and-wife
team of Karen Benjamin and Alan Chapman, revisiting their whimsical
Christmas songs; the quirky Cindy Benson, using a bizarre combination
of vocal prowess and physical comedy to make her points; the feisty
Elmarie Wendel, stalking the stage with the manic energy of a caged
puma; and musical director Todd Schroeder stepping out with a Jerry
Lee Lewis-like romp through Christmas blues.</TE>
<TE>   The second act offered a particularly exceptional opening segment
in Jason Graae's hilarious sendup of "My Funny Valentine," Ann Kerry
Ford's equally whimsical rendering of Monty Python's "Galaxy"
followed by a tender reading of James Taylor's "Secret of Life" and a
cabaret-defining performance by the gifted Jane A. Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Other memorable segments featured the youthful Maude Maggart,
whose talent and imagination offer hope for the future of cabaret,
and Keri Kelsey's touching view of "The Last Song."</TE>
<TE>   The four-hour-plus program, with singer Deborah Downey and Les
Traub as hosts, was, as one performer noted, the sort of event that
-- in its affirmation of the life and spirit of cabaret in Los
Angeles -- merits repetition on an annual basis. Maybe that's the
sort of thing that the estimable Kessler and Rolla can put together
on a partnership basis.</TE>

<HD>Like Santa, Coldplay and Beck deliver</HD>
<DH>They bring an energy that was sorely lacking to KROQ-FM's
Almost Acoustic Christmas benefit concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has been the most exciting year for adventurous rock 'n' roll in
nearly a decade, so you'd think alt-rock titan KROQ-FM's annual
Almost Acoustic Christmas benefit concert Sunday would have been a
four-star celebration -- a hearty ho-ho-ho-ho on the Santa scale.</LD>
<LD>   But the show at the Universal Amphitheatre came close to being
simply a ho-ho-ho-hum.</LD>
<LD>   The main reason is that several of the acts that brightened KROQ's
(106.7) playlist during the year, including the White Stripes and
Hives, weren't on hand, creating a serious void.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the hip-hop charm of the always dependable Jurassic 5 and
the punk-edged punch of the evolving Vines early in the six-hour
concert, the energy level was so low by the two-thirds point that you
felt that only a Heimlich maneuver could pump some life into this
baby.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Beck and Coldplay were in the house.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a busy two weeks around town for Beck. First, he and
Flaming Lips lead singer Wayne Coyne helped bring some holiday cheer
to KCRW-FM's holiday concert on Nov. 23 at Universal by singing such
oddities as Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe."</TE>
<TE>   Then the singer-songwriter returned to Universal two nights later
for his own spectacular concert with the Flaming Lips, mixing
heartbreak tunes from his excellent new album, "Sea Change," with
some of his more experimental early work.</TE>
<TE>   In a 45-minute set Sunday backed by the Lips, Beck gave us a
mini-version of the Nov. 25 concert, showcasing three songs from "Sea
Change," but mainly offering the earlier work, including the old KROQ
favorite "Loser." It was a dazzling display of energy and imagination
that represented the best instincts of both KROQ and pop music
generally.</TE>
<TE>   But Beck wasn't done. Before exiting, he and the Lips actually
tried to live up to the spirit of the Acoustic Christmas title by
bringing out a dozen folks in Santa Claus suits and animal costumes
while they led the audience in "White Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   To keep the merriment going, Beck then invited some of the
evening's cast, including Coldplay's Chris Martin and Dashboard
Confessional's Chris Carrabba, to sing Band Aid's 1985 charity song
"Do They Know It's Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   You'd think such lively holiday exercises would be a staple in the
parade of year-end, radio station-sponsored concerts, but they are,
sadly, the exception.</TE>
<TE>   Artists could show the audience another side of their musical
personality by playing an unexpected song by another act (as the
Vines did to good effect Sunday with a soulful rendition of OutKast's
"Ms. Jackson") or (imagine this) actually playing a holiday song a la
Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than let the energy level sag after Beck, Martin and his
mates in the English rock group Coldplay put on an eye-opening set
that showed how much they have grown as performers since their
engaging but understated L.A. debut early last year at the Mayan.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the band members were modest and reserved, as if not
wanting to distract from the thoughtful and personal nature of their
tales of love and longing. But Martin showed a confidence and command
Sunday that reminded you of the early days of U2, when that Irish
band reached out to the audience with captivating fervor. Martin also
earned bonus points Sunday by closing with a solo rendition of "Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Things would have been a whole lot merrier Sunday (and Saturday,
the first of the two Acoustic Christmas nights) if the other acts had
shown as much spirit as Beck and Coldplay. Good Charlotte played with
the precision that comes from doing more than 300 shows over the last
two years, but the East Coast band's brand of punk is so pop-flavored
that it has little to do with the legacy of the Sex Pistols and Black
Flag.</TE>
<TE>   Dashboard Confessional's sensitive, soul-searching exercises are
compelling on record, but they felt far less urgent or unique in the
6,000-seat amphitheater. When Carrabba plays solo, as he did Sunday,
rather than with his band, he needs to find a way to vary his
delivery so that everything isn't at the same emotional level.</TE>
<TE>   The audience seemed to adore Jack Johnson, but the
singer-songwriter's music, with its light blues and reggae touches,
was so undemanding that you wonder how it ever made its way onto
KROQ's playlist, unless everyone's caught up in his
surfer-as-musician back story.</TE>
<TE>   And, then, there was comedian Jimmy Fallon, whose hyperactive
rock-star routine and spoofs of artist-audience bonding aren't ready
for prime time. They lacked any real focus or wit.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything was forgiven during the magic of the 90-minute
Beck/Coldplay stretch, but that goodwill was shattered by a
performance by Creed that seemed jinxed from the start. Singer Scott
Stapp wasn't 30 seconds into his huff-and-puff rock-star posturing
before he realized his microphone wasn't working. The band had to
take a five-minute break to get things worked out.</TE>
<TE>   For all its life-affirming, spiritual tinges, Creed's hard-rock
style is so overbaked that the five minutes of silence proved to be
the highlight of the set. After a half hour, I gave myself an early
Christmas present. I headed home.</TE>

<HD>Arledge's exuberance recalled at memorial</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Roone Arledge was eulogized Monday by many of the broadcasters he
made famous in his tenure overseeing ABC News and ABC Sports. They
remembered him less for his accomplishments that transformed
television than for his exuberant approach to the business and the
people who surrounded him.</LD>
<LD>   Arledge, who brought show business to televised news and sports in
four decades at ABC and created both "Monday Night Football" and
"Nightline," died Thursday in New York of complications from cancer.
He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd that filled the Episcopal St. Bartholomew's Church on
Manhattan's Park Avenue included many of Arledge's ABC and Disney
colleagues and his family, as well as former New York Gov. Hugh
Carey, News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, Fox News Chairman Roger
Ailes, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, CBS anchor Dan Rather and his
predecessor, Walter Cronkite. NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol and
former NBC West Coast President Don Ohlmeyer, Arledge proteges at ABC
Sports, were among the ushers.</LD>
<TE>   "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel recalled how ABC News personnel
reacted when they learned in 1977 that the ABC Sports president, who
at the time was partial to an "open-necked safari jacket set off by a
gold chain," would be their new boss. "Clearly he was a dangerous
man," Koppel said.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his ABC News post, Arledge "showed an unhealthy obsession
with Son of Sam," Koppel recalled, referring to the serial killer who
terrorized New York the previous summer, and at one point Koppel
wrote a resignation letter, which Arledge ignored. But after a
private lunch a few weeks later, "I was in love," Koppel said. He
noted the way Arledge had of drawing people into his sphere, adding
that often "there was not enough of him to go around."</TE>
<TE>   "World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings, who had early on
joined Koppel in protesting Arledge's imminent appointment at ABC
News, said that "the man was no saint," but added that "had Roone not
been as interesting and complicated and compelling, most of us would
not be here." Arledge, he said, "made everything seem so possible."</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers included former "Monday Night Football" commentator
Frank Gifford; "20/20" anchor Barbara Walters; ABC News President
David Westin; Richard Wald, a longtime Arledge deputy at ABC News;
Arledge's son Roone Arledge Jr.; and Blackstone Group Chairman Pete
Peterson, who called Arledge the "Toscanini of television."</TE>

<LD>I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother.... She told me
her age, that she was thirty-two.... that they had been living on
frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the
children killed.</LD>
<LD>   These are the words of Dorothea Lange, whose camera captured this
photo of Florence Owens and her children in 1936. Lange found the
widowed mother of eight waiting for car parts by the side of the
road. Owens had been in California's Imperial Valley plucking beets
and was on her way to Watsonville with her children to pick lettuce
when their car broke down.</LD>
<LD>   Lange brought this picture of Owens, looking weary as her young
children hid their faces, to the newspapers. The photograph shocked
Americans, and the government immediately sent 20,000 pounds of food
for starving families, like this one, who had come to California
hoping for work during the Great Depression.</LD>
<TE>   Owens and her family kept looking for work, following the crops.
She was still doing field work at age 50, when she married George
Thompson and settled down in Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this photograph and others by Dorothea Lange at the
Getty Museum's exhibition "About Life: The Photographs of Dorothea
Lange," through Feb. 5. The museum invites children 12 and younger to
stop by the information desk to receive a free postcard of this
photograph. Family Art Adventures are Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m.
For more information, call (310) 440-7300 or visit www.getty.edu.
Parking reservations are not needed weekends or after 4 p.m. on

<HD>Speaking against war</HD>
<DH>A group of celebrities will issue a statement today
protesting an attack against Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 Hollywood actors, producers and directors will out
themselves today as antiwar activists. Mike Farrell, Alfre Woodard,
Ed Begley Jr., Tony Shalhoub and others will hold a news conference
at 10 a.m. at Les Deux Cafes in Hollywood to issue a statement
protesting the costs and risks of going to war with Iraq. Calling
themselves Artists United to Win Without War, the celebrity
signatories to the statement range from Gillian Anderson and Kim
Basinger to Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Stipe.</LD>
<LD>   Denouncing war talk in Washington "alarming and unnecessary," the
simple, five-paragraph declaration urges the disarming of Iraq
through "legal diplomatic means."</LD>
<LD>   "We are patriotic Americans who share the belief that Saddam
Hussein cannot be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction. We
support rigorous U.N. weapons inspections to assure Iraq's effective
disarmament," the statement reads. "However, a preemptive military
invasion of Iraq will harm American national interests. Such a war
will increase human suffering, arouse animosity toward our country,
increase the likelihood of terrorist attacks, damage the economy, and
undermine our moral standing in the world."</LD>
<TE>   The glitterati in the group will fill the talk shows and
entertainment magazines soon enough. This is the story of how two
friends armed with nothing but their computers and e-mail accounts
quietly rounded up some of the biggest names in Hollywood for the
antiwar effort.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Robert Greenwald (director of "The Burning Bed" and
director-producer of the upcoming "My Dark Places") started talking
to his buddy, actor-activist Farrell (of "MASH" and "Providence").</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it all to Andrew Card," recalls Greenwald. "It seems like
a lifetime ago now, but he said, if you have a product, you don't
release it in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwald recalls thinking the comment by the White House chief of
staff and former vice president of General Motors -- explaining why
the Bush administration would wait until September to make its case
for war in Iraq -- was outrageous. "I was talking to Mike Farrell,
saying, 'Did he really say that?' Here were people who were using the
language of the world we function in, only they were selling things
that were life and death decisions for an enormous number of people."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 2, Farrell and Greenwald set up a teach-in at the home of
Stanley Sheinbaum, the Democratic fund-raiser. Speakers included
Scott Ritter, the former U.N. weapons inspector turned peacenik, and
David Cortright, a professor in the peace studies department at Notre
Dame who also runs the Fourth Freedom Forum, a private research group
that advocates the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons. More
than 50 figures from politics and entertainment attended the
gathering, including Warren Beatty and wife Annette Bening, Tom
Hayden and Gary Hart.</TE>
<TE>   It was a turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "We began to discern the extraordinary amount of concern out there
-- and confusion," Farrell says. "We didn't pull that meeting
together to start another organization. But we realized something had
to be done."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks following, Greenwald found himself growing more
alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching the news more and more, and seeing one message,"
he says. "Even before the elections, it was being brilliantly done by
the administration. There were no other voices out there. The
argument was about when you bomb them, not if you bomb them. It was
about when you go to war, not if you go to war. The underlying
assumptions were not being questioned."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwald and Farrell realized that there are people with high
profiles and strong opinions who could speak out -- "and they happen
to be actors and actresses," says Greenwald.</TE>
<TE>   On the weekend of Nov. 15, Cortright and a group that called
itself the Win Without War coalition met in upstate New York. There
they crafted the wording that would become the basis for the
Hollywood statement.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwald and Farrell began circulating the declaration by e-mail.
They sent it to friends, business associates, acquaintances. It was a
low-key campaign, but steady. There were no political advisors, no
formal announcements, no fund-raisers. Word spread quietly, over
dinner tables, at preschool pickups, on movie sets.</TE>
<TE>   Some celebrities declined to sign, saying they preferred to wait
and see. But many leapt on board, telling Greenwald and Farrell they
were thankful finally to have an outlet to express both their
patriotism and their antiwar views.</TE>
<TE>   "Tea and I would love to sign the letter," David Duchovny replied
in an e-mail. "Tea was just saying at dinner -- 'We're going to be at
war soon and it's like we're just blindly accepting the drift ... ' "</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the current administration and the mainstream media are
bullying the American public into blindly supporting acts of
aggression," wrote Janeane Garofalo before signing on.</TE>
<TE>   At best, Greenwald says, they hoped to get 15 to 20 stars to sign.
Instead, signatures of support continued to pour in over the weekend
and into Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The statement has also been signed by some impressively titled
non-Hollywood names, such as Edward Peck, the former U.S. ambassador
to Iraq; retired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll; and former
ambassador and arms control negotiator Jonathan Dean.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles news conference will be followed by the release of
a similar statement by the Win Without War coalition Wednesday in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition worked hand-in-hand with the Hollywood group in
drafting its statement and orchestrating its news conference. The
Washington coalition is made up of 15 organizations, including the
National Council of Churches, the NAACP, the National Organization
for Women and MoveOn.</TE>
<TE>   Artists United to Win Without War also plans to run a full-page ad
in the national edition of the New York Times. The statement will
then be forwarded to President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an environment created after 9/11 where somehow it
wasn't patriotic to speak out," says Greenwald. "I think there have
been an increasing number of voices raised against war, but they have
not done an effective job of reaching TV, radio and the print media.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a way to get attention."</TE>

<HD>Working for change during a silent night</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether by act of God or geography, cell phones don't work at the
Mary &amp; Joseph Retreat Center. A few of the 40 members of L.A. Metro
Strategy who gathered there recently tried to get a signal -- one man
left the property to stand on the other side of the road -- and a few
others pumped coins into the well-marked pay phone, but most
surrendered to the fact that the world was no longer with them. At
least not in a buzzing, vibrating sort of way.</LD>
<LD>   Settled on the shoulder of a hill in Rancho Palos Verdes, the
40-year-old interfaith center is a place apart. Through gaps in the
borders of cypress and oak, one can glimpse what was left behind --
the faraway tapestry of Torrance and Carson, the spires of San Pedro.
But the air is 10 degrees cooler than in downtown L.A., and the
silence in the garden surrounding a statue of the Blessed Mother is
complete.</LD>
<LD>   In the adjacent conference center, the walls on two sides are
windows, and so there are sun and grass pressing against the room
along with the slightly burned smell of industrial-strength coffee
and a conversation about the meaning of "disinterest."</LD>
<TE>   The purpose of this retreat is to remind everyone that the work of
organizing is as important as the specific issues involved --
fighting secession, lobbying for driver's licenses for immigrants and
getting people to vote. Too often the problems in this city are
fought by hastily contrived coalitions that disintegrate as soon as
election day is over. The members of L.A. Metro, a year-old group
dedicated to supporting community empowerment, hope to create a
broad-based organization for lasting change in such areas as school
reform.</TE>
<TE>   They are here to examine their role as agents of change, to take
the step in the process of activism that many see as most critical:
evaluation. Because after meetings are planned and after meetings are
held, the real gains are often found in evaluating the process.</TE>
<TE>   And so instead of creating phone banks and drawing up "to do"
lists, they are discussing detachment.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Cortes, a member of the populist Industrial Areas
Foundation, a national network of organizations that helps
neighborhoods create civic and political gains and which helped
launch L.A. Metro, reiterates some of the whys and hows of
grass-roots organizing. He has introduced Aristotle and his concept
of philia, political friendships based on the "disinterested capacity
to be concerned about another's well-being."</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of relationship, he says, that allows organizers
-- he hates the word "activist," prefers "active citizen," a term to
describe one's involvement with the community, not legality -- to
trust one another enough to effect real change.</TE>
<TE>   People in the group immediately want to know how you can help
people you don't even care about. It's not about not caring, Cortes
and others counter; it's not about being uninterested; it's about
seeing a person in a way that is separate from one's self, about
recognizing someone else's needs in a detached way.</TE>
<TE>   As the members of L.A. Metro talk, the winter sun lowers and fills
the room with the butterscotch light of the Hudson River School. It
would be easy to wax sentimental about this moment, this group. A
glance around the room prompts the word "diverse." Here are pastors
Catholic, Episcopal and Methodist from Koreatown and Pasadena and
South-Central, members of synagogues in the Valley and on the
Westside, organizers from Pacoima and East Los Angeles, union
representatives and teachers from Glendale, Northridge and Boyle
Heights.</TE>
<TE>   But "diverse" limits the observation to skin color and place of
residence and in many ways is just wrong. Because each one of these
people is here, for 24 hours most of them, cut off from even their
voice-mail, trying to figure out ways to unite the divisions that
occasionally threaten to destroy this city. So how diverse are they
really?</TE>
<TE>   In a culture ruled by talk-show hosts and ad execs, it's easy to
gloss over words like "diverse" and "disinterest," easy to
sentimentalize poverty, racial tensions and those who try to end
them. There are so many big-screen images to choose from. And this
retreat could well be one of them -- the light is golden, the room
looks like an I Love L.A. ad campaign. It would be easy to lean back
into this place of silence and philosophical discussion, where the
gift shop is stocked not only with Bibles but with yoga mats and
focus stones, with 12-step guides to most everything, and think, "how
special this is."</TE>
<TE>   But here "retreat" is not a passive word, and the politics of
sentimentality are assailed. "We cannot operate from our fears and
anxieties," Cortes says, and neither can we be ruled by a need for
"warm fuzzies." Change, social or personal, rarely occurs in back-lit
epiphany. Change requires a lot of grunt work and do-overs and
discipline and conversations about goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tired of winning the battles and losing the war," one man
says. "We're tired of 'going down fighting.' We want to win."</TE>
<TE>   But there is no Norma Rae moment, no "I have a dream" speech.
Instead, there is much good-natured laughter, a fair amount of
"organizer-speak," including repeated use of the word "relational,"
and a primer of pulpit-styles.</TE>
<TE>   There is talk about time -- "Too many families are working two and
three jobs so there is no time for the children and the marriage,"
says Cortes; and space -- "We are trapped in the bubbles of work and
play," says the Rev. Frank Portee of Church of the Redeemer in
Compton. "Our paths do not cross unless we force them to." And there
is talk about the meaning of words -- "We think of the professional
organizers as the organizers," says the Rev. Ed Bacon of All Saints
Episcopal in Pasadena, "but we are the organizers. All of us."</TE>
<TE>   For hours, these people speak to one another and listen and shift
in their seats, getting up for coffee in Styrofoam cups and handfuls
of Goldfish crackers. One or two go outside to see if maybe this time
the cell phone will work. The sky turns black, and the only things
visible through the glass walls are far-off grids of light,
glittering like something spilled.</TE>
<TE>   They are here and they will stay because there is a deep human
need to talk about the things we share -- love and family and art and
work. And too often we forget to talk about our work, whatever it is,
about why we do it and what it means, about who we are and why. When
describing the point of an organization like L.A. Metro, Cortes
quotes Lyndon Johnson. "If you want me to help with the
crash-landing, then I need to be in at the take-off."</TE>
<TE>   Which could just as easily apply to a marriage, a product launch,
a day at the factory or a revolution.</TE>

<HD>Prudent decision for LACMA is a setback for the city</HD>
<DH>Delaying renovation plans may be the only alternative, but
it shows a failure of nerve on the part of the board and donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision last Wednesday by the board of the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art to put on hold its extensive $200 million-$300 million
renovation and expansion plans at its Hancock Park campus is all but
a death knell for the project, one of the city's most important
cultural initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   The museum's president and director, Andrea Rich, reached by phone
over the weekend, explained that the decision came after a series of
false starts in the museum's fund-raising efforts. The museum has had
to delay the public launch of a capital campaign because major donors
would not step forward with the necessary "quiet phase" seed money.
In November, voters failed to pass a bond measure that would have
provided $250 million for physical improvements at county cultural
organizations, including $98 million for LACMA.</LD>
<LD>   Local billionaire philanthropist and LACMA board member Eli Broad
said Monday that he had been ready to commit $50 million to the
Koolhaas project. "No one else had made that commitment," he said.
"Even if you got one or two others, what you end up with might have
gotten you halfway there."</LD>
<TE>   "It became overwhelming," Rich said. "At this point I don't see
where the money is. It would take someone to come in with huge
enthusiasm and put up a big chunk."</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes almost exactly one year after the museum
unveiled the plan, which was selected after a much-hyped seven-month
international competition. Designed by celebrated Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas, the winning scheme would have virtually wiped away the
museum's existing campus, a pastiche of mismatched buildings built up
over 37 years that many consider a civic embarrassment. In its place,
Koolhaas proposed a monolithic structure, with the museum raised on
slender columns and enclosed under an enormous undulating tent-like
roof.</TE>
<TE>   Rich added that the board will now look into other, more
affordable options, which would mean significantly scaling back the
museum's ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a little money for seismic rehabilitation at LACMA West,"
she said. "We could make it much nicer and move some programs over
there. That frees up space to do some program expansion and redo the
[existing] galleries. It's a much more modest look but doable in my
lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   On its surface, the board's decision may seem a prudent one. The
economic downturn and increasingly conservative financial climate
that has followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks make it more
difficult to raise money for major building projects. In New York,
the Guggenheim Museum has abandoned a plan to build a new
$650-million Frank Gehry-designed complex in downtown Manhattan
because of its financial troubles. The UCLA Hammer Museum has delayed
its planned $25-million renovation in Westwood. And San Francisco's
Jewish Museum has put off plans to build a new home designed by noted
Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind.</TE>
<TE>   But other institutions are pressing ahead. The Natural History
Museum of Los Angeles County, for example, had hoped to raise $98
million for its $300 million renovation project through the same bond
measure that was rejected in November. But museum spokeswoman Leslie
Baer said that the future of the project never relied on the bond.
"We went into it thinking it was a longshot," she said. "But the
project didn't hinge on the bond passing."</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum hired New York architect Steven Holl
last spring and expects to announce a final design team in January.
The museum plans to launch the quiet phase of the capital campaign in
a year.</TE>
<TE>   The deeper issue for LACMA, therefore, is a total lack of courage
on the part of its donors and the board. Koolhaas says that
completing the schematic design would cost the museum roughly $4
million -- $1 million less than was spent on the effort to get the
bond measure passed. Completing the design could take from 1 1/2 to
two years.</TE>
<TE>   If the board believed in the project, it could have postponed the
capital campaign but continued with the design process. The
investment would be relatively paltry, and it would have bought the
museum more fund-raising time. No one can predict how much the
economic climate will change over the next year.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sense of civic duty that finally resurrected the Walt
Disney Concert Hall. Seven years ago that project had ground to a
halt after costs spiraled out of control because of problems with the
working drawings. Today, after a renewed fund-raising effort
spearheaded by Broad and then-Mayor Richard Riordan, the project is
on the verge of completion, and it may well become the most stunning
architectural achievement in the city's history.</TE>
<TE>   In some sense, Koolhaas' design may be more important to the
city's future. LACMA houses the city's only encyclopedic collection
of art. Its location, midway between Santa Monica and downtown, makes
it a critical hinge in connecting the city's communities. As such,
its contribution to L.A.'s growing cultural depth would be far
greater than that of the Getty Center, a building that cost $1.3
billion and stands aloof from L.A., more of a quaint tourist
attraction than a place for vibrant cultural exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The power of Koolhaas' conceptual design, in fact, was that it
proved that a compromise solution would only add to LACMA's current
architectural malaise. Not only is the complex outdated in its
physical plant, but the muddled galleries make it an awkward place to
view art.</TE>
<TE>   All four of the other finalists' proposals in the LACMA redesign
competition preserved the majority of the existing buildings. All
added significant additions in an effort to give the complex some
cohesion. All failed. "Our alternatives were a clean slate, as
presented by Rem, or nothing," LACMA board chairman Walter L. Weisman
said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' proposal, by comparison, was remarkable for its clarity
and power. Its enormous, open-air plinth, pierced by grand staircases
and overlooking the park, would have acted as a lively public forum
in a city that has few. Its flexible gallery spaces -- arranged as
four parallel bands and housed under the spectacular roof -- allowed
for a level of flexibility that represent a radical reworking of the
conventional museum.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the design tapped into Los Angeles' greatest attributes
as a city--its love of the new, its relentless charge toward the
future. Its abandonment should be greeted with sadness -- and
outrage.</TE>

<HD>Drama adorns Waverly's holiday program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Waverly Consort's "Christmas Story" digs into the past, finds
great drama there and ends with a glorious blessing. Sung and enacted
Sunday afternoon in the soaring Gothic-inspired confines of Immanuel
Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire (and repeated Monday at the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts), the program told the
familiar story of the birth of Christ through unfamiliar music
ranging from the 10th to the 15th centuries, drawn from Spain, Italy,
France and Britain.</LD>
<LD>   The seven vocalists showed mastery in the range of styles, from a
jaunty 12th century song addressed to an ass bearing one of the Magi
to the grating close intervals of a 14th century English Kyrie. Often
they sang their difficult music a cappella. But a five-member period
instrument ensemble -- including wife and husband founders Kay Jaffee
and Michael Jaffee -- also provided bewitching support.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it was a burst of instrumental music that depicted the
sophistication and corruption of Herod's court, where the dramatic
conflict of the story arose: Herod's fear of another king leading to
the slaughter of the innocents. Here the concert became as vivid as
opera. Splendid irony occurred whenever characters addressed this
mostly forgotten -- apart from the Christ story -- royal with the
words "O king, live forever!"</LD>
<TE>   While the pain of the grieving mothers (sung powerfully by
mezzo-soprano Carolann Buff) was not easily forgotten, the final Te
Deum, sung by all the ensemble members, did much to alleviate it. The
pure tones of the hand bells they rang enveloped the audience in a
kind of benediction. The program was part of the Chamber Music in
Historic Sites series sponsored by the Da Camera Society of Mount St.
Mary's College.</TE>

<HD>Even angels flip for holiday bargains</HD>
<DH>Project Angel Food's Divine Design sale opened with a
celebrity dinner and ended with $1.5 million-plus to help people with
AIDS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside the airplane hangar, martini-fueled shoppers stumbled over one
another through vast displays of merchandise, dizzied by the
bargains. Everything, from the endless racks of clothing to entire
rooms of furniture, was half off the original price. For sale rack
devotees, this was heaven.</LD>
<LD>   "How do I get these all home?" Clarisse Shumaker asked
breathlessly as a sales clerk tallied up her purchases: four cane
chairs, one leather chair and a heavy wooden table for $2,000. She
frantically called out to her husband to pull the car around.</LD>
<LD>   When she disappeared into the crowd, clerk Lars Hansson noted that
Shumaker's purchase, while significant, was modest. Moments before,
he said, a man bought $40,000 worth of patio furniture. Shoppers move
quickly here because "by Monday a lot of this will be gone," Hansson
said. "Then it will be bedlam. They just rip things out of each
other's hands."</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday night, however, the crowds were just getting warmed up
for the four-day shopping extravaganza known as Divine Design.
Celebrities and supporters paid $250 each for first crack at the
merchandise with a dinner party, silent auction and fashion show at
Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hangar.</TE>
<TE>   The annual event, which began in 1992, helps raise as much as 40%
of the operating costs of Project Angel Food, a charity that
distributes 1,000 free meals a day to people in Los Angeles County
disabled by AIDS. "Giving people that dignity is extraordinary," said
actress Annette Bening, who, along with Lauren Hutton, was one of the
evening's honorees.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers come for the progressive discounts, which started at 50%
Friday. Prices are slashed by 90% on Monday. "We call it Winona Day,"
quipped actor Eric McCormack. By Monday morning, the event had
grossed $1.5 million, significantly more than the $1 million
anticipated by John Gile, Project Angel Food's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   While charity was the evening's goal, the celebrity element was in
full effect. Ubiquitous partygoer Lisa Rinna worked the crowd,
seemingly oblivious to the merchandise but keen on other actors
milling about. When she spotted Julie Benz, Rinna halted traffic,
sending martinis rippling in a crowd near the cosmetics area. "You
were so great in 'Taken,' " Rinna gushed, wrapping her willowy arms
around the slim blond actress. Benz, whose show is on the SciFi
Channel, smiled, surprised. Then, Rinna abruptly disappeared into the
crowd with a hand to her throat and a face full of wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was impressed by the layout of goods. Bobby Trendy,
best known as the custom furniture designer whose bedding was
destroyed by Anna Nicole Smith on her E! Network show, adjusted his
silver sequined scarf and complained. "The lighting shouldn't be so
harsh," he said. "It's added 10 years to my 24-year-old face." He
went on to urge an acquaintance to watch for him on Smith's Christmas
special.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of the Guns N' Roses tour, which started last month with a
cancellation and a riot in Vancouver, Canada, was on shaky ground
again after a Philadelphia show on Friday was called off, enraging
fans and pushing the tour's promoter to reconsider the viability of
the entire enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   By midday Monday, MTV was reporting that the tour was canceled and
word spread throughout the music industry that Axl Rose and company
had proved too unstable for Clear Channel, the corporate promoter
behind the tour. A spokeswoman for Clear Channel said an update on
the tour would be given today.</LD>
<LD>   A staffer at Sanctuary, the New York-based management company for
the band, said Monday that "everything is up in the air at this
point" but added that "there might be some changes to the tour, but
to say it is canceled, that is not the truth." The tour schedule
includes a Jan. 3 date at the Forum in Inglewood.</LD>

<LD>The controversy over "Barbershop," the film about a black barbershop
released in September, continues to simmer. Community activist Najee
Ali, the head of Project Islamic Hope, is holding a news conference
today to protest the NAACP Image Award nominations given to
"Barbershop" last week. Ali said he was opposed to irreverent remarks
made in the movie about civil rights icons Rosa Parks and Martin
Luther King Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The remarks were made by a character played by Cedric the
Entertainer, who received an Image Award nomination for outstanding
supporting actor.</LD>
<LD>   "The NAACP Image Awards has delivered a slap in the face to the
legacy of Dr. King and Rosa Parks," Ali said in a statement released
Monday. "Cedric the Entertainer should not be awarded with an Image
Award nomination for his disparaging remarks about Dr. King and Rosa
Parks. We should not reward buffoonery, cooning or disparaging
remarks against civil rights icons for a two-second laugh."</LD>
<TE>   Executives with the NAACP could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish director Pedro Almodovar swept up the top prizes at the 2002
European Film Awards on Saturday night for his movie "Hable Con Ella"
("Talk to Her"). Almodovar's intense drama about loneliness won best
European film in 2002 and garnered Almodovar best European director
and screenwriter.</LD>
<LD>   "Talk to Her," which opens here Friday, centers on a male nurse in
love with his comatose patient and the friendship he strikes up with
the boyfriend of another comatose patient -- an injured woman
matador.</LD>
<LD>   The movie has sparked some controversy for its sympathetic
portrayal of a rapist.</LD>
<TE>   Although most critics consider it Almodovar's best film, it failed
to win Spain's foreign language film entry for the Academy Awards
this year. "Talk to Her" lost out to "Mondays in the Sun," starring
Javier Bardem, about unemployed dock workers.</TE>

<DH>The story so far: Sarah, an Amish girl living in Ohio,
begins to question her way of life after Chelsea moves in next door.</DH>

<LD>"Have you talked to Mrs. Hewlitt yet?" I asked Mama that night while
we were fixing supper.</LD>
<LD>   "I have only said hello to her," Mama answered. "She is busy, and
so am I."</LD>
<LD>   "Chelsea says they watch television every day."</LD>
<TE>   Mama's mouth dropped open. I knew I was shocking her, but I
couldn't stop thinking about TV, as Chelsea called it.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen television?" I asked Mama.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not," she answered. "These things are of the world and
not a part of our ways."</TE>
<TE>   "But Chelsea says I'm missing a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Mama gave me a long look. I knew having fun was not a good reason
for doing something.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always asking about other things too," I said, "like about
our clothes and our buggies and why I don't go to Holmes County
Elementary School like she does. I don't know what to tell her."</TE>
<TE>   "This often happens," Mama said, "when people who are not Amish
move nearby. But we do not owe explanations to others. Just tell her
this is the way it's always been and the way it always will be."</TE>
<TE>   That was Mama's answer to everything, but this time it wasn't
enough for me. I thought about how I spent my days -- going to the
Amish school, being barefoot most of the time and feeling the cool
grass under my feet, helping on the farm and playing with my little
brothers and sisters. It was a fine life, but now I wanted to find
out more about how other people lived.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could watch TV just once," I said. "I want to learn
about the outside world."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Sarah get to watch TV?</TE>

<HD>On his team -- and on his case</HD>
<DH>Ben Stiller gets his writer pal Jerry Stahl to loosen up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Put actor Ben Stiller on stage with his pal, the hilarious but dark
Hollywood writer Jerry Stahl, and the comedy ensues, the way it does
in a buddy picture where the biting humor undercuts the most piercing
-- and revealing -- moments.</LD>
<LD>   Take away the quips, though, and during a Sunday-afternoon
presentation by the nonprofit group Writers Bloc, Stiller got right
down to the tough questions: How hard was it for Stahl to write his
critically acclaimed madcap memoir "Permanent Midnight" (Warner,
1995), about his days in the '80s as an ex-speedball-shooting junkie
who ruined a career as a TV writer for hit shows such as
"Moonlighting" and "thirtysomething"? (Stahl's drug habit also meant
that, at 38, he couldn't hold onto a subsequent job -- as a
McDonald's cook.)</LD>
<LD>   At one low point, Stahl told the audience of about 200 at the
ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood, he was living at Cahuenga Boulevard
and Yucca Street "in the basement of a crack house ... with no
power."</LD>
<TE>   "The basement of a crack house," Stiller repeated dryly, raising a
hand at eye level to indicate higher ground. "Not even ... ?" The
audience laughed; the tension dissipated.</TE>
<TE>   Stahl's memoir unfolds in much the same way, with moments of
self-loathing interspersed with irony and black humor. He writes, for
instance, of injecting heroin at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center while
his daughter was being born, and, in the same breath, recalls a
double amputee who still managed to get high with a girlfriend's
help: "Another triumph of the human spirit. But slap me if I get
sentimental."</TE>
<TE>   At the Writers Bloc presentation, Stahl radiated intensity from
the moment he walked in, unsmiling and chewing gum, wearing his
trademark all black -- this time, though, in the sort of short-sleeve
T-shirt that he couldn't wear when he had track marks on his arms. He
dropped his leather jacket on the ground and took a seat in a
director's chair next to Stiller, sometimes clutching his microphone
with both hands, looking muscular and healthy.</TE>
<TE>   After stints in drug-rehab clinics, Stahl, 49, who said he has
been clean for eight years, now is a writer for CBS' "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation" and writing a biography of Fatty Arbuckle, the
scandal-tainted silent-film star. His more recent book "Plainclothes
Naked" (William Morrow), a novel, was released last year. Stiller,
37, the star of "Zoolander" and "There's Something About Mary," had
played Stahl in the 1998 film version of "Permanent Midnight."</TE>
<TE>   The two friends, who both live in Los Angeles, also have
collaborated on other movie projects, including a screenplay
adaptation of the classic Hollywood novel "What Makes Sammy Run?"
("We're trying to figure it out right now," Stiller said vaguely, in
response to a question on the screenplay's status.)</TE>
<TE>   Stiller and Stahl, who hung out together before the filming of
"Permanent Midnight," each have such a sharp, quick sense of humor
that sometimes it's hard to tell whether they're joking. Stahl
repeated a story he has told journalists about how, about five
minutes after they first met and decided to work on the "What Makes
Sammy Run?" screenplay, he was sent on a private jet to St. Bart's
and remembers "eating Sly Stallone's leftover sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   "No, there was no private jet," Stiller insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't happen like that?" Stahl said. "No?"</TE>
<TE>   In a serious moment, Stahl talked about his writing philosophy,
based on advice he once heard: "If you write a sentence that makes
you squirm, keep going." Stahl said that he blurted out his memoir
"in a way that, being a discreet older fellow now, I might not have
written. It didn't feel like writing. It was sort of a slow-motion
literary boil lancing." Beat. "Not to be too flowery."</TE>
<TE>   An audience member wanted to know how Stahl dealt with the
reaction to his memoir. "When you've written something as intimate
and personal ... and something that's sexually graphic ... how do you
deal with it? And your kid and everything?" Stahl said he has a good
relationship with his 13-year-old daughter. "We've established she
will not read the book until she's 40, so that's taken care of," he
said. But if she happens to catch "Permanent Midnight" on cable, "I
could tell her I made it all up and instead of thinking I was a
junkie, she would think I was a liar. So I went with junkie."</TE>
<TE>   His full circle from Hollywood writer to junkie and back has been
surreal, Stahl acknowledged, starting with the fact that he managed
to get an agent and book deal for "Permanent Midnight." He had never
written about himself before. "It is kind of ironic," he said. "I'm
among the few people who can actually say being a junkie, destroying
my life [and] health and betraying those I love and everyone I ever
met was a great career move. I don't advise it, but it worked for
me." The audience tittered nervously.</TE>
<TE>   Long pause. "In-teresting," Stiller deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone laughed.</TE>

<HD>8 rules and 8 reasons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are at least eight simple reasons you can safely skip
tonight's, um, very special Christmas episode of "8 Simple Rules for
Dating My Teenage Daughter" (8 p.m., ABC):</LD>
<LD>   1. The series has been on for only half a season and the producers
are already trotting out a Christmas episode. You do the math.</LD>
<LD>   2. The show's generic brand of sitcom humor -- the popular
daughter, Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), yaps incessantly on the cell phone
with her simple-minded hunky boyfriend, for example -- is quickly
growing old.</LD>
<TE>   3. Tonight's highlight comes when the mom, Cate (Katey Sagal),
gets to sing a solo of "Silent Night" at her church's midnight
service on Christmas Eve, which is understandably a thrill for her TV
family. But you're not Katey Sagal's TV family.</TE>
<TE>   4. It's a sweet and heartfelt rendition, but true music
aficionados may be tempted to check out the Dixie Chicks on NBC or
Yanni on PBS.</TE>
<TE>   5. The episode's other main plot line is equally unexciting: The
dad, Paul (John Ritter), scrambles to find the perfect presents to
make up for last year's yuletide fiasco, when he bought everyone in
the family "I (Heart) Chicago" trinkets at the airport gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   6. That "I (Heart) Chicago" gag is the only funny line on
tonight's show.</TE>
<TE>   7. KLCS is broadcasting a Los Angeles school board meeting at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   8. Over on the Food Network, Emeril Lagasse is making squab with
orange rice.</TE>

<HD>9 lives, 3 terms, at the Capitol</HD>
<DH>"Sen. Kitty" has been a feline fixture at the statehouse
for more than 13 years. Now she's famous, thanks to Sharon Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>We are standing outside the Capitol's east door, early one misty
morning in December. Very Important People are rushing by, juggling
cell phones, Palm Pilots and coffee cups.</LD>
<LD>   Just off the pathway, behind a thick hedge, a shadowy figure
lurks, watching the human parade with a look of practiced disdain.
She has seen this all before, the hustle-bustle that accompanies the
dawn of a new legislative season at the California statehouse. She is
not impressed.</LD>
<LD>   Politicians come and go in this age of term limits, but one
constant remains at the government building with the big white dome:
Capitol Kitty. The People's Cat.</LD>
<TE>   For 13 years, this portly black feline has patrolled the political
sidelines here, tended by a loyal cadre of state workers who buy her
food and cart her off to the vet every once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   Now Capitol Kitty is enjoying a rare moment of celebrity, starring
in a children's book written by no less a luminary than the
governor's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Last week marked the official launch of "The Adventures of Capitol
Kitty." At a festive ceremony, First Lady Sharon Davis read the book
to some third-graders and spent almost two hours signing copies.
Capitol Kitty puppets were hawked as well, with proceeds -- from the
book and the toy -- going toward school libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Just up the street, the real Capitol Kitty seemed oblivious to all
the fuss, spending her day as she always does -- contemplating
squirrels, catnapping and eating.</TE>
<TE>   For the cat's devoted fans, however, the book and attendant
publicity are a big deal. They are buying up copies for friends and
relatives, and eagerly sharing anecdotes about the real kitty's real
life. Capitol Kitty has finally been discovered, and her caretakers
couldn't be more thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an icon around here," says Bernadette McNulty, a Senate
clerk who has the challenging job of catching Capitol Kitty for vet
visits. "We're all very protective of her."</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Wright, who runs a shoeshine stand in the Capitol, agrees
that the now-famous feline possesses a special something that draws
people to her. Not that she's drawn to them, of course. Wright, who
feeds the cat every day, says that in nine years, she has deigned to
rub against his leg exactly twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Not real generous with affection," Wright says with a grin. "But
I love her."</TE>
<TE>   Political animals</TE>
<TE>   It is not surprising that someone finally decided to immortalize
Capitol Kitty in print. Animals and politics, after all, seem a
popular combination.</TE>
<TE>   Former First Lady Barbara Bush wrote a bestseller about first
pooch Millie, and Hillary Rodham Clinton penned a tell-all about
letters written to her family's White House pets. Photos of
presidents and their dogs are a staple of White House imagery.</TE>
<TE>   California's first couple is currently pet-less, though Mrs. Davis
grew up in a household filled with animals and is a devout cat lover.
These days, she says, she's away from home too often to give a pet
the attention it needs.</TE>
<TE>   The first lady's first encounter with Capitol Kitty -- whom some
call Sen. Kitty because she favors the Senate side of the statehouse
-- came early in the governor's first term, when the cat appeared on
her office window ledge.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first and last time the cat ever came to see me,"
Sharon Davis says with a laugh. But it was inspiration enough.</TE>
<TE>   She has always wanted to write a book, Davis says, and lit upon
the idea of a children's story to help raise money for the Governor's
Book Fund, which buys books for school libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Like many first-time authors, Davis found the writing a struggle.
Her first draft was rejected by the publisher, Scholastic Inc., and
the second draft met a similar fate. Scholastic gently suggested a
ghostwriter, but Davis insisted she could pull it off.</TE>
<TE>   Her third story -- about Capitol Kitty's plot to scare off an
intruder feline she sees as a threat to her status as top cat -- was
a hit.</TE>
<TE>   The book has drawn favorable reviews and sold well, making a
second printing of 10,000 copies likely. Kids particularly enjoy the
disruption of official business during the cats' wild romp through
the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Said Shawn Ivory, 9, of Sacramento: "I like the part when the cats
slide off the table into the governor's lap. It's pretty funny."</TE>
<TE>   In Capitol offices, aides are chuckling as well, but not just over
the story. Some of the illustrations, by Daniel San Souci, bear a
striking resemblance to certain legislators, and aides have made a
game of guessing who's who.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Davis insists that the drawing of the governor is the only
one intended to look like the real guy. And she can't resist adding a
political aside: "It's a good thing Gray won a second term. That
picture of the governor in the book doesn't look a thing like Bill
Simon."</TE>
<TE>   A kitty with clout</TE>
<TE>   Like all savvy strays, Capitol Kitty is firmly nonpartisan. She
ignores Democrats and Republicans equally.</TE>
<TE>   But she is forgiven her aloofness, because she has been through a
lot.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, a trucker slammed his big-rig into the side of the
Capitol, right next to Capitol Kitty's favorite patch of plants.
Frantic e-mails buzzed through the statehouse, seeking news of her
whereabouts. A few days later she surfaced, hungry but unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after, Capitol Kitty came perilously close to death when
a bite from a male cat caused a nasty infection in her leg. Surgery
was required, and she now walks with a limp that seems to enhance her
mysterious allure. That close encounter led to a $300 vet bill, but
it was covered easily by donations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to generous supporters, Capitol Kitty has clout.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, someone decided her three cathouses nestled in the
shrubs were an eyesore and had them removed. Within hours, the cat's
fan club had put them back, and state officials well up the food
chain ordered that the houses not be tampered with again.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Hammer, a gardener who has tended the flower beds favored by
the feline for eight years, called the episode astounding.</TE>
<TE>   "That cat has some serious juice in this building," he marveled.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, the shoe-shiner, knows that to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm reincarnated," he said recently, standing beside a
15-pound bag of kitty food someone had donated, "I want to come back
as that cat."</TE>

<HD>Comeback in '03 Seen for Ad Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hard-hit advertising industry is expected to make a comeback next
year, driven by a rebound in the U.S. market, but there will be no
sudden global recovery, two leading forecasters said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   After one of the worst downturns on record, ZenithOptimedia said,
the advertising industry had hit bottom, and global spending on major
media was expected to climb 2.9% next year, with spending in the
United States set to rise 1.9%.</LD>
<LD>   Universal McCann's forecasting guru, Robert Coen, was even more
optimistic, saying he expected U.S. advertising spending to grow 5%
next year to $249 billion, bumping worldwide advertising spending
4.9% higher to $470 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "Continued modest improvement is now expected for U.S. and
worldwide advertising in 2003.... The shakeout in high-tech,
financial and dot-com spending has been a drag in 2001 and into 2002,
but the worst appears to be over," Coen said at the UBS Warburg media
conference in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, ZenithOptimedia said the industry would have to wait
until 2004 for a more sustained recovery, when it expects spending to
rise 4.4% as Europe kicks back in with a 4.6% rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising industry has shown tentative signs of life this
year after what many executives describe as the worst slump since the
Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. broadcasters have been the most upbeat, reporting a
significant resurgence in advertising.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts caution that many risks remain, including a possible
war with Iraq, weak European markets and the fact that a recovery has
been restricted to a few sectors such as automobiles and political
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Though the United States market, which accounts for nearly half of
global advertising spending, will lead the recovery, the U.S.
presidential elections and the Athens Olympics in 2004 are expected
to cement the rebound in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Appeal on Mass Asbestos Trial Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a Virginia court order that
consolidated about 1,300 asbestos product-liability claims into one
trial.</LD>
<LD>   One defendant, privately held Hopeman Bros. Inc. of Waynesboro,
Va., appealed, arguing that a single mass trial would be unfair and
would violate constitutional due process rights.</LD>
<LD>   The high court rejected the appeal without comment.</LD>
<TE>   In October, the Supreme Court rejected a similar appeal by
companies that said a massive West Virginia asbestos trial would
violate fundamental fairness.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia case involved more than 35 defendants initially,
including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, independent
contractors and insurance carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The claims alleged that workers from security guards to welders
were exposed to asbestos at Newport News Shipyard &amp; Drydock Co.</TE>
<TE>   Among the remaining 10 defendants are Amchem Products Inc.; Dow
Chemical Co.'s Union Carbide unit; Combustion Engineering, a unit of
Swiss firm ABB; S.B. Decking Inc.; Mallickrodt Inc.; C.E. Thurston &amp;
Sons Inc.; and Hopeman.</TE>
<TE>   Several groups supported the appeal, including the Chamber of
Commerce, the National Assn. of Manufacturers, the American Tort
Reform Assn. and the Coalition for Asbestos Justice.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fitch Ratings on Monday downgraded $9.3 billion of Calpine Corp. debt
two notches, pushing the troubled power generator deeper into junk
territory on concerns about the San Jose company's heavy debt load in
the face of continued weak electricity prices.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the Wall Street credit rating firm said the
outlook for Calpine's rating is "stable." Calpine stock slipped 12
cents, or 3.4%, to $3.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch cut Calpine's senior unsecured debt rating to B-plus from
BB. Calpine's outstanding convertible trust preferred securities were
lowered to B-minus from B.</LD>
<TE>   All of the ratings are below investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   The downgrade does not trigger any debt defaults or otherwise
affect company operations, Calpine spokeswoman Katherine Potter said.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine and other companies that generate power and trade
electricity have been hit hard by depressed electricity prices and
tight credit.</TE>

<HD>CKE Posts Profit on One-Time Events</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A string of one-time events, including a $5.5-million tax break,
helped the Santa Barbara-based parent of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's
burger chains post net income of $9.5 million for the third quarter,
compared with a net loss of $1.7 million in the year-ago period, the
company said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   One-time events aside, however, CKE Restaurants Inc. reported what
were essentially flat earnings from operations.</LD>
<LD>   Also, same-store sales, a key measure of a chain's strength, fell
5% at Carl's Jr. after five consecutive quarters of growth.
Same-store sales at Hardee's -- which the company acquired in 1997 --
dipped 3.5%.</LD>
<TE>   CKE shares closed at $4.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 20
cents for the day and down 64% since the stock hit a 52-week high of
$12.85 in April.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tax break, CKE gained $3 million from the sale
of most of its shares of Checker's Drive-In Restaurants. It was the
second consecutive quarterly gain for a firm that saw 10 straight
quarters of net losses before that.</TE>
<TE>   For the quarter ended Nov. 3, the company reported earnings of 16
cents a share, compared with a loss of 3 cents in the year-ago
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue was $312.8 million, down nearly 4% from the $324.8 million
posted in the previous year's third quarter, primarily because of the
reduction in comparable-store sales, said Steven Posey, the company's
director of finance.</TE>
<TE>   The company has resisted the temptation to join in the burger
wars, which have seen market leaders such as McDonald's Corp. and
Burger King Corp. aggressively push so-called value menu items priced
at $1 or less.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Puzder, president and chief executive of CKE Restaurants,
acknowledged in a statement that price discounting by competitors has
hurt sales.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the company has no plans to change course.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to revitalize Hardee's by focusing on a premium
product, when McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's [International] are
focusing on discounted menus," said Amy Greene, a Nashville-based
restaurant analyst with Avondale Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be slow going for a while."</TE>

<HD>Probe of Charter's Accounts Widens</HD>
<DH>The FBI is investigating whether the cable giant counts
nonpaying customers to inflate subscription figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Widening their probe into accounting practices at cable giant Charter
Communications Inc., federal investigators have begun questioning
program suppliers in recent weeks about the way Charter counts
subscribers, according to executives who have received the inquiries.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents contacted many of the nation's largest cable channels
late last month to inquire about how Charter counts customers who do
not pay their cable bills, as compared with general industry
practices.</LD>
<LD>   These nonpaying customers are at the heart of a federal grand jury
investigation into whether Charter uses them to inflate the
subscription figures that Wall Street investors rely on to value the
company. In addition, Charter has been hit with several shareholder
lawsuits alleging that the company used creative bookkeeping to
inflate the figures.</LD>
<TE>   A Charter spokesman would not comment on the FBI inquiries or on
the company's subscription accounting practices. Charter is the
nation's No. 3 cable provider, with about 6.7 million cable customers
nationwide, including about 500,000 subscribers in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis-based cable company, controlled by billionaire Paul
Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., has lost about 90% of its stock
value this year, and its shares closed Monday at $1.52 on Nasdaq.
That's because of investor concerns about the federal probe as well
as the company's $18-billion debt load.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the investigation, Charter placed its chief
operating officer, David Barford, on paid leave in October. Carl
Vogel, who took over as chief executive late last year, is expected
to undertake a broad housecleaning of the management ranks in hopes
of restoring investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The federal investigation, disclosed in August, has until recently
concentrated on questioning current and former Charter employees. One
entire floor of Charter's parking structure has been converted to a
copying center to replicate internal documents for federal
investigators. Charter also has cooperated with the probe by turning
over computer files from its regional offices, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The latest FBI inquiries come as program suppliers have been
raising their own questions about Charter's subscriber counts. These
numbers are used by channels such as ESPN and Fox News to bill cable
operators such as Charter for their programming.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to its programming suppliers dated December 2001,
Charter said it had overstated the number of its paying subscribers
for the entire year because it had included nonpaying customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company blamed the error on its spree of acquisitions and the
challenge of introducing a software system to track its expanded
customer base. As a result, the letter indicated, Charter had
overpaid the programmers for their services in 2001. Attached was
Charter's assessment of how much money it planned to recoup from
these channels through deductions from their future license fees.</TE>
<TE>   When Charter began implementing those deductions in April, many
programmers objected, saying Charter failed to provide any subscriber
documentation. Some demanded to audit Charter's books but were told
the information was not readily available, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   By September, according to the sources, Charter had dropped many
of its demands for reimbursement in the midst of the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   One high-level Charter official said the situation has been
resolved with most programmers, although many say the yearlong
dispute has caused lingering ill will. Some large channels also
believe they still are owed money.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to clean up Charter's customer accounting, Vogel,
the new CEO, this year began purging the company's books of nonpaying
customers, at least some of whom continued getting cable service. The
largest number came in the first quarter, when Charter removed
149,000 nonpaying subscribers. An additional 42,000 were removed in
the second quarter, and 86,000 in the third quarter. In all, about
277,000 deadbeats were cut, representing about 4% of Charter's total
subscription base.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how long the nonpaying subscribers were counted on
Charter's rolls.</TE>

<HD>More Pressure on Enron Banks</HD>
<DH>A Senate subcommittee is investigating deals between
Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and the energy trader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Drawbaugh</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking aim at allegedly deceptive tax and accounting strategies sold
by big banks to corporate clients, a senior U.S. senator was expected
to call for tighter regulation of a hot Wall Street growth area known
as "structured finance."</LD>
<LD>   At a public hearing set for Wednesday, Sen. Carl Levin (D.-Mich.)
was expected to propose that the Securities and Exchange Commission
and bank regulators work together to deter banks from selling
questionable structured finance strategies, a Levin aide said.</LD>
<LD>   Under present regulation, such strategies slip between the cracks
of the SEC's oversight of financial statements and bank regulators'
focus on capital adequacy, aides said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators working for Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations charged Monday that Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. -- both using structured finance-style deals -- helped
Enron Corp. hide debt and pad profit in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the deals -- known as Sundance, Bacchus and Fishtail --
were complex accounting transactions, whereas a fourth known as
Slapshot was a Canadian tax scam, said investigators for the
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "By concocting elaborate schemes of so-called structured finance
with no legitimate business purpose other than tax and accounting
manipulation, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase helped Enron deceive
the investing public," said Levin, ranking Democrat on the
subcommittee, in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Citigroup and J.P. Morgan were set to testify at
the hearing, as well as regulators from the SEC, the Federal Reserve
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the subcommittee's allegations concerning the four
Enron-related deals, both Citigroup and J.P. Morgan said that today
-- after a year of scandals that have hammered Wall Street -- that
they would not engage in such transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said in a statement: "Today, Citigroup would not approve
the transactions that have been under review.</TE>
<TE>   "Under a new policy Citigroup initiated in August, no such
financing will be approved without meaningful disclosure of its
impact on a company's financial condition."</TE>
<TE>   Levin said the three accounting deals "were nothing more than sham
contrivances that used secret agreements to make Enron look more
financially healthy than it really was, violating accounting
standards."</TE>
<TE>   Levin said the Slapshot transaction was "a tax scam, designed and
peddled by Chase to Enron and other companies."</TE>
<TE>   On the Slapshot deal, J.P. Morgan Chase spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau
said: "Each country has its own tax law. We were advised by two
Canadian law firms that this was legal and appropriate under Canadian
tax laws. While we don't think we did anything illegal or unethical,
from the standpoint of reputation risk, we would not do this
transaction today."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the subcommittee said lawmakers do not view
numerous post-Enron legislative and rule-making initiatives underway
at the SEC and elsewhere as adequate to stem alleged abuse of
structured finance.</TE>

<HD>Top RV Maker Fleetwood Reports Profit</HD>
<DH>Firm benefits from industry boom but sees continued decline
in manufactured- housing business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After posting losses for more than two years, Fleetwood Enterprises
Inc. on Monday reported a profit of $4.6 million, or 13 cents a
share, during its fiscal second quarter as the company's new line of
motor homes and travel trailers rode a boom in recreational vehicle
sales and rentals.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Riverside-based company said that its
manufactured-housing business continued to shrink dramatically, with
no recovery anticipated until the end of next year, as buyer
financing remained scarce.</LD>
<LD>   Profit for the three-month period ended Oct. 27 compared with a
net loss of $12.3 million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-ago
quarter, the company said. Quarterly sales increased 8.5%, to $641.1
million.</LD>
<TE>   The company's results beat analysts' expectations, but Fleetwood's
shares were caught in a selling wave on Wall Street on Monday, with
the company's stock falling 25 cents to $7.95 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "This quarter's results demonstrate the great strides Fleetwood
has taken over the past two years," said Fleetwood President and
Chief Executive Edward B. Caudill, a former truck manufacturing
executive who took control of the company last summer. "Management
expects that we will see further improvements to profitability,
particularly in the RV Group, following the seasonally difficult
third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest RV manufacturer -- whose brands include Pace
Arrow, Southwind and Coleman -- said that its RV group's
second-quarter operating results swung to a $17-million profit from a
loss in the year-ago quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sales shot up 33% on a year-over-year basis, to $395.8 million, as
the company's new-product development push began to pay off, industry
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fleetwood has been [increasing] market share in the last two
quarters" over such rivals as Winnebago Industries Inc. and Monaco
Coach Corp., said analyst William Gibson at Banc of America
Securities, which was the lead investment bank on $187 million in
convertible securities Fleetwood issued last year.</TE>
<TE>   While RV sales boomed, the company's manufactured-home division --
the second-largest in the nation -- reported an 18% decline in
quarterly revenue, to $234.4 million. Operating profit sank 74% from
the same period last year, to $4.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mobile-home sales have suffered industrywide partly because of the
lack of financing available after the closure this year of GreenPoint
Financial, one of the nation's largest mobile-home lenders.</TE>

<HD>Analyst Slams Shares of Video Game Producers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite record sales of video games, a leading Wall Street analyst
Monday downgraded the stock of four major publishers and sent shares
across the industry lower.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a possible slowdown in industry growth next year, UBS
Warburg analyst Michael Wallace lowered his recommendations on
Calabasas Hills-based THQ Inc., Santa Monica-based Activision Inc.
and Midway Games Inc. from "strong buy" to "hold." The new rating is
two grades below his earlier designation. Wallace also downgraded
Acclaim Entertainment Inc. to "reduce" from "hold."</LD>
<LD>   Early estimates of holiday sales suggest the industry is on target
to hit a record $12 billion in sales this year, up 20% from 2001. But
Wallace pointed to signs that the industry is headed for a slowdown.</LD>
<TE>   In 2003, consoles will be in their second or third years, and
consumers will start waiting for next-generation machines. Many
analysts expect consumers to cut spending in 2004 in anticipation of
faster hardware.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace also said a glut of new games this year is making it
difficult for some companies to generate substantial sales.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that returns from retailers of unsold games will
cause many of these firms to take a financial hit in January.</TE>
<TE>   None of the companies would comment on the UBS report.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Midway sank 15% to $5.70 on the New York Stock Exchange,
while Acclaim lost 16.5% to 91 cents on Nasdaq. THQ fell 7% to $15.78
and Activision lost 6% to $18.12 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The losses outsized overall market declines of nearly 4% on Nasdaq
and 2% on the Dow Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   Even companies that escaped the downgrade, Redwood City,
Calif.-based Electronic Arts Inc. and Take 2 Interactive Software
Inc., gave up ground, though their losses were less than the overall
market. EA shares fell $2.07, or 3%, to $63.95, while Take 2 lost 80
cents, or 3%, to $28.12.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street tries to anticipate things," said Todd Dagres, a
partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass., which has no stake
in video game companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom is that the market a year from now will
start to trend down because it will approach the end of its cycle,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Idun to Get $22.8-Million Backing</HD>
<DH>San Diego biotech firm creates interest with its
Nobel-winning cell death technology and experimental liver drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Idun Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego biotechnology company co-founded by
Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz, on Monday closed a private
financing deal that will allow it to begin testing a liver disease
medication based on the scientist's discovery.</LD>
<LD>   Idun said it raised $22.8 million from a syndicate of investors
led by Ventana Capital Management, an amount slightly less than the
$28 million raised by all San Diego biotech firms in the third
quarter in a tough venture capital environment.</LD>
<LD>   To nail the deal, Idun accepted terms that value the company at
one-tenth the amount it commanded in 1999 during rosier times for
biotech. Four members of the investment syndicate, which now controls
51% of Idun, took seats on the company's seven-member board.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Steven J. Mento said Idun will begin human tests
of a pill designed to prevent the death of liver cells in hepatitis B
patients. The experimental medication leverages on Horvitz's
breakthrough discovery of the "cell death" gene for which he won this
year's Nobel Prize in medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Horvitz, a scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
discovered a gene that, when activated, commands cells to commit
suicide. Idun's experimental drug is supposed to keep liver cells
alive by preventing them from throwing the cell suicide switch. The
drug will need many years of testing before anyone knows whether it
works safely in patients.</TE>
<TE>   Elliot Parks, a managing director of Ventana Capital, also of San
Diego, said investors liked Idun's strong patent position on cell
death technology, but required control of the firm. "This is a
recapitalization," said Parks, who joined the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the deal, Idun has received $100 million in outside
funds since its inception, with $38 million from venture capitalists
and the remainder from such pharmaceutical partners as Novartis,
which ended a collaboration in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Ingram Sees Revenue at Low End of Forecast</HD>
<DH>The company says weak demand for computer parts in North
America hurt sales expectation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter J. Brennan</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ingram Micro Inc., the world's biggest distributor of computer parts,
said fourth-quarter sales will be at the low end of its forecast
because demand in North America is "softer" than expected.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana-based Ingram Micro reiterated an estimate for profit,
excluding some costs, of $26 million to $29 million, or 17 cents to
19 cents a share. Sales will be at the lower end of the company's
earlier forecast of $5.75 billion to $5.90 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Demand in North America "is a bit softer than we originally
expected," Chief Executive Kent Foster said. Less-robust demand in
the fourth period is unusual because companies tend to spend capital
budget at year's end, said Robert Anastasi, an analyst at Raymond
James &amp; Associates Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still bumping along the bottom," Anastasi said. "This is
very much in line with the kind of things we're seeing" industrywide.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected profit of 18 cents a share on sales of $5.85
billion, the average estimates in a survey by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Ingram Micro fell 61 cents to $12.39 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   They have declined 28% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Demand hasn't weakened outside of North America, spokeswoman Ria
Marie Carlson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not seeing this type of softening in Europe or elsewhere in
the world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram Micro has previously said it will have extra costs this
quarter because it's been cutting jobs, closing facilities and
reorganizing operations.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's fourth quarter, Ingram reported net income of $5.7
million, or 4 cents a share, on sales of $6.14 billion. The company
said it would have had profit of $14.4 million, or 10 cents a share,
if some costs were excluded.</TE>

<HD>Bankrupt Stock Usually Loses</HD>
<DH>Despite UAL's initial rally, experts say buying the common
shares on the cheap is risky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For investors, UAL Corp. shares now may look like a cheap ticket. But
experts warn that taking this ride probably would prove costly.</LD>
<LD>   The stock rallied initially Monday as the airline giant filed for
bankruptcy protection. The shares opened at 64 cents, soared as high
as $1.19, then closed unchanged at 93 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks of companies in bankruptcy protection often are extremely
volatile, and big rallies -- at least in percentage terms -- are
common.</LD>
<TE>   But market veterans warn investors that it's usually a mistake to
buy such stocks on an expectation of a long-term payoff. That's
because shareholders go to the end of the line of creditors when a
company is reorganized or liquidated in bankruptcy, and there is
usually nothing left for them.</TE>
<TE>   What looks like a "cheap" stock is more than likely to be a
virtually worthless stock in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "The common stock almost always fares badly in a bankruptcy, and
with UAL that will almost certainly be the case," said George Putnam,
head of Web site Bankruptcy Data.com in Boston, noting the company's
massive debt.</TE>
<TE>   So, why did UAL stock nearly double Monday from its intraday low
to its high?</TE>
<TE>   Short-term speculators often pour into bankrupt stocks, looking
for a quick buck.</TE>
<TE>   There also can be another factor boosting such shares, at least
early on: Short sellers may have been buying UAL to close out their
bets on the stock's decline.</TE>
<TE>   It's a version of the classic "buy on the rumor, sell on the news"
trading strategy, said Russ Koesterich of State Street Global Markets
in Boston. In a short sale, a trader borrows stock and sells it,
anticipating a price drop and expecting to buy the shares back later
at a lower value. If the bet is correct, the trader pockets the
difference between the sale price and the repurchase price.</TE>
<TE>   In UAL's case, some short sellers sold the stock in recent weeks
or months, anticipating a bankruptcy filing. The number of shorted
UAL shares rose from 9.1 million at the start of the year to 25.5
million as of mid-November, according to the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, some of those short sellers were buying back the shares
to repay the loans, after the bankruptcy became reality. The buying
helped push up the price for much of the session, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In general, however, experts say traditional buy-and-hold
investors should steer clear of bankrupt stocks. If the shares' value
isn't wiped out completely as a company's assets are distributed to
creditors, at common stockholders' expense, the stock may wind up
valued at just pennies a share.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the stocks can bounce around dramatically while
awaiting their ultimate fate.</TE>
<TE>   After infamous energy trader Enron Corp. filed for Chapter 11 a
year ago, the stock soared from 26 cents on Nov. 30 to $1.01 by Dec.
5. It now trades for less than 10 cents as the company continues to
work through its bankruptcy case.</TE>
<TE>   After Kmart Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection in late January,
the stock swung as high as $1.55 within two weeks, and reached $1.78
in two months. But the discount retailer's shares have since been
marked down to 54 cents, as of Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Like Enron, WorldCom Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. and Adelphia
Communications, among others, Kmart still is working through its
reorganization plan, and it isn't clear what, if anything, common
shareholders will receive.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think, 'Gee, this used to be a $30 stock and now
it's at $1 -- how much lower can it go?' " Putnam said. "Well, it can
go to zero, meaning you can lose 100%" of whatever you pay.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in a statement Monday, Kmart warned that "holders of Kmart
common stock should assume that they could receive little or no value
as part of a plan of reorganization."</TE>
<TE>   In UAL's case, even many "value"-oriented money managers see no
value in the stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We look to take on risk in our Focused Value fund, but even we
wouldn't touch" UAL, said Nicholas Gerber, manager of the Alameda,
Calif.-based Ameristock funds.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber added that his Focused Value fund owns shares of regional
carrier Midwest Express Holdings Inc. and Dutch airline KLM, which
have relatively clean balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Said Shelly J. Meyers, head of Beverly Hills-based Meyers Capital
Management, "The only airline I would ever consider owning is
Southwest Airlines Co. They're making money when others can't --
that's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say buying the common stocks of companies in Chapter 11 is
among the riskiest games investors can play if the strategy is to
find a bargain to keep. But even as a short-term trade the stocks can
be tricky to read.</TE>
<TE>   One potential handicap is that bankrupt shares often are delisted
from the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, and end up trading in the
over-the-counter market, where price swings can be particularly wild
and market regulation is limited at best.</TE>
<TE>   "If traders are extremely nimble and lucky they might make money,"
Putnam said. "Maybe there is a secret, but I haven't figured out what
it is."</TE>
<TE>   Still, UAL is likely to appeal to rapid traders, just as stocks
such as Enron, WorldCom and US Airways Group have in the recent past.</TE>
<TE>   "These stocks can move 20% or 30% in one day. There are some
traders who live for that kind of volatility," Gerber said.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam suggests that with UAL -- or any bankruptcy, for that
matter -- individuals looking for a bargain wait and consider buying
the newly issued stock only if or when the company emerges from
Chapter 11 protection.</TE>
<TE>   That way, they would be investing alongside the creditors who help
craft the company's reorganization plan and who typically agree to
receive the new equity as compensation for debt or other obligations
they had been owed.</TE>

<HD>Isuzu to Slash SUV Prices to Boost Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling American Isuzu Motors Inc. said Monday that it will slash
suggested starting prices on three of its four Isuzu sport utility
models by as much as 14% in a bid to jump-start flagging sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Cypress-based car importer helped start the sportutility craze
in the U.S. when it introduced the Trooper in the early 1980s. But
sales have dried up as the firm has been slow to introduce new
models. Financial woes in Japan also caused parent Isuzu Motors Ltd.
to pare its U.S. advertising budget. As a result, most car shoppers
today are not familiar with the brand.</LD>
<LD>   A resurrection plan includes Monday's price cuts, an increase in
advertising spending and a restructuring that will result in the
layoff of 150 of the company's 400 corporate employees.</LD>
<TE>   Suggested prices for 2003 will start at $13,999 for Isuzu's Rodeo
Sport, down $2,376; $15,999 for the Rodeo, down $2,318; and $24,345
for the Axiom, down $2,190. The new Ascender starts at $28,649.</TE>

<HD>Kmart to Restate Financial Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brad Dorfman</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. said Monday that it would restate financial results from
1999-2002 because of errors in how it recorded leases and payments to
vendors, but it stressed the changes would not hurt liquidity.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not expect this restatement to affect our ability to
conduct business," Chief Financial Officer Al Koch said.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart, facing a Securities and Exchange Commission probe, had said
it would have to restate earnings because of other accounting issues.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January
after weak holiday sales and stiff pricing competition left it
strapped for cash, also said it has begun repaying lenders who gave
it the debtor-in-possession financing that allowed it to stock
merchandise for the 2002 holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, Troy, Mich.-based Kmart had $495 million of
borrowings outstanding and had used $330 million of its
debtor-in-possession credit facility for letters of credit.</TE>
<TE>   The company had $1.07 billion in debtor-in-possession financing
available as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the discovery of new accounting problems came as a
surprise, one analyst said it reflected problems under Kmart's
previous management, not the managers currently trying to fix the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "At least we know that things are being fixed at the new Kmart,"
said Richard Hastings, chief economist at Cyber Business Credit, a
New York-based retail advisory firm.</TE>
<TE>   The restatements will decrease Kmart's net loss for the first half
of 2002 by less than $100 million, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   They will cause results over the last three fiscal years to be
less than $100 million worse than previously reported.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Kmart reported a $1.83-billion loss for the first
half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In reviewing its financial results, Kmart discovered it had not
properly accounted for some of its leases, which will lead to an
accounting adjustment to reduce future rent, Koch said.</TE>
<TE>   It also discovered that it failed to properly record payments made
to one unnamed vendor because of a computer error.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares fell 2 cents to 54 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Labor Not to Blame for Failure, Some Say</HD>
<DH>Financing and operating strategies are faulted. But others
maintain that wage hikes ruined airline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Wall Street shorthand, what went wrong at United Airlines often
comes down to two words: labor costs.</LD>
<LD>   But was Monday's bankruptcy filing really the fault of greedy
pilots and unreasonable mechanics? Union leaders and at least some
industry observers say labor has been unfairly singled out for blame.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Gritta, a professor of finance and transportation at
Oregon's University of Portland who has followed the airline industry
for 30 years, said poor financing and operating strategies were the
real culprits in the airline's failure.</LD>
<TE>   United's debt is too high, Gritta said, largely because the
airline leases about 80% of its planes. That's the highest rate among
major airlines, all of which spend too much on leasing, he
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Gritta also said the airline's traditional hub-and-spoke operation
is far more costly than point-to-point strategies used by smaller,
more successful competitors such as Southwest. Other major airlines
have made the same tactical error and are in trouble because of it,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wages don't even factor into Gritta's equation. "So a pilot makes
$250,000 a year. I don't begrudge them that," he said. "They have a
special skill, and if you have a family, you give up a certain
amount. Maybe you could argue they're overpaid, but that's not the
cause" of the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor of labor history at UC Santa
Barbara, said the focus on labor costs is partly pragmatic: They can
be reduced quickly and relatively easily at a time of crisis, unlike
fuel prices or leasing expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But he said concern over high pilot salaries fits into a larger
ideological trend, also demonstrated in the recent longshore labor
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when unionization is the exception, a highly paid union
worker is seen as completely egregious and weird," he said. "It's
like the nail sticking out of the wood. The inclination is to smash
it."</TE>
<TE>   Many airline analysts and consultants argue otherwise, however.
They note that labor compensation at United has risen dramatically
over the last decade and now accounts for 43.2% of operating costs.
That's the highest in the industry, although only a percentage point
or two above most other airlines. (American Airlines is No. 2 at
42.9%.)</TE>
<TE>   United employs about 82,700 workers, some 23,000 of them in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Line Pilots Assn., which won industry-leading salaries for
United pilots two years ago after staging disruptive job actions, is
viewed as particularly burdensome -- pushing for compensation
packages that critics say ensure red ink.</TE>
<TE>   "That compounded an already existing cost problem, and it also
polluted the industry" by encouraging other unions to demand wage
hikes, said Jon Ash, president of the Washington-based consulting
firm Global Aviation Associates. Pilot wages at United since have
been surpassed by those at Delta.</TE>
<TE>   Wages, which run into the $200,000-to-$300,000 range for veteran
pilots who work international flights, tell only part of the story.
Total costs also are raised by work rules and benefits that allow
full-time pilots to fly as few as 55 hours per month.</TE>
<TE>   Ash noted that under United's employee stock ownership plan,
pilots controlled 25% of the company's shares and had a seat on its
board. Thus they were partly responsible for approving the wage
increases that he maintains ruined the company. "The pilots drove the
stake into their own hearts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   United's pilots were the first employee group that agreed to 18%
cuts in pay to avoid Bankruptcy Court, but Ash said at least a 25%
drop is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics, represented by the International Assn. of Machinists,
followed the pilots with their own lucrative contract, under which a
seasoned mechanic can earn about $70,000 a year with generous medical
and retirement benefits. Mechanics were set to vote on a proposed 7%
wage cut to save the company. But they canceled the vote last week
when the federal government refused to guarantee a $1.8-billion loan,
triggering the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Flight attendants are by far the lowest-paid union group at the
airline, with veteran employees earning on average $32,000 a year.
Represented by the Assn. of Flight Attendants, the 24,000 employees
operate under a contract that automatically raises their pay to the
industry average. Trying to avoid a bankruptcy filing, the union had
agreed to a pay cut 4% below that level.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the differences in pay, AFA officials defended the pilots'
wages, noting that they were negotiated when United was highly
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really handy to be able to point to the pilots," said AFA
spokeswoman Sara Dela Cruz. "But if you start pointing at the pilots,
the next step is the mechanics and then the flight attendants and
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Employees unfairly are being asked to pay for poor management
decisions made during the last decade by executives who left the
company with lucrative severance packages, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to give and give," Dela Cruz said. "I wonder what
would be enough. Would minimum wage be enough?"</TE>
<TE>   Pay cuts almost certainly will be more severe as the firm moves
through Bankruptcy Court, and employee groups have signaled that they
are willing to accept more to keep the airline alive. Unionized
employees at other troubled airlines are watching closely, concerned
that their contracts could be next.</TE>
<TE>   "We question whether any airline can just cut its way to profit
and success," said Gregg Overman, communications director at the
Allied Pilots Assn., which represents American Airlines employees,
who recently were asked to accept wage freezes for the next year.
"There are more fundamental issues to be addressed than just trying
to squeeze the labor groups."</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Extends Last Week's Decline</HD>
<DH>Nasdaq plunges nearly 4%. Shares are caught up in the
turbulence from UAL's bankruptcy filing and an IBM downgrade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s bankruptcy filing and a brokerage downgrade of IBM shares
put investors in a dark mood as they began the week Monday, sending
stocks sharply lower.</LD>
<LD>   Key indexes suffered their steepest losses in four weeks, as the
decline that began last week accelerated.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average sank 172.36 points, or 2%, to
8,473.41.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index slid 55.30 points, or 3.9%, to
1,367.14.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's choice of John W. Snow, chief executive of
railroad operator CSX Corp., to be Treasury secretary failed to
extend the modest gain in stocks after Paul H. O'Neill's resignation
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't know who Snow is," said James McGlynn, who
helps manage $5.7 billion at Summit Investment Partners in
Cincinnati. He is "untested."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors remain jittery about the prospect of war with
Iraq, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 24 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 25 to 9 on Nasdaq. Trading volume was about on par with
Friday's levels.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said the pullback over the last week isn't
surprising, given the heady gains in many stocks since early October.</TE>
<TE>   The losses Monday pushed the Dow back to where it was on Nov. 19.
Nasdaq is back to levels last seen on Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say many investors are still largely upbeat despite
recent declines and should bid stocks higher by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "December is usually one of the market's strongest months, but
it's usually the last week and a half that we see the gains," said
Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden &amp; Co. in Greenwich,
Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after we finish this consolidation, stocks should be set
up for some type of year-end rally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others warned that some investors may have gotten too excited
about the potential for corporate earnings gains in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a low-growth environment where earnings expectations
still need to be adjusted down," said Richard Turgeon, director of
research at Victory Capital Management, which manages $65 billion in
Cleveland. The firm has been selling retail, technology and auto
stocks in the last two weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, IBM shed $2.73 to $79.59. Banc of America Securities
analyst Joel Wagonfeld said the stock trades at the high end of its
historical valuation range after a 50% rally in two months.</TE>
<TE>   Wagonfeld cut his rating to "market perform" from "in-line" and
reduced his 2003 revenue estimate by 3%, to $87 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Airline stocks were mostly lower after UAL's bankruptcy filing,
even though it had been expected. Continental dropped 65 cents to
$8.10, Delta lost 99 cents to $12.41 and Southwest fell 26 cents to
$16.</TE>
<TE>   Among suppliers to airlines, Boeing was off $1 to $32.40 and
United Technologies slumped $1.41 to $60.60.</TE>
<TE>   As the market slid, some investors turned to Treasury securities.
The yield on the 10-year T-note fell to 4.03% from 4.09% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The economy will "recover but probably at a slower pace than what
a lot of people would like," said Fred Engimann, who helps manage $17
billion at Chicago Capital Management. "Anticipation that things are
not going to be as rosy as stocks had priced in during their rally a
few weeks ago" is helping Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   Economic growth probably will slow to a 1.6% annual pace this
quarter from a 4% pace in the third quarter, according to the
November Blue Chip Economic indicators survey.</TE>
<TE>   The economy will expand by 2.8% next year after growth of 2.4% in
2002, according to the median forecast of economists belonging to the
Bond Market Assn.'s Economic Advisory Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Gold eased after gaining last week. Near-term futures slipped 50
cents to $325.80 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will be intently studying this week's economic reports
for clues to the economy's next move, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Federal Reserve meets, but policymakers aren't expected
to make changes in their benchmark interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Qualcomm slid $2.29 to $39.19. Salomon Smith Barney analyst T.C.
Robillard Jr. cut his rating on the owner of patents for mobile
telephones to "in line" from "outperform." He cited concern that
share gains have outstripped earnings potential.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm has climbed 40% since Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   * Software shares including Microsoft and Oracle declined after
Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation on the industry to
"cautious" from "in line," citing concerns about valuation.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Charles Phillips said a recovery in the industry is likely
to be "mild" and license growth will be little changed next year.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, the biggest software maker, lost $1.94 to $53.53.
Oracle, the third-largest software maker, dropped 75 cents to $10.53.
Siebel Systems, the biggest maker of programs to automate customer
service, slid 62 cents to $7.68.</TE>
<TE>   * Wal-Mart dropped $1.19 to $51.85. The retailer said sales last
week at stores open at least a year increased about 3%, at the low
end of expectations.</TE>

<HD>'Preferred' Can Be a Relative Term With Stock Issues</HD>
<DH>As in any bankruptcy case, all UAL equity holders will find
themselves at the end of a long line of creditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, many income-hungry investors have been attracted to
so-called preferred shares of major companies. The appeal is the
often high dividends the stocks pay and the fact that investors in
these shares usually have a greater claim on company assets, in the
event of a bankruptcy filing, than common shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   But as owners of about 6 million UAL Corp. preferred shares have
found, "preferred" can be a relative term.</LD>
<LD>   The airline giant's two preferred issues have plunged in price in
recent months, as investors have anticipated the company's Chapter 11
filing. Both of the stocks were trading near $1 on Monday, down from
about $20 in June, according to Bloomberg News data.</LD>
<TE>   Here are answers to some questions preferred shareholders may
have:</TE>
<TE>   Question: Where do preferred holders stand on the bankruptcy
priority list? Who gets paid before and after them?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There are three categories of debtors in a corporate
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Secured creditors -- in this case, mainly banks that hold liens on
UAL assets such as airplanes and terminal slips -- would be paid
first.</TE>
<TE>   Unsecured creditors, such as suppliers of fuel, food and other
services to the company, are in the second slot. Holders of some
types of preferred stock also fall into this category.</TE>
<TE>   The final group is made up of equity security holders -- the
holders of UAL's common stock, and sometimes preferred stock. They
are at the bottom of the heap, though preferred holders rank above
common holders.</TE>
<TE>   Equity owners, if they're not wiped out completely in the
bankruptcy proceedings, are likely to have their interests
drastically diluted, said Jack Williams, professor of bankruptcy law
at Georgia State University College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How are UAL's preferred stocks structured?</TE>
<TE>   A: UAL has two distinct types of preferred shares outstanding. It
has about 3 million Series B preferred shares and an additional 3
million in Trust Originated Preferred Securities.</TE>
<TE>   The Series B preferred is structured more like equity, according
to company representatives. The so-called TOPS shares are structured
more like debt.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does that mean that the TOPS holders will get paid and the
Series B holders won't?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not necessarily. The final determination about whether a
preferred share is considered debt or equity will be up to the
presiding Bankruptcy Court judge, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge will look at myriad factors to decide how to classify
UAL preferred. Generally, preferred shares are classified as equity
if the preferred holder is able to vote on directors and other issues
relating to the company's governance or is able to somehow
participate in the company's profits.</TE>
<TE>   Preferred stock usually is classified as debt if it pays a set
rate of return, the holders are not given a vote in company matters
and do not have a representative on the board, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happens to the dividends owed to UAL preferred
shareholders?</TE>
<TE>   A: UAL suspended dividend payments on its Series B preferred,
which had paid $3.06 a share annually, in September and "extended"
payment of the Dec. 31 dividend on its TOPS preferred, paying $3.31
annually, until March 31.</TE>
<TE>   UAL representatives on Monday could not say whether the TOPS
quarterly payment would be made in March or if it would be postponed
again. Under the terms of the initial offering of the securities, the
company can postpone TOPS dividend payments up to 20 consecutive
quarters -- five years total.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there any downside to owning TOPS shares compared with UAL's
Series B preferred?</TE>
<TE>   A: Just one: TOPS owners are likely to get tax statements showing
that UAL "accrued" the Dec. 31 quarterly dividend payment on
shareholders' behalf, even though it wasn't paid in cash. That makes
the unpaid but accrued amount taxable on 2002 tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   If UAL ultimately fails to make the payment owed, shareholders
would be able on future tax returns to claim a loss for the unpaid
dividend income.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Series B dividends, the payments don't accrue;
they are paid at the discretion of UAL's board.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What arrangement could United make to repay preferred
shareholders?</TE>
<TE>   A: In many bankruptcy cases, bondholders are offered a combination
of cash and stock in the reorganized entity in exchange for their
debt.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't known whether holders of either of UAL's preferred
issues would eventually be offered an equity stake in the reorganized
company.</TE>

<HD>A 'Wait and See' Reaction to Treasury Nominee Snow</HD>
<DH>The initial take on the retooling of Bush's economic team
is generally favorable but noticeably restrained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth, Thomas S. Mulligan and Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Some people were expecting a new Treasury boss with closer ties to
Wall Street or Capitol Hill. Some were hoping for a well-known
apostle of supply-side economic policy. Some just wanted a more
familiar face.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, President Bush gave them railroad executive John W. Snow,
and many weren't quite sure what to make of it.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, New York and other centers of power, the initial
take on the retooling of Bush's beleaguered economic team was
generally favorable but noticeably restrained.</LD>
<TE>   "We live in an uncertain time, with terrorism and war and airline
bankruptcies, and having an unknown quantity just increases that
uncertainty," economist Brian Wesbury said. "We're going to have to
wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced Monday that he was nominating Snow -- who is
chairman, president and chief executive of rail operator CSX Corp. --
to replace Paul H. O'Neill, who is resigning after a troubled
two-year tenure as Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The president is expected to announce as early as today his choice
of Stephen Friedman, former co-chairman of investment firm Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., to succeed Lawrence B. Lindsey as chairman of the White
House's National Economic Council.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill and Lindsey were shown the door Friday as the White House
tries to counter criticism that its policies and personnel have not
helped the nation recover rapidly enough from the economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Bush's camp expressed hope that Snow and Friedman would do
a better job of articulating the president's economic agenda than had
their predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Job No. 1, they said, would be selling a new package of proposed
tax cuts that will be largely in place by the time they report for
work.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next three to six months, they have one thing on their
plate, and that is to polish up and shepherd through the new tax
cuts," said Wesbury, chief economist at the Chicago investment firm
Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &amp; Thompson. "I hate to call them glorified
salesmen, but that's going to be their job."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's economic appointments failed to dispel the general gloom in
the financial markets Monday. Stock prices declined sharply as
traders reacted to the bankruptcy filing of United Airlines parent
UAL Corp. and downgraded earnings forecasts for IBM Corp. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of some Wall Street regulars, the new team looks a lot
like the old team. Snow, like O'Neill, is a Ford administration
alumnus and a captain of old industry. As chairman of the Business
Roundtable, Snow lobbied for deficit reduction, a stance that might
conflict with the push for more tax cuts. Friedman, for his part, is
a director of the Concord Coalition, a watchdog group that advocates
balanced budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall message of Snow and Friedman is continuity, and the
markets are struggling with that," said Lehman Bros. chief political
analyst Kim Wallace. "Based on what happened Friday, people thought
they were going to get two strong spokesmen for opening the back door
of the Treasury until this economy is growing at 5% again, no matter
what the cost. Those expectations were dashed this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in Washington, for the most part, were jubilant at the
prospect that the Bush economic plan finally will have effective
spokesmen.</TE>
<TE>   "This will hopefully be the answer to the cavalry call we've been
waiting for," said House Deputy Majority Whip Mark Foley (R-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   Even Democrats were generally complimentary, saying they were more
concerned about the contents of Bush's economic policy than with the
personnel who promote it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is encouraging that the president is reaching out to
people of experience," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.). "But it isn't the names, it's the plan that is of concern
to us. Trickle-down economics doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), who worked with Friedman for 10 years
at Goldman Sachs, characterized his former colleague as "a pragmatic,
thoughtful individual" who would present both sides of issues. He
called Snow a disciplined manager who would be "formidable in his
presentation of the president's case."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue praised
Snow's service on commissions that promoted reforms in corporate
governance. National Assn. of Manufacturers President Jerry
Jasinowski predicted that Snow would be a strong advocate of U.S.
exporters. New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard E. Grasso said
Snow's "balanced mix" of experience with CSX, the Business Roundtable
and the Ford administration would serve him well as Treasury
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, some investors may take comfort in the perception
that Snow and Friedman are deficit hawks, said Tobias Levkovich,
equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. The bond
markets in particular tend to fear large deficits because they put
upward pressure on interest rates and inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a politically savvy move," Levkovich said. "It suggests
the president is choosing people who will support his economic
stimulus program without coming off as irresponsible with the
deficit."</TE>
<TE>   Market experts said reaction to Bush's choices was muted because
Snow and Friedman are regarded as unlikely to bring dramatic shifts
in policy. Some said traders are less concerned with the identity of
the administration's front men than with the details of the tax cut
package.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, Wall Street doesn't really know what to expect from
these guys," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer of Wells
Capital Management in Minneapolis. But "it's not that big a deal
because most of the agenda is going to stay the same regardless of
who takes those posts."</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, there's still some question as to who these two people
are," said Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief strategist at First Albany
Corp. "They're known, but not well known."</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comerica Inc. played a key role in Franchise Pictures' attempt to
inflate budgets on films such as "Angel Eyes" and "Get Carter,"
according to a suit filed by German licensor Intertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Comerica was the production lender for most of the films at issue
in Intertainment's pending suit against Franchise. In 2000,
Intertainment claimed the producer of "Battlefield Earth" overbilled
its European licensing partner on 10 of 26 films. That case is set
for trial early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Comerica spokesman Keith Turner said the company doesn't comment
on pending litigation.</LD>
<TE>   Comerica, Michigan's largest bank, purchased Inglewood-based
Imperial Bank in 2001 for $1.3 billion. Imperial's Beverly Hills
office was a major lender to small film companies, and Franchise was
one of its largest entertainment customers.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Jobs Report Revised to Fix Errors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor Department issued a fresh version of its closely watched
employment report after it found an error in payroll figures for
October and September.</LD>
<LD>   But even after the government overhauled the jobs report, which
was released Friday, the basic message was the same: that the labor
market remains in the doldrums in the aftermath of last year's
recession.</LD>
<LD>   The revisions left the payroll number for November unchanged at a
drop of 40,000.</LD>
<TE>   However, October payrolls were revised upward to a gain of 86,000
from a previously reported gain of 6,000. September payrolls were
ratcheted downward to a job loss of 84,000 versus the previously
stated decline of 4,000. The changes to the two months offset each
other.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions did not affect the unemployment rate, which is based
on a survey of households and is separate from the survey of business

<DL></DL>
<LD>Spyglass Entertainment, the independent financier of the 1999
blockbuster "The Sixth Sense," has signed a deal to finance and
produce movies with DreamWorks.</LD>
<LD>   Spyglass, formed in 1998 by co-Chairmen Gary Barber and Roger
Birnbaum, was free to enter into the pact after the expiration of an
exclusive production deal with Walt Disney Co., which still owns 10%
of the company as one of its three equity partners. The nonexclusive
pact allows Spyglass to take projects elsewhere if DreamWorks passes.</LD>
<LD>   Under its new agreement, DreamWorks will distribute Spyglass
movies domestically and in a few overseas markets, including South
Korea and Scandinavia.</LD>
<TE>   As part of a preexisting arrangement, Spyglass and DreamWorks are
in production on "Seabiscuit," a film about the legendary racehorse
starring Tobey Maguire and directed by Gary Ross.</TE>

<HD>Skechers Shares Plunge 42% on Warning of Loss</HD>
<DH>The shoemaker forecasts its first losing quarter as a
publicly held entity. Analysts cite a trend toward retro footwear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manhattan Beach shoemaker Skechers USA Inc. warned Monday that it
would post its first-ever loss as a publicly traded concern in the
fourth quarter, and it's clear that it would take some fancy footwork
to turn things around.</LD>
<LD>   The company's shares plunged 42% on the news.</LD>
<LD>   Skechers executives said revenue for the three months ended Dec.
31 would be $160 million to $170 million, rather than the $195
million to $205 million previously forecast. That will result in a
loss of 25 cents to 35 cents a share, rather than previous estimates
of a 5-cent-a-share profit.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that our record sales growth for the past two fiscal
years, coupled with tough market conditions, presented us with
challenges in the second half of 2002," said David Weinberg, the
company's chief financial officer. "The weak economic environment has
been characterized by soft consumer spending, price concessions and
fear of inventory buildup at retail."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of moving to a new Belgium warehouse and tepid sales
overseas contributed to the company's woes, Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors punished Skechers mightily, sending its shares tumbling
$5.03, to $7.02, making it the biggest percentage loser Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Though the lagging economy and lack of
consumer interest in footwear and apparel have hurt many
manufacturers this year, some on Wall Street suggested that Skechers
in particular faces an uphill battle in turning around its business
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, given how much they're taking down their guidance,
I don't think this is just a function of a difficult environment,"
said Mitch Kummetz, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los
Angeles. "It's a huge miss."</TE>
<TE>   Part of what has plagued many shoe companies this season has been
consumers who felt they over-shopped during the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the problem, especially for companies with a large youth
base such as Skechers, has been a retro fashion trend. For companies
such as Nike Inc., Adidas-Salomon and K-Swiss Inc., that has meant
reviving the old looks -- and lower prices -- of more basic footwear
and moving away from the more expensive sneakers and loafers on which
many companies had come to rely.</TE>
<TE>   The trend has been particularly troublesome for Skechers, Kummetz
said, because the 10-year-old company has no retro look of its own to
revive. What's more, the major companies' lower prices eat away at
one of Skechers' main selling points: lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the major reasons to buy Skechers has been removed from
the equation," Kummetz said. "And they're not an authentic brand as
far as retro goes, so they have two strikes against them."</TE>
<TE>   Without a fashion breakthrough, Skechers' best hope may be in
waiting for fashion to take a turn back toward more expensive
footwear, Kummetz said. That would allow the company to capitalize on
its ability to produce similar-looking shoes at lower prices.
"Higher-end fashion will be attractive to the consumer again, and
that will play into Skechers' hands," Kummetz said. "I just don't see
that happening anytime soon."</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Skechers said it expects earnings per share of $1.04
to $1.14, compared with the current First Call consensus estimate of
$1.45 per share. Sales are expected to be $922.7 million to $932.7
million, the company said.</TE>

<LD>Tyco International Ltd. sued two former top officers, Dennis
Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, to recover $40 million in profit from
their trading of the company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco says former Chief Executive Kozlowski and Swartz, who was
chief financial officer, violated a federal rule governing so-called
short-swing trades that requires insiders who buy and sell company
stock within a six-month period to relinquish their profit. The
lawsuit, which cites 67 alleged violations, was filed Friday in
federal court in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   Kozlowski and Swartz are battling state criminal charges in New
York that they engaged in a $600-million theft and fraud scheme. The
two men, who pleaded innocent, each face 30 years in prison on
enterprise corruption, grand larceny and conspiracy charges.</LD>
<TE>   Tyco already has sued Kozlowski, former general counsel Mark
Belnick and former director Frank Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Such suits are "not terribly common, because most officers and
directors are well-enough advised that they don't usually violate"
short-swing trading rules, said attorney David M. Becker, former
general counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco says Kozlowski violated the commission's short-swing rule 31
times from Aug. 1, 2000, when he exercised an option to buy 392,000
shares, to Jan. 30, when he bought 225,000 shares.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz allegedly violated the rule 36 times from Aug. 1, 2000,
when he exercised an option to buy 196,000 shares, to April 26, when
he bought 209,000 shares.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen E. Kaufman, Kozlowski's attorney, and Charles Stillman,
Swartz's attorney, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco spokesman Gary Holmes said the lawsuit "speaks for itself"
and declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Tyco's stock began to fall amid questions about
accounting and the company's liquidity. Shares fell 46 cents Monday
to $16.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined 72% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco is based in Bermuda and run from Exeter, N.H.</TE>

<HD>Investors Worry About Bond Status</HD>
<DH>Holders of the tax-free securities fear that the airline's
bankruptcy filing could leave them with worthless paper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors holding $413 million in special lease revenue bonds at Los
Angeles and San Francisco airports are worried that Monday's
bankruptcy filing by United Airlines' parent company may leave them
stuck with worthless paper.</LD>
<LD>   UAL Corp. has used a little-known public agency as a conduit to
issue four tax-free bond offerings to fund the building of passenger
and cargo facilities at California's two largest airports.</LD>
<LD>   Although the bonds have municipal status, no government or public
agency has guaranteed the bonds or is liable for any default.</LD>
<TE>   Investors say that the wording on the "indentures," or 750 pages
of rules that govern the bonds, might be vague enough to allow the
nation's second-largest airline to avoid making payments.</TE>
<TE>   "We are uncertain whether they will be paid out of the
bankruptcy," said Bud Byrnes, chief executive of RH Investments in
Encino and the holder of $200,000 worth of the bonds at face value.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the company has filed for bankruptcy protection, Byrnes
added, he fears that the bonds may "become about as worthless as the
company's stock." On Monday, UAL shares closed unchanged at 93 cents
on the New York Stock Exchange. The bonds now trade at 20 cents to 25
cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bonds first were issued to institutional investors,
most changed hands as United's financial situation deteriorated and
now are held by individuals who purchased them at steep discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Details of UAL's strategy for operating under Bankruptcy Court
protection have yet to emerge, but the company has obtained $1.5
billion in fresh financing from a consortium of banks to continue
operating as usual for now. The Elk Grove Township, Ill.-based
carrier is expected to cut jobs and trim unprofitable flights as the
company reorganizes under Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to win a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee last week
pushed the money-losing airline into Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   California represents a sizable portion of United's business. The
airline is the No. 1 carrier at Los Angeles International Airport and
San Francisco International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   UAL used two bond offerings, totaling $225 million, to construct
at LAX a giant cargo terminal, upgrade passenger terminals 7 and 8
and build an underground customs and immigration center for
international flights, according to Alan Wayne, an airline spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Two San Francisco bond offerings -- totaling $188 million --
helped fund construction of an international terminal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   All four offerings were made over the last five years through the
California Statewide Communities Development Authority, an agency
that confers tax-exempt status on the investments.</TE>
<TE>   Governments often sponsor bond issues by private companies if the
bonds are used to fund improvements for public infrastructure
projects such as airports. This type of financing gives a tax break
to investors and lowers the cost of borrowing for the company.</TE>
<TE>   United has not said whether it would give up gates and space at
either airport, but officials from LAX and SFO confirm that other
airlines are interested in any surplus United facilities. If other
airlines were to take over some of United's areas, they would have to
pay the airport for the ground leases and certain improvements. But
whether they'd have to pay the bondholders is far less clear.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy and municipal bond experts, in fact, are divided over
what will happen to these United investments now that UAL is
operating under Bankruptcy Court protection.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Thomas, a partner with Saybrook Capital, an investment bank
that specializes in advising creditors in bankruptcy reorganizations,
said he would be surprised if another airline could move into any of
the United space linked to the bond issues without taking over the
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Zane Mann, publisher of California Municipal Bond Advisor, also
believes that the bondholders are likely to be made whole at the end
of the day. If United stops payment, he believes, trustees for the
bondholders -- in this case Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank of New York,
depending on the issue -- will attempt to break United's leases and
find a new tenant for the airline's facilities. In turn, he expects
the new tenants to make the payments on the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the history of airline bankruptcies," Mann said,
"the demand for airport gates has been good enough so that if an
airline defaults on the lease payments there are other carriers
standing in line to get those gates."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Karen Sisson, chief financial officer of Los Angeles World
Airports, which represents LAX and Ontario International Airport, has
a different take on the situation. "I believe there is no obligation
for a new tenant to pay the bondholders," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Byrnes also was pessimistic, noting that "there doesn't seem to be
a provision in the documents for the transfer of gates and
facilities," apparently leaving the bondholders with no mechanism to
be paid.</TE>
<TE>   All that the bond documents do clearly say, according to Byrnes
and others, is that the holders become general creditors in the event
of a bankruptcy filing, a status that places them with other
unsecured creditors owed more than $3 billion by UAL. In other words,
they've been sent to the back of the line.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the type of bonds most at risk in the United
bankruptcy," said Daniel Champeau, managing director of Fitch
Ratings, a corporate credit rating firm.</TE>
<TE>   The major unsecured creditors, including bondholder
representatives, are expected to meet in Chicago on Friday to
establish a committee to represent their interests during UAL's
reorganization.</TE>

<HD>Vons to Stand Trial in Overcharging Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supermarket giant Vons is set to stand trial next year for allegedly
overcharging customers at a Santa Monica store.</LD>
<LD>   The city attorney filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint against
the Pleasanton, Calif.-based company after a routine inspection of
the checkout scanner at its Pavilions market on Montana Avenue found
that about 30% of 20 items purchased on one trip were rung up at
higher prices than labeled.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy City Atty. Adam Radinsky said Vons, a unit of Safeway Inc.,
could have settled with the city, paid fines and avoided a trial but
chose to go to court. Trial has been set for Feb. 6 in Los Angeles
County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   A Vons spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, referring all
calls to the company's attorney, who did not return numerous phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally with these kinds of cases their excuse is they didn't
bother to take down the sales tags in time once computers have been
set to the real price," Radinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Vons had been convicted in Santa Monica of overcharging customers
after previous scanner inspections, Radinsky said. However, the chain
is far from the only reported violator.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County scanner survey this year found that shoppers
were overcharged for one or more items at 34% of the 537 retail
stores surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   Radinsky said Santa Monica did not single out Vons. The city makes
a practice of pursuing litigation against all retail establishments
found during such inspections to be overcharging.</TE>
<TE>   Violators must either settle with the city and pay a $2,700 fine
for each item or go to court.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Agriculture and Weights and
Measures -- the agency that conducts the undercover scanner
inspections -- has this year beefed up its Buyer Beware Program. The
agency has hired more inspectors and enforced a new "scarlet letter"
ordinance approved by the Board of Supervisors that requires
retailers convicted of overcharging to post a notice in their
windows.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing last week, Vons argued to a Los Angeles County
Superior Court judge that because it was once acquitted of charges in
a similar L.A. County case, and separately found not to be in
violation by an administrative hearing officer in Ventura County, it
should be barred from prosecution on the latest charges.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Bernard Kamins disagreed, turning down Vons' motion to
dismiss the complaint .</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica has accused Vons of six counts of violating the state
business code by charging higher than the posted sales price. Another
count alleges that Vons disseminated false and misleading
advertising.</TE>

<HD>CSFB Fills Research, Legal Oversight Post</HD>
<DH>Promotion of Gary Lynch, a former SEC enforcement director,
is part of an effort to bolster analysts' image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Cahill</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Credit Suisse First Boston on Monday said it named Gary Lynch vice
chairman in charge of stock research and legal and compliance issues,
as the brokerage attempts to bolster its analysts' image in the
aftermath of allegations of conflicts of interest across the
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch, who was enforcement director of the Securities and Exchange
Commission from 1985 to 1989, was one of CSFB Chief Executive John
Mack's first hires and had already been the firm's global general
counsel.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch has taken the lead in negotiating a settlement with
regulators from Massachusetts and the NASD (formerly known as the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers) who have alleged that CSFB used
tainted stock research to win investment banking business.</LD>
<TE>   The investigations of CSFB are part of a broader probe by the
federal government and by states into brokerage analysts' conduct
during the bull market's heyday of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage industry now is negotiating a global settlement with
regulators. The talks are expected to result in large fines and major
reforms. A deal is expected before year's end.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB and other brokerages already have tightened controls in their
research departments after regulators this year disclosed e-mails
showing analysts privately disparaging stocks they publicly praised.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows the importance John Mack attaches to these issues," said
Lynch, who will become one of three vice chairmen at the firm. "He's
very serious about making sure we're at the forefront of change on
Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   CSFB previously said its research analysts would no longer report
to bankers such as technology chief Frank Quattrone, who had
oversight of research until July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the firm, like many other brokerages, has simplified its
stock recommendations to buy, sell and hold, and prohibited
compensation for analysts based on investment banking transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin has
alleged in a complaint that CSFB's investment banking division
controlled the research department and acted contrary to the
interests of average investors. CSFB has denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, 52, was a partner at law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell in New
York before being hired by Mack in August 2001. He helped negotiate a
$100-million settlement in January of allegations that CSFB allotted
sought-after shares of initial public offerings in exchange for
investor kickbacks in the form of higher commissions.</TE>
<TE>   As SEC enforcement chief in the late 1980s, Lynch oversaw cases
against Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert.</TE>
<TE>   At Davis Polk, Lynch was hired by General Electric Co. to review
its Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit after the firm lost $210 million from
bond trades that Kidder alleged were made by government bond trader
Joseph Jett.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's promotion at CSFB follows steps taken by other firms to
bolster the independence of their stock research.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. in October created a unit for its brokerage and
equity research departments to separate analysts from bankers and
named Sallie Krawcheck, the chief executive of independent research
firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., to lead the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in May named E. Gerald Corrigan, the
former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to a new
post as research ombudsman.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Dellenback, 84, the former Peace Corps director and Republican
congressman from Oregon who drafted legislation establishing the
Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, died Saturday of viral
pneumonia in Medford, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Dellenback was named director of the Peace Corps by President Ford
in 1975. For two years, he supervised the organization of 6,700
volunteers.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure in Congress from 1966 to 1974, Dellenback was a
leader in developing legislation on education and natural resources.
One of his accomplishments was crafting amendments to the bill
allowing construction of the Alaska oil pipeline holding shippers
liable for oil spills.</LD>
<TE>   Dellenback also was an ardent promoter of Christian education. He
became president of the Christian College Coalition in 1977 and
increased its membership from 10 colleges to 77 by the time he
stepped down in 1988. The organization later became the Council of
Christian Colleges and Universities.</TE>
<TE>   Dellenback made medical history six years ago when, at age 78, he
became the nation's oldest kidney transplant recipient to that date.
The kidney was donated by his wife Mary Jane, then 68, and the
country's third-oldest donor to that time.</TE>

<LD>Walt Stewart, 71, a courtroom artist whose sketches of notorious
criminal trials have been a staple of national television news for
decades, died of chronic lung disease Nov. 27 at his home in Bolinas,
Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Media outlets, particularly TV stations, counted on his work to
illustrate proceedings where cameras were banned from the courtrooms.
His first case was the 1964 trial of Jack Ruby, the man who shot Lee
Harvey Oswald; his last was the penalty phase of the trial of Cary
Stayner last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart also covered the Patty Hearst bank robbery trial and
trials of Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski, Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh and Charles Manson.</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco native grew up in Berkeley. He graduated from
the University of the Pacific and the Art Center College in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His archive of work -- tens of thousands of sketches -- will be
donated to the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.</TE>

<HD>Sanford Atwood, 89; Head of Emory Backed 'God Is Dead'
Professor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sanford S. Atwood, 89, the former president of Emory University in
Atlanta who stood firm behind a professor who espoused a theory that
"God is dead," died Dec. 2 of a brain hemorrhage in Asheville, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Atwood, a Wisconsin native who was the first non-Methodist
president of Emory, served from 1963-77. In 1965, Atwood threw his
support behind religion professor Thomas J.J. Altizer, who was
espousing the theory that "God is dead." Atwood said that if Altizer
felt he had an idea worth considering, "he has the right to do so."</LD>
<LD>   Atwood's firm stance supporting Altizer came amid calls for the
professor's ouster and threats from alumni and church bishops to cut
off funds for the university. Ultimately, Atwood's stance raised the
prestige of the school and increased fund-raising.</LD>
<TE>   During his tenure, Atwood had the first black and the first woman
commencement speakers. He brought in a series of diverse speakers,
including black power advocate Stokely Carmichael and conservative
Gov. Lester Maddox.</TE>

from Alabama, died Dec. 3 in Birmingham, Ala. The cause of death was
not reported.</LD>
<LD>   Andrews won her House seat in a 1972 special election after the
death of her husband, George W. Andrews, who held the seat for nearly
28 years. She ran unopposed, served nine months and chose not to run
for reelection.</LD>

said she would run "if that is what the people of the 3rd District
wanted."</TE>

Montevallo with a degree in home economics. She held teaching posts
in Livingston and Union Springs, where she met her husband. She lived

<HD>Boris Schapiro, 93; Bridge Player Linked to Cheating
Scandal</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boris Schapiro, 93, a top British bridge player who was implicated in
an international cheating scandal, died Dec. 1 at his home near
London. The cause of death was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   An engaging man with a sharp sense of humor, Schapiro was
devastated when the World Bridge Federation found him guilty of
cheating at the 1965 Bermuda Bowl World Championships in Buenos
Aires.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. team captain had accused Schapiro and his partner,
Terence Reese, of using finger signals to communicate with each
other. The British players withdrew from the tournament. An
investigation by the British Bridge League found them not guilty of
cheating; the Americans viewed that as a whitewash.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Riga, Latvia, Schapiro's family moved to Britain at the
time of the Russian Revolution. He served in British Intelligence
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   In a career spanning six decades, Schapiro won the European
Championship in 1948, 1949, 1954 and 1963, and the Bermuda Bowl in
1955 -- all playing with Reese.</TE>
<TE>   Schapiro also served as bridge correspondent of London's Sunday
Times from 1968 until his death.</TE>

<TE>   Millard "Corky" Alexander, 73, the editor and publisher of the
Tokyo Weekender, a free English-language newspaper for expatriates
there, died Dec. 3 in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Caras, 93, the winner of five world billiards championships
between 1936 and 1967, died Dec. 3 in Jacksonville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Yasuo Goto, 79, the former president of Japan's now-defunct Yasuda
Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., who made headlines in 1987 by purchasing
Vincent van Gogh's "Vase With Fifteen Sunflowers" for $39.9 million,
died Nov. 27 of malignant lymphoma.</TE>
<TE>   Klaus Loewitsch, 66, the actor known for his work in films by the
German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder -- most notably, "The
Marriage of Maria Braun" -- died Dec. 3 of cancer in Munich.</TE>

<HD>Bobby Joe Hill, 59; Led Texas Western Team to Basketball
Title in '66</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Joe Hill, 59, the leading scorer for the Texas Western team
that won the 1966 national championship and changed the landscape of
college basketball, died Sunday in El Paso of an apparent heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Don Haskins started Hill and four other black players in
that NCAA championship game against top-ranked Kentucky. Texas
Western College, now known as the University of Texas at El Paso,
beat Kentucky, which started five white players, 72-65. The victory
was credited with opening the doors of universities across the nation
to black athletes.</LD>
<LD>   "I am deeply, deeply saddened by the death of Bobby Joe Hill,"
Haskins said Monday. "Bobby Joe was the greatest leader, the greatest
competitor I have ever had."</LD>
<TE>   Haskins said he wasn't trying to make a social statement with his
lineup; he was simply starting his best players.</TE>
<TE>   The move, however, raised the ire of some who sent Haskins hate
mail and even death threats during the racially charged era.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, a native of Michigan, worked for El Paso Natural Gas for
many years before retiring in El Paso.</TE>

<HD>Bill Pearson, 82; Jockey and Dealer of Art and Antiques</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm reconciled to the fact that I will never get out of this life
alive. And while I'm still breathing, I'm going to live it up."</LD>
<LD>   -- Billy Pearson to Parade magazine, 1959</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   He was a small man -- 5 feet 2 inches and 105 pounds -- yet larger
than life. He wrote his autobiography, "Never Look Back," in 1958,
but added so many adventures over the last 44 years that he stacked
up enough material for a whole series of sequels.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Austin "Billy" Pearson, world-traveling jockey, megabucks
quiz show winner, self-taught art connoisseur and dealer who made
fortunes and gambled and partied them away with such high-living
friends as director John Huston and actors Sterling Hayden and Burl
Ives, has died. He was 82.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson, who straddled horses from Santa Anita to Siam but
preferred a well-stitched quilt to a thoroughbred, died Thanksgiving
Day in Kingston, N.Y., where he lived in a 1730s stone house with his
sixth wife, Margaret.</TE>
<TE>   The inveterate chain-smoker and heavy drinker of the best that
money could buy ended what his daughter Sarah Luck Pearson called his
"magical life" by dying of pneumonia, after suffering from emphysema
and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson was always a good story -- for the sports pages that
recorded his 826 track victories; for television where he wowed
viewers of "The $64,000 Question" and "The $64,000 Challenge" with
his arcane knowledge of art; and on the pages of Architectural
Digest, which raved about the 17 historic homes he refurbished and
decorated with his eclectic art collection.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for interviewers, his mouth was as good as his eye.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a college graduate to appreciate a painting or a
symphony, and it's proved by the fact that a snot-nosed 5-foot-2
ex-delinquent like me can be an art authority," he told a writer for
a 1967 Times article. "And that's the way it should be."</TE>
<TE>   As for what he really thought of horses, he told the San Francisco
newspaper columnist Herb Caen in 1986, "I hate horses. They're dumber
than canaries and don't know a thing about art."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1950s -- when Pearson was still riding at Santa Anita
and Hollywood Park and tracks in Athens, Milan, France, Britain and
Ireland, and in the former Ceylon, Malaya and Siam -- sports
columnist Ned Cronin announced that he planned to make his fortune
writing a book about Pearson.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," the columnist wrote, "seems to happen to Pearson in the
ordinary way. If he started out for a ham on rye at the corner
drugstore, chances are he'd wind up on a floating carpet eating
goat's ears with ... Valentino."</TE>
<TE>   The jockey and art dealer dedicated his own book to the IRS,
which, he wrote, "had watched over me closer than my mother, knew me
better than my wife, one who, even after I was dead, could
'remember.' "</TE>
<TE>   Huston, who once helped Pearson get back on his feet by obtaining
pre-Columbian art from Meso-American tombs, wrote in the
autobiography's foreword: "What a rare combination of big times,
tough breaks, wild dreams, handsome payoffs and bad falls served to
make up this book. I marvel at it, just as I shall forever marvel at
Billy himself."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson was born in Chicago but didn't stay long. He moved to
Pasadena with his mother, a nurse, when he was 5, and stayed there
until he started roaming the world, first on horseback and later with
the jet set.</TE>
<TE>   He dropped out of school to join the Civilian Conservation Corps,
established by during the Depression to provide work for the jobless.
There Billy became a much-defeated flyweight fighter until the CCC
athletic director cautioned: "Try something else, kid, before you get
killed. You're about the right size for a jockey."</TE>
<TE>   So Pearson got a job as stable boy and "hot walker" at the Le Mar
Stock Farm at Santa Anita, and learned to gallop thoroughbreds at
Charlie Cooper's San Luis Rey Ranch. He rode in the California county
fair circuit in the late 1930s and broke into the big time at Santa
Anita in 1940. He immediately became the top apprentice rider in
America.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, Pearson was the leading rider at the Hollywood Park
meeting until fate set him off in a new direction. The horse he was
riding plunged through a fence, and Pearson wound up hospitalized for
nine months with a concussion, eight broken ribs, and a fractured
shoulder, thigh and ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow jockey Jackie Westrope tried to needle him by sending him a
book on quilts "because it looks like you're going to spend the rest
of your life sewing."</TE>
<TE>   But the joke backfired. That book sparked Pearson's fascination
with quilts, antiques and various kinds of prehistoric and folk art.
He bought a quilt he liked at a San Francisco Goodwill store for
eight dollars and then learned it was worth $2,000. The design was
Independence Hall, and Pearson later donated the quilt to the
Smithsonian Institution, which valued it at $20,000. He quickly
bought up every quilt he could find -- 150 or so at up to $100 each
-- only to discover the whole lot was then worth a mere $11.</TE>
<TE>   "That started me thinking," he said in 1986. "Why should one quilt
be worth $2,000, and 150 others worth nothing? So I really began
studying the design, the needlework, the stitches, and became an
expert. And that opened my eyes to other art objects."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson read scores of books on art. Huston taught him about
pre-Columbian and African art. His friend, watercolorist, art
educator and administrator Millard Sheets, became another teacher. In
France, Pearson raced for Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who
introduced him to classical and modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson kept riding -- except for a couple years in the Merchant
Marine during World War II -- but his earnings as a jockey were now
directed toward buying art.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike money," he often said, "art gives lasting pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, he put his newly acquired knowledge to work on television
-- becoming the fourth person to win $64,000 on "The $64,000
Question," choosing Great Art and Artists as his category.</TE>
<TE>   In typical fashion, he partied all night, cashed the check, put
the cash in a hatbox, and with his friend Ives walked up New York's
Fifth Avenue to a gallery and bought an early version of Edward
Hicks' "The Peaceable Kingdom." Pearson later donated the painting to
Scripps College in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   In equally typical fashion, he stopped off in Las Vegas on the way
home to Pasadena and lost most of what was left of his quiz show
winnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I went on 'The $64,000 Challenge,' " he told syndicated
columnist Art Buchwald in 1958, "to make enough money to pay taxes on
the money I'd won on the 'The $64,000 Question.' "</TE>
<TE>   He won a total of $170,000 on the two shows and retired from the
track. He was making more money than some leading Hollywood producers
he told Buchwald but added ruefully: "I had obligations to bookies,
dice tables, Ferraris, imported wines and friends I had never met
before."</TE>
<TE>   Huston bawled him out for squandering his winnings, but then
staked him to open an art gallery in La Jolla. He later moved the
gallery to San Francisco, where he started refurbishing antique
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson dealt in pre-Columbian, primitive and tribal art; American
folk art and quilts; Hungarian painted dowry furniture; model steam
trains; and World War I photographs and artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he was recognized as one of the top 100 collectors in the
United States by Art and Antiques magazine. He helped develop the
Oakland Museum and often lent parts of his collection to museums for
exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson is survived by his wife, Margaret; and four daughters:
Mia, Enrica, Sarah and Cody Pearson.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be planned next month in San Francisco.
The family has asked that any memorial donations be sent to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars.</TE>

<HD>Cut Payroll Taxes to Put Disabled in Jobs</HD>

<AU>Deborah Kaplan</AU>
<BD>Deborah Kaplan is the executive director of the World
Institute on Disability in Oakland and on the advisory council for
Get America Working!</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We in the disability movement have a grand concept known as universal
design. It postulates that if a building, appliance, service or just
about anything else in civilization is designed with all users in
mind, including the 50 million Americans with disabilities, everyone
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   A wheelchair access ramp is used more often by pedestrians than
wheelchairs; speakerphones were designed for the disabled but are
nearly universal today; close-captioned TV ostensibly for the
hearing-impaired wound up in every sports bar in America.</LD>
<LD>   There are many such examples, and they all eliminate false
distinctions between people with disabilities and the other
four-fifths of the population, seeing the aggregate as one big
"market" for a smart product or service. Ventures that ignore 20% of
a potential market are apt to fail, but ideas adaptable to the widest
possible markets are apt to succeed and innovate.</LD>
<TE>   The economy is slouching toward a possible double-dip recession,
with flat growth and rising unemployment, now at 6%. A Social
Security crisis looms as our aging demographics shrink the labor
force. What better time to rethink our workforce and apply the
lessons of universal design?</TE>
<TE>   The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act envisioned a workforce in
which people with disabilities were fully integrated into the whole.
Although eight out of 10 working-age people with disabilities say
they want jobs, only a third have them. Despite the ADA's aims, the
employment rate for people with disabilities has remained unchanged
since 1990. Thus, millions of willing and able workers are sidelined,
supported at an annual cost of $232 billion in government aid and
private insurance payments.</TE>
<TE>   The failure of the ADA to produce higher employment rates for
people with disabilities is due in part to how it has been applied.
The Supreme Court has systematically narrowed the ADA's scope by
siding against people with disabilities in all six ADA employment
cases it has heard. It announced it would hear a seventh case, which
could end up shielding states from ADA lawsuits entirely. But beyond
legal hurdles is the greater obstacle of a mentality that needlessly
segments and categorizes the population as disabled versus not
disabled -- those defined as in the presumptive workforce versus
those defined as out of it.</TE>
<TE>   A universal design approach would survey the entire pool of
potential workers and ask what innovations could encourage inclusion
for all. Today, tens of millions who would work given the
opportunity, don't -- not only people with disabilities but 10.2% of
African Americans, two-thirds of all Americans over 55 and millions
of others not officially counted as unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   One measure under consideration in Washington that would help
accommodate them in a more universally designed workforce is payroll
tax relief.</TE>
<TE>   Payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare benefits,
are already universal in the bad sense of the word: For 80% of
Americans, payroll taxes take the biggest bite, accounting for more
than one-third of all federal revenue. Taxing payrolls kills jobs. It
makes employers and workers pay an additional 15% on salary and
benefits, inflating hiring costs and depressing job growth while
squeezing paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   Payroll tax cuts or rebates could create new jobs, reduce the
regressivity of other proposed tax cuts and put more money in the
pockets of low- and middle-income workers whose discretionary
spending drives economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   If payroll tax disincentives were removed from hiring, the job
market would afford new job opportunities for millions -- people with
disabilities and everyone else. Disability employment rates and
benefits funding would increase, along with the entire tax base,
rescuing Social Security and Medicare funding for everyone and
reducing government dependency costs arising from joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the access ramp, the speakerphone and close-captioned TV?
If those small-scale innovations improved your life at all, think how
much more benefit the whole economy would derive from a universally
designed workforce that embraced tens of millions of new workers who
no longer were left on the outside looking in.</TE>

<HD>Even Lawyers Are Getting Sick of Abuses in Asbestos
Litigation</HD>
<DH>Big money is going to the healthy, and that's unfair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Meroney</AU>
<BD>John Meroney is associate editor of the American
Enterprise magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you fear your working conditions might one day give you cancer,
should you be able to sue your employer and collect damages even
before you're sick? Some of the nation's most prominent trial lawyers
say yes. About 700 of them are behind the explosion in asbestos
litigation. Since 2000, more than 100,000 claims have been filed
against scores of companies. One study estimates there may be 3
million claims before it's all over. One jury awarded $150 million to
six plaintiffs who were exposed to asbestos dust but don't have
cancer -- they just fear that one day they might get it.</LD>
<LD>   However, an insurgent group made up of lawyers who represent
terminally ill clients now say the asbestos cases have become
mockeries of justice and argue that such litigation will undermine
the chances that those who have been harmed by cancer will be fairly
compensated. The fault line now emerging among trial lawyers over
whether to seek damages for clients who are healthy is one of the
latest issues in what has become the nation's longest-running product
liability case.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, the Supreme Court will weigh in on whether six West Virginia
railroad workers once exposed to train wheels and brakes containing
asbestos fibers are entitled to the more than $4 million a jury
awarded them because they fear their limited exposure would one day
cause cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys themselves are making the kinds of candid admissions
they've never made before. "We have more and more asbestos cases
because lawyers are very, very creative," said Dallas attorney Mark
Iola, once a pioneer in asbestos lawsuits and now part of the
renegade group of tort lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Iola is frank when he talks about his erstwhile ally Fred Baron of
the Texas-based tort firm Baron &amp; Budd, whose primary asbestos
strategy is to sign up as many clients as possible, then force
defendants into bankruptcy. "Fred likes that because he can settle a
bunch of cases and pocket the fees," Iola said in a press interview.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law banned asbestos in the workplace 30 years ago, but
curiously the number of claimants has risen dramatically in the last
few years. If anything, such protections should mean a decrease in
victims. "That's why we have 10 times more nonmalignant cases being
filed today than in 1990," Iola explained. "A nonmalignant asbestos
case is whatever a willing physician says it is, so a lawyer and
physician can go out and create however many cases they want."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to keeping damages out of the hands of those with
terminal illnesses, asbestos litigation is also having a devastating
economic effect on workers unlucky enough to be employed by the more
than 60 businesses already driven to bankruptcy. A study released
last week by Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz, the
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Clinton
administration, says between 52,000 and 60,000 workers have already
lost their jobs and more than $8,000 each in pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   Such effects aren't surprising when one considers the extremes
most asbestos lawyers resort to. Often, asbestos lawyers enlist
marketing and advertising firms to drum up business. They sponsor
mass screenings held at union halls and motels.</TE>
<TE>   A secret document titled "Preparing for Your Deposition" that
Baron &amp; Budd wrote for witnesses was also especially telling: "It is
important to maintain that you never saw any labels on asbestos
products that said "WARNING" or "DANGER."</TE>
<TE>   The document also instructed witnesses to avoid revealing that any
one asbestos product outnumbered another because "all the
manufacturers sued in your case should share the blame equally!"</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers have targeted Mississippi courts, flooding the dockets
with thousands of out-of-state claims from well people because the
state has been especially friendly to plaintiffs. Lawsuit excesses
have been so outrageous that the Mississippi Legislature recently put
limits on asbestos litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Venue shopping has also become common. Earlier this year, Provost
&amp; Umphrey, a plaintiffs' firm with offices across the country, went
looking for a favorable judge in Texas, filing four nearly identical
asbestos cases in separate courts. When the firm's actions were
uncovered last month, a judge slapped it with a $500,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers used to aspire to be modern-day folk heroes
championing the rights of the helpless, as in Hollywood movies such
as "Erin Brockovich." Now the profession ought to make good on that
dream and stop the rampant abuses in asbestos cases.</TE>

<HD>Beltway Shift: It's the Investors, Stupid</HD>
<DH>The next Treasury chief's task will be to salve the ailing
financial markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John W. Snow underscored a major shift Monday in his brief remarks
after being nominated as the next Treasury secretary. He mouthed the
usual platitudes about "small businesses," "medium-sized businesses"
and "large businesses." And then he hastened to add, "and investors."
That's the reality of postindustrial America today: It's the investor
class, stupid.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why Paul H. O'Neill, the ousted Treasury secretary, and
White House economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey had to go. By most
measures, they had done a good job. Yes, unemployment ticked up as
the economy came under new strains; one study estimates that the new
"terror tax" on the U.S. economy is more than $250 billion a year.
Even so, real gross domestic product -- that is, GDP adjusted for
what little inflation there is -- clocked in at a healthy 3.1% growth
rate in the third quarter of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   But there's one statistic that's gone seriously awry: that of the
financial markets. Total capital losses over the last three years are
$8 trillion, a sum dwarfing President Bush's 2001 tax cut, which was
a mere $1.35 trillion spaced over 10 years. And so the investor class
-- the 100 million people who have money invested in those markets --
is drowning in its own red ink, and investors want blood, or at least
scalps.</LD>
<TE>   Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, explains
the new political-economic dynamic: "Thirty years ago, politicians
used basically just one measurement to judge the economy: the
unemployment rate. Then came the inflation of the 1970s and another
variable was added: the consumer price index. Today, there's a third
variable: the stock market."</TE>
<TE>   To Norquist and other free-marketeers, that's a positive
development, because this triad of concerns forces politicians to
think comprehensively about the economy. That is, pols can't simply
enact "quick fixes," such as public works projects to hire people, or
wage-and-price controls to squelch inflation. Instead, they have to
think long-term, about all the tax and regulatory factors that affect
economic growth -- and thus stock prices as well.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was intellectually in tune with this worldview, but he
lacked the right personal touch. If the Treasury secretary's job is
to baby-sit the markets, he had a bad crib-side manner. He once
dismissed Wall Streeters as folks who "sit in front of a flickering
green screen ... not the sort of people you would want to help you
think about complex questions."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was right, of course; the "masters of the universe" aren't
so masterful. Leaving aside the corporate scandals -- Enron,
WorldCom, Global Crossing, each of which had a Wall Street component
-- one might question the savvy, or even the sanity, of investors who
blew into the stock bubble.</TE>
<TE>   What was going through the minds of those who bid up, for example,
the price of Yahoo from $7 a share in January 1998 to $237 in January
2000? Yahoo is now under $16. But to paraphrase Winston Churchill,
market capitalism, including its casino-esque excesses, is the worst
of all possible economic systems -- save for the alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   So what about Snow? Will he be a good horse whisperer, befriending
the wild markets? As business maven Neil Cavuto said on Fox News,
"There's some concern that this man is not coming from Wall Street;
he's coming from smokestack America."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Snow has market-friendly credentials; he was a member
of Jack Kemp's flat-tax commission in the mid-'90s, saying at the
time that the tax system "must be replaced by a new system for the
21st century." Americans, he added, must "capitalize on opportunities
-- not stifle economic growth and entrepreneurial activity."</TE>
<TE>   And besides, railroad executive Snow is likely to be joined by a
real Streeter, Stephen Friedman, former chairman of Goldman Sachs, in
Lindsey's economic advisor job. He can be relied upon to whisper
sweet somethings into investors' ears.</TE>
<TE>   So what's not to like? The only possible concern is that a high
stock market will become a kind of entitlement, benefiting the huge
new investor class. That is, presidents will be judged on their
ability to comfort the comfortable and enrich the rich. That could
make for the mother of all bubble-bursts someday. But today, the
political imperative is much simpler for Snow &amp; Co.: Get the Dow back
up again.</TE>

<HD>What if the Hunt for 'Evildoers' Aimed at Us?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The negative response from the Bush administration to the U.N.
inspections in Iraq could be dismissed as childish pique were it not
so telling an evocation of the image of the Ugly American making a
grab for oil.</LD>
<LD>   Like a playground bully, we have made it clear that there is no
answer to our verbal demands that would forestall a punishing
physical assault. Yet, to anyone not rabid for war, the United
Nations inspections would seem to be going well. As regards the hunt
for weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein's dictatorship is now
arguably the most open society in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly no other nation has been willing to allow deeply
suspicious foreign experts access to every nook and cranny, even the
dictator's bedroom, to ensure that bad things are not being done. And
the Bush administration acknowledges that its satellites and other
means of intelligence have failed to provide a smoking gun to refute
Iraq's accounting of its own program.</LD>
<TE>   What if the United States were subject to such an investigation?
Might U.N. inspectors find the source of the anthrax used to
terrorize the nation in a nerve-racking but as yet unsolved crime
committed a year ago? Our government has said that the deadly anthrax
brew was almost certainly not an imported product, so why has its
origin eluded the world's most elaborate security force?</TE>
<TE>   A bolder investigation would unearth the original U.S. designs for
the weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and nuclear
-- that now haunt the world. If U.N. investigators were deployed
here, they would discover that it was U.S. companies that quite often
supplied the materials that permitted other countries to experiment
with the means of killing us all.</TE>
<TE>   What new devilish inventions are being worked on in that vast
network that this nation has assiduously devoted to weapons of mass
destruction for more than half a century? Perhaps our lab directors
don't want the truth to come out and, like Hussein, are in need of a
bracing visit from international inspectors empowered to offer the
U.S. scientists safe exit and the security of a witness protection
program.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors could start with scientists at the national
weapons lab at Los Alamos, whose directors only last month were
forced to admit that highly classified computers and other equipment
worth millions of dollars were stolen each year. Surely one of the
scores of scientists who had access to the super- secret safe from
which the sensitive laptop hard drives were stolen two years ago
might be encouraged to break the wall of silence that has impeded the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Those hard drives, intended for use by emergency response teams in
immobilizing weapons, contain the most detailed knowledge base on
terrorist weapons of mass destruction and how they might be disarmed
if found, for example, emitting radiation at some airport or in the
Senate cloakroom. They constitute the ultimate terrorist cookbook.
Yet government investigators still don't have a clue as to how those
drives disappeared, only to be rediscovered hidden behind a copying
machine in the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Rest assured that if copies of those hard drives were to be found
in Iraq, it would trigger a U.S. aerial blitzkrieg killing hundreds,
perhaps thousands of Iraqi men, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps our president, who was pointedly uninterested in global
affairs before Sept. 11, does not know that in the matter of
introducing weapons of mass destruction, it is we, and not some
overseas "evildoers," who opened the door to this most heinous and
ultimately suicidal perversion.</TE>
<TE>   How could one blame George W. if he is among the vast majority of
Americans who blissfully and conveniently forget that we are the only
ones to ever actually use a nuclear weapon. Yes, this is all just
history, and therefore of no interest to the chauvinistic babblers
who dominate the national dialogue on U.S. airwaves. But it may
explain why even those who love freedom and democracy as much as we
do are frightened not only of Saddam Hussein but increasingly of us.</TE>

<LD>So now we know why we like cheese so much. It's our mouse genes. An
impressive international team of scientists has mapped the mouse
genome, the complex collection, arrangement and bonding of some
30,000 genes. As life's biological building blocks, genes program
mice -- indeed, all living things from bacteria to biologists -- to
think, look, act and dress as they do. The scientists, who carry the
white-lab-coat gene and often eat cheese, explain in their Nature
article that humans and mice have a lot more in common than thought.
Ninety-nine percent of mouse and human genes are the same.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, we've long suspected an invisible human bond with
little mice. Rats are dirty, deserving of disgust or life as lab test
subjects, drinking immense amounts of colas and wine. But mice are
different. Except for Orkin staffers, humans often appear halfhearted
in hunting mice; mousetraps catch more fingers than the minuscule
rodents.</LD>
<LD>   You know all the mouse cartoons and stories, right? Well, who'd
you cheer for -- Tom or Jerry? Mighty Mouse? He's a hero. Mickey
Mouse? We built him a theme park. Stuart Little got adopted. Mice
just seem more like us. Now, we know why.</LD>
<TE>   Mice come inside when it's cold. They sneak snacks late at night
and dislike loud teen music. Also, Mickey and Minnie aside, few mice
don hats. Have you noticed fewer humans, especially women, wearing
hats recently? See any connection? Or polyester leisure suits.
Neither species likes them anymore. Now, at this month's holiday
parties watch how cheese is served -- in little cubes, just right for
both species.</TE>
<TE>   These scientific findings also prompt wonder about whether humans
are unique in their study of other species. We know from recent
reports that wild dogs evolved into domesticated pets by studying
what animal behavior evoked beneficial treatment from humans. Maybe
behind those little round holes in the walls of our homes and garages
are vast, bustling laboratories of mice in white coats studying
humans, mixing steaming beakers of poison antidotes, experimenting
with mousetrap-clearing machines and testing smells and sounds that
repel and attract humans.</TE>
<TE>   It's all coming together now, thanks to the Nature report. The
human scientists even found that their species carries the same tail

<LD>Since it was chosen as the headquarters of the U.S. atomic bomb
program in 1942, Los Alamos National Laboratory has advanced science
in the American interest. Recently, the lab, amid cottonwood trees on
a mountain plain near Santa Fe, N.M., has competed with Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in the Bay Area to become the
headquarters of homeland security chief Tom Ridge's counter-terrorism
research program. Now, Los Alamos can probably kiss the homeland
security job goodbye. Unless it acts quickly to investigate and dig
out corruption, it can also say goodbye to its funding and
reputation.</LD>
<LD>   As Times staff writer J.R. Moehringer reported Monday, the lab's
managers recently fired two former police officers hired to
investigate theft and other problems. The investigators reported
unearthing a host of embarrassing security lapses, ranging from the
crass (a worker who allegedly tried to buy a $30,000 customized Ford
Mustang with lab money) to the dangerous (the disappearance of
cryogenic freezers that could be used for bioweapons research and of
260 computers, some of which had been used for nuclear weapons
design).</LD>
<LD>   The lab's problems aren't new. Then- Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson solemnly promised better security after hard drives full
of nuclear data vanished from a safe in 2000. But the sweep of the
current accusations is eye-opening.</LD>
<TE>   Much of what is admirable about Los Alamos, managed by the
University of California, lies in the lively, freewheeling atmosphere
it affords scientists. During World War II, for instance, lab
managers let physicist Richard Feynman pick locks throughout the
property and even on one occasion remove highly sensitive documents
from a supposedly secure file cabinet. It's a good thing lab managers
didn't fire Feynman, for he went on to devise the formula for
predicting the energy yield of a nuclear explosive, helping his
country win the war.</TE>
<TE>   Feynman's pranks at least had a purpose: He wanted to show that
the lab's security was not nearly as infallible as its security
managers had thought. The managers of Los Alamos today seem more bent
on damage control than self-improvement.</TE>
<TE>   They will soon come under the hard gaze of congressional
investigators and get a grilling at hearings in the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce. UC President Richard Atkinson shouldn't wait
for hearings, however, to dismiss the officials responsible for
firing the bearers of bad news.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations at Los Alamos have run off the tracks in the past,
most recently in the spying accusations that led to the jailing of
physicist Wen Ho Lee, who later was released. That doesn't mean some
of the lab's nonscientist employees, the group fingered by the
investigators, should be free to walk off with the furniture. As one
of the dismissed investigators reasonably asked, "If you see the way
they handle this money and their property, what would lead you to
believe they do any better with national security?"</TE>

<HD>Cut Rhetoric, Then Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rhetoric hit doomsday levels in Sacramento on Monday as the
Legislature convened a special session to consider Gov. Gray Davis'
call for $10.2 billion in budget cuts over the next 18 months.
Schools are the last place to cut, screamed a full-page ad paid for
by an education coalition that includes teachers unions, the PTA and
administrators. Not us, declared city and county governments.
Democratic lawmakers demanded that cuts be balanced by tax increases.
No new taxes, Republicans vowed.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing will get done in that atmosphere. First, cut the rhetoric.
And stop the increasingly ridiculous blame game, which included
Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga saying,
"Should I turn down an invitation to Hawaii simply because Gray Davis
has bankrupted California?" Brulte was one of the lawmakers who went
to Maui last week for a conference sponsored by the 26,000-member
union of prison guards, who reaped a 37% salary hike last year.
Brulte and the rest can prove their independence by digging into the
$5.3-billion corrections budget for far more savings than the paltry
$13.6 million that Davis seeks.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, Davis helped cause some of the deficit, mostly by agreeing to
bills passed by the Legislature to boost education and health
spending rather than build reserves. But the big culprit is the
precipitous drop in income taxes after the virtual collapse of
Internet technology businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The overcharged rhetoric is everywhere. The teachers union leader
said the cuts would devastate the schools, but in truth the reduction
would amount to only about 2% of total school income, which also
includes local property taxes and federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting school spending in the middle of the year will not be easy
and will surely hurt some programs, but most of the harm will be
temporary. The Legislature should give school districts as much
flexibility as possible in how they spend state aid so they can
better cope with cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' own plan is a starting point for eliminating the deficit,
expected to run more than $21 billion over the next year and a half,
but he evaded the tough part: any mention of revenues or temporary
tax increases, which will be necessary to close such a huge budget
hole. He owes better leadership to the state, especially since he
won't be running for governor again. Only a strong governor ready to
crack heads can get a reasonable budget out of the polarized
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Symbolism too will count. A good start would be eliminating the
$100,000-plus yearly stipends paid to former legislators and other
political favorites to sit on state bodies such as the Integrated
Waste Management Board and the Medical Assistance Commission. That
would not solve the deficit, but it would help make other cuts easier
to swallow.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Losing Popularity in World," Dec. 5: I'm a student at the
College of Europe, pursuing a master's degree in European politics.
Though I was aware of negative sentiment about the U.S. before I
arrived here, I was extremely disheartened to learn that even
students who had lived or worked in the U.S. had a negative view of
America. U.S. foreign and domestic policy after Sept. 11 is looked on
with disgust, and the most common jokes on our listserv are political
cartoons lampooning President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Now that I'm gaining perspective on the States, I can understand
Europeans' anger and frustration with a country that pursues ends so
contrary to its stated values. When we have one of the worst public
education systems among industrialized nations, no health-care
system, terrible pollution and we conveniently forget the foreign
policy disgraces of our past (not least with the Iraqis after the
Gulf War), American statements about "liberating" other countries and
"spreading democracy" begin to sound a little hollow.</LD>
<LD>   I'm furious with an American policy that acts the bully. America
could couple power with benevolence, technological might with
progressive values and wealth with generosity. Thousands are
starving, dying of AIDS and suffering under sanctions, but you'll
seldom see that on the nightly news. Our myopia seems to be getting
worse.</LD>

<TE>   People of foreign countries perceive America as the most wealthy,
powerful country on Earth, and they are green with envy because for
the most part they are so impoverished. But they would all like to
come here, and do by the millions.</TE>
<TE>   This hateful feeling is only ameliorated by the billions of
dollars that the U.S. has bestowed. Polls of the Turkish people
reveal that only about 30% of the populace feels friendly to the U.S.
The irony is we are about to plow hundreds of millions of dollars
into their country. Of course, this is for possible war preparedness,
but the trickle-down effect to the Turkish people will be tremendous.
Even the Kuwaitis are now getting into the unfriendly column, along
with the Saudis. As long as money and protection alone cannot dispel
international ill will toward us, why not just shut off the money and
let them fend for themselves against aggressors?</TE>

<TE>   I was appalled, but not surprised, by President Bush's ignorance
about American history when he was quoted as saying, "We'll do
everything we can to remind people that we've never been a nation of
conquerors; we're a nation of liberators." I would encourage the
president to remember that an entire continent was taken from people,
by conquest, who already lived there -- ask any American Indian.
Filipinos fought a three-year guerrilla war with the U.S. after our
"liberation" of them during the avoidable Spanish-American War. The
American Southwest and California were wrested from Mexico by force.
Florida was extorted from Spain -- essentially we told Spain to sell
it to us or we would take it by force. Should we even mention the
history of Texas?</TE>

<LD>Re "Officers Linked to Death of Teen," Dec. 8: When Los Angeles
Police Department officers Mario Rios and Michael Montoya dropped
that kid off in the turf of a rival gang, they were trying to kill
him. They did it to him twice, and on the second attempt their murder
of the teen was successful. They used the rival gang as the murder
weapon.</LD>
<LD>   There is no statute of limitations on murder. The fact that the
LAPD and the district attorney were investigating the officers only
for "obstructing justice" instead of murder is emblematic of the
corrupt effort of Los Angeles' officialdom to get the Rampart scandal
behind it.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Fires His Top Economic Advisors," Dec. 7: What was once a
foregone conclusion has become a reality -- the resignations of
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Lawrence Lindsey, President
Bush's chief economic advisor. What remains to be done will be up to
the voters in election 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Unemployment at its highest since 1994 and a historic budget
surplus that turned into a budget-busting deficit in just two years
are grim reminders of failed fiscal and economic policy.</LD>
<LD>   Presidential advisors serve at the president's pleasure and
advocate, promote and administer his policies both foreign and
domestic. One predominant qualification for advisors is their loyalty
to the chief executive. If O'Neill and Lindsey were to remain on
board, they would hamper the president's reelection prospects.</LD>

<TE>   It was interesting and distressing to learn that the real reason
behind the administration's economic shakeup was the 2004 election
and White House officials' need "to burnish their image as an
administration concerned about the economy," as former senior
presidential aide Robert Hormats commented.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be refreshing to have a president who addressed the
economy because it was the right thing to do for the country, rather
than do it just for image-building and reelection?</TE>

<TE>   The solution to the economic downturn will not come by replacing
the secretary of the Treasury. The solution will not come by
decreasing taxes and starting a war with Iraq. On the contrary, this
combination will bankrupt all the social programs that are already
failing. In fact, all of the president's solutions are doomed to
failure because they are oversimplified solutions that do not take
into account the complex nature of domestic and foreign factors.</TE>

<TE>   The argument of tax-cut advocates that double taxation occurs when
the government taxes corporate profits as well as shareholders'
dividends is a phony one ("President Makes Move to Avoid His Father's

that when I pay my barber with money that has been taxed, he should
not be taxed on any profit he nets from that money.</TE>

<LD>In her discussion of media bias, Norah Vincent missed the big picture
("The Unbiased Truth About Media Objectivity," Commentary, Dec. 5).
Underneath the self-satisfied, elitist liberalism of the New York
Times and the strident, reactionary arrogance of Fox News lies a more
insidious bias.</LD>
<LD>   The major media have for years hidden or apologized for the true
motives and tactics of American foreign policy. From Vietnam to Chile
to Nicaragua to East Timor to Iraq, the deaths of civilians, the
racketeering for multinational corporations, the deceit by one
presidential administration after another, the flouting of
international law, the support of brutal dictators, the ravaging of
Third World ecologies -- all have been ignored or distorted by media
that are owned and funded by corporations and, therefore, obviously
protect corporate interests.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent did not mention this, but anyone interested in a
scientific study of this phenomenon can read "Manufacturing Consent:
The Political Economy of the Mass Media," by Noam Chomsky and Edward
S. Herman, or even see the excellent movie by the same name.</LD>
<TE>   The saddest part of Vincent's commentary is that she asks us to
accept media bias as "unavoidable." With hacks like Vincent given
free rein, she may be right.</TE>

<TE>   Let's see now, Chris Matthews, host of "Hardball," is a liberal

the right. Actually, Vincent, too, has it only half right. Yes, the
press in America does indeed have a liberal bias. It cannot and
should not be any other way. For the same reason that our
universities have a liberal bias, so, also, must our press. Both
institutions are charged with challenging the status quo, questioning
the conventional wisdom and pointing us in new directions. I say
hurray for the liberal press!</TE>

<HD>2nd Amendment and Weapons Ban</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Court Upholds State Assault Weapons Ban," Dec. 6: Why do people
(and courts) insist on debating amendments to the Constitution as if
they were stand-alone documents? The Constitution exists to affirm
individual rights and limit the powers of government.</LD>
<LD>   The Times seems to recognize context as a factor when discussing
the 1st Amendment but not the 2nd. Perhaps this is because so many
people now assume a right of irresponsibility and incompetence.</LD>
<LD>   People have a right to be incompetent, so we must sue anyone who
produces a dangerous product, like a clothes iron or a hot cup of
coffee. People have a right to be irresponsible, so we must outlaw
anything that requires responsibility, like owning a firearm. I'll
grant you that incompetence and irresponsibility are commonplace, but
I don't believe they are inalienable rights. Of course, the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals would probably disagree.</LD>
<TE>   Our Constitution boldly asserts that individual citizens may
competently and responsibly govern ourselves. Is it not so?</TE>
<TE>   Dean Zatkowsky</TE>
<TE>   Ojai</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If we really want to defeat terrorism in this country, we will
start with an assault weapons ban. Instead, the U.S. is the easiest
place in the world to obtain such deadly weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The current administration would oppose such state laws on the
basis of the 2nd Amendment (read the National Rifle Assn.) or the
so-called "right to keep and bear arms." But it has no problem with
laws and pronouncements limiting other constitutional rights of
American citizens, such as privacy and due process, in the name of
the war on terror. Maybe it is stupidity rather than politics --
either conclusion is scary.</TE>
<TE>   I.C. Black</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge Stephen Reinhardt's interpretation of the 2nd Amendment
isn't very convincing. Why would this supposed "state" right be under
the 2nd instead of the 10th Amendment? Using Reinhardt's argument,
George Washington and his army in the American Revolution were the
equivalent of Shays' rebellion, a "mob of armed individuals" -- and
we'd all be flying the Union Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Baldridge</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three cheers to our U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for agreeing
with the U.S. Supreme Court's 1939 ruling that the 2nd Amendment does
not give individuals the right to bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   I now hope that the National Rifle Assn. forces the Supreme Court
to make a ruling. I am curious as to the extent of the political
corruption of the Supreme Court's five conservative members in
ignoring the Constitution and simply pandering to the
ultraconservative credo.</TE>

<HD>Actor Is Accused of Domestic Battery</HD>
<DH>Tom Sizemore arrested after a woman alleges he hit her. His
attorney denies accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Tom Sizemore, who plays a police lieutenant in the CBS series
"Robbery Homicide Division," was arrested by Los Angeles police after
a woman alleged that he hit and threatened her, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sizemore, 41, was taken into custody Saturday at his home in the
2700 block of Hudson Place in West Los Angeles after the woman, with
whom police said he had a "dating relationship," alleged that he "hit
her in the face and threw her to the ground" that morning, said LAPD
Lt. Horace Frank.</LD>
<LD>   The actor was booked at the Pacific Division station on suspicion
of misdemeanor domestic battery and released on $2,500 bail, pending
a Jan. 8 appearance in L.A. Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office said that
after the arrest, Sizemore was served with an emergency protective
order requiring him to keep away from the woman.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the star of the CBS television show, which is
based on the work of the LAPD's detective unit, called the
allegations unfounded. Robert Barta said the woman "became unruly
when asked to leave and was escorted out of Mr. Sizemore's house."</TE>
<TE>   Sizemore's film credits include "Heat," "Saving Private Ryan" and
"Black Hawk Down." He debuted this television season as Lt. Sam Cole
in "Robbery Homicide Division." If convicted, Sizemore faces up to a
year in county jail and a $2,000 fine.</TE>

<HD>Budget Deficit May Block O.C. Freeway Work</HD>
<DH>If state makes a big cut as proposed, the effect on the
congested Garden Grove would be 'very serious,' says the county's
transit chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County transportation projects on the verge of construction,
including the long-awaited expansion of the Garden Grove Freeway,
face the loss of more than $200 million in funding because of the
state budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The Garden Grove Freeway might lose $174 million in state money,
jeopardizing plans to expedite the work, local transportation leaders
said Monday. The freeway, which was in line for at least $438 million
in improvements, hasn't had a major upgrade since it opened almost 35
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Not expanding the chronically congested route as planned "is going
to have a very serious negative impact," said Arthur T. Leahy, chief
executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "How we are
going to keep moving is the problem right now."</LD>
<TE>   Facing a $21-billion-plus state budget deficit, the governor's
office has proposed about $1.8 billion in cuts for transportation
projects statewide. About $1 billion of the total involves all work
funded by the state Traffic Congestion Relief Program, which includes
the Garden Grove Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said the governor's proposed cuts for Orange County
also include $17.5 million for street improvements and $12 million to
help rebuild a heavily traveled rail corridor through five miles of
Placentia, Anaheim and unincorporated areas. The corridor is where a
freight train hit a Metrolink train in April, killing three people
and injuring more than 200.</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA board of directors discussed the looming setbacks for the
Garden Grove Freeway and surface street projects at its Monday
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said OCTA will meet with Caltrans to discuss how to proceed
on the Garden Grove Freeway if the money is ultimately cut. Although
the Legislature must approve the proposed budget cuts, Leahy said
OCTA is not optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that if projects were already in construction,
everything would be OK. It's not OK," Leahy said. "Some people are
going to feel some real pain as a consequence."</TE>
<TE>   About $32 million in state funds for the Garden Grove Freeway has
already been spent for planning, sound walls and environmental impact
reports being prepared by Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision on the size of the project has not been made, but
improvements are vital to relieve congestion on a roadway carrying
175,000 vehicles a day. That load is expected to grow to 210,000
vehicles in just a few years, transportation officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the mid-1960s, the freeway is one of Orange County's most
congested corridors during rush hours. Travel is especially slow at
the notorious Orange Crush, where it meets the Santa Ana and Orange
freeways. Transportation officials also note that the Garden Grove is
the only freeway in the county lacking carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans and OCTA have considered a range of improvements to the
freeway. The most likely and preferred option, transportation
officials say, is a $438-million proposal to widen most of it,
improve onramps and offramps, and build a single carpool lane in each
direction.</TE>

<LD>Orange County transportation projects on the verge of construction,
including the long-awaited expansion of the Garden Grove Freeway,
face the loss of more than $200 million in funding because of the
state budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The Garden Grove Freeway might lose $174 million in state money,
jeopardizing plans to fast-track widening of the heavily traveled
route through central Orange County, local transportation leaders
said Monday. The Garden Grove, which was in line for at least $438
million in improvements, hasn't had a major upgrade since it opened
almost 35 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Not expanding the chronically congested route as planned "is going
to have a very serious negative impact," warned Arthur T. Leahy,
chief executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "The
widening is a great project. It has to be done. How we are going to
keep moving is the problem right now."</LD>
<TE>   Facing a $21-billion-plus state budget deficit, the governor's
office has proposed about $1.8 billion in cuts for transportation
projects statewide. About $1 billion of the total involves all work
funded by the state Traffic Congestion Relief Program, which includes
the Garden Grove Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said the governor's proposed cuts for Orange County
also include $17.5 million for street improvements and $12 million to
help rebuild a heavily traveled rail corridor through five miles of
Placentia, Anaheim and unincorporated areas. The corridor is where a
freight train hit a Metrolink train in April, killing three people
and injuring more than 200.</TE>
<TE>   "We are starting to clear ground, contractors have been hired --
you mean to stop all that?" said Placentia Public Works Director
Chris Becker, whose city is participating in the $500-million
project.</TE>
<TE>   The work, which would eventually include a concrete trench for
train tracks, had received a $28-million commitment from the state.
About $16 million of that has already been spent.</TE>
<TE>   Becker said he hopes most, if not all, of the funding will be
retained because the work is vital for rail safety and moving cargo
to and from the fast-growing ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA board of directors discussed the looming setbacks for the
Garden Grove Freeway and surface street projects at its Monday
meeting. The governor's office notified the authority of the proposed
cuts Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said OCTA will meet with Caltrans to discuss how to proceed
on the Garden Grove Freeway if the money is ultimately cut. Although
the Legislature must approve the proposed budget cuts, Leahy said
OCTA officials are not optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that if projects were already in construction,

175,000 vehicles a day. That load is expected to grow to 210,000
vehicles in just a few years, transportation officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials cautioned that it was premature to say exactly
where the budget cuts would fall. County transportation agencies and
the California Transportation Commission will have to set new
spending priorities, they say, and projects no longer funded by the
Traffic Congestion Relief Program will have to compete for money from
other state transportation programs. Some of those, however, could
face cuts of their own in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg," said Orange County
Supervisor and OCTA board member Jim Silva, whose district includes
the freeway. "I've pushed to improve the Garden Grove Freeway for
eight years. Then this hits. It's frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove) said OCTA and other
government agencies will have to reset their priorities and lobby the
Legislature, the state Transportation Commission and the governor for
projects they think are most important.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm greatly concerned," said Dunn, who vowed to fight for the
Garden Grove Freeway funds. "The 22 is the last highway in the county
to be upgraded. It never should have been left unimproved for so
long."</TE>
<TE>   Built in the mid-1960s, the freeway is one of Orange County's most
congested corridors during rush hours. Travel is especially slow at
the notorious Orange Crush, where it meets the Santa Ana and Orange
freeways. Transportation officials also note that the Garden Grove is
the only freeway in the county lacking carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans and OCTA have considered a range of options, from the
addition of express buses to an $872-million project that would
include widenings, carpool lanes in both directions and new
connectors to the Costa Mesa, San Diego, Santa Ana and San Gabriel
River freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely and preferred option, officials say, is a
$438-million proposal to widen most of the Garden Grove, improve
ramps and build a single carpool lane in each direction. To pay for
that option, the state's previous commitment of $206 million was
going to be matched with funds from Measure M, the county sales tax
for transit projects.</TE>
<TE>   To speed up those improvements, OCTA amended Measure M to include
the freeway and decided late last year to use a single contractor to
do both the engineering and construction. The so-called design-build
approach has not been used for freeway construction elsewhere in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the concept say it can save time and money. In the
case of the Garden Grove Freeway, OCTA officials have said the work
could be completed as early as June 2006, about three years ahead of
previous estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very disappointed because this is an important project,"
said Leahy, who has helped make the freeway one of OCTA's priorities.
"The residents of Orange County need to have the road widened."</TE>

<HD>Parents Sue Ventura County Over Traffic Death of Girl While
Jogging</HD>
<DH>The Camarillo-area couple seek more than $25 million,
alleging officials were negligent by not correcting a dangerous road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a popular Camarillo High School cross-country runner
killed a year ago by a car while jogging on Santa Rosa Road have
filed a lawsuit contending that the county's failure to remedy
dangerous road conditions contributed to their daughter's death.</LD>
<LD>   Paul and Dorothy Bonds filed the suit late last month in Ventura
County Superior Court, accusing the county of negligence in the death
of their 14-year-old daughter, Jennifer.</LD>
<LD>   The high school freshman was struck by a car as she jogged last
Dec. 11 with her father near their Camarillo-area home.</LD>
<TE>   Outrage over the fatal accident touched off demands that county
leaders look into long-standing safety concerns about Santa Rosa
Road, a heavily traveled, two-lane thoroughfare that connects
Camarillo with Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Although law enforcement officials have said the driver was not
speeding and did not cite him, the Bondses named the Oxnard man,
Pedro Acosta Valenzuela, as a defendant in the suit, along with the
county.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks more than $25 million in damages and $10,000 in
funeral expenses. It contends that Santa Rosa Road had been unsafe
for years and that the county "knew or should have known of the
dangerous character and conditions [of the road] ... and failed to
warn or failed to correct the dangerous conditions."</TE>
<TE>   County lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment, and
Valenzuela could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, Paul Bonds kept a vigil at the site where his
daughter was killed, spending nearly every afternoon at a makeshift
shrine that family and friends erected along the roadside. The
memorial, which began with a few flower displays and candles, grew in
the ensuing weeks to include photographs, poems and newspaper
clippings, all surrounding a small white cross.</TE>
<TE>   The site also served as a rallying point for a campaign by Bonds
and others to improve safety along the rural road. Area residents
have long complained about speeders on the thoroughfare, where the
posted speed limit is 55 mph.</TE>
<TE>   That effort culminated last summer in a vote by the Board of
Supervisors to pursue a number of road improvements, including
installation of a traffic light at the intersection of Yucca Drive,
near where the accident took place. Area residents are set next week
to vote on whether to tax themselves to pay one-third of the $200,000
cost of installing and maintaining the traffic signal.</TE>

<HD>Santa Clarita May Annex Site Slated for Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned about the effects of a proposed subdivision on its southern
border, the Santa Clarita City Council is expected to launch an
effort Tuesday to annex 555 acres where a developer hopes to build
5,800 homes.</LD>
<LD>   Developer Las Lomas Land Co. plans a subdivision with an expected
population of 15,000 people on the rugged, hilly property that many
Santa Clarita residents value for the psychological distance it gives
them from the rest of the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   At its meeting tonight, the council will consider a resolution to
become the agency that decides what to do with the unincorporated Los
Angeles County land, which is east of the Golden State Freeway and
west of the Antelope Valley Freeway. Another resolution will request
to formally annex the land.</LD>
<TE>   The developer has filed an application to have the property
annexed into the city of Los Angeles. But Santa Clarita officials are
worried that the project will snarl traffic, impede an important
wildlife corridor and eventually include a shopping mall that will
drain tax revenue from the city's main shopping area in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very bad idea -- for one, because they'd be taking down
whole mountains" to build it, said Councilwoman Marsha McLean. "Since
it's going to affect our city so much, I believe we should have a say
in it."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita planning officials argue that the property is within
a "logical boundary" of their city, which has "the most efficient
provisions for municipal services, offering mutual social and
economic interest to the future residents of the project site,"
according to city documents.</TE>
<TE>   If the resolution passes, the question will be taken up with the
Local Agency Formation Commission, which handles annexation requests,
City Manager Ken Pulskamp said.</TE>
<TE>   Las Lomas Land Co. is a venture between Santa Monica-based Palmer
Investments Inc., and Los Angeles investment group Southbrook
Equities. Dan Palmer, the developer heading the project, could not be
reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council also plans to inaugurate a new mayor tonight --
31-year-old Councilman Cameron Smyth, who is taking over from Frank
Ferry in the council's yearly rotating mayoral system.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Niguel Regulates Model-Aircraft Flights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beginning in March, the skies over a tiny neighborhood park in Laguna
Niguel will be regulated by the city. A law regulating
remote-controlled model aircraft was adopted last week after the
planes caused problems for a resident near Lilly Shapell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Valbuena, who lives in the Hillcrest Estates, a gated
neighborhood a few yards from an area used as the model fliers'
airfield, grew so tired of planes crashing in his yard that he took
Laguna Niguel to court seeking a ban on the miniature aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The city drew up an ordinance that the City Council approved
unanimously last week.</LD>
<TE>   The law requires hobbyists to get permits before flying their
craft at the park. Permits will be issued only after pilots pass
flight and rules tests. A committee of experienced model aircraft
pilots will administer the tests and make recommendations to the city
recreation director.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations also limit the model aircraft to an area away
from homes and allow only five aircraft to fly at a time. Violators
can lose their permits.</TE>
<TE>   Valbuena's suit is pending. A preliminary injunction was denied
this summer, but a trial date for a preliminary injunction has been
set for June.</TE>

<HD>Orange County D.A. Will Again Seek Death for Deputy's
Killer</HD>
<DH>A mistrial was declared in the penalty phase of Maurice
Steskal's trial after the jury deadlocked 11-1 in favor of life
without parole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County district attorney's office announced Monday that it
will ask a second jury to impose the death penalty on Maurice
Steskal, convicted of killing an Orange County sheriff's deputy in
June 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Frank Fasel declared a mistrial Dec. 2 in the
penalty phase of Steskal's trial after jurors deadlocked 11-1 in
favor of recommending life in prison without the possibility of
parole. Fasel scheduled a hearing for Dec. 19 to schedule a new
trial.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Steskal, an unemployed laborer, pumped 30 rounds
from an assault rifle into Sheriff's Deputy Brad Riches and his
patrol car at a Lake Forest 7-Eleven on June 12, 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Riches, 34, was on patrol when he pulled up at the 7-Eleven at
Muirlands Boulevard and Ridge Route Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors saw a surveillance tape of Steskal, 43, entering the store
sometime after midnight carrying a rifle. According to Deputy Dist.
Atty. David Brent, Steskal told the clerk to not be scared, that the
gun was to protect him from police.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after he left, the tape picked up the sound of the gunfire.
Steskal fled, but an identification was made after authorities viewed
the tape. He was arrested later that day while in a car with his
wife. Brent said 30- and 100-round clips were found in the trunk of
the car.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Mark Davis argued that Steskal was plagued
by an irrational, delusional fear of authorities most of his life and
fired out of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Brent said Steskal is "a coldblooded killer, pure and simple."</TE>

<LD>A 76-year-old woman died Monday after an accident in which she
apparently tried to turn left in front of two oncoming cars in Los
Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   The woman's name was not released pending notification of
relatives, according to Los Alamitos Police Sgt. Phil Arnold. "We're
still trying to gather all the facts to determine what happened," he
said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 3 p.m., when the woman in a Ford Tempo
westbound on Katella Avenue began turning south onto Siboney Street
and was hit by two eastbound cars.</LD>
<TE>   No other injuries were reported, Arnold said. The accident closed
eastbound traffic on Katella from Bloomfield Street to Walker Avenue
for about five hours.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s Planners Misread Slump</HD>
<DH>The fiscal crisis began when building permits slowed, but
the awaited turnaround never materialized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco and Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financial crisis at the Orange County Planning Department began
more than two years ago when building activity began to slow.</LD>
<LD>   The number of permit applications dropped as the county began to
build on its last undeveloped land -- with a corresponding cut in
revenue. The department's budget took another hit when officials
decided to trim what developers were charged for building permits.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of slashing costs, the department covered a growing
deficit by drawing on its $18-million reserve fund.</LD>
<TE>   Officials bought a fleet of Ford Explorers and installed a
$7-million computer system. They predicted a turnaround in permit
applications that never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Board of Supervisors will consider an emergency plan to
keep the department afloat by raising permit fees more than 50%. The
vote comes less than a week after Planning Director Thomas B. Mathews
notified employees that 20% of the staff would be laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors and others expressed shock at how the department found
itself in such a hole, losing at least $500,000 a month with no
reserves left.</TE>
<TE>   "The Planning Department is supposed to do planning. They are the
ones who are supposed to know what their budget should be," said
Supervisor Chuck Smith. "It's inexplicable."</TE>
<TE>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom said Monday that his office
has begun to sort out what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see once and for all a fair accounting of their costs
and revenues and all their overhead costs coming out of [the
budget]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the downturn, the Planning Department increased spending
each of the last three years -- from about $24 million in 2000 to a
projected $33 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   According to an optimistic business plan for fiscal year 2001-02,
the department's budget staff predicted that though "permits are down
at this time ... our trend analysis indicated that the second and
fourth quarters historically are the peak periods. March is expected
to increase.... We are not considering any reductions in staff."</TE>
<TE>   The business plan predicted that the department's budget woes were
temporary.</TE>
<TE>   So many large projects such as Rancho Mission Viejo would begin in
coming years that permit applications would shoot up again, the plan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The spike never happened. Instead, Planning Department spokesman
Brian Murphy said all four quarters of 2001 saw less permit activity
than any quarter in the previous four years.</TE>
<TE>   This year's planning department budget predicted a $9-million
increase in building fee permit revenues. But the extra money hasn't
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   The problem surfaced publicly in August, when supervisors
discovered that the department's reserve fund was empty.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved an emergency $8-million loan that was supposed
to last through June. So far, $6 million has been spent.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it's hard to predict new housing starts.</TE>
<TE>   "The big challenge is that these cycles don't behave in very
predictable ways," said Richard Gollis, a real estate market analyst
based in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Still, county planners are very aware of the status of projects
and should have been able to pinpoint future activity fairly
accurately, Gollis said.</TE>
<TE>   The county is in a legal battle in Orange County Superior Court
with Barratt American Inc., a national homebuilder that alleged that
planners were charging too much for permits. The county voluntary
reduced some of its fees after the suit was filed in 1999, but the
case has yet to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   A judge appointed a special master to review the county's record.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed Monday, Robert Mosier, the special master,
faulted planners for mishandling the department's finances and urged
the judge to stop the board from approving a fee increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The spending train gained so much momentum ... that by the end of
the fiscal year on June 30, 2002, when the reserve was finally
depleted, it just kept going," Mosier wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Judge C. Robert Jameson declined to intervene Monday, saying it
would be premature before supervisors made their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Some stunned employees expressed their own anger that warning
signs were not more clearly seen by managers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all a nightmare," said a department worker who requested
anonymity. "What happened, that's what everybody wants to know. What
went wrong. Who's running the planning department? It's like a
shipwreck."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Clarita plastics company under federal investigation for
allegedly illegally discharging toxic chemicals and exposing its
workers to hazardous materials is shutting down a major component of
its operations.</LD>
<LD>   Keysor Century Corp., once a prominent producer of vinyl records,
will cease the production of polyvinyl chloride resin by the end of
the month, attorney Manny Abascal said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a search warrant affidavit in February, FBI agents said that
the family-owned company was making resin beyond its capacity,
causing equipment to malfunction and release "dangerous amounts" of
the byproduct vinyl chloride, which has been linked to liver cancer.</LD>
<TE>   The affidavit also contended that company officials knew that data
measuring environmental exposure and emissions for regulatory
agencies had been falsified. The FBI's investigation is ongoing, a
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Keysor Century filed for bankruptcy in March. But Abascal said the
company will continue with other aspects of its plastics production.</TE>

<HD>Former Teacher Going to Jail</HD>
<DH>The Thousand Oaks elementary educator, who retired after
being arrested, gets a three-month sentence in child pornography
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former elementary school teacher from Thousand Oaks was ordered
Monday to serve three months in jail for downloading and possessing
child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   James Robertson, 56, who was a fourth-grade teacher at White Oak
Elementary in Westlake Village, apologized during his sentencing
hearing and told a judge that he did not realize he was committing a
crime when he printed out sexually explicit images of children on his
home computer.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a great embarrassment that I stand in front of you,"
Robertson said. "I see very clearly now that what I have done was
harmful ... I am ready for whatever sentence you give today."</LD>
<TE>   Robertson, who retired from teaching after his arrest in August,
faced up to one year in Ventura County Jail after pleading guilty in
late October to two misdemeanor charges.</TE>
<TE>   He was originally charged with 20 misdemeanor counts, which
included one count for each printed picture of child porn that
authorities found in his home.</TE>
<TE>   During sentencing, Robertson's estranged wife, Jeane, pleaded for
leniency. She told Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie that she was
the one who turned in her husband to police for possessing child
porn.</TE>
<TE>   But she argued that Robertson, to whom she was married for 18
years, had been a good father and a dedicated educator who had never
harmed a child. They are now divorcing.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson has no prior criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe he is dangerous or a threat to society," she
said, adding that she and her 14-year-old daughter are financially
dependent on Robertson and cannot afford for him to be incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's lawyer, Tim Quinn, urged Brodie to spare his client
from a jail sentence. But the judge, agreeing with prosecutor Howard
Wise, ruled that some time behind bars was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Brodie told Robertson that the pictures were "degrading" and
"inhuman" and questioned how a teacher charged with protecting
children could download computer images that sexually exploit them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's offensive and you knew it," Brodie said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the three-month jail sentence, which Robertson must
begin serving in mid-January, he was placed on three years'
probation, ordered to register as a sex offender and attend sex
offender counseling, and barred from using the Internet at home.</TE>

<HD>Activists Branching Out in Tree Protest</HD>
<DH>Effects of Newhall Ranch subdivision to be target of Santa
Clarita demonstration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to turn support for tree-sitter John Quigley into a
broader campaign against sprawl, Santa Clarita environmentalists plan
a protest today targeting Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., which plans to
build a 21,600-home subdivision a few miles north of the 400-year-old
oak known as "Old Glory."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County officials say the tree must be moved to widen
Pico Canyon Road, which would provide access to Newhall Ranch and its
70,000 expected residents.</LD>
<LD>   Activists say the developer is pressuring county officials to
widen the road to four lanes, but Newhall officials say they do not
believe road-widening is necessary for their project.</LD>
<TE>   "They're trying to haul us into this battle," said Newhall
spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer. "That's both frustrating and
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The activists should take their complaints to developer John Laing
Homes, which must complete the road-widening project as part of a
county building permit for its subdivision across the street from the
tree, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The protest -- sponsored by local groups Friends of the Santa
Clara River, the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the
Environment and others -- is planned for 5 p.m. in front of Newhall's
offices at 23823 Valencia Blvd. in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley of Pacific Palisades has pledged since Nov. 1 to stay in
the tree until he receives a guarantee that it will not be moved or
cut down. Yet many of the conveniences of modern life continue to
make their way to his perch. On Monday, a dentist climbed the tree
and gave Quigley a temporary filling after he broke a molar.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he was told Monday by surveyors that Laing homes was
trying to find a way to build the road around the tree. Laing
spokeswoman Annette McCluskey said the company was considering all
options.</TE>
<TE>   "The door is not closed on anything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Activist Teresa Savaike said the protest will also focus on what
she believes will be Newhall Ranch's detrimental effects on traffic,
air quality, endangered species and oak trees -- 1,600 of which would
be lost as part of the proposed development.</TE>
<TE>   Lauffer said Newhall plans to preserve more than half of the
12,000-acre project as open space, saving about 90% of the 16,000
trees on the property.</TE>
<TE>   After the rally, the groups plan to walk across the street to
Santa Clarita City Hall to protest the removal of oak trees as part
of the proposed Needham Ranch development on the south side of Santa
Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial center calls for the removal of 800 oaks, but the
City Council has asked the developer to rework its plan so that fewer
trees are destroyed, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "John Quigley and Old Glory are symbols of all that will be lost
with Newhall Ranch and the Needham Ranch project," Savaike said.</TE>

<LD>A man armed with a knife abducted a 76-year-old woman Sunday night as
she walked home from church in the North Hollywood area and raped
her, Los Angeles police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The assailant first approached the woman on her way to church when
he asked her for directions, then accosted her as she was walking
home and dragged her at knifepoint into a white four-door minivan in
the 13000 block of Sherman Way, said LAPD spokesman Jack Richter.</LD>
<LD>   "It's outrageous, and a threat to everyone's safety when someone
so vulnerable is attacked," Richter said. "This is a high-priority
case."</LD>
<TE>   The assailant drove the woman to an undisclosed location and raped
her, police said. Her attacker then returned the woman to the area
where she was abducted. The victim, who was disoriented, walked home,
where relatives alerted authorities. She was treated at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center's Sherman Way Campus and held overnight,
police said.</TE>

<HD>Early-Morning Stroll Ends in Death for Pious Woman, 72</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A morning walk was one of the few indulgences Hai Huynh allowed
herself. The 72-year-old would walk briskly around her Irvine
neighborhood and then return to her sister's home at the top of the
hill, retreating to her bedroom where she would pray four times a day
at a makeshift shrine.</LD>
<LD>   She was beginning her ascent up the hill Monday morning when she
was struck and killed by a neighbor backing out of her driveway, a
violent end to a life shaped by simple and selfless acts.</LD>
<LD>   Huynh was struck about 8:30 a.m. as she walked on the sidewalk
near Ascension and Silent Night and dragged a short distance, said
Irvine Police Sgt. Wally Prestidge. She was pronounced dead at the
scene.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the sport-utility vehicle has not been cited.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor notified the woman's sister, Marguerite Le, who ran to
the scene. "I was never afraid of her walking in the neighborhood,"
said Le, 59. "She's been walking it for seven years. She knew every
step. But I've always warned her about cars."</TE>
<TE>   Huynh moved from another sister's home in Indiana to Le's house in
the gated neighborhood near Concordia University in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Her sister said Huynh was a devout Buddhist who lived a modest
life, worried about the well-being of others and followed a strict
vegetarian diet. Her white-walled bedroom had been given over to a
shrine.</TE>
<TE>   She prided herself on her attention to health.</TE>
<TE>   "She always joked with me that if everyone was like her, doctors
would be starving," Le said.</TE>
<TE>   Huynh would begin her day at 5:30 a.m., pulling on a gray robe and
kneeling on a green rug to pray for those suffering around the world.
She then changed to a burgundy sweater and a knit hat and headed out
for her hourlong walk.</TE>
<TE>   "She became a figure here," said Al Jaeger, 59, who met Huynh when
he began working as a gate attendant at the complex about five years
ago. "I'd see her every day. The people on [Concordia University]
campus know her. Security here knows her. It's just a ... shame."</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor, Ally Nguyen, said that Huynh saved money from her
Social Security checks and gave it to her to send to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd give me about $800 every two months and designated me to
send several hundred dollars to relatives, several hundred to a
temple and the rest to buy rice for an orphanage," said Nguyen, 52, a
live-in caretaker and neighbor who joined Huynh on her morning walks
during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Family members, neighbors and crisis counselors gathered at Le's
home and remembered Huynh, who had said she chose not to marry, have
children or even learn how to drive so that she could more completely
devote her time to Buddhism.</TE>
<TE>   Le said her sister would have wanted to pray for the driver of the
car that hit her."I pray for her on my sister's behalf," Le said. "I
know she is suffering too, and my sister would do that for her."</TE>

<HD>Property Tax Is a Rare Bright Spot for State Income</HD>
<DH>While most other revenue streams are down, California is
projected to receive at least 7% more from homeowners this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long blamed for not doing enough to fund schools, California
homeowners are one of the few revenue sources the state can count on
in this lean year, with property taxes -- due in part today --
projected to bring California and its localities at least 7% more
than last year.</LD>
<LD>   In some parts of Southern California, where the housing market has
been robust, county tax collectors expect to reap more than the state
average.</LD>
<LD>   While revenues from taxes on income, capital gains, sales and a
host of other goods and services are projected to be sharply down or
flat, property taxes are "the one area that's sustaining growth,"
said Dan Goodwin, assessor in Ventura County, where the tax roll is
nearly 10% larger than last year.</LD>
<TE>   As California officials grapple with a shortfall topping $21
billion, taxes on real estate are "keeping it from being a disaster,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today is the deadline for property owners to pay the first half of
their 2002-2003 taxes. The second installment is due April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, property taxes are projected to top $29 billion this
year, based on a 7.3% increase in the assessed values on which the
taxes are largely calculated, according to the State Board of
Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   Property taxes amount to 1% of a property's value in the year it
was purchased. Added in locally are service charges from agencies and
any debts levied to pay for bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 13, California's landmark taxpayer reform passed
in 1978, unless a property is sold, transferred or significantly
upgraded, the owner's tax bill can increase no more than 2% a year.
There are various quirks in the tax law, such as an allowance for
homeowners over 55 to retain their older, lower tax assessment if
they sell their home and move into a less expensive one.</TE>
<TE>   Because housing prices have far outpaced the cap on taxes, it
isn't just older, longtime owners who have benefited from Proposition
13.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bought a house five years ago, you're benefiting
dramatically," said Jim Dodd, Ventura County's deputy assessor.</TE>
<TE>   Before Proposition 13, localities could change tax rates from year
to year, based on their budgetary needs. Just as it was lauded for
making property tax bills more predictable, Proposition 13 has been
criticized for benefiting land-rich Californians at the expense of
public school students, who stand to benefit most from property tax
collections.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, taxpayers rushed to postmark their checks, pay by
computer or phone, or line up at county tax collectors' counters
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   To sweeten the prospect of paying taxes, Ventura County's
treasurer-tax collector, Larry Matheney, handed out Hershey's
chocolates to property owners as they made out their checks to him.</TE>
<TE>   The strong housing market in Ventura County has made for a tax
roll $66 million richer than last year -- it's now $746 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, as in the rest of the state, the tax collector
warned that residents who miss today's deadline will be charged a
hefty fee.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pay late -- by even one day -- you are assessed a 10%
late-payment penalty. It's very hard to get that waived, almost
impossible," Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach said, adding,
"I take no joy in collecting that."</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach's office issued 781,493 bills this year, calling for $2.9
billion in property taxes. That's more than 9% more money than in the
last fiscal year, which ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "That shows the growth in our county," Moorlach said. The rise
stems from "increased property values and 10,000 new parcels -- new
homes and other parcels subdivided from existing larger parcels."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's property assessment roll grew by more than 6%
for the fourth straight year, by $39.8 billion, county Assessor Rick
Auerbach said. During most of the 1990s, he said, 3% increases were
more common. The county issued $7.6 billion in tax bills this year.</TE>

said Dan Goodwin, assessor in Ventura County, where the tax roll is
nearly 10% larger than last year.</LD>
<TE>   As California officials grapple with a shortfall topping $21
billion, taxes on real estate are "keeping it from being a disaster,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today is the deadline for property owners to pay the first half of
their 2002-2003 taxes. The second installment is due April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, property taxes are projected to top $29 billion this
year, based on a 7.3% increase in the assessed values on which the
taxes are largely calculated, according to the State Board of
Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   Property taxes amount to 1% of a property's value in the year it
was purchased. Added in locally are service charges from agencies and
any debts levied to pay for bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 13, California's landmark taxpayer reform passed
in 1978, unless a property is sold, transferred or significantly
upgraded, the owner's tax bill can increase no more than 2% a year.</TE>
<TE>   There are various quirks in the tax law, such as an allowance for
homeowners over 55 to retain their older, lower tax assessment if
they sell their home and move into a less-expensive one.</TE>
<TE>   Because housing prices have far outpaced the cap on taxes, it
isn't just older, longtime owners who have benefited from Proposition
13.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bought a house five years ago, you're benefiting
dramatically," said Jim Dodd, Ventura County's deputy assessor.</TE>
<TE>   Before Proposition 13, localities could change tax rates from year
to year, based on their budgetary needs. Just as it was lauded for
making property tax bills more predictable, Proposition 13 has been
criticized for benefiting land-rich Californians at the expense of
public school students, who stand to benefit most from property tax
collections.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, taxpayers rushed to postmark their checks, pay by
computer or phone, or line up at county tax collectors' counters
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   To sweeten the prospect of paying taxes, Ventura County's
treasurer-tax collector, Larry Matheney, handed out Hershey's
chocolates to property owners.</TE>
<TE>   The strong housing market in Ventura County has made for a tax
roll $66 million richer than last year -- it's now $746 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, as in the rest of the state, the tax collector
warned that residents who miss today's deadline will be charged a
hefty fee.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pay late -- by even one day -- you are assessed a 10%
late-payment penalty. It's very hard to get that waived, almost
impossible," Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach said, adding,
"I take no joy in collecting that."</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach's office issued 781,493 bills this year, calling for $2.9
billion in property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than 9% more money than in the last fiscal year, which
ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "That shows the growth in our county," Moorlach said.</TE>
<TE>   The rise stems from "increased property values and 10,000 new
parcels -- new homes and other parcels subdivided from existing
larger parcels."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's property assessment roll grew by more than 6%
for the fourth straight year, by $39.8 billion, county Assessor Rick
Auerbach said.</TE>
<TE>   During most of the 1990s, he said, 3% increases were more common.
The county issued $7.6 billion in tax bills this year.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Group Visits Port Hueneme</HD>
<DH>Officials from city of Chongqing gather ideas on running a
harbor town. Local leaders hope the exchange will lead to trade ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A seven-member delegation from the Chinese city of Chongqing stopped
by the port and city of Hueneme on Monday to take an up-close look at
local government during a 10-day visit to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Six government employees and a bilingual businessman representing
a trading firm in China were welcomed by Port Hueneme Mayor Jon
Sharkey; Will Berg, director of marketing for the Oxnard Harbor
District; Arlene Fraser, executive director of the Chamber of
Commerce; and Bill Buratto, president of the Ventura County Economic
Development Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "We're a Pacific Rim city, and we need to do what we can to
capitalize on expanding international trade," Sharkey said.
"Somewhere down the line these kinds of visits can lead to increased
business at the port, which helps our city."</LD>
<TE>   Most of the five-man, two-woman delegation's questions concerned
the details of municipal government.</TE>
<TE>   After a presentation at City Hall that featured briefings by the
city's finance and community development directors, delegation
members got down to business.</TE>
<TE>   How is the city financed? How many employees are needed for a city
of Port Hueneme's size? Are budgets done annually or every six
months? How much is spent on services such as landscaping?</TE>
<TE>   "A goal of their visit is to look at the effects of international
trade on local economies," Sharkey said.</TE>
<TE>   Fraser gave an overview on how an American chamber of commerce
works with government and business interests to promote commerce,
along with helping new residents.</TE>
<TE>   Buratto reflected on the diversity of the Ventura County economy,
from the adjoining commercial port and Navy base, to agriculture,
biotechnology and retail.</TE>
<TE>   "From some of the questions that they asked, they were looking for
ways that we could partner," Buratto said.</TE>
<TE>   But the delegates' U.S. visit wasn't restricted to business
meetings -- they also spent a few days in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Chongqing, the most populous city in its own central province with
about 26 million residents, has a port on the Yangtze River. Because
of its location about 950 miles inland from Shanghai, it does not
receive large oceangoing cargo ships as does the Port of Hueneme,
according to Berg.</TE>
<TE>   Though Monday's meeting won't soon lead to additional business for
the deep-water port, Berg stressed the importance of maintaining such
contacts overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "It never hurts to keep the name of the Port of Hueneme alive and
active in China," he said. "It's important that we foster these
relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the harbor district established a "sister port"
arrangement with Qinhuangdao, an ocean port 200 miles east of Beijing
that handles about 60% of China's coal exports. Berg said Qinhuangdao
is a large apple-growing region but has little citrus, a principal
export from Ventura County.</TE>

<HD>Property Taxes Are Bright Spot for State Income</HD>
<DH>While most other revenue streams are down, California is
projected to receive at least 7% more from homeowners this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch and Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long blamed for not doing enough to fund schools, California
homeowners are one of the few revenue sources that can be counted on
in this lean year, with property taxes -- due in part today --
projected to bring the state and localities at least 7% more than
last year.</LD>
<LD>   In some parts of Southern California, where the housing market has
been robust, county tax collectors expect to reap more than the state
average.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, an expected $2.9 billion in property tax revenue
is nearly $250 million -- or 9% -- more than the previous year,
Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach said.</LD>
<TE>   He said the difference stems from "increased property values and
10,000 new parcels -- new homes and other parcels subdivided from
existing larger parcels."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County tax rolls are expected to jump 10% this year, with
Los Angeles County posting an increase of more than 6% for the fourth
straight year.</TE>
<TE>   As California officials grapple with a state budget shortfall
topping $21 billion, taxes on income, capital gains, sales and a host
of other goods and services are projected to be sharply down or flat.</TE>
<TE>   Only the boost in property values is keeping the state situation
"from being a disaster," Ventura County Assessor Dan Goodwin said.
"[It's] the one area that's sustaining growth."</TE>
<TE>   Today is the deadline for property owners to pay the first half of
their 2002-2003 taxes. The second installment is due April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, property taxes are projected to top $29 billion this
year, based on a 7.3% increase in the assessed values on which the
taxes are largely calculated, according to the State Board of
Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   Property taxes amount to 1% of a property's value in the year it
was purchased. Added in locally are service charges from agencies and
any debts levied to pay for bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 13, California's landmark taxpayer reform passed
in 1978, unless a property is sold, transferred or significantly
upgraded, the owner's tax bill can increase no more than 2% a year.
There are various quirks in the tax law, such as an allowance for
homeowners over 55 to retain their older, lower tax assessment if
they sell their home and move into a less expensive one.</TE>

date. They also can be taken to the county Treasurer-Tax Collector's
Office at 12 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana, where a drop-off box is
available after hours. Residents also can pay online at
http://tax.ocgov.com. Credit card payments also can be made online or
by telephone at (714) 834-3411.</TE>

<HD>Chief to Meet With Israeli Police, Political Leaders</HD>
<DH>Officials say Bratton's trip was scheduled before he
accepted the top LAPD post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William J. Bratton traveled to Israel this week to deliver a speech
and meet with police and political leaders, honoring a commitment
that Los Angeles officials say was made months before his selection
as chief of police.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton, who is scheduled to return to Los Angeles on Thursday, is
scheduled to speak to "OR YAROK" or "Green Light," a volunteer
organization dedicated to reducing traffic fatalities in the Jewish
state, said LAPD spokeswoman Mary Grady.</LD>
<LD>   The chief is also scheduled to hold meetings with Israeli police
organizations and political leaders in an effort to learn more about
the country's counter-terrorism measures.</LD>
<TE>   Grady said Bratton notified Mayor James K. Hahn and the city
Ethics Commission before embarking on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said that he had
encouraged Bratton to make the trip and also said that he believed
the speech was the second of two prior contractual commitments.</TE>
<TE>   "I encouraged Bill to do it because there's a real benefit to
having him there right now," Caruso said. "The leadership of the city
should go around the world to learn about a multitude of issues --
not only terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot to learn from the Israelis. That's no different
from people coming here to learn from the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   The trip comes as the department is assembling a new command staff

<HD>Davis Faces a Fight With Legislators on Budget Cuts</HD>
<DH>In brief meeting, Democrats pledge to battle for programs
while Republicans vow to oppose tax increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper and Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Top legislators vowed Monday to blunt Gov. Gray Davis' proposed cuts
to health and welfare spending, while some legislators and lobbyists
discussed putting measures on the ballot to raise taxes or protect
specific programs.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators convened briefly Monday to begin considering Davis'
proposed budget cuts. State officials say they face a $21-billion
deficit over the next 18 months -- $6 billion in the remainder of the
current fiscal year and $15 billion deficit for the fiscal year that
begins in June.</LD>
<LD>   Davis so far has proposed measures to reduce that deficit by $10.2
billion, including $3.2 billion from public schools and universities,
and $2 billion from health and welfare programs primarily for the
poor, elderly and infirm. Detailed hearings will not begin until next
week.</LD>
<TE>   But even before those hearings begin, some Democrats began their
campaign to fight for programs, while Republicans, relying on the
requirement that a two-thirds vote in both houses is necessary to
raise taxes, vowed to make any tax increases difficult. Noting that
Republican leaders are opposing tax increases, Senate President Pro
Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) criticized Davis' proposed health
and welfare cuts, and raised the possibility of an initiative or
Legislature-sponsored ballot measure seeking voters' approval for
specific aspects of the budget. Several others have suggested seeking
voters' approval for some sort of tax increase to forestall budget
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, we may do well to go to the ballot with a package
of restorations," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   From the other side of the aisle, Assembly Republican Leader Dave
Cox of Fair Oaks said he remains firm in his opposition to tax
increases, adding that he and other Republicans are exploring ways to
get around the state constitutional prohibition against carrying more
than $300,000 in debt from year to year, except in extreme
circumstances. Such a concept could be combined with a cap on state
spending. It too might require a ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is what can you do with the deficit. Can you roll it
over?" Cox asked. "Give the economy the opportunity to catch up and
then put a cap in place [on spending]. There are lots of things that
can be discussed."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of public employees' unions have floated a similar
idea, and are considering placing such a measure on a ballot, perhaps
aimed at a special election next year.</TE>
<TE>   While most Republicans say they oppose tax increases, the
Republican caucus is not completely unified on that issue. Earlier
this month, for example, Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge),
the Legislature's lone physician, introduced a bill, AB 30, to create
a special fund for health care, paid for by "new revenue sources,"
code for taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ideas being contemplated by Democrats and Republicans
are higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and a new tax on
health-care insurance policies. Also being weighed are higher income
taxes on the wealthiest Californians -- a notion that draws support
mainly from Democratic liberals -- an increase in the annual tax that
motorists must pay to register their vehicles, and extending the
sales tax, which now is limited to consumer goods other than food.</TE>
<TE>   Under the latter proposal, the overall sales tax rate could be
reduced, but sales taxes would be extended to include services such
as car repair, dry cleaning, and perhaps accounting and legal
services.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of asking voters to approve new taxes is not without
precedent. Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature won voters' approval
in 1993 to extend a half-percent sales tax increase to pay for police
and firefighting services. Earlier, voters approved a sales tax
increase to help pay for repairs to freeways and bridges damaged in
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Other measures have failed, including one in 1990 to raise taxes
by a nickel per drink on beer, wine and spirits. A measure to raise
income taxes on wealthy Californians failed in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators and some lobbying groups say the public may be willing
to approve some tax measures, given the depth of the current budget
problem and the magnitude of cuts proposed to education and
health-care spending. Los Angeles County voters' approval last month
of Measure B, which raises property taxes to pay for the county
health-care system, has helped fuel that belief. "Health care is on
everybody's mind right now," Assembly Health Committee Chairman Dario
Frommer (D-Los Angeles) said. "This may be the issue that we build a
coalition around, do a revenue increase, and address policy."</TE>
<TE>   In part, the tax debate is spurred by the magnitude of the cuts
being contemplated.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is suggesting paring education spending by more than $3
billion in a move that in the extreme could force layoffs or a
shortened school year. The governor also called for a cut of 10% in
state Medi-Cal payments to physicians, nursing homes and others who
provide care to elderly and disabled Californians who cannot afford
private insurance.</TE>
<TE>   He has also proposed legislation to shift $1 billion in sales
taxes on gasoline from transportation projects to general government
operations, a move that would crimp state transportation efforts but
would help ease the strain on other programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously not accepting the cuts," Frommer said. "These may
not be the cuts we decide to make. We may decide to cut somewhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is urging legislators to act on the cuts by the end of
January.</TE>
<TE>   But legislators don't plan to start holding hearings until next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said
serious discussion will not begin until Jan. 10, when Davis releases
his full spending plan for the 2003-04 fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we're going to solve this problem is on a bipartisan
basis," Davis said after meeting with legislative leaders Monday. "We
cannot do justice to the people of this state unless we rid ourselves
of politics and rigid ideology."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' preliminary plan presented Friday includes no tax
increases, and even if the Legislature adopted all his proposals, it
still would leave the state with a shortfall of $10 billion or more
over the next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he could not support deep reductions in social
services and education without a plan for closing the ongoing budget
gap.</TE>
<TE>   He said some programs were largely spared in the Davis proposal,
most notably tax breaks for businesses and major raises for
corrections officers.</TE>
<TE>   "If nobody is safe at the bottom, nothing is safe at the top,"
Burton said.</TE>

<HD>5 Injured in Collision of 2 Vans With 3 Cruisers Called to
Pursuit</HD>
<DH>Sheriff's deputies were trying to join effort to catch a
carjacking suspect when the accident occurred at a South Bay

<LD>A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy trying to join the pursuit of a
suspected carjacker was hospitalized when his patrol car and two
other cruisers collided with two vans at a South Bay intersection
Monday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Two occupants in one of the vans suffered minor injuries in the 10
a.m. crash on the border of Hawthorne and Lawndale.</LD>
<LD>   The deputy, William Palm, was listed in fair condition at
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center with a broken right leg, hip and left arm,
said Sheriff's Sgt. James Ramsey.</LD>
<TE>   County firefighters used hydraulic equipment to free the deputy
from the mangled wreckage of his overturned cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   The patrol car "flipped over a couple of times," said Deputy David
Cervantes. "The light bar was torn off the unit and the roof
crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Wreckage from the sheriff's cruiser, which was using a siren and
lights, was strewn across the intersection of Rosecrans and Prairie
avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Two other sheriff's cruisers and a second private vehicle also
were involved, authorities said. Deputy Bruce McCall suffered two
broken ribs, and Deputy Timothy Crise suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The collision occurred as deputies from the Lennox sheriff's
station were responding to an assistance call by deputies in pursuit
of a carjacking suspect on West Imperial Highway at South Vermont
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, who was later arrested, allegedly stole the car in
Lawndale, authorities said. Henry Daniel Flowers, 23, was booked on
suspicion of carjacking, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California police pursuits have come under increasing
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   A crash caused by a driver fleeing Los Angeles Police Department
officers in Sylmar resulted in the amputation of much of the left arm
of a 2 1/2-week-old boy. The Los Angeles Police Commission is
considering revising the LAPD's policies on pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies can initiate a pursuit, but are required to give
commanders specific information from the field concerning their
speed, location and specific reason for the chase, including what
type of law was violated.</TE>
<TE>   "The watch commander will take that information and determine
whether it falls within department guidelines," said Deputy Darren
Harris. "The deputies also have discretion to cancel a pursuit at any
time."</TE>

<HD>Disco Owner Calls Drug Raid a Payback</HD>
<DH>Gene La Pietra says his Hollywood secession bid sparked
reprisal. Hahn aide calls claim absurd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State authorities arrested five people in a drug raid at a Hollywood
nightclub over the weekend, a move the club's owner called
retaliation for his efforts to make Hollywood an independent city.</LD>
<LD>   "The police call this a drug raid. I call it a raid on my
reputation, and I'm very disappointed," Gene La Pietra, the leader of
the failed Hollywood secession movement, said of the action Saturday
at his club.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Mayor James K. Hahn dismissed La Pietra's claims.</LD>
<TE>   "It sounds like Gene La Pietra needs to focus more on cleaning up
his businesses than on making these absurd charges," said Matt
Middlebrook, deputy mayor for policy and communications.</TE>
<TE>   Among the five people arrested Saturday night on drug charges by
the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control were two employees
of La Pietra's Circus Disco, said Lupe Garcia, ABC assistant
director.</TE>
<TE>   Over seven months at the club, investigators from ABC and the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration bought more than 10,000
Ecstasy pills, worth more than $200,000 on the street, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC investigators, aided by the DEA, bought the Ecstasy, along
with cocaine, marijuana and katemine, on 26 occasions from 25
individuals, Garcia said. On six occasions, club employees either
facilitated or sold the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra was not arrested during the raid, and no official has
called him a target of the investigation. Garcia said, however, that
the ABC would look into possibly requesting penalties, such as a
suspension or revocation of the club's liquor license.</TE>
<TE>   In response to La Pietra's claim that he was targeted because of
secession, Garcia said, "This is a state investigation. We initiated
this over seven months ago."</TE>
<TE>   "We've been checking nightclubs, not only in this area, but
elsewhere in the state" looking for Ecstasy sales at rave events, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said he has never had any kind of violation in more than
three decades of owning the club. He also said that if the
investigation began seven months ago, it was just at the time that
Hollywood secessionists won their fight to put a secession measure on
the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference outside Circus Disco on Monday afternoon, La
Pietra said he was present at the raid, which began about 11:15 p.m.
Saturday. He said he saw about 100 Los Angeles Police Department
officers entering his property through three gates--evidence, he
said, of the city's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello said police deployed 15
uniformed officers, three plainclothes detectives and one supervisor
to assist about 40 ABC investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is entirely an ABC investigation. We had a supporting role
in the service of the search warrant, as we would with any outside
agency serving a warrant in the city of Los Angeles," Pasquariello
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by Flier</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said the investigation began when ABC investigators saw a
flier on a car windshield "inviting people to a rave event at
Circus." He said investigators also found references to rave parties
at the club on Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation relied, in part, on the work of Trinka D.
Porrata, whom an ABC press release described as "one of the nation's
leading experts on Ecstasy and rave events."</TE>
<TE>   The ABC said Porrata visited the club and described what she saw
as a rave event because of "lack of drug or weapon searches at the
front door, extensive security, numerous patrons under the influence
of designer drugs, the type of music, laser lighting, glow sticks,
sales of water bottles and so-called power drinks with a high
concentration of caffeine such as Red Bull, an outside cooling off
area, and other factors."</TE>
<TE>   The press release said that caffeine enhances the Ecstasy high and
"creates a super high which gives a hallucinogenic effect," and that
loud music, laser lights and glow sticks add to "the psychedelic
effect." It said water counters dehydration from Ecstasy and other
designer drugs.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said the club is not the site of raves.</TE>
<TE>   "Raves are for kids, for teenagers. My club is 21 and over," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the club also doesn't have a cooling off area, but does
have an emergency medical technician on hand in a tent outside.</TE>
<TE>   "So does Disneyland. So do a lot of churches," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for selling the caffeinated drink Red Bull, he said it's
available everywhere, "from high schools to the Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   "And water! Everyone sells water," he said. "It's the national
drink."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Gave Stars Drugs, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Physician prescribed addictive narcotics to Winona Ryder
and Courtney Love, a state report says. He lost his license last
week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein and Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jules Mark Lusman, whose medical license was revoked last week for
prescribing addictive drugs to celebrities, frequently provided
narcotics on a "cash-and-carry" basis to the rich and famous,
including Winona Ryder and singer-actress Courtney Love, according to
a state report.</LD>
<LD>   Lusman, 49, may face criminal prosecution, authorities said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In its report, the Medical Board of California said the Santa
Monica physician's stated specialty was laser surgery. But he also
catered to "the demands of wealthy and/or famous drug-seekers for
prescription narcotics which would otherwise have to be obtained on
the street," the report stated.</LD>
<TE>   The doctor frequently made house calls to celebrities, examining
them only briefly before prescribing drugs, the report said. Lusman
used one drug, the powerful and potentially addictive Demerol, as
"his first weapon" against pain complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor charged thousands of dollars for those house calls; in
one case, the doctor received a $3,000 "retainer" charged to a sick
patient's credit card. "The reason for such a fee cannot be
fathomed," the medical board concluded.</TE>
<TE>   In total, Lusman's conduct resembled "the sub-plot of a Raymond
Chandler novel," the board said.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman called the decision "grossly unfair" in an interview Monday
with the television program "Inside Edition," which said he had been
interviewed at his mother's home in South Africa. He also denied any
wrongdoing in his treatment of Ryder, star of "Age of Innocence" and
"Girl, Interrupted."</TE>
<TE>   Before the board, Lusman argued that "his care and treatment fell
within the standard of care at all times for a physician in his
community with his practice emphasis."</TE>
<TE>   But the report identified eight patients and cited their treatment
as grounds for revoking his license. One patient received
approximately 360 prescriptions over five years, more than two-thirds
from Lusman. The medical board's report identified patients only by
initials. One was identified as C.L., whom the report went on to
describe as "a fairly well known musician" who "at one time had been
married to Mr. C., who had passed away."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Love, the widow of rock singer Kurt Cobain,
declined to comment on the board's assertions. Two sources familiar
with the investigation, however, confirmed that the C.L. in the
report was Love.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with several of the people alleged in the report
to be patients of Lusman objected that the medical board had violated
their privacy by detailing what Lusman's files contained.</TE>
<TE>   "The California medical board never made any attempt to ascertain
the accuracy of the information in Dr. Lusman's files," the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to those files, C.L. was treated by Lusman during the
summer of 2001, and received Demerol and prescriptions for syringes
and the hypnotic drugs Ambien and Xanax.</TE>
<TE>   She was not the only patient to be prescribed Demerol with the
understanding that it would be injected by the patients, the state
found.</TE>
<TE>   Candis Cohen, a spokeswoman for the state board, which licenses
and regulates California's 112,000 physicians, said criminal
proceedings are possible. "It is very rare for a physician's license
to be revoked," she said. Statewide, the medical board revoked 38
medical licenses during the year ending on June 30. A state
administrative judge determines whether physicians should lose their
licenses based on evidence from board investigators.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's
office declined to say Monday whether the office will consider
criminal charges against Lusman. The spokesman also would not say
whether the district attorney is investigating other physicians who
prescribed addictive painkillers to Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   A native of South Africa, Lusman was once disciplined by medical
authorities there for "improper prescription of medications to a
patient."</TE>
<TE>   California authorities were made aware of Lusman's record when he
moved here in 1990, and kept him on probation for two years.</TE>
<TE>   In a probation report in the Ryder case, state investigators and
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported that Lusman had
been "kicked out of South Africa for overmedicating people. He came
to California and is the doctor to many celebrity people." That
report did not identify Lusman's other alleged celebrity clients.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman's role as a doctor to the stars came to light after police
found eight types of prescription drugs in Ryder's possession last
December while booking her for shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ryder's probation report, released Friday, Ryder had
37 prescriptions filled by 30 doctors from January 1996 to December
1998. She obtained the medications from a Rite-Aid drugstore on
Sunset Boulevard as well as pharmacies in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In a subsequent search of Lusman's home, car and office, state
board investigators found the doctor had written several
prescriptions to the two-time Oscar nominee under her stage name as
well as the alias Emily Thompson. Last March, the state revoked part
of Lusman's license, preventing him from "prescribing, furnishing,
dispensing or distributing" controlled substances.</TE>
<TE>   The state board report identified a patient E.T. as a "well known
entertainer." Lusman prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety
medication for E.T.'s "anxious pain," "insomnia," scoliosis and
injured wrist.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2001, E.T. told Lusman she needed more Vicoprofen
despite having received a prescription for 65 pills days earlier,
according to the board. Lusman refilled her prescription with 30
more, the board said.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators also reported that E.T. signed up for cosmetic
laser surgery -- Lusman's stated specialty -- in October 2001.
Although no records indicate that either the surgery or a medical
exam was performed, E.T. received prescriptions for Vicoprofen, Xanax
and a third, unknown drug. The patient paid Lusman $1,000 on that
day, state regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder told county probation officers that she took those and other
drugs to treat a herniated disk she suffered while rehearsing for a
movie. Days before her arrest, Ryder said, she also injured her arm.</TE>
<TE>   "If the defendant was under 'pain management guidance,' then the
procedures that are recognized to effect pain were certainly not
followed by" Lusman, the Ryder probation report said. "Apparently, he
was a popular doctor because he made house calls and hotel calls."</TE>
<TE>   Lusman lost his license the same day a Los Angeles County judge
sentenced Ryder, 31, to three months probation, community service and
drug and psychological counseling for shoplifting $5,560 in designer
merchandise last year from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The medical board fined Lusman $74,979.58 to compensate the state
for its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, said he knew of no other
investigations involving doctors who prescribed drugs to her.</TE>
<TE>   "All were completely legitimate," Geragos said Monday. "Lusman was
legitimate, but I don't know what his problems are.... The other
doctors are well thought of."</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, Lusman can petition the medical board to get his
license reinstated in two to three years. Cohen, the board
spokeswoman, said that Lusman would have to prove to the state that
his problem is "cured."</TE>

<LD>By the time a battered woman seeks help, experts say, she is usually
so traumatized that she is unable to help the other victims of her
abusive partner: her children.</LD>
<LD>   That is where the professionals and volunteers at Sojourn Services
for Battered Women and Their Children come in.</LD>
<LD>   "We try to do very therapeutic and healing programs," said Erika
Stewart, assistant director of Sojourn, which is based in Santa
Monica. "We teach children how to play in ways where everybody wins."</LD>
<TE>   Children who have witnessed violence show many of the same
symptoms as those who were abused, Stewart said. They have difficulty
concentrating, negotiating and trusting. They are easily startled and
often have no sense of safe boundaries with strangers.</TE>
<TE>   A key goal of Sojourn is to persuade children who have seen
violence at home not to resort to violence when conflicts arise.</TE>
<TE>   "What we try to do at Sojourn is give the children the skills
needed to go out into the world and become problem solvers," said
Roxann Smith, director of development for the Ocean Park Community
Center, an umbrella organization for Sojourn and five other projects
serving low-income and homeless individuals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the most recent year for which data are available, Los
Angeles County accounted for nearly a third of the 186,000 calls
statewide for assistance related to domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   According to federal data, more than half of female victims of
such violence live in households with children younger than 12.</TE>
<TE>   "In other shelters, the mom is the primary client," Stewart said.
"Sojourn always had an amazing awareness that children were our
clients too."</TE>
<TE>   Ocean Park Community Center has received a $15,000 grant from the
Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, an annual fund-raising drive that
aids organizations serving children and families in Southern
California. The center plans to use the money for children's programs
at Sojourn's two shelters.</TE>
<TE>   One is a crisis shelter with 15 beds and two cribs that has
operated for 25 years, taking in battered women and their offspring
for six weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The other is a new 18-bed transitional shelter designed to serve
36 women and children annually, each for six months.</TE>
<TE>   The children's programs, intended to stimulate as well as soothe,
include play areas with jungle gyms, bikes, trucks, blocks, puzzles,
art supplies, books and other items for nonviolent activities.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Times Holiday Campaign raised $653,000, which was
distributed to more than 50 charitable organizations in Los Angeles,
Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The Times and
the McCormick Tribune Foundation absorb all administrative costs.</TE>

<HD>King-Drew Hospital Programs in Trouble</HD>
<DH>Radiology training loses its accreditation. County
affiliation agreement could be in jeopardy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medical regulators are withdrawing their accreditation from a key
training program at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center and
have found problems that could hamper the hospital's ability to serve
patients, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move raises "significant questions" about the county's
affiliation agreement with Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and
Science, which manages medical care at the hospital, Dr. Thomas
Garthwaite, director of health services for Los Angeles County, said
in a memo to the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has
revoked the accreditation of King-Drew's diagnostic radiology program
and found "significant deficiencies" in the office that handles all
medical training at the facility, Garthwaite said.</LD>
<TE>   The hospital's internal medicine training program has been put on
probation, and its general surgery program has been proposed for
probation.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by a separate accrediting body, the American College of
Surgeons, found so many problems at the institution that it may
restrict the level of trauma care the hospital can provide. The
hospital's trauma designation has not been changed.</TE>
<TE>   King-Drew officials are appealing the decision to withdraw
accreditation from the radiology program, which takes effect in June
2004. But the hospital has stopped accepting new radiology residents
for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really revamping everything," said Marcelle Willock, dean
of the College of Medicine at the historically black Drew University.
"A lot of it boils down to dollars, of course."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Garthwaite said patients are not at risk at
King-Drew, the sole major hospital for one of the poorest, sickest
and most densely populated stretches of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're in any more danger at King-Drew than they
are at any other hospital," he said. "It's an accredited hospital."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said that if King-Drew
loses some of its graduate programs, the effect would be
"devastating, absolutely devastating."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has to get on the ball and come up with some answers,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In withdrawing its approval of the radiology program, the
accreditation board found that medical residents do not receive
enough supervision while working in the emergency room. In addition,
only 15.4% of residents from 1997 to 2001 passed their oral exam for
board certification on their first attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The radiology program has 12 current residents, according to a
county spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The program has been cited repeatedly for poor board scores for
the last eight years," wrote Judith Armbruster, executive director of
the radiology residency review committee in an Oct. 22 letter.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the group's concerns, Drew officials said that their
board pass rates are improving, and that problems with supervision in
the emergency room have been rectified. Willock said some of the
citations arose because the county has not provided enough support
staff, so physicians must fill in.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said she will formally ask the medical center and university
for corrective action plans at today's Board of Supervisors meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The big test for King-Drew will come in April, when the
accrediting group reviews its overall graduate medical education
office. If it receives an unfavorable rating, the impact would be
"significant" on all training programs there, Garthwaite said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get everyone to take it extremely seriously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Willock said that the school is doing so, and that it and the
county must continue to push each other to ensure they improve.
"Unfortunately, a lot of things don't happen until there's a crisis,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said the previous clinical leadership at the hospital
should have pushed harder to address problems. The hospital has a new
interim executive director and medical director, and Drew University
has a new medical school dean, Willock -- all of whom Garthwaite said
are committed to fixing the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Drew's greatest challenge now, he said, is attracting teachers and
researchers without the resources of some other big universities.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the medical needs in South Los Angeles, Garthwaite
proposed to keep King-Drew open despite the county's projected
multimillion-dollar budget deficit. If other hospitals were required
to close, he proposed Harbor-UCLA and Olive-View UCLA medical centers
as more appropriate targets.</TE>
<TE>   But Garthwaite said King-Drew could become more efficient because
its costs outpace those of other county hospitals. The health
services department hired a consulting firm, Renoir Corp., to look
for ways to cut 16% of the hospital's budget. The group has presented
its findings about ways to better use operating rooms and better
deploy emergency room staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to succeed," he said. "What I'm trying to do is find
the right mixture of forces to get them to continue to change in the
right direction. I don't think the current management has been given
a chance to show what it can do."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the county budget cuts, Garthwaite also is looking to
revamp the health department's overall affiliations with medical
schools. He has considered eliminating the links between individual
hospitals and schools, in favor of a broader tie between medical
schools and the entire health system.</TE>

<HD>MTA Official Left Old Job Under a Cloud</HD>
<DH>The transit agency's new head of security, a former police
chief, intervened in the traffic stop of a woman with whom he had an
affair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's new head of security is a
former police chief from Washington state who resigned amid
accusations that he had obstructed the arrest of a woman with whom he
had an extramarital affair.</LD>
<LD>   Stan Reeves, former police chief of Vancouver, Wash., was never
charged with wrongdoing after an investigation into the incident,
though officials said he had used "poor judgment."</LD>
<LD>   Reeves, whose first day of work at the MTA was Monday, will
oversee all aspects of security at the agency as chief of transit
police, a new post.</LD>
<TE>   MTA's deputy CEO, John Catoe, said he feels strongly that, despite
the controversy that embroiled Reeves last summer, the new chief is
the right man for the job. "I look at him from an experience
standpoint," Catoe said. "My concern about the allegations is zero."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the MTA's revamped security plan, Reeves will help
oversee officers deployed by the Los Angeles Police Department and
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The two agencies are
contracted by the MTA to provide security for the county's bus and
rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves will also be responsible for implementing the MTA's
anti-terrorist plan and running the agency's force of about 100
officers, who mainly guard MTA buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves is employed under a conditional offer as the agency
completes a state-required background check, according to Catoe. He
is slated to make $140,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves' tenure as head of the 206-officer police department in
Vancouver, a city of about 50,000 near Portland, Ore., ended in a
maelstrom. The controversy stemmed from a May 2001 traffic stop
involving a woman with whom he acknowledged having had an affair,
according to an investigative report released by the Washington State
Patrol and an interview with the chief criminal prosecutor in the
Washington attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found that Reeves intervened in the traffic stop --
arriving at the site where the woman had been pulled over, taking her
from an officer and driving her away. But they cleared Reeves of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's chief criminal prosecutor, Brian Moran, said the
woman's blood alcohol level had been .08, right at the legal limit in
Washington, and an arrest would not have been mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line here is there was some bad judgment involved on
the chief's part," Moran said. "But there was nothing clearly
prosecutable."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a year after the incident, it was reported in the press and
the probe resulted. Reeves resigned in May, the day the investigation
was announced. Reeves, 52, told officials he was quitting for health
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Catoe said he believes Reeves has the skills needed to oversee the
transit agency's security, particularly because of his background
providing contract security at the University of Oregon, where he
served as director of public safety before going to Vancouver. Reeves
also worked for 17 years for the Eugene, Ore., police department.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves takes his new position as the MTA is involved in protracted
contract negotiations, expected to wrap up by next summer, with the
LAPD and Sheriff's Department. LAPD officials have expressed the
worry that Reeves' new post might have too much power over the
department's officers.</TE>

<HD>A Rescue Mission Near UC Santa Barbara Came With Its Own

<LD>Reader Margo Kline tipped me to a recent article headlined "Rescue
Workers Extricate Dudes" in UC Santa Barbara's Daily Nexus newspaper.
It seems that two adventurous surfers crashed into the rocks below
some cliffs near the campus and were stranded there. The dudes were
eventually rescued by firefighters who pulled them up by rope.</LD>
<LD>   What made the event more unusual was that the woebegone
wave-riders received moral support during the rescue from some UCSB
students who live in ocean-side housing. "The whole thing seemed kind
of comical because the surfers were pretty calm, so we brought two of
our biggest speakers outside facing the water and blasted 'Eye of the
Tiger' from 'Rocky' and 'Don't Worry, Be Happy,' " said Marty
Machado, a senior art studio major.</LD>
<LD>   "After everything was over, one of the guys came up and thanked
our building for calling the Fire Department and for playing the
music."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly a stocking stuffer: Audrey Richards of Long Beach
noticed that one business has a gift suggestion that can only be
termed down to earth (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still digging around: "You better wear your hip boots when you
order this salad," wrote John Shaboo of L.A., who enclosed an unusual
menu item (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Always read the small print: That's right. Susan Salazar of La
Verne points out that not until you read the parking regulations at
the bottom of one hotel sign that you find out that the rates apply
only to cars less than two feet long (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Visalia, I'll tell ya: Ray Estrada saw an episode of the TV show
"24" that committed the crime of mispronouncing the town of Visalia.
"It's vie-sail-ya, not vuh-sal-ya," said Estrada, who grew up in
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, few cities have been pronounced in more ways than Los
Angeles. The Chamber of Commerce issued a ditty in the 1880s that
said, "The Lady would remind you, please/Her name is not Lost Angie
Lees" -- which was just how President Theodore Roosevelt pronounced
it on a later visit here.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1900s, The Times printed a daily endorsement of the
Spanish version: loss AHNG-hay-less.</TE>
<TE>   But an anglicized version, Loss AN-juh-less, won out, though one
L.A. mayor, Sam Yorty, opted for loss ANG-uh-lus. Fortunately, most
everyone gets L.A. right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

first item, I can't stop humming that darn song.</TE>

<LD>Is it just me, or is the mail a lot creepier this season? I've been
combat-trained on political mailers. I'm prepped for the
passively-aggressively chatty holiday newsletters.</LD>
<LD>   But this, as the TV-casters say to scare you into paying
attention, is a new and alarming trend! Letters haven't been this
loaded with grim tidings since the mail brought sprinklings of
anthrax to Florida and Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   * The letter on the machinists union Web site announcing that
United Airlines would be filing for bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   * The letter read to Catholics across California on Sunday telling
the faithful that their spiritual shepherds would be calling their
own wrath down to stop a state law that lifts the statute of
limitations on molestations for a year to let victims of priestly
abuse have a day or more in court.</TE>
<TE>   * The letter from Saddam Hussein, read on Iraqi TV, apologizing
for invading Kuwait in 1990; you just know Hussein had his fingers
crossed behind his back when he wrote that, or, more likely, told his
goons to cross some political prisoner's fingers behind his back --
permanently.</TE>
<TE>   * The letter to the editor from the former Bush White House
consultant apologizing for using the term "Mayberry Machiavellis" to
describe White House aides; this was very bad news to me because I
thought the letter was going to apologize to the town of Mayberry,
individually and severally, from Floyd the Barber to Goober the
Mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   * The pink-slip letters firing two investigators who uncovered "a
culture of theft" at hush-hush Los Alamos nuclear lab.</TE>
<TE>   So I'll be using a bit of this space to give Santa a heads-up
about his mailbags. At this moment some wiseacre kid is probably
crafting an "I want a .22 rifle-or-else" letter. Let the elves open
the mail; that's what they get workers' comp for.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150,000 Angelenos recently opened our mailboxes to "you
may already be a business" shakedown letters -- out-of-the-blue
missives demanding business taxes, fees and late penalties from
people who hadn't a clue that their little endeavors, like taking
clippings from their garden and potting them to sell at street fairs,
could make them as much fair game for the tax collector as Arco --
and, more deplorably than even a law-abiding, tax-paying petro-giant,
make them scofflaws for not knowing they were operating a taxable
business.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles council member Wendy Greuel has sent a letter of her
own, to the head of the city finance department who sent out those
letters with Mayor Jim Hahn's blessing. Greuel wants the city to give
a break, a penalty waiver, a one-time get-out-of-jail-free card to
those folks who didn't know that excessive dog-sitting is a business
-- and she is also bringing in some of those folks to the City
Council meeting tomorrow to describe the nasty postmarked surprise
that came from City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   And now another 133 letters have made it to the 90012 mail chute,
addressed to all 133 people who ran for the City Council and mayor
positions that yes-on-secession votes would have created in Hollywood
and the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The letters are from Hahn and pro-secession businessman and Police
Commissioner Bert Boeckmann, inviting all 133 to a meeting next
Monday in Encino. Hahn praises each addressee for the "commitment" to
improving his or her part of town, and asks "your ideas, particularly
your thoughts on ways to improve the quality of life in every Los
Angeles neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   I was trying to think of where I'd heard before about an
invitation with the potential of this one. Maybe it was from the
"Thousand and One Arabian Nights," the tale of a caliph who vowed
that he wanted to make nice with his enemies, invited them all to
dinner, and had them done away with between the soup and the entree.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe I was thinking of Saddam Hussein. His sons-in-law
defected to Jordan, but Saddam wheedled them into coming back to
Iraq, all was forgiven, let's have a nice roast goat and let bygones
be bygones -- and then had 'em whacked. Hahn should craft something
warm and welcoming for the 133 who wanted to stray from his flock. I
like Lincoln's second inaugural speech -- "with malice toward none,
with charity for all ... let us strive on ... to bind up the nation's
wounds.... " Hahn should use the second inaugural spirit as a
blueprint for binding up the city's post-secession wounds. He can't
match Lincoln's phrasemaking; the letter is written in that
particularly hideous language, Bureaucratian, wallowing around in
lardy phrases like "governance structure."</TE>
<TE>   These invitations will reach every candidate, from the Hollywood
guy who printed up "Free Winona" T-shirts to Valley mayor aspirant
Assemblyman Keith Richman, a Republican and MD, and Gene La Pietra,
the nightclub owner who wanted to be mayor of Hollywood. He is
steamed about a weekend raid on his Hollywood nightclub by about 100
law enforcement officers, an action that netted five arrests and six
figures' worth of illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Was it drugs, La Pietra is wondering darkly -- or ... retaliation
for the secession campaign? "The timing is very suspect, no question
about it ... they call it a drug raid, and I say it's a raid on my
reputation." Granted, La Pietra can be a bit over the top, but City
Hall in full secession reward-and-retaliation mode is something many
people have muttered fearfully about.</TE>
<TE>   Want to put La Pietra and the other 132 at ease? Permit me a
suggestion: no more letters. Next Monday, at that get-together in
Encino, Jim Hahn should be the first to taste the punch.</TE>

<HD>Hahn to Talk Up 'State of Valley' With Its Leaders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to mend fences after a bitter secession campaign, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn plans to credit his opponents in the San Fernando
Valley today with spurring reform in City Hall. He also has invited
the former candidates for office in the proposed Valley and Hollywood
cities to meet next week.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn is scheduled to give a "State of the Valley" speech at the
annual meeting of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., a group
that endorsed secession. The mayor is attempting to enlist the
support of the business community as he deals with his latest
pressing issue: rising crime.</LD>
<LD>   "The debate on whether to keep our city united changed Los Angeles
and the way city government does business," according to a draft of
the speech. "The old bureaucracy has given way to a new and
reinvigorated Los Angeles. And the state of the San Fernando Valley
has never been stronger."</LD>
<TE>   In the speech, the mayor plans to outline the city's success in
building or renovating parks, police stations, fire stations and
libraries in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He will also note that the city has redrawn City Council
boundaries to give the Valley a fifth district completely within the
Valley. Record miles of street paving, sidewalk repairs and tree
trimming have been budgeted.</TE>
<TE>   "Never before has Los Angeles city government been so focused on
listening to, and then meeting, the needs of the collection of
neighborhoods that make up the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles,"
the draft says.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also plans to use his speech to ask the business
community to help the city tackle the rising crime rate in the Valley
and throughout Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He says business leaders can become active in Neighborhood
Councils, refer potential candidates to the Los Angeles Police
Academy and make financial donations to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn says in the speech draft that he has asked the City Council
to enact business tax reforms to encourage a strong local economy.
But that goal can also be advanced by making the city safer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are attracted by clean and safe neighborhoods, not by
those ridden with crime and torn apart by gangs," the draft says.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also plans to ask the Industry and Commerce Assn. and
other Valley groups to work with him to "implement the types of
reforms that serve to enhance the quality of life for all Los Angeles
residents and businesses."</TE>
<TE>   That same message has gone out in a letter of invitation to the
132 secessionists who ran for office in the proposed Hollywood and
San Fernando Valley cities.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, co-signed by secession backer and Police Commissioner
Bert Boeckmann, urged people to attend a town hall meeting with the
mayor and put past differences aside so the two sides can come up
with a unified approach to making City Hall work better.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is likely to face some skepticism, if not downright
hostility, when he meets with the former candidates at the Encino
Community Center next Monday night, judging from some initial
reaction to the letter, which was sent Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a public relations ploy. It's a sham," said Marc Strassman,
one of the 10 candidates for mayor of the Valley city. "To have more
than 100 people standing around asking the mayor questions is
ludicrous. There are other ways to get our input if he was sincere.
He could talk to us one on one."</TE>
<TE>   Voters citywide defeated Valley secession by a 2-1 ratio in the
Nov. 5 election, although the measure won 50.7% of the votes in the
Valley.</TE>

<HD>Work Starts on Traffic Center</HD>
<DH>New Eagle Rock facility is to monitor and manage freeways
in L.A. and Ventura counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State transportation officials announced Monday the start of
construction of a $46-million transportation management center that
they hope will help them better monitor and manage traffic in Los
Angeles and Ventura counties.</LD>
<LD>   The center will replace a much smaller operation at Caltrans
headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. In addition, the center, to be
completed by 2004, will hold the California Highway Patrol's
emergency dispatch facility, now near Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The 89,000-square-foot center on West Broadway in Eagle Rock will
be the state's largest transportation management center, according to
California Department of Transportation officials. Construction is
being funded primarily by gasoline tax revenue.</LD>
<TE>   From the center, state transportation officials and Highway Patrol
officers will be able to monitor freeway traffic via closed-circuit
cameras, pavement sensors and 911 calls. In response to emergencies,
technicians at the center will be able to dispatch tow trucks or CHP
officers. To improve traffic flow, center technicians will be able to
adjust ramp meters and send traffic advisory messages via radio
transmitters or changeable message signs.</TE>
<TE>   "People can't work if they can't get to work," said Doug Failing,
Caltrans director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Many transportation experts agree that California cannot keep up
with the state's growing transportation demands by building more
freeway miles, especially with a projected $21-billion-plus state
budget shortfall next year. Instead, they said, the most efficient
way to ease Southern California's freeway congestion is to manage
traffic better on freeways with remote-controlled cameras, road
sensors and tow trucks on patrol to quickly clear away accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is building a $171-million headquarters in downtown Los
Angeles, but Failing said the new transportation management center
was not included in the headquarters building plan because it does
not meet the more stringent seismic standards needed for the center.
The transportation management center in Eagle Rock is designed to
withstand a severe earthquake and continue operating on its own power
supply.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Caltrans transportation management center, technicians
monitor brightly colored screens and computer terminals, from which
they can control 350 closed-circuit cameras, 100 changeable message
signs and 850 ramp meters. Caltrans officials hope that the center
eventually will be connected to 450 closed-circuit cameras, 150
changeable message signs and nearly 1,200 ramp meters.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be able to put in more tools and more gadgets," said
Osama Assaad, a Caltrans senior transportation engineer.</TE>

<HD>Activist's Hopes Rooted in Change</HD>
<DH>Tree-sitter John Quigley would like the story of the
threatened oak to start debate on the costs of growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A chain-link fence surrounds the 400-year-old oak tree near Santa
Clarita in which John Quigley has been defiantly perched for more
than a month. Each day, small children press against it, gazing
wide-eyed through gnarled branches to see the man who doesn't want
the enormous tree cut down.</LD>
<LD>   Attached to the fence are dozens of their notes, some from entire
elementary school classes. They don't always fully understand the
problem: that a road is planned right where the old tree sits.</LD>
<LD>   "Do not cut the tree....A man lives there," reads the uneven
scrawl of one young writer.</LD>
<TE>   Children boil things down to the bare bones, and to many this has
become a story of good versus bad. Quigley said he has tried to keep
his message just that simple, to let people know that it's possible
for one person to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a children's story: A man climbed up in a tree to keep
it from being cut down," he said. "Even if you're not an
environmentalist, you can understand that."</TE>
<TE>   But Quigley, 42, also acknowledged last week that he hopes his
save-one-tree campaign sparks a larger debate about the more complex
issue of growth in an increasingly crowded Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The tree, after all, is ancient against an ever-changing landscape
of new homes, chain stores and shopping centers. Many of those who
have come out to support Quigley live in the new houses. They're part
of the growth machine pushing relentlessly into the region's
remaining open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, workmen were putting red tiles onto another new house
in a new development whose homes look down on the tree from across a
narrow, two-lane road. It's this road that the county says must be
widened to four lanes to accommodate traffic from another planned
subdivision nearby.</TE>
<TE>   So what is the answer? How do we balance growth with our need to
protect the environment?</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to take care of the areas that are already developed,
if we were to invest in our cities so that people wouldn't want to
move farther and farther out, we wouldn't have the kind of pressures
that we're having on the environment," Quigley said. "I hope that the
folks in this community will reflect on that, because there is an
irony here. As a society, we have focused so much on convenience at
all costs. Most of the planning that's been done is just about how
much money and how fast. We need a fundamental shift in our
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he grew up in suburban Washington, D.C., next to a
forest. He took it for granted in a way. But when he came to Los
Angeles after college, what he saw made him an activist.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a big awakening when I moved to L.A. and saw all the
density, the air pollution, the concrete," he said, during a short
break to stretch his legs on solid ground. "I thought, 'Is this where
it's all headed? Does it have to be?' "</TE>
<TE>   Some people resent that Quigley is an import and that he lives in
Pacific Palisades, far from the tree, and that his protest has turned
the area surrounding the tree into a kind of crunchy-granola
festival, complete with aging hippies in overalls and posters
decorated with peace signs.</TE>
<TE>   Up close, Quigley looks like a man who's been living out in the
harsh wind and sun for weeks, his clothes smudged with bark dust, his
face a deep, parched reddish-brown. He looks like a man sorely out of
place in the tidy suburbs. But he said he understood the suburban
dream, to live in nice homes with nice backyards in nice communities.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this tree represents the American dream as it should be.
It's about respecting our heritage," he said. "In many ways, we don't
respect our elders, both our human elders and nature, what came
before us. I think we need to undertake a fundamental shift in our
values, to recognize that everything is a subset of the environment,
and if we do not respect the environment, we're contributing to our
own demise."</TE>
<TE>   On the fence, one handmade poster quotes "The People, Yes," a poem
by Carl Sandburg:</TE>
<TE>   The people so often sleepy, weary, enigmatic,</TE>
<TE>   is a vast huddle with many units saying:</TE>
<TE>   "I earn my living.</TE>
<TE>   I make enough to get by</TE>
<TE>   and it takes all my time.</TE>
<TE>   If I had more time</TE>
<TE>   I could do more for myself</TE>
<TE>   And maybe for others."</TE>
<TE>   Up in the tree, Quigley has had a lot of time to think. It's taken
him out of the busy-ness of everyday life. Speaking of the support
he's received, in letters from all over the world, in visits from
strangers, he said he was moved by people who told him that they,
too, had paused to reflect.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of a letter one 16-year-old had sent to the local paper,
describing how she'd spent an hour and a half at the old oak. In the
letter, the girl said she'd driven home afterward looking at her
surroundings with new eyes, Quigley said. She noticed the pencil-thin
baby trees newly planted by developers and compared them to the old
oak, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked around at this sort of prefabricated world and
suddenly realized it could be different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When he first climbed up into the tree on Nov. 1, Quigley thought
he'd be down in a week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Each day I was thinking, well, at least, at least. At least, the
tree's going to live one more day. At least this is getting people to
slow down and look at a tree," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the first step, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts with awareness and then you have to make a commitment
to take action. I think ultimately it's about people who are sitting
in their homes, doing their own thing, watching the news, having the
courage to speak out and fight for things that matter. Maybe we need
to start taking responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   To developers, the old oak tree was referred to in paperwork as
oak #419. Now people call it "Old Glory" and think about its age and
what it means, Quigley said. Some tell him stories about it. A woman
told him that her husband proposed to her in the tree in 1942.
Another woman told him she's been walking by it every day for the
past 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said people need to hear such stories from those who
remember the history of places. They need to notice their
surroundings and treasure them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all in the process of evolving. I would say the one thing
that is unacceptable is apathy. If all a person does is commit to
becoming more aware and to taking more action, then they've begun the
process."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley is unsure when or how his crusade will end. The developer
of the new road has said he plans to move the tree to a nearby park.
But Quigley and his supporters believe the aged oak would not survive
a transplant, and so the battle continues.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Quigley's supporters keep showing up to cheer him on.</TE>
<TE>   Yvette Aslanian, who lives in a nearby development, said her kids
think the oak tree is magical. They keep wanting to come see it, she
said. "They think it's out of a fairy tale, out of Harry Potter. They
don't understand how anyone could cut it," she said. "They don't see
it's because of all the houses that this is happening. But you know,
once development arrives, it's going to take root just like a tree
and keep spreading."</TE>
<TE>   Aslanian, who moved to the area in 1990, said she knows some
people might think she's a hypocrite in her support for Quigley
because she lives in a new development. But when she arrived, so much
open space remained, and cows still grazed in the nearby hills, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Growth needs to be controlled at some point," she said. "The
community needs to come together and take control."</TE>
<TE>   She said she hopes that Quigley will help make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "They ask me if we can save this tree, and I say, 'It's possible.
But all the powers that be, everyone, has to come together to make it
happen. It's kind of like magic.' I take my kids here and I tell
them: 'This is what you have to do to make change.' "</TE>

<HD>Military Police Target Auto Safety Violations</HD>
<DH>From seat belt scofflaws to speeders, officers are cracking
down on risky driving behavior in response to a disturbing jump in
traffic fatalities.</DH>

<LD>Packing a 9-millimeter handgun, the grim-faced soldier in the
bulletproof vest eyed the line of cars and trucks entering the
Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. Squinting in the bright morning
sun, Cpl. Benjamin Davis inspected each identification card closely,
scanned inside each car and scrutinized every driver.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, a military police officer, takes his job seriously. He is,
after all, the first line of defense against a slew of potential
threats: terrorists, thieves, spies and seat belt scofflaws.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, seat belt scofflaws.</LD>
<TE>   Responding to a jump in traffic deaths in the military, America's
fighting forces launched a campaign last month to crack down on seat
belt use and other automobile safety issues. For good reason. Since
the Vietnam War, more men and women in uniform have been killed in
auto accidents than in training and combat combined.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, the military has lost an average of about
260 men and women annually to traffic accidents. By comparison, 148
American soldiers were killed in combat during the Persian Gulf War,
a military operation that involved more than 660,000 American
servicemen and servicewomen.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, military personnel have had a slightly lower
automobile accident rate and a higher rate of seat belt use than the
civilian public, on and off base.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be changing. From October 2001 to September, 321
uniformed men and women died in traffic crashes, up 35% from the
previous year. Nearly half of those killed were not wearing seat
belts, according to the Department of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   The disturbing increase prompted the four branches of the armed
services to ally with the National Safety Council to combat low seat
belt use in the military.</TE>
<TE>   "In the military, every fatality is like a death in the family,"
said Chuck Hurley, vice president of the traffic safety group for the
National Safety Council.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem is not just seat belt use. It includes a range of
risky behind-the-wheel behavior, including speeding and drunk
driving.</TE>
<TE>   On military bases, traffic laws are strictly enforced and
violators can lose driving privileges or face extra duties, such as
kitchen patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Off base is another story. Young soldiers trained to endure pain,
to fear no enemy, can forget that they are mortal and vulnerable to
injury. Too often, they knock back a few beers, get dogfaced and
speed around town, imagining they are Tom Cruise in "Top Gun."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is particularly acute in the Marine Corps. From
October 2001 to September, 46 leathernecks died in auto crashes,
compared with 25 deaths the previous year. Well over half of those
killed were not wearing seat belts, and 20% of the deaths involved
alcohol, military officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Benjamin Moody of the Marine Corps' safety division
points out that the Marines are an elite fighting force and cannot
afford to lose a few good men.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel those losses more than anyone else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Why Marines? One reason could be that nearly 70% of Marines are
between the ages of 18 and 26 -- a higher percentage than in the
other military branches. It is an age group known for high-risk
driving and low seat belt use.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine culture also may play a role.</TE>
<TE>   "There is definitely a mentality that I'm invincible. I'm a
Marine," said Capt. Scott Hornbuckle, a safety officer at the Miramar
Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   Moody agreed. "Part of our training instills in Marines the
attitude that, 'I can take any pillbox. I can take any hill. Whatever
it is, I can do it,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, a private first class was killed in the Bay Area when
she fell asleep behind the wheel, crashed and was ejected from her
car. She was not wearing a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, two lance corporals from the Marine Corps Air
Station in Yuma, Ariz., were in a car, trying to overtake another
vehicle at 80 mph. The driver lost control and flipped the car. The
driver, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown free and killed.
The other Marine, who was wearing a seat belt, survived.</TE>
<TE>   On military bases, the Marines are dead serious about enforcing
seat belt use. Anyone caught driving without a seat belt is cited.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Marines who were cited were dinged four points on
their driving record. If a Marine gets 12 points or more during a
12-month period, that Marine can lose driving privileges on the base
for up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   Since the recent crackdown began, every seat belt violation also
requires that the soldier visit a military traffic court, where a
high-ranking officer can impose additional penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol is doing its part too. CHP officers
near the Marine bases at Twentynine Palms and Camp Pendleton are now
notifying the base commanders whenever a Marine is cited off base for
driving without a seat belt. The CHP hopes to expand this program to
other bases in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Given the mounting toll, Marine officials are making sure the
message carries like a rifle shot.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning at the main gate of the Miramar Marine Corps
Air Station, Cpl. Anthony Cruz, a military police officer, stood on
the median of the road, aiming a radar gun at traffic leaving the
base.</TE>
<TE>   A baby-faced soldier driving out of the base in a gray Nissan
slowed as he approached the corporal, then began to speed off when it
seemed he had cleared the radar gun's scope.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop!" commanded Cruz, a brawny Marine with a no-nonsense
expression.</TE>
<TE>   The stunned driver, who wasn't wearing a seat belt, stopped next
to Cruz, who then ordered the young GI to pull to the curb.</TE>
<TE>   After issuing a citation, Cruz returned to his post. He said the
driver's excuse for failing to wear his seat belt was a common one:
He forgot.</TE>
<TE>   He probably won't forget again.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Break Up House Party</HD>
<DH>Their 94-90 victory ends New Orleans' 11-game home win
streak and stretches L.A. win streak to three.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The Clippers took no particular delight in ending the New Orleans
Hornets' extended housewarming party Monday. They were willing to
overlook their many shortcomings too.</LD>
<LD>   What counted most of all to them were the final numbers on the
scoreboard: Clippers 94, Hornets 90.</LD>
<LD>   A victory over one of the league's better teams was something to
excite the Clippers, who have a season-best three-game winning streak
going into tonight's game against the 18-2 Mavericks at Dallas. The
end of the Hornets' 11-game winning streak at New Orleans Arena was
left for others to ponder by game's end.</LD>
<TE>   Even stoic point guard Andre Miller let go with a broad smile as
he and the Clippers ran from the floor with the final buzzer ringing
in their ears.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing we did was come down here two days early," Coach
Alvin Gentry said of the Clippers' hasty departure Saturday from
Staples Center after thumping the Minnesota Timberwolves by 16
points. "The guys got it out of their system."</TE>
<TE>   If any Clippers were spotted along Bourbon Street on game day, it
was merely because they were on their way to finding an intriguing
place for lunch. Monday evening, the Clippers were all business.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets (15-7) made several strong runs at the Clippers after
falling behind by double digits in the second quarter and trailing,
43-35, at halftime. New Orleans surged into the lead, 78-75, on
Stacey Augmon's jump shot with 5:25 remaining in the game. The rally
faded after that.</TE>
<TE>   Marko Jaric sank a jump shot from the corner. Elton Brand made
another, then dropped in a left-handed hook and made two free throws.
And then one more.</TE>
<TE>   During the run, New Orleans countered with a three-point shot from
Baron Davis, who would make all six of his fourth-quarter shots en
route to 33 points, his season best, by game's end. Davis fouled out
with 40.1 seconds to play, however.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun," Brand said. "I saw they were up three. I'm open,
I'll shoot. Don't hesitate. As coach says, 'If I'm stupid enough to
have you on the floor, then you have to be stupid enough to shoot it
when you're open.' "</TE>
<TE>   Brand's season best of 29 points in 46 minutes, plus 16 from
backup shooting guard Quentin Richardson, plus a second consecutive
standout defensive showing from Tremaine Fowlkes (this time on Jamal
Mashburn) put the Clippers in a position to win for the ninth time in
21 games.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, playing on a badly sprained left ankle, helped seal the
deal by making six of six free throws during crunch time and 10 of 10
for the game. He had 18 points and eight assists in 35 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "No, he's probably only 75 or 80%," Gentry bellowed when asked if
Miller's ankle, sprained after a collision with Sacramento's Bobby
Jackson on Nov. 29, had improved.</TE>
<TE>   "Tough as nails," Brand said of Miller, who sat out only the
Clippers' loss Dec. 1 against the Indiana Pacers. "He's doing big
things for us. Hitting free throws. Making passes. Giving us good
defense."</TE>
<TE>   Bum ankle and all, Miller did what he could against Davis, who may
soon need back surgery. In fact, Davis said after the game he didn't
know if he could play Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But there he was in the fourth quarter, wheeling and dealing and
dropping shots into the basket from all angles.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was the only Hornet clicking, however, and a good deal of
that was because of Fowlkes' defensive play against Mashburn.</TE>
<TE>   One game after limiting Minnesota's Kevin Garnett to 19 points on
13 shots, Fowlkes held Mashburn to 15 points on five-for-20 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers switched from man-to-man defense to a zone and back
again repeatedly, forcing the Hornets to the perimeter, where they
made nine of 30 three-pointers. The Clippers outshot the Hornets,
45.2% to 42.7%, and outrebounded them by a whopping 46-31.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we handled it well," New Orleans Coach Paul Silas
said of the Clippers' defensive pressure. "Then we could never really
get in sync. Our jumpers were not falling, and we kept shooting
them."</TE>

<HD>Will Bruins Show Them the Money?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Toledo's demise began with a hurricane and ended with a tidal
wave.</LD>
<LD>   He might be the first coach who ever lost his job because of a
report on the Weather Channel.</LD>
<LD>   Think about it.</LD>
<TE>   If UCLA plays Miami on Sept. 26, 1998, I say the Bruins win by a
touchdown, go undefeated, win the national title, win all the
recruiting wars and Toledo is UCLA's coach this year and next.</TE>
<TE>   Miami wasn't Miami then, it was a young, post-probation team being
nurtured along by Butch Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Miami lost three games in 1998, two games before Oct. 10, and
probably would have lost to UCLA in late September.</TE>
<TE>   But Hurricane Georges postponed the game to Dec. 5, by which time
tailback Edgerrin James was running downhill and the program was
primed for a historic run.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, we remember it well. Instead of flying into Miami on Thursday
to acclimate to the weather and time change, UCLA saved a few bucks
and flew in on Friday, Dec. 4, for a 11 a.m. (Pacific) Saturday
kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   You know the rest. Miami knocked UCLA from 10-0 to 10-1 and out of
the national title game. The Bruins did, however, come in under
budget.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and Toledo were never the same after that Miami loss, going
24-23 since then until Monday, when Athletic Director Dan Guerrero
fired Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   The weather report this time for Toledo involves gathering storm
clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Now, gulp, comes the big question: What next?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has long been the budget motel of major universities when it
comes to paying market rate for coaches, selling the love and
location of UCLA rather than the love of Porches.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Donahue was bumped up from eager assistant in 1977 and
lasted 20 years before retiring and being replaced by Toledo, his
offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lavin was summoned from the end of the bench to replace
basketball coach Jim Harrick.</TE>
<TE>   Why pay the huge money when you don't have to?</TE>
<TE>   The question now is whether that philosophy works in this brave
new athletic world? Can you get to a BCS game and fly on Friday to
play Saturday games in Florida?</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said Tuesday, "We want to have a national caliber program
here."</TE>
<TE>   We know what that means at Texas A&amp;M. It means kidnapping Dennis
Franchione from Alabama and paying him $2 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma, it means extending Bob Stoops' contract at midseason
after a victory against Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   At Washington, it means tearing up Rick Neuheisel's contract so
many times to keep him in Seattle you get paper cuts.</TE>
<TE>   USC learned these new realities the hard way two years ago,
getting played by other coaches before the ante for out-of-work Pete
Carroll rose to more than $1 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Carroll was worth every cent.</TE>
<TE>   However, we just can't imagine UCLA ever getting caught up in this
sort of negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, you learn a lot from other searches," Guerrero said. "But
if someone is using a search to leverage a position, he's clearly not
a right fit."</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA wanted to win a national title fast, it would adopt the
Southeastern Conference's open-check policy. Guerrero would get Bill
Parcells on the horn or maybe have the Coast Guard hunt down Jimmy
Johnson, then offer him the moon over Miami.</TE>
<TE>   But that has never been UCLA's style and never will be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I know the nature of the situation better than anybody,"
Donahue, now a front office executive with the San Francisco 49ers,
said. "UCLA has always been a school of balance and has always
believed in keeping proper balance. I don't believe personally that
UCLA will deviate far from that formula."</TE>
<TE>   So forget about Johnson or Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   But can you really win big without hiring the Big Tuna?</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is yes, if you hire the right person," Donahue said.
"To me, that's where the answer is. There are more coaches you can
count that will take that job for way under a million. They are
either great coaches at smaller schools, an outstanding coach not
currently coaching or a young assistant waiting for the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, unlike USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett two years ago,
admitted Monday he wasn't necessarily going after the best coach.</TE>
<TE>   "What I want is the best coach to meet the profile," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The best guess is that the next UCLA coach will make more than
Toledo's $578,000 per year but less than Carroll, which may come up
in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get this straight, Dan, you want me to beat USC but pay me
less than its coach?</TE>
<TE>   And we presume Guerrero's going to say, "yep."</TE>
<TE>   In an odd, perhaps admirable way, many in the Bruin family are
proud of this historical prudence.</TE>
<TE>   "You could hire Jimmy Johnson and he could put his boat in
Malibu," former quarterback Tom Ramsey said, "But that's stupid
money."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, do you want to be national champs or what?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA seems torn between losing to USC and losing interest on its
mutual fund.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Guerrero can't pull this off, but it puts the incredible
onus on him to identify the next Jeff Tedford and not the next Bob
Davie.</TE>
<TE>   And how many football coaches did Guerrero hire at UC Irvine?</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable I'll make the right decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The composite coach Guerrero sketched for reporters seems to
eliminate the big pitch for someone like Neuheisel, for years the
next-UCLA-coach-in-waiting but now a man who has priced himself out
of the market and has more issues with the NCAA than Toledo ever had.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is UCLA likes the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero talked about giving the next coach an incentive-laced
contract that could bring him in line with the market. But he will
also have to deal with the issue of increasing the pay of Bruin
assistants to avoid the logistical problems of a head coach commuting
from Bel Air and the defensive coordinator from Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   While Guerrero says he is hell bent on a return to glory, his
vision of the next UCLA coach looks a lot like Mike Riley, or former
Bruin Karl Dorrell, presently an assistant on Mike Shanahan's Denver
Bronco staff.</TE>
<TE>   Is this the groundbreaking hire that helps end the agony of four
consecutive losses to USC? Or, does it produce a Paul Hackett-like
mistake that leads to another news conference in three years.</TE>
<TE>   For Guererro, it all comes down to dollars and sense.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, the UCLA job has a lot to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, though, maybe UCLA could offer more.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Golden Voice of Baseball"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Ted Patterson</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing, L.L.C</TE>
<TE>   Price: $39.95</TE>
<TE>   This 192-page coffee-table book is filled with biographical and
anecdotal material on many of the legends who have broadcast baseball
over the years. There also are fascinating photos and two CDs of
historical calls and interviews of the announcers featured.</TE>
<TE>   It's all the work of Ted Patterson, a Baltimore sportscaster
generally recognized as one of the foremost experts on sportscasting
history.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Gowdy wrote the foreword, and more than 35 announcers are
featured. It's noted that a member of the Brooklyn Dodger
broadcasting team during the Jackie Robinson era was "a young kid
from Fordham University who went on to have perhaps the greatest
career of any sportscaster in history: Vin Scully."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the other men featured are Mel Allen, Red Manning, Russ
Hodges, Harry Caray, Jack Buck, Red Barber, Jack Brickhouse, Lindsey
Nelson and Ernie Harwell.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most fascinating chapters is on Bill Stern, who was
better known as a football announcer and for his national "Colgate
Newsreel" shows. Stern never let the truth get in the way of a good
story.</TE>
<TE>   On one of his "Colgate Newsreel" shows, he said with a straight
face that Abraham Lincoln had been on his deathbed in the
boardinghouse across from Ford's Theatre, after John Wilkes Booth
shot him, when he summoned Abner Doubleday and whispered to him to
invent the game of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, who died in 1971 at 64, was often ridiculed by the press.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got news for the press," he said toward the end of his
career. "I laughed all the way to the bank.... The press was
basically jealous of radio guys because we made 10 times as much
money and they felt announcers didn't know as much about sports as
they did, which is probably true."</TE>

<HD>To Play, or Not</HD>
<DH>Pepperdine calls Kimble's condition career-ending, but
athlete isn't so sure</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Kimble says he's praying for a miracle, and that's what it might
take for the Pepperdine junior to play college basketball again.</LD>
<LD>   Kimble was the starting center for the Waves until he passed out
at practice Nov. 26 and was diagnosed with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that can cause sudden death. Kimble
and his family are hoping the diagnosis was incorrect and have
scheduled an evaluation by another cardiologist this week.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine coaches hope Kimble will be cleared to rejoin the team,
which has struggled without the low-post presence of the 6-foot-10,
230-pounder.</LD>
<TE>   But the university is adhering to a more conservative stance,
releasing a statement that Kimble has a "career-ending" condition.
Though Kimble reportedly approved the release, he indicated he isn't
ready to call it a career at age 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real optimistic," he said of his chances of playing again.
"It's just a gut feeling."</TE>
<TE>   John Watson, Pepperdine athletic director, said the medical
evidence would have to be conclusive for the school to allow Kimble
back on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "If it turns out that this initial diagnosis was incorrect --
invalidated -- then obviously we'll review everything," Watson said.
"But based on what we've been told with the preliminary diagnosis,
this is the prudent action for Will.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to put him in harm's way, nor do we want a young
person's enthusiasm to place him in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Watson's caution is understandable. He was at Loyola Marymount's
Gersten Pavilion the night of March 4, 1990, when Loyola's Hank
Gathers collapsed during a basketball game and later died of
myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart. Boston Celtic star Reggie
Lewis died of the same condition.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola's insurance carriers eventually paid a settlement of $1.4
million to Gathers' family.</TE>
<TE>   Another $1 million was paid on behalf of Vernon Hattori, the
cardiologist who had treated Gathers for his heart condition and
cleared him to play.</TE>
<TE>   Watson acknowledged that Kimble's situation reminds him of
Gathers', but said that has not influenced the way Pepperdine is
handling the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in my mind, but it's not the overriding concern," Watson
said. "Nor is the liability issue an overriding concern. It's what's
right for Will Kimble."</TE>
<TE>   And if Kimble receives a second medical opinion that contradicts
the initial diagnosis, clearing him to play?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how we would resolve it, other than having long
discussions with the family and with Will," Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about a kid who might feel pain with an
arthritic knee the rest of his life. We're talking about life and
death as a potential."</TE>
<TE>   Kimble -- no relation to Bo Kimble, Gathers' high-profile teammate
at Loyola -- had never displayed any signs of having a heart problem
before last month, said his mother, Irene Donley-Kimble, an
obstetrician-gynecologist.</TE>
<TE>   She said Will was "active in almost every sport" while growing up.
He competed on a youth swim team and was a Boy Scout. He played
basketball and football at San Bernardino Pacific High.</TE>
<TE>   "William never complained of any kind of problem," Donley-Kimble
said. "He's a quiet kid, but when he's not feeling well, he lets you
know."</TE>
<TE>   Kimble passed a physical before he was cleared to play for
Pepperdine, but John Shearer, the school's head trainer, said a heart
condition such as the one diagnosed in Kimble would not be detected
by general health screening unless a more telling sign, such as a
heart murmur, were present.</TE>
<TE>   "You would need an echocardiogram," said Shearer, referring to the
procedure of examining the heart through ultrasound.</TE>
<TE>   A key reserve for Pepperdine last season, Kimble became a starter
and played without incident in the Waves' season-opening loss at
Bradley on Nov. 22.</TE>
<TE>   He was participating in a rigorous full-court press drill at
practice the morning of Nov. 26 when he started to feel lightheaded.
He went to sit down on the base of a basket at Firestone Fieldhouse
on the Pepperdine campus in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing you know, I was out," Kimble said.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates noticed him lying face down on the court. He quickly
regained consciousness. A team manager summoned Shearer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was only out five or 10 seconds," Kimble said. "Then, after
that, I just felt fine."</TE>
<TE>   Shearer asked Kimble a series of general health questions. Had he
skipped breakfast that morning? Had he suffered a recent head injury?
Was he taking any medication? When Kimble's answers failed to provide
any clues, Shearer decided to hold Kimble out of the rest of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Shearer called Dr. Gary Green, the team physician, who arranged to
have Kimble evaluated by a cardiologist.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble drove himself to UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent a
battery of tests, including an echocardiogram that detected
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by
thickened tissue of the heart muscle that can interfere with the
movement of blood as it is pumped from the left ventricle.</TE>
<TE>   During strenuous exercise, "not enough blood can get to other
areas of the body, including the brain, which is probably why he
passed out," Donley-Kimble said.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble said the cardiologist (Dr. Antoine Hage) who treated him
told him he "should never exercise again." Donley-Kimble said Hage
indicated that Kimble could perform normal physical activities but
would have to undergo further testing and might need to take
medication. Hage could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Heart Assn., 36% of young athletes who
suffer sudden cardiac death have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which
can cause fatal arrhythmias.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes have gone to great lengths to prolong their careers
despite health concerns. Gathers had an irregular heartbeat that
doctors were trying to control with medication. He needed further
testing to find the cause of the arrhythmia, but he did not want to
do it until after the basketball season.</TE>
<TE>   Devard Darling tried unsuccessfully to play football for several
universities after he was found to have the same sickle-cell trait
that was found in his twin, Devaughn, who died after collapsing
during a workout in February 2001, when they were freshmen at Florida
State. Devard finally transferred to Washington State, where he is a
sophomore wide receiver, after exhaustive medical tests cleared him
for competition.</TE>
<TE>   Donley-Kimble said that although the family is seeking a second
medical opinion, they will not press for her son to play basketball
if results confirm the initial tests. Kimble has scheduled an
evaluation and consultation Wednesday with Dr. Robert Siegel, a
cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to press William or have him play again if
there's anything that shows [his condition] could possibly cause
sudden death," Donley-Kimble said.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Kimble's heart condition was diagnosed, Pepperdine
Coach Paul Westphal broke the news to the team. Westphal has helped
ease Kimble's transition from player to spectator by allowing him to
travel with the team and sit on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   After Westphal spoke, Kimble addressed his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   What he told them is, "Take nothing for granted and appreciate
everything that they've got," Kimble said. "Because you could lose
everything in one second.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that you work for could be gone like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's Will Kimble averaged 5.4 points and 3.7 rebounds a
game as a reserve on last season's 22-9 team. He started the Waves'
first game this season before being diagnosed with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.</TE>
<TE>   * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results in the abnormal growth of
the heart muscle cells. The wall between the heart chambers, known as
the septum, may become so thickened that it blocks the flow of blood
through the left ventricle. In most instances, there are no warning
signs of the condition, which is most often diagnosed in young
athletes.</TE>

<HD>Still a Dynasty, or Dead Ringers?</HD>
<DH>Three-time champs have a lot of mileage on them. Is this
the season Laker juggernaut runs out of gas?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn, their voice, died in August. Jerry West, their
cornerstone, took other employment a few months before. Magic
Johnson, their personality in the last championship era, was
considering buying into another team, leaving the Lakers behind.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after, Laker owner Jerry Buss was sitting in a luxury box at
Staples Center where in three years he had hosted three NBA
championships, three parades through the heart of Los Angeles. His
expression was of sadness.</LD>
<LD>   "What's happened to the old gang of mine?" he wondered.</LD>
<TE>   And then the Lakers' season began, and on many nights that
question lingers.</TE>
<TE>   Those who best know the Lakers, who watched them struggle to their
first title, bicker to their second and slog to their third in a Los
Angeles hoop-dreams era marked alternately by brilliance and
distress, intuitively knew a fourth consecutive championship would
not be a purely ceremonial exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Before the banners were hung, they played through personality
conflicts, through the strain of injury and ego, through old lessons
not entirely mastered.</TE>
<TE>   Their championships might have appeared predetermined, carried so
elegantly on stringy legs and broad shoulders. But it has been work
since Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant joined up in the summer of
'96, three years before Coach Phil Jackson drove in from the Montana
woods to bring harmony and diamond-crusted rings to their lives. He
helped turn them back into NBA royalty, if at times with the dash of
Mark Madsen, who dances at championship parties with absolute joy --
and as if stomping the flames of a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Playing now to be held with or above all but one other NBA dynasty
-- the Boston Celtics, who won eight titles in a row from 1959-66 --
the Lakers have won only nine of their first 22 games. With a quarter
of the season gone, they had been in last place in the Pacific
Division, behind even the Clippers, who share an arena but little
else with the decorated Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Two victories over the weekend -- the first a stunning 30-point
comeback against the previously once-beaten Dallas Mavericks, after
being booed from their own floor at halftime -- soothed the fears of
some Laker fans that the string of titles had run its course.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a tough schedule," Orlando Magic Coach Doc Rivers said.
"They didn't have Shaq. They had an East Coast trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Did everyone think they'd start off that slow? No. But every year
of the last three it seems like they have had a wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, by Sunday night, the hysteria was gone at Figueroa and
11th streets, replaced by the soberness that more often comes with
the onerous NBA regular season. The Lakers were back playing with
more typical assuredness. They had presumed their win over the
Mavericks would propel them to an effort and a result more befitting
their recent past, and their immediate expectations. A follow-up
victory over the Utah Jazz confirmed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't curious," Jackson said. "I was expectant they would."</TE>
<TE>   But strong and legitimate concerns remain.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, the great mountain of a center, limped from the NBA Finals
MVP presentation in June, his right big toe wracked by arthritis.
Nearly three months later, he had surgery, and was not well enough to
play until the Lakers' 13th game. By the time he trudged to the
floor, the Laker record was 3-9, among the worst starts in the
history of a franchise that has won 14 titles dating to its birth in
Minneapolis in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   As Bryant, their other first-team All-NBA player, found it
increasingly difficult to win without O'Neal hurling away defenders
near the rim, speculation grew that the cast around the superstars
had grown weak with age and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   After a 26-point loss in Dallas in mid-November, Bryant said, "I
look around the locker room and I don't see any fire in anybody's
eyes. Everybody's just kind of dozing off a little bit. I don't know
if they're waiting for Shaquille to get back or whatever. I don't
know. But there's just no intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, O'Neal huffed, "I just want eight guys out there
with me who want to play." Adding, "The problem is that the whole
team is not playing with enough energy or enough fire."</TE>
<TE>   And so they remain the Lakers, flaws and all, on the verge of
dynasty or collapse, depending on the mood, the moment, the bounce of
the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   They are dynamic and vulnerable, unbeatable and pathetic -- some
nights all by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Just like last season.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, a mainstay at forward during these championship years,
said Jackson recently gathered the team in a room at its training
facility in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is calling for our demise," Jackson told them. "They're
saying, 'Break up the Lakers.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then Jackson laughed and said, "We do this every year."</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing concern is that O'Neal return to full health and
fitness. The Lakers are 6-4 since he came off the injured list, the
victories because he is among the largest, most nimble centers in
history, the defeats because he is not yet jumping or running at his
best, a serious problem as the Lakers try to rebound from their early
poor record.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Shaq, they're just another team," Dallas guard Steve Nash
had said after the 26-point Maverick victory with O'Neal still on the
bench. "With Shaq, they're one of the best teams in history."</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki, Nash's teammate, said, "Shaq is the Lakers, pretty
much."</TE>
<TE>   In the days before he returned to the floor, O'Neal warned, "Real
life will be back soon. This is all just a terrible, bad dream."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been slow to awaken.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's economic structure -- revenue sharing, the salary cap
and an expected luxury tax after this season -- is designed to
promote parity and foster competitiveness. For years, it did.</TE>
<TE>   But then along came Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in Chicago.
They were followed in Los Angeles by O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls twice won three consecutive titles in the 1990s, and
then the Lakers went on their tear to start the millennium.</TE>
<TE>   The common thread is Jackson, now 57, who is one title from
surpassing former Celtic Red Auerbach for the record among NBA
coaches. Both have nine.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the Lakers gain popularity -- an ESPN poll recently tabbed
the Lakers the NBA fans' favorite team for a second consecutive
season -- there may be issues too great for Jackson, O'Neal and
Bryant to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   There are ominous theories, espoused by Jackson among others, that
three seasons played into late June (while most organizations pack up
in April or May) fatigue the athlete's body cumulatively. Perhaps the
emotional and physical toll of so many playoff games -- the Lakers
have played 58 in the last three years, or nearly three-quarters of
another regular season -- cannot be healed in a single summer of
rest.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things you see with teams that have success, they play
so late in the season," said West, now president of the Memphis
Grizzlies. "With all the awards and plaudits they get, emotionally it
takes awhile to get into it the next season.</TE>
<TE>   "Other teams may win a lot of games in the regular season, but
that's not the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is most deft at pacing his teams so they are ready for the
playoffs in April. He might have kept the Bulls' run in Chicago going
even longer had Jordan not retired -- twice (before coming back again
to play for the Washington Wizards). But O'Neal's absence and the
Lakers' inability to play through it probably have cost Jackson the
luxury of pacing. When it comes time for the playoffs, assuming the
Lakers are in the NBA's come-one, come-all version of them, the old
gang might be all tired out from making up lost ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a challenge," guard Brian Shaw said, even after
their two latest victories. "It's going to be a challenge, trying to
win this fourth in a row."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Bruin Coach Has Empathy for Toledo</HD>

<LD>Bill Barnes knows what it is like to be fired as UCLA football coach.
He was fired by the late J.D. Morgan following a 4-6 season in 1964.</LD>
<LD>   Barnes, 85, who has been retired from the real estate business for
16 years and plays golf once a week at Riviera Country Club, said
Morgan, who was then in his second year as athletic director, called
him into his office.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'How do you tell an old friend that you have to let him
go? Heck, we were never friends."</LD>
<TE>   As for Bob Toledo's firing on Monday, Barnes said, "I think it's
unfair, but I guess the new AD over there had to show everyone who's
boss."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Tommy Prothro replaced Barnes. Who replaced Prothro
when he left UCLA for the Rams in 1970?</TE>
<TE>   What it takes: Barnes, who was the head coach at UCLA for six
seasons, says he knows what it takes to win games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 85% players, and the rest is coaching," he said. "The
freshman class I passed on to Prothro was the best I ever had."</TE>
<TE>   That class included Gary Beban and linebacker Don Lee Manning. Mel
Farr was a sophomore. Future coach Terry Donahue was a walk-on
freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Small world: Barnes and Prothro went to high school and junior
high school together in Memphis, Tenn., and were both on Red Sanders'
staff at UCLA. They remained friends until Prothro's death in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The real story: Kurt Warner's wife called a St. Louis radio
station last week to say it was her idea to have her husband's hand
X-rayed, not Ram Coach Mike Martz's.</TE>
<TE>   Said Terry Bradshaw on "Fox NFL Sunday": "So it appears that she's
calling her husband's boss a liar."</TE>
<TE>   No way: On CBS' "The NFL Today," Jim Nantz asked Dan Marino if his
wife ever called a radio station in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife doesn't even call me," Marino said. "There's no way she'd
be calling a radio station."</TE>
<TE>   Hitting and hoping: During the final round of the Target World
Challenge at Sherwood Country Club, Tiger Woods hooked his second
shot on No. 16 into the thickly wooded area.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many leaves and everything was so loose," he said,
"I could not afford to put my club anywhere near the ball [for fear
it might move and cost him stroke]. So I had to start my club at the
top and just hit it and hope."</TE>
<TE>   Woods' ball hit a branch and didn't make it to the green, but he
ended up chipping in to save par.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Pepper Rodgers.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Charles Barkley was a guest on CNN's "Talk Back Live"
last week with Gloria Allred and Michael Jackson. They were talking
about Jackson dangling his baby son over a Berlin hotel balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Said Barkley to Allred: "First of all, lady, you act like you
ain't got nothing better to do than worry about Michael Jackson and
his kids.... It's none of your business, basically. He made a mistake
and he apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time some high-profile case breaks out, you jump on
television and act like you're God. Only God can judge other people.
Why don't you go back to your office, wait for another case, and shut
the hell up."</TE>

<HD>As New Star Rises, Will Lavin Fall?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He strolled into the center of wild, wild Westwood a couple of hours
after high noon.</LD>
<LD>   He was dressed in a dark suit. He wore a cold stare. He carried a
black folder, the harsh contents of which he recited as if he were
ordering breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   "This was not a healthy environment."</LD>
<TE>   "There had been an erosion of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want to continue in this situation another year."</TE>
<TE>   His hands remained folded. His face showed no sweat. His football
coach had survived seven stress-filled years. He tossed him out the
door in about 10 cool seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted the opportunity to coach the bowl game," said Dan
Guerrero. "I felt that was not a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   What former UCLA administrators needed years to figure out,
Guerrero handled in the matter of one day, firing Bob Toledo before
lunch, beginning his new coaching search before dinner.</TE>
<TE>   With all respect to the memory of Kevin Malone ... now this is a
new sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   This Guerrero showed the strength of Pedro and the speed of
Vladimir.</TE>
<TE>   He's been in the job five months and already dismissed one of his
two high-profile coaches, a guy whose embracing nature had previously
been good enough to overshadow his program's deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   A bad day for Bob Toledo, and perhaps a worse day for Steve Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   The two struggling coaches, with similar starting dates and
contracts, had survived under a shared cocoon.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero has stripped away that security like a yawning man
pulling back a shower curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kevlar vests are gone," said one bystander. "Bullets are
flying."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin better stay low, because he could be next.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin has never failed to qualify for the postseason, unlike
Toledo, nor has he endured the off-court problems of Toledo's
program. But he's not going to be able to escape the notion that
Toledo's basting has turned him into a lame duck.</TE>
<TE>   Everything Guerrero said was wrong with Toledo's regime applies to
Lavin's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said he was disturbed with the image of the UCLA football
program beyond wins and losses, feeling that it had sunk beyond
repair.</TE>
<TE>   He said it wasn't just that Toledo's Bruins had lost recent
important games, but it was how they were losing them.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do, and how we do it, is sometimes as important as what
we produce," Guerrero said. "One of my absolutes is that the students
will represent the school with distinction."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, for Lavin, those November losses to teams named
after video games could haunt.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about his basketball coach, Guerrero initially brushed
it aside, saying, "We're talking about football here."</TE>
<TE>   Asked again, he said it "wasn't an appropriate time" to discuss
Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   That was the exact message he sent me last week when I first asked
him about Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure?" Guerrero said with a tiny smile. "I'll have to
check my notes."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin coaches in all sports, long considered safe in the haven of
an athletic department that moves as slow as the traffic on nearby
Sunset Boulevard, should check their resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, the job of the UCLA basketball coach has
not changed," Lavin said Monday night. "You have to produce."</TE>
<TE>   But if Guerrero is to be believed, you may have to do more.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo and his supporters thought he might be safe because he was
the coach of a young and improving team.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said he was at risk because it was a young team.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make a change before it was too late," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo thought he did well with a fourth-place team that was
picked to finish sixth in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said he wasn't pleased that the Bruins would ever be
picked that low, period.</TE>
<TE>   "My question is, why are we rated as a preseason sixth-place
team?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   All students beware: Guerrero does not grade on a curve.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke about UCLA football Monday the way those guys across town
speak about their team, even as his words were costing him about $1.3
million in buyout money.</TE>
<TE>   "Football at UCLA is the economic driver of our entire athletic
program," he said. "If a change needs to be made, we will make it."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking about those guys across town ...</TE>
<TE>   While Guerrero obviously entered the season with some serious
reservations about Toledo's program, sources say the determining
factor was this year's blowout by USC.</TE>
<TE>   After that, only consecutive blowouts of Washington State and the
Bruins' bowl opponent would have saved him, and maybe not even then.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was big, I think it was very important," Guerrero said
of the 52-21 loss to the Trojans. "We want every one of those games
to be competitive. It's important to the city of L.A. It's important
to the West Coast. Its important that we restore that tradition."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to UCLA football, sometimes it's hard to remember
that it has tradition.</TE>
<TE>   During 20 consecutive victories, Toledo revived it.</TE>
<TE>   In the troubled four-year aftermath, he misplaced it.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, this being football and these being the gutty little
Bruins, he would have been given time to find it again.</TE>
<TE>   But that was then, and this is Dan Guerrero, who shook the
university by its lapels Monday in proclaiming that it shouldn't have
been lost in the first place.</TE>

<HD>Toledo's Job Is Old News</HD>
<DH>Past problems led to firing; now UCLA will talk to former
USC assistant Riley</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Toledo's past ran him down and swallowed him whole Monday. The
UCLA football coach was fired not for present transgressions, but
because Bruin followers refused to forgive and forget problems that
beset the program in recent years -- including four consecutive
losses to USC.</LD>
<LD>   So now UCLA might turn to a former Trojan assistant for their
salvation.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA representative Bob Field was flying to New Orleans Monday
night to speak to Saint secondary Coach Mike Riley about becoming the
Bruins' 15th head coach, sources said late Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   This is the bold new world at UCLA under first-year Athletic
Director Dan Guerrero, whose stamp on the program could become the
likeness of the grim reaper. Basketball Coach Steve Lavin would do
well to update his resume.</TE>
<TE>   In making Toledo, 56, the first Bruin football coach to be fired
in 38 years -- Bill Barnes, in 1964, was the other -- Guerrero
ignored two consecutive winning seasons. UCLA is 7-5 and headed to
the Las Vegas Bowl despite playing 22 freshmen, including the entire
offensive backfield most of the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   The determining factors were incidents that happened long before
Guerrero replaced the retired Pete Dalis in July. There was the
handicapped parking scandal of 1999, the NCAA special benefits
violation by tailback DeShaun Foster and drunk driving convictions of
quarterback Cory Paus last season. There were charges filed against
several players stemming from off-campus fights last spring and
summer.</TE>
<TE>   This season, there was questionable play-calling in the crucial
moments of losses to Oregon and USC.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want a situation where that next transgression, that
first bad call next year would dredge up negative things in this
program," Guerrero said. "It's not any one thing Bob Toledo did or
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some good signs, some real ups during the course of
the year. The kids played hard. They were committed to performing.
But there were other things that came into play as you evaluate."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said Monday afternoon that he had not made contact with a
potential successor, but sources said the Bruins would soon be
talking with Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Riley has Pacific 10 Conference connections as head coach at
Oregon State in 1997-98 and as an assistant at USC from '93-96.
During his time with the Trojans, USC won three bowl games -- and
lost four times to UCLA. Riley was head coach of the San Diego
Chargers from 1999-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Others on UCLA's short list, sources said, are Denver Bronco
assistant and former UCLA receiver Karl Dorrell, Kansas City Chief
assistant Greg Robinson, University of Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris,
Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz and USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow.</TE>
<TE>   Other names that have surfaced, including San Francisco 49er Coach
Steve Mariucci, might be too expensive. Sources within the athletic
department said UCLA is willing to pay the new coach at least $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand what the market is," Guerrero said. "I am going to
bring in an individual who is the right fit for UCLA. That doesn't
necessarily mean it will be the best coach. He has to fit the profile
that makes sense for us."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo left campus immediately after his morning meeting with
Guerrero and did not return calls. Ed Kezirian, a former assistant
coach and the team's assistant director of academic services the last
10 years, will coach the Bruins in the bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is owed a $1.34-million buyout spread over six years. He
will receive his full salary of $578,000 next year and his base
salary of $153,000 in each of the following five years. If he takes
another job he would forfeit some of the buyout.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the buyout was covered by a surplus fund Dalis started
when ticket revenues from home games against Alabama in 2000 and Ohio
State in 2001 exceeded expectations.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued by UCLA, Toledo said, "I came to UCLA with
class and dignity and I will leave with class and dignity. I have
nothing but great things to say about UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank the coaches who have worked with me and the
players that have played for me. We've done some outstanding things
during my time here and we've won some big games."</TE>
<TE>   Two days before UCLA faced USC on Nov. 23, Guerrero said that
Toledo, his staff and players had responded well to the expectations
and standards the athletic director implemented.</TE>
<TE>   But a 52-21 loss to USC -- Toledo's fourth straight to the Trojans
-- was followed by a 48-27 loss to Washington State on Saturday. The
mood of Bruin followers, from the casual to the influential, darkened
considerably and Guerrero became convinced that Toledo had lost the
confidence of fans and players.</TE>
<TE>   He said he made his decision Sunday and informed Chancellor Albert
Carnesale, who backed him.</TE>
<TE>   "In the final analysis, I felt it was not a healthy environment,"
Guerrero said. "In a lot of ways, it is a reflection of perception
and attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from players was mixed. Paus, a senior whose run-ins with
Toledo were well-chronicled, could hardly contain his glee.</TE>
<TE>   "Something had to give," he said. "I support the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Younger players are anxious because the coach who recruited them
is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I was astonished," freshman tight end Marcedes Lewis said.
"Everybody respected Toledo as a person and as a coach. When I
committed here, other coaches said that Toledo might get fired and
that I should go to their schools. But I'm going to stay here. I just
hope some of the assistants are able to stay."</TE>
<TE>   The nine Bruin assistant coaches will remain through the bowl
game, but a new coach will select his own staff. Defensive
Coordinator Phil Snow, brought in by Toledo two years ago, plans to
look for a job elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my time to move on," Snow said. "I won't interview [to
replace Toledo]. I hate to finish this way. My image has really been
spoiled these last two games."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's image also tarnished even after he enjoyed great success
in his early years as Bruin coach. He replaced Terry Donahue in 1996,
and his disarming personality and reputation as an imaginative
offensive guru won him support that grew when the Bruins posted 10
consecutive victories to end the 1997 season and 10 more to open
1998.</TE>
<TE>   But serious problems began when the Bruins lost to Miami, 49-45,
blowing a chance at a national championship in 1998. A loss to
Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl followed.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 season was greeted by a highly publicized scandal, with
13 players convicted of fraudulently using handicapped placards.
Toledo suspended the players for two games and the team struggled to
a 4-7 record.</TE>
<TE>   After a 6-6 mark in 2000, the Bruins appeared poised for a
championship run last season behind a large group of talented seniors
and won their first six games. But then came close losses to Stanford
and Washington State, and the roof caved in when the NCAA suspended
Foster for driving a car that did not belong to him.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins lost to Oregon a week later, 21-20, and Toledo's
play-calling was criticized after he became conservative during a
late drive.</TE>
<TE>   Then, before the USC game, it came to light that Paus had failed
to inform the coach of two convictions for driving under the
influence. Toledo allowed Paus to play anyway, UCLA lost, 27-0, and
finished 7-4.</TE>
<TE>   Players whispered that their coach unfairly blamed them for the
misfortunes, and Toledo never fully recovered. Only months into his
new job, Guerrero recognized the absence of trust.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of players took heat for things that weren't our fault,"
junior receiver Tab Perry said. "I think Guerrero had to make a
change."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Carnesale told Toledo during the off-season that his job
was safe as long as the team posted a winning record and
off-the-field embarrassments ceased. But then the chancellor hired
Guerrero and gave him the clout to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   So it didn't matter that this season Toledo might have done his
best coaching since the 20-game win streak. UCLA opened with wins
over bowl-bound Colorado State and Oklahoma State, tied a school
record by going 5-1 on the road and won three in a row after Paus'
season was ended by a broken ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do and how we do it is as important as what we produced.
When I first got here I set down certain absolutes, that the kids
represent the university with distinction, and they met that
challenge," Guerrero said. "That's a direct reflection of the
coaching staff and senior leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Nevertheless, when all the issues are taken into account, that
those [past transgressions] did happen, that they could be brought
into the forefront again, we needed to begin the healing process and
look to the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a national caliber program here. We want to compete for
the top 10 and be one of top programs in the country every year. We
want to go to major bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is the program now? I felt a change in leadership was
necessary."</TE>

<HD>Aceh Rebels Sign Milestone Peace Accord With Indonesia</HD>
<DH>International monitors will help implement the agreement,
which officials hope will end 26 years of fighting in the troubled
province.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>After 26 years of warfare, the Indonesian government and rebel
leaders from Aceh signed a landmark peace accord Monday that
negotiators hope will bring an end to fighting in the troubled
province.</LD>
<LD>   Signed in Geneva, the agreement calls for the disarmament of the
rebels and a reduction of government forces but leaves key issues
unresolved, including the specifics of demilitarizing the province.</LD>
<LD>   The conflict is one of the longest-running in the world and has
claimed an estimated 1,500 lives this year, many of them civilian.
Rights activists have accused the Indonesian government of human
rights abuses in the province, including kidnapping, torture and
murder.</LD>
<TE>   Gen. Endriartono Sutarto, chief of the Indonesian military, said
the army would pull back troops who have been besieging a rebel
stronghold in a monthlong campaign aimed at pressuring the
separatists to accept the peace agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "They are no longer our enemy," Sutarto told reporters in Aceh.
"They are our brothers working together with us to develop the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Separatist leaders said they would halt hostilities and continue
their quest for independence through peaceful means, including
elections in 2004 provided under the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the signing and will give this peace deal a chance,"
said Isnandar Faseh, a rebel spokesman. "Even if we are attacked once
or twice, we will hold back."</TE>
<TE>   Aceh, a province of 4.1 million people on the northern tip of the
island of Sumatra, has been fighting for independence on and off
since 1870, when the Dutch colonized the territory. The current war
began in 1976 and has claimed the lives of an estimated 12,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   Aceh is one of the most ardently Muslim regions of Indonesia, and
many of its people favor the imposition of the strict Islamic code
known as Sharia.</TE>
<TE>   However, emissaries from the Al Qaeda terror network who tried to
link up with the rebel Free Aceh Movement in 2000 were rebuffed,
authorities say, and there is no apparent connection between the
rebels and terrorists active in other parts of Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The Aceh conflict has contributed to the country's instability and
helped scare off foreign investors. Exxon Mobil, which operates a
large liquefied natural gas facility in the province, was forced to
close it temporarily last year because of the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Aceh has substantial petroleum and timber resources, but the fact
that little of the revenue they generate remains in the province has
fueled support for the independence movement.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the effort to win peace, the government earlier granted
Aceh special autonomy status that could give the province as much as
70% of the revenue from oil and gas production. The autonomy grant
also permits Aceh to implement Sharia.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's peace accord was negotiated over the last two years by

<TE>   The agreement calls for free elections in 2004 in which separatist
political parties will be allowed to compete. It also provides for
international observers to begin arriving as early as this week to
monitor the accord's implementation.</TE>
<TE>   One pitfall might be the lack of a plan for demilitarizing the
province.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement calls for the two sides to design a "mutually agreed
upon process" to disarm the rebels and withdraw government troops.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists fear that army units might try to undermine the
peace agreement because of their financial interest in remaining in
the province. The army is known to operate numerous businesses, both
legal and illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In Aceh, reaction was subdued as residents waited to see how the
accord would be implemented. But in Geneva, government officials were
enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks be to God, we have signed the deal," Indonesia's top
security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, told Indonesia's Metro
TV. "The agreement is a milestone in Indonesia's history of trying to
solve the Aceh conflict. Now we can look to the future."</TE>

<LD>   The crew of the French sub Nautile, hired to probe the wreckage
2.2 miles deep, had previously found six cracks and oil leaking from

<HD>Fertile Ground for Terror</HD>
<DH>In the wake of dictatorship and economic collapse,
Indonesia's lawlessness has created an ideal base for launching
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BINJAI, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>It was the kind of rescue the Indonesian army was trained to carry
out. Hundreds of soldiers from the 100th Airborne Battalion, wearing
war paint and armed with bazookas, grenade launchers, mortars, tanks
and a mobile antiaircraft gun, attacked in the dead of night.</LD>
<LD>   Their targets were two police stations. Their mission was to
rescue a friend named Marwan who had been arrested for allegedly
selling the drug Ecstasy.</LD>
<LD>   The battle was one-sided. The soldiers killed seven police
officers and two civilians and wounded 37 officers. One station was
destroyed and the other heavily damaged. A soldier died in the
fighting. The army freed Marwan and 60 other prisoners, including
accused murderers, rapists and thieves. None has been recaptured.</LD>
<TE>   "How can the military attack a police station?" asked a
28-year-old police sergeant who was hit in the leg by shrapnel during
the attack. "I don't understand. It was brutal. It was coldblooded."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 29 attack highlights the lawlessness that has plagued
Indonesia since 1998, when the military dictatorship of President
Suharto collapsed. Despite Indonesians' desire for democracy,
disorder has reigned. With three presidents in four years, the
country of 231 million people has suffered from chronic corruption,
feeble leadership and ineffective law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The military, still the most powerful institution, finances most
of its activities through a business empire that operates inside and
outside the law. Its enterprises include hotels, oil refineries and
insurance. They also include drug dealing, gambling, prostitution and
illegal logging, says former Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono.</TE>
<TE>   The police, independent of the military only in recent years, are
widely perceived to be as corrupt as the army.</TE>
<TE>   Across the sprawling archipelago of more than 17,000 islands,
economic crime is rampant. Indonesia's borders are poorly protected
and its seas suffer the highest rate of piracy in the world,
according to a report in October by the International Chamber of
Commerce. Illegal logging is so widespread that the country's
once-vast rain forests will vanish in five to seven years, says
Environment Minister Nabiel Makarim.</TE>
<TE>   In the courts, justice is for sale. More than 90% of the country's
judges and police officers are on the take and graft reaches to the
highest levels of government, according to a federal anti-corruption
commission that monitors officials' assets. In a recent worldwide
survey by the advocacy group Transparency International, only five
countries ranked as more corrupt than Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's lawlessness has created an ideal climate for
terrorists. Western officials believe that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network is well established in Indonesia and has used the country as
a base to launch terror attacks in the region, including the Oct. 12
nightclub bombings in Bali that killed 191 people.</TE>
<TE>   "With the deadly rivalry between the army and police and the level
of corruption in both, you simply can't trust anybody in the security
forces to be what they say they are or to do what they say they're
doing," said Sidney Jones, head of the Indonesia office of the
International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. "A
government that is not serious about fighting corruption is not
serious about fighting terror."</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's instability endangers Americans as never before in its
five-decade history since independence. Seven Americans died in the
Bali bombing. Two American teachers were killed Aug. 31 when gunmen
ambushed their car on a mountain road in the province of Papua, and
police are investigating whether soldiers carried out the attack. The
State Department has withdrawn all embassy family members and
nonessential staff from the country.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population, with
extremists very much a minority. As a moderate, democratic country,
it could be a model for the Islamic world. But few expect the nation
to pull out of its post-dictatorship chaos any time soon. Its
fundamental problems, diplomats and analysts say, will be left for
the next generation of leaders to solve.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a society where there is total impunity and lack of
accountability," said a senior U.S. diplomat who asked not to be
identified. "The way out is slow water torture of the democratic
variety. But it really isn't going to pay off in most of our
lifetimes."</TE>
<TE>   The corruption and lack of law and order add to the hardship of
everyday life. Vigilante justice is common. Government funds are
siphoned into the pockets of officials, and spending on health care,
education and other public services is woefully deficient. Major
cities are shrouded in unrestrained pollution. Few drivers obey the
rules of the road, and traffic often comes to a standstill. Public
transportation is so crowded that some children ride home from school
on the roofs of their school buses.</TE>
<TE>   Though rich in resources, Indonesia is handicapped by the slow
pace of its recovery from the economic crisis that struck Asia in
1997. The government estimates that about 38 million people are
unemployed. Few foreign investors are willing to put their money
here.</TE>
<TE>   Also hampering the country's progress is a legal system in which
fairness is a foreign concept and verdicts often go to the highest
bidder.</TE>
<TE>   One striking example was a decision by a three-judge panel this
year to declare the Indonesian unit of Canada's Manulife Financial
Corp. bankrupt -- though the insurance company was unquestionably
solvent. Manulife said the ruling was an attempt by a disgruntled
Indonesian ex-partner to ruin its business.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict touched off an international outcry and was later
overturned by the Supreme Court. The lower court judges are under
investigation for allegedly accepting bribes, but that probe is
unusual. Judges are rarely held accountable for their decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "In almost all cases, especially in Jakarta and other big cities,
every verdict that the judge is going to make there will always be a
transaction," said Petrus Selestinus of Indonesia's anti-corruption
commission. "If you want to win, you have to pay."</TE>
<TE>   In government, top officials brazenly hang on to power even when
their questionable dealings are well known. Parliament Speaker Akbar
Tanjung, who was convicted Sept. 4 of stealing $4.5 million intended
for the poor and using it in a political campaign, remains in his
post pending appeal. Atty. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Rahman, the top law
enforcement officer, failed to report his ownership of a house valued
at about $300,000 and bank deposits of about $80,000, as required by
an anti-corruption law, Selestinus said. The attorney general refuses
to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Businessman Mahfudz Djaelani -- who ran unsuccessfully for the
post of Jakarta governor in September against incumbent Gov.
Sutiyoso, who like many Indonesians goes by one name -- has
complained loudly that he was out-bribed.</TE>
<TE>   The city's 84-member parliament elects the governor, and Djaelani
thought he had the race sewn up because of his generous donations to
a majority of members. But a few days before the election, he learned
that the going rate for each vote had jumped to $50,000 -- far more
than he had expected to pay.</TE>
<TE>   After he lost, Djaelani publicly demanded the return of thousands
of dollars he had doled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a businessman," Djaelani explained in an interview. "If I
make a down payment and I don't get elected, I want the money back."</TE>
<TE>   Under Indonesia's justice system, some people even appear to get
away with murder. No one from the military, for instance, has been
convicted for the well-publicized slaughter of 1,000 civilians
carried out by army-backed militias in East Timor in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Accused people smuggler Abu Quassey, who police say had organized
a refugee boat that sank off Indonesia last year, killing 373
asylum-seekers headed for Australia, was never charged in the deaths.
Instead, the Egyptian was sentenced to six months in jail for
violating his visa.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators concluded that at least nine special forces
soldiers took part in the kidnapping and killing of Papuan separatist
leader Theys Eluay last year, but no one has been tried for the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The army's conduct has called into question the Bush
administration's policy of restoring ties with the Indonesian
military. But Washington sees its choice as either helping the armed
forces become more democracy-minded, or someday facing a conservative
Islamic government here.</TE>
<TE>   Under Suharto, the main responsibility of the armed forces was to
maintain order within the country. The military, which included the
police, was often brutal but succeeded in suppressing many of the
ethnic, religious and separatist conflicts that afflict the country.
A year after Suharto fell, the police force and military were
separated in the hope that a more democratic system would be created.
Instead, the new arrangement created two rival armed camps.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2001, soldiers and police have engaged in at least
12 shootouts in which participants or bystanders were killed or
wounded. Even by these standards, the Binjai battle was extreme.
Police officials say the loss of seven officers was the highest death
toll the department has suffered in a single engagement.</TE>
<TE>   Binjai is a bustling city of 220,000 just west of Medan, the
largest city on the island of Sumatra. Marwan, 32, was arrested Sept.
28 and taken to the Langkat police station on the outskirts of
Binjai.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, three soldiers arrived a few hours later and
asked the detective handling the case to release him. Marwan, they
said, was their friend. The detective refused, saying Marwan was
still under investigation. Without warning, one of the soldiers
pulled out a knife and cut the detective's ear, nearly slicing it
off. As the soldiers ran, police fired, wounding at least one of
them.</TE>
<TE>   Police and army officers met that evening and negotiated a truce.
But the next night, the army began preparing for war.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are uncertain how many of the 100th Airborne Battalion's
600 soldiers were involved, but witnesses say the attackers numbered
in the hundreds. The assault was so well organized that it seems
unlikely it was carried out without the participation of officers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police account, soldiers went to the power
station about 11 p.m. and cut the city's electricity. Moments later,
troops attacked the station where Marwan was being held. The soldiers
fired grenades and mortars, destroying one small building and setting
the main building on fire. Most of the police fled.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers went to the jail and used a hammer to break the locks
on the cell doors, freeing the prisoners. "They wanted to free
Marwan, but they freed all of them," said a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers also took Marwan's police file and about 1.5 tons of
marijuana stored at the station.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the soldiers moved across town and advanced on the
Binjai headquarters of the police Mobile Brigade unit, a tough,
battle-hardened police corps.</TE>
<TE>   They fired on the buildings and set them ablaze. When police
reinforcements arrived by truck, the soldiers fired an antiaircraft
gun at the vehicle, killing the driver, according to a police
sergeant in the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the battle, Army Chief of Staff Ryamizard Ryacudu
discharged 20 soldiers. In a ceremony broadcast on national
television, he stripped them of their uniform shirts and hats. The 20
are on trial in a military court in connection with the attack but
face only token sentences ranging from 10 months to 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   No other soldiers have been charged. Despite a police
investigation, North Sumatra police spokesman Amrin Karim said it was
still unclear why the military went to such lengths to win Marwan's
release.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel deeply sad," Karim said, "because we still have a long
way to go to uphold the law."</TE>

<HD>A Film Festival Without Glitz? Only in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Moviegoers say they prefer the low-key celebration of
cinema as they glimpse forbidden materialism through American
pictures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol J. Williams</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>No limousines or motorcades. No pampered stars or pushy paparazzi. At
the 24th International Festival of New Latin American Film, Hollywood
and its flashy entourage are conspicuously absent.</LD>
<LD>   Cubans say they like their proletarian style of celebrating cinema
and disdain the displays of wealth and exclusivity at just about
every other film festival on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Few complain about the lack of star-studded glamour. What's
important, they say, is that American films make their way here by
hook or by crook, opening a window into the other world that looms so
large across so narrow a frontier.</LD>
<TE>   "We would welcome a bigger American presence here, but Tinseltown
glitz has nothing to do with the Cuban people or Cuban reality,"
insists festival director Ivan Giroud.</TE>
<TE>   But this week's airing of nearly 500 films from throughout the
Western Hemisphere, including 45 U.S. productions, is giving Cuba's
avid moviegoers a look at the forbidden materialism of the
norteamericanos and subliminally testing their commitment to loftier
social objectives.</TE>
<TE>   Elegant clothes, opulent furnishings and tables groaning with food
form an alluring yet unattainable backdrop in many of the films from
the region's more prosperous countries. That reinforces a sense of
moral superiority among supporters of the regime while compounding
feelings of failure and deprivation among the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Hollywood's suspense films, but for the most part I prefer
movies from Cuba and Latin America. They're more realistic," says
Tomy Magos, a 33-year-old newspaper production worker who, like many
Cubans, manages to take in a movie about once a week despite a
profound recession limiting the average wage to about $10 a month. A
cinema ticket costs 1 peso, or less than 4 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "People always find the money to go to the movies, even if it's
their last peso," says Maggie Alarcon, a Cuban cinema official who
grew up in the United States when her father was a U.N. diplomat.
"Sometimes going to the movies is a person's only true moment of
relaxation."</TE>
<TE>   Especially in these times of economic crisis, movies are the
favorite escape of many Cubans, and the 11-day festival, which ends
Friday, gives them a concentrated look at what the capitalist world
has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   The view of the United States, derived from both film and
television, is often unflattering. Spanish-language versions of "Sex
and the City" indulgence and "Sopranos" machinations elicit more
disgust among Cubans than envy. Among the few U.S. box-office
successes at the film festival are "In the Bedroom" and "Frida," the
former reinforcing Cuban views of the United States as a society
shattered by handgun violence and the latter presenting socialist
artists and intellectuals in their 1930s glory.</TE>
<TE>   "Our films are more professional. I like U.S. films, but I respect
Latin American films more. They don't glorify social problems," says
Dayree Veliz, a 29-year-old secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Guevara, the ideological godfather of Cuban cinema and
close confidant of President Fidel Castro, argues that there is a
larger role to be played by American movies in this country, as
filmmakers connect with the people irrespective of political divides.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is much more liberal than the political establishment,"
says Guevara, who cannot resist an urge to suggest that U.S. films
expose the foibles of America's culture. "Hollywood produces
extraordinarily valuable films about social conformity that are
important for understanding the complexity of life."</TE>
<TE>   Guevara, the longtime chief of the Cuban Institute of Cinematic
Art and Industry, who is now retired, says that more U.S. films
should be shown in his homeland but that some committee of "wise men"
should filter the offerings for offensive content.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue of perception and of proportion. I wouldn't want to
see the products of one country occupying all the cinema screens of
my country as they do elsewhere," Guevara says.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. directors and producers come for the festival, invoking
a cultural-exchange exclusion in the travel ban. Most are
little-known or independents, but a visit last month by Steven
Spielberg and one made by Kevin Costner last year to show his Cuban
missile crisis film, "Thirteen Days," have raised expectations of
more collaboration -- and more glamour.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban movie houses rarely show American box-office hits because a
U.S. commercial embargo prevents their sale and the government can't
afford to convert pirated videos for their antiquated projectors. But
viewers and film officials say about 80% of movies on television are
purloined U.S. productions.</TE>
<TE>   "What we see in American films is a lot of violence," says Iriam
Salasar, a 27-year-old microbiologist waiting in line with two
friends to buy tickets to "Frida." "But I like U.S. films, especially
dramas. They have an appeal that transcends our differing outlooks."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Experts Dive Into Baghdad's Arms Report</HD>
<DH>In a search for omissions and discrepancies, the Iraqi
declaration is compared with intelligence gathered by spies and
satellites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A small army of U.S. experts on Monday began checking Iraq's
11,807-page account of banned weapons programs it claims are now
defunct against intelligence gathered by spies, satellites and other
covert means.</LD>
<LD>   Although the White House National Security Council is coordinating
the overall effort, the CIA is leading the closed-door review at its
headquarters in Langley, Va.</LD>
<LD>   High-level task forces also have been mobilized at the Pentagon,
the State Department and the Energy Department to help search for
distortions, omissions or discrepancies in the massive Iraqi
document, as well as tips for further investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists and engineers from the nonproliferation and
international technology group at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico, America's premier nuclear weapons facility, will play a
lead role in combing the 2,100 pages that deal with Iraq's nuclear
program, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The little-known group, which operates under the Energy
Department's Office of Intelligence, assesses the science, technology
and infrastructure behind foreign nuclear weapons. It also develops
high-tech nuclear detection and other devices for U.S. intelligence
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department's
nonproliferation division and other U.S. defense and intelligence
agencies will help analyze the bulk of the report, which focuses on
Iraq's efforts to produce deadly germ agents, chemical weapons and
ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Monday that they had not set a deadline for an
initial U.S. assessment. Nor had they set a date to determine whether
Iraq has met its obligations to provide the U.N. Security Council
with full disclosure of any illegal weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just getting into it now," a U.S. intelligence official
said. He said the chief goal is to compare the document with
"information that we know."</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. intelligence official cautioned that no specific
piece of U.S. intelligence constitutes a "smoking gun" that will be a
clear test of Iraq's vow to disclose all its weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one key thing," he said. "It's a totality of little
things."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. analysts and technicians will rely on "the whole panoply" of
U.S. and allied intelligence collection efforts, he added, including
spies and defectors, satellite images and electronic intercepts of
Iraqi government and military communications.</TE>
<TE>   They also will compare the new document with reports compiled by
U.N. and International Atomic Energy Agency inspection teams that
worked in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, and with the numerous supposedly
"final" arms declarations issued by Iraq during that time.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the recent U.S. collection effort has focused on Iraq's
global network of front companies and other attempts to illegally
obtain and import raw materials, spare parts and highly specialized
tools and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a single 'gotcha' here," the official said of the
procurement schemes. "But considering all we know, it would be an
extraordinary set of coincidences if they aren't doing something
illegal."</TE>
<TE>   An index of the Iraqi document released at the U.N. on Monday
indicated that 33 pages are devoted to "acquisition of equipment,
material, supplies and empty munitions containers" for what Baghdad
contends was a now-ended bioweapons program.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of the index indicated that the report also details
Baghdad's efforts in the past to procure parts and technical
assistance for chemical and nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA, which believes that Iraq has secretly continued its
weapons programs, has not shared raw intelligence with the U.N.
weapons inspectors. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday
that the administration needs to protect sensitive intelligence
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to work with the inspectors to help to
get them the information so they can do their job," he said. "Of
course, at the same time, we want to make sure that sources and
methods are not compromised in any information that could be conveyed
to inspectors."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said "there's skepticism and there's fear about Iraqi
intentions and capabilities." But he withheld judgment on the new
document, saying the administration wants to study it "thoroughly,
completely, and fully and thoughtfully."</TE>
<TE>   The process, he said, "deserves respect and it deserves thoughtful
judgment, and we'll not rush to it."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the sheer size of the report -- more than 12
volumes in English and Arabic, plus computer disks -- might be
misleading, because it appears to include extensive documentation
that Iraq handed over previously.</TE>
<TE>   The report also includes dual-use chemical, biological and nuclear
materials that might have either military or commercial purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration insists that Saddam Hussein's regime
already possesses an arsenal of biological and chemical weapons and
is seeking to develop nuclear arms. It has asserted that Baghdad must
disclose those weapons programs or face military attack.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq says its latest declaration proves that it has destroyed all
proscribed weapons and that it has abandoned efforts to build any
others.</TE>

<HD>Dutch Report Says Militants Being Drafted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dirk Laabs</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>The Netherlands' next generation of Islamic militants is being
recruited, trained and brainwashed right at home, the Dutch secret
service said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "After Sept. 11, we found pages on the Internet calling on future
jihadis to learn how to shoot in clubs near them, in their home
country," said Vincent van Steen, a spokesman for the AIVD.</LD>
<LD>   Would-be fighters no longer need to travel to terrorist training
camps abroad, the agency concluded in a report released Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, recruiters from Liberia and Mauritania -- "not the places
we would have thought," said Van Steen -- approach youngsters,
especially the children of immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "These youngsters are in an identity crisis. They don't know where
they belong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some recruiters finance their work by selling drugs and fake
passports, the report said. Others try to obtain positions of
authority in mosques, which fund their efforts. German investigators
established a similar pattern in the behavior of the Hamburg group
connected with the Sept. 11 suicide pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Such recruiting is not illegal in the Netherlands.</TE>

<HD>Days Will Soon Be Brighter Thanks to Kabul's Power Plant
Hero</HD>
<DH>Manager protected the facility, due to go back on line this
month, during decade of chaos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When a switch is flipped this month and the main power plant here
comes to life after a decade in mothballs, energy-starved citizens
will have Gullaghon Hairan to thank.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a decade, Hairan protected the plant he manages in
northwest Kabul from marauding squads of moujahedeen and Taliban
looters. His largely successful efforts provide a rare point of light
in a country where the public infrastructure for the most part lies
in ruins.</LD>
<LD>   While the Kabul plant's 44 megawatts of power is a mere spark
compared with the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station -- whose two
working 1,120-megawatt nuclear reactors provide power for 2.2 million
homes in the Southland -- its recommissioning will increase this
capital's power supply by more than 60%.</LD>
<TE>   "This is my baby, this plant, and when the turbines start up
again, I will be immensely proud," Hairan said.</TE>
<TE>   During the plant's shutdown, the manager hid tools and spare parts
in underground culverts, guarded transformers and used sandbags to
protect the control room from rockets and gunfire. He was jailed for
11 days in 1997 for refusing to turn over copper transmission cables
to Taliban authorities, who wanted to resell the parts for scrap in
Pakistan and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   He and his staff lived alongside the turbines and maintained them
in near-working order long after diesel fuel dried up in 1992 and
forced the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the rehabilitation of the plant -- nearly
completed by the multinational company Alstom and financed by a
$2-million World Bank grant -- has been relatively brief and
inexpensive. Building a new plant from scratch would have cost at
least $75 million and taken years, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The rehabilitation is heartening for international donors, such as
Germany and the World Bank, that have committed large sums to
rebuilding a semblance of an electric system for this war-ravaged
city. They see a viable power source as crucial to the nation's
recovery from more than two decades of plunder and violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The dedication of the engineers running that plant really
deserves commendation," said Alistair McKechnie, the World Bank's
director for Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the rehabilitation of the rest of the electricity
grid in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan won't be so easy.</TE>
<TE>   What was once Kabul's other main power plant stands in ruins in a
southwestern neighborhood, stripped of valuable parts, its control
room a shambles, its fuel tanks shot up by vandals.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of the country's power transmission lines have been
stolen from their pylons. Large numbers of transformers been ripped
out of concrete housings and carted away, and electrical substations
have been dismantled for parts.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that Kabul, population 2.5 million, has a power
supply that in the U.S. would serve a town of only 70,000.
Electricity for the capital, generated by nearby hydroelectric
plants, is available just a few hours a day, and a mere 4% of
Afghanistan's population has access to electricity at all.</TE>
<TE>   Hairan couldn't save everything. The Taliban took 17 maintenance
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me that if I didn't give the vehicles to them, they
would take me out for a 'desert trial,' " the 49-year-old manager
said. "That meant they were taking you out in the desert to shoot
you. So I gave them the keys."</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank and other organizations also are concerned about
widespread deforestation in a country where most people depend on
wood for heat.</TE>
<TE>   Along with insecurity and bad roads, the lack of electric power is
among the most daunting impediments to an economic renaissance in
Afghanistan, said Christiane Hieronymus, a counselor with the German
Embassy here. Her government has committed $30 million in grants
toward rebuilding the system.</TE>
<TE>   "You aren't going to get private companies to invest in
Afghanistan without a reliable source of energy," she said. "People
can't work. Ministries can't communicate. Factories can't operate."</TE>
<TE>   The Germans are financing the repair of turbines at the two
problem-plagued hydroelectric power plants that have been supplying
the capital's power since the diesel-fueled main plants were shut
down. Once those repairs are completed, Kabul will receive an
additional 50 megawatts of power.</TE>
<TE>   But the problems go deeper than just power generation. According
to a recent World Bank study, Afghanistan loses half of what little
power it generates either to thieves or through faulty transmission
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the difficulty of paying for diesel fuel for the
rehabilitated plant, which Hairan estimates will cost $2.5 million a
month. Although the World Bank has promised to cover that cost this
winter, the future could be problematic for a government forced to
beg international donors for 85% of its meager $460-million annual
budget. Customer fees cover only a small fraction of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   His optimism tempered by the experience of living too many years
amid anarchy and violence, Hairan sees a recovery ahead, even
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "We have problems, mainly too many people with guns who don't obey
the law and don't want to see progress in the country," he said. "But
we have a lot of possibilities. We have gas in the north that could
fuel new power plants. We have the potential for thousands of
megawatts more in hydroelectric power. And we have many good people."</TE>

<HD>Hard-Liners Attack Students at Reform Rally in Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Scores of hard-line Islamic militia members, some brandishing sticks,
attacked students at a Tehran university Monday as they held a rally
calling for political reforms, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The violence erupted when one of the speakers at the Amir Kabir
University of Technology rally said Iranians are "paying the price of
our fathers' mistakes."</LD>
<LD>   The hard-liners -- angered by the apparent insult to the 1979
Islamic Revolution, which brought clerical leaders to power --
reportedly attacked the podium, broke the microphone and started
punching students, beating them with sticks and using pepper spray on
their faces.</LD>
<TE>   The students fought back, and at least six students and one
hard-liner were injured in the violence, the witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some 150 hard-liners attacked the gathering and beat the students
and also took away some others," said Sajjad, a student leader who
declined to give his last name.</TE>
<TE>   Political tension has been growing since last month, when the
country's hard-line judiciary sentenced reformist academic Hashem
Aghajari to death for questioning clerical rule.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, which is under review, has sparked the largest
protests for reform in more than three years. Students have staged
almost daily gatherings demanding the release of political dissidents
as well as reforms in a country where President Mohammad Khatami's
efforts to improve democracy and social freedoms have been blocked by
powerful conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the Iran Student Polling Center found 78% of Tehran
residents thought Khatami should take a tougher line with his
political adversaries.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Advice to Arafat Sparks Ire</HD>
<DH>Palestinians threaten an escalation in tension if their
leader isn't allowed for the second year in a row to attend Christmas
Eve Mass in Bethlehem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A top Palestinian official warned Monday of a "very dangerous
escalation" of tension if Israel stops Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat from celebrating Christmas in Bethlehem for a
second straight year.</LD>
<LD>   The warning came after Raanan Gissin, an advisor to Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, said Arafat should not try to attend the
traditional Christmas Eve midnight Mass. But Gissin stopped short of
saying Israel would bar him from the city.</LD>
<LD>   In new violence Monday, Israeli troops shot and killed a
28-year-old mentally disabled Palestinian near a military checkpoint
in the West Bank. The army said soldiers opened fire when the man
refused to halt and started running.</LD>
<TE>   And in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, a Palestinian woman
was reported slain after an Israeli tank crew opened fire on a taxi.
Rehaneh Hesham Kilani, 25, was killed and two other passengers were
hurt, family members said. A military official said the incident was
under investigation. That death came a day after Palestinian Nahla
Aqel was fatally shot in the Gaza Strip while walking with three of
her children.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, a Muslim, began attending the Christmas Mass in Bethlehem
in 1995, after the city was turned over to Palestinian control.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sharon's Security Cabinet decided to ban Arafat from
going to Bethlehem from his office in Ramallah. Both cities are in
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gissin said Arafat "should stay in his place, in
[Ramallah], because he has caused much tragedy to the Christian
population, and he didn't do anything to advance the cause of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Israel would stop Arafat from attending, Gissin
said: "I didn't say we would stop him. I just said that he should
stay in his place."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis say Arafat is not restricted to his office or to the
West Bank, but they also have said that if he leaves the West Bank,
he might not be allowed to return.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said Arafat had an
obligation to be with his people on Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be a very dangerous escalation not only on the
security level but also as far as the political situation is
concerned," Erekat said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANGRA DOS REIS, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Mudslides triggered by torrential rains slashed through this
southeastern Brazilian city Monday, burying houses and killing at
least 39 people, firefighters said.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,500 people were driven from their homes by the torrent of
water and mud after the city of 60,000 got more than 5 inches of rain
in 24 hours, the National Weather Institute said.</LD>

hillside to slip away in a mudslide that covered at least 10 houses.</LD>

rain continued to fall late Monday in his city, 75 miles west of Rio
de Janeiro, tucked between mountains and the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not torrential rain like earlier, but it's still raining,"
he told local radio. "I've never seen anything like it in 20 years."</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Opposition Prepares to Meet</HD>
<DH>The mood is hopeful among foes of Saddam Hussein on the eve
of a gathering in London to map out guidelines for a future
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- A broad gathering of Iraqi groups opposed to Saddam Hussein
is on track to take place this week after months of fits and starts,
but the assembly will stop short of trying to form a government in
exile, an opposition figure with royal lineage told journalists
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sharif Ali bin Hussein, a constitutional monarchist who aspires
one day to reclaim the Iraqi throne once held by his cousin, said 300
to 350 delegates will gather to map out a general plan for Iraq's
future governance. He described the mood of Iraqis inside and outside
the country as hopeful that this time, the United States is serious
about ousting the leader whom he called a "tyrant and murderer."</LD>
<LD>   "We are the most optimistic we have ever been, and therefore we
are preparing a future for the post-Saddam Iraq," Bin Hussein said.
The 46-year-old investment banker has not been to Iraq since 1958 --
the year his cousin King Faisal II was killed in a military coup that
paved the way for Baath Party rule. Bin Hussein's monarchist party is
one of the smallest opposition factions.</LD>
<TE>   The conference has been delayed in part by bickering among
factions about the size of the assembly and the distribution of seats
among the spectrum of opposition groups. But Bin Hussein dismissed as
a falsehood the widespread perception that the Iraqi opposition is
hopelessly divided.</TE>
<TE>   "We are no more divided than many political parties in the United
States or in the West," he said at a news briefing. "What unites us
is our determination to overthrow this regime and establish democracy
in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   As Bin Hussein described it, the meeting at a London hotel will
map out general democratic principles for a post-Hussein Iraq and
also form a committee of "free Iraqis" around which the country's
people could rally. That group could serve as the focal point for the
international community in dealing with the Iraqi people. But calling
it a government in exile would be impractical, he said, partly
because Iraqis inside Iraq could not be included and partly because
such a government would be hard-pressed to gain international
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Hussein's comments came as three of the most powerful Iraqi
opposition leaders met in Tehran, apparently to overcome last-minute
hurdles to the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting involved Ahmad Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National
Congress, an umbrella group for small opposition parties that has
support from the Pentagon and Capitol Hill; Ayatollah Mohammed Bakr
Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in
Iraq, a mainly Shiite Muslim group with Iranian backing and a wide
following in the south of Iraq; and Massoud Barzani, head of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party, one of the two Kurdish factions that
share power in the autonomous north of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In London, Bin Hussein said the Iraqi opposition has already tried
to help the United States by opening lines of communication with
Iraqi army officers who would defect in the event of a U.S.-led
military assault and by telling the Americans which specific units
want to "join the revolution."</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that units that do not resist and do not protect
Saddam will not be attacked" by the U.S., he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime is toppled, Bin Hussein argued, there should
be only a short-term U.S. or international administration before
Iraqis are put back in charge. Like the free French or the free Dutch
after the defeat of Germany in World War II, "free Iraqis" could take
over managing the affairs of their liberated country in short order,
he said. He rejected the notion that Iraq is a basket case in need of
lengthy foreign administration.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a centralized government that is working -- it just is
carrying out insane policies," he said. "The thing is to remove that
leadership and put in one that is more representative of the Iraqi
people."</TE>
<TE>   Bin Hussein also scolded European countries for not speaking out
against Saddam Hussein's rule.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is the position in Europe right now that Saddam is a
sovereign leader and he's like anyone else -- and that is what we
really feel disappointed about," he said. "At the very least, come
out and say that he is a mass murderer and needs to be arrested."</TE>

<HD>Venezuelan Merchants Feeling Pain of Strike</HD>
<DH>Businesses both large and small are affected by a
nationwide shutdown now in its second week. But many participate to
oppose the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL HATILLO, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Christmas is supposed to be the best time of year here.</LD>
<LD>   Tourists from all over flock to this small colonial town just
outside the capital, Caracas, using Christmas bonuses to snap up
handicrafts and folk art at dozens of small stores crowded along
narrow streets.</LD>
<LD>   The hundreds of thousands of dollars that pour into the local
economy spread across the nation. They reach into the Amazon in the
east, where entire tribes depend on sales of handicrafts here for
hard cash. And they reach to the Andes in the west, where small
farmers grow specialty coffee for sale to local merchants.</LD>
<TE>   But this year, it's different. Venezuela's nationwide strike, now
in its second week, has made the business of Christmas a mere memory.</TE>
<TE>   "This has totally paralyzed us," said Gloria Mugarra, who was
sitting Monday in her small furniture shop, empty except for the
smell of wood stain and handmade chairs and tables. "We are suffering
considerably."</TE>
<TE>   Designed to force President Hugo Chavez to accept early elections,
the protest has affected every sector of this nation's economy, from
the wealthy owners of department stores to poor vendors who sell
candy on street corners.</TE>
<TE>   Economists believe that the country lost at least $600 million in
exports last week, much of that as a result of a near-shutdown in oil
production. Analysts are predicting that even if the strike ends this
week, it will have shaved an entire percentage point off the
country's estimated $80-billion GDP for 2002, which has already
contracted by 7%.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the strike spread. Bankers joined in. So too did some
employees from the country's tax collection agency. More oil managers
and union workers signed up.</TE>
<TE>   The protest seemed to be reaching a crucial phase. Gasoline was
running out, with long lines of cars backed up at service stations
throughout the country. Diesel fuel supplies were thought to be even
lower, with some analysts predicting that the country's system for
transporting commercial goods, composed entirely of diesel-fueled
tractor-trailers, would grind to a halt today or Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Rodriguez, the president of the state oil company, Petroleos
de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took to the airwaves to warn that the country
was rapidly running out of money.</TE>
<TE>   He said a continued strike would mean the state couldn't pay the
salaries of state workers -- about 1.3 million people -- or make
payments to state contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "What's threatening us is a true national disaster," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There was panic buying in local markets. One grocery store
executive said business in December has been double the norm, even
though many stores have been open only half-days to show support for
the strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to sell anything next month. People are stocking
up," said the executive, Eduardo La Cruz, who was waiting to buy gas
at a filling station.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's opponents -- from businesses to unions to ordinary people
-- want him to resign and hold new elections. But Chavez insists that
nothing can be done until August, when the constitution would permit
a referendum on his rule.</TE>
<TE>   Amid growing pressure on both sides to reach an accord soon, talks
resumed Monday night, but it was unclear whether any progress was
made.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has hardened his position, declaring a "battle" for control
of the state oil company. He sent national guard troops to take over
private fuel shipping companies Monday and posted soldiers around gas
stations.</TE>
<TE>   And strike organizers have gained momentum with the support of the
country's oil sector and outrage over the deaths of three protesters,
blamed on Chavez and his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, for the first time, the organizers said the protest
would continue until Chavez leaves office. Previously, they have
pinned the lifting of the strike on an agreement for a February
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the final hours of an authoritarian regime," said
Carlos Ortega, leader of the country's largest union, the
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers. "We will be in the streets until
he leaves. Mr. Chavez, know that the people that you have ignored and
not listened to will remove you from power in a peaceful, democratic
and constitutional way."</TE>
<TE>   What was clear Monday was how much the strike has hurt businesses
big and small.</TE>
<TE>   The country's largest source of export income, the state oil
company, had stopped all exports, resulting in an estimated daily
loss of about $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   Internal gas supplies were also hurting. Adrian Bendeck, Chevron
Texaco's Venezuela distribution manager, said that between 15% and
20% of the chain's 83 service stations were completely out of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   The shortages of fuel and transport ran down the chain of
industry, paralyzing ports and major production centers of iron and
aluminum in the southeast, where tugboat pilots had stopped moving
barges along the mighty Orinoco River. Those industries account for
about $10 million in revenue a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Those plants are going to stop any minute," said Alberto Quiros,
a political and economic analyst. "There are ... a lot of people
working there."</TE>
<TE>   As more and more businesses feel the strike, especially small
ones, Chavez is likely to come under pressure from his own supporters
to find a solution.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the strike's duration, it's been business as usual for
the hordes of vendors who participate in the country's informal
economy, the folks who sell pirated CDs and Britney Spears notebooks
from tiny stalls that crowd the streets in urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   But as buses stop running and delivery trucks fail to bring new
supplies, as milk and food run short, the poor -- who make up 80% of
Venezuela's population and most of Chavez's support -- will start to
feel the pinch.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to allow elections. He has no other way out," said
Fernando Martinez, a former transport minister who is now in the
private sector.</TE>
<TE>   Here in El Hatillo, in cool green mountains a 20-minute drive
outside Caracas, the effects of the strike were clear enough.</TE>
<TE>   The place was a ghost town. The tiny central square looked like
the inner courtyard of a prison, ringed with restaurants and shops
that had pulled down metal shutters.</TE>
<TE>   Just up from the square, Javier Martin had locked the wooden doors
of Hannsi, which boasts of being Venezuela's largest handicraft and
arts center.</TE>
<TE>   When he opened them for a few moments to speak to journalists, two
people passed by and asked whether he was open.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said with a sad smile. "Not until the strike's over."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the 32,000-square-foot showroom, Venezuela's remarkably
rich folk art was on display.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, the manager of the center, said he would sell $60,000
worth of folk art in a normal week in December. Last week, he sold
nothing, and he still paid the salaries of his 40 employees.</TE>
<TE>   He said his business could survive perhaps two more weeks of the
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make the maximum sacrifice we can," he said.
"After that, we collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Mugarra, the furniture store owner, said that she has lost about
$15,000 in sales but that the sacrifice was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a high cost, but it's what we have to do," she said.
"Otherwise, we'll never get rid" of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said the willingness of small-business owners to make
such sacrifices is an indicator of how deep resentment against Chavez
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get businesses at Christmastime willing to forgo sales
for ideological reasons," said Ricardo Hausmann, an economist at
Harvard and a former Venezuelan planning minister. "They just don't
see the viability of this regime."</TE>

<HD>United Vows to Maintain California Presence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parent of United Airlines filed for bankruptcy reorganization
Monday, setting in motion a major overhaul of the loss- ridden
carrier. Nonetheless, the company's chief executive said the airline
would maintain a strong presence in California because the state is a
key asset.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 filing, the largest in airline history, means
United will keep operating while it develops a plan to pay back its
creditors. For now, the No. 2 airline behind American has vowed to
keep flying its current schedule and maintain its frequent-flier
program.</LD>
<LD>   But in coming months, the carrier and parent UAL Corp. are
expected to undergo significant changes that could include shrinking
the airline and selling off routes and other assets to raise badly
needed cash. Those changes, in turn, are likely to trigger major
shifts throughout the airline industry and in the choices available
to travelers.</LD>
<TE>   Regardless, United will maintain a major presence in California
even if the carrier drops some unprofitable routes, said Glenn
Tilton, UAL's chairman and CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Coast is a real core strength for United and obviously
is our window to the Pacific," where United has widespread service,
Tilton said in an interview. "Even if we had to prune a route ... we
would protect the region."</TE>
<TE>   United is the biggest airline at the Los Angeles and San Francisco
airports, and several of its most heavily traveled routes involve the
two cities. More than a quarter of United's nearly 1,800 daily
departures originate from a California airport, and nearly 23,000 of
United's 82,700 employees are in the state.</TE>
<TE>   As United works its way through bankruptcy proceedings, each
flight in California and elsewhere will be put to a "stress test" to
measure its profitability and popularity with travelers, Tilton said.
But even if some flights fail that test, overall service in
California "is central, pivotal going forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   United, the most powerful and profitable airline only a few years
ago, is awash in red ink and unable to make payments on its $21
billion of debt. Its Chapter 11 filing culminated a grueling downturn
at the company in the last two years that produced record losses,
eroded service, alienated many passengers and sapped employees'
morale.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding United's problems is the deep slump in air travel that
was exacerbated by last year's terrorist attacks, which included two
hijacked United jetliners. The slowdown slashed United's income and
helped low-cost, low-fare carriers such as Southwest Airlines eat
away at the market share of United and other airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But many analysts contend that the post-Sept. 11 trauma to the
industry mainly exposed structural weaknesses at United, namely that
its lofty operating costs were badly out of sync with the downward
trend in fares.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of United's downfall was an acrimonious tug of war
between the carrier and its powerful labor unions. Each side blamed
the other for much of the airline's swoon, which has left it unable
to fund nearly $1 billion of debt payments that are now due.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they staged a last-gasp effort to produce a recovery
plan and keep the airline out of Bankruptcy Court. But it failed.
Last week, the Bush administration rejected United's bid for a
$1.8-billion loan guarantee, making a bankruptcy filing inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Although passengers won't immediately notice much change at
United, analysts said the Elk Grove Township, Ill.-based airline --
which carried 75 million passengers last year -- probably will shrink
and lay off more workers as it reorganizes under Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   United began the process Monday with an announcement of wage cuts
for salaried personnel starting next week, including an 11% cut in
executives' base pay.</TE>
<TE>   There also is the prospect that large pieces of United, or even
the whole airline, could be sold. Some of United's routes, airport
gates, aircraft and other assets could be divested to raise cash for
the airline's lenders and other creditors. Even a liquidation of
United is not out of the question, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, where it was business as
usual Monday at United's terminal, passengers said they expected
United to keep flying but were bracing for disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned that the flights to lesser-populated cities will be
cut," said Michael Ker of Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Like most airlines, United already has slashed its operations --
by about one-fifth in this case -- to cope with the travel downturn.
United has about 1,775 daily flights around the world and 550
aircraft. Another major airline, US Airways, has been operating under
bankruptcy protection since August.</TE>
<TE>   One immediate concern is how United's employees will react to the
turmoil of a bankruptcy case and whether they can maintain a level of
service that appeals to travelers.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of customer-service employees are likely to be
distracted, angry and worried about their jobs and retirements," said
Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, an
advocacy group for business fliers.</TE>
<TE>   After the Chapter 11 filing Monday morning in Chicago, CEO Tilton
strolled through United's terminal at O'Hare International Airport,
hugging employees and urging them to stay the course. He handed them
buttons bearing the words "United Will Stand."</TE>
<TE>   In the air, pilots offered reassurance to passengers. "The pilots
want this company to succeed, not just survive," said Paul Whiteford,
head of the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The morale issue is acute at United because its employees own 55%
of UAL's stock, yet those shares stand a good chance of becoming
worthless with the company in Chapter 11. The stock finished
unchanged at 93 cents a share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, not only are many United employees in jeopardy of losing
their jobs, but their investment in the carrier also could be wiped
out. The employees obtained their controlling stake in United eight
years ago, when they made wage concessions in exchange for company
stock and -- in the case of its pilots and mechanics -- seats on
UAL's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the employees will be asked to make new concessions that are
even deeper than the $5.2 billion in total labor cuts that United
proposed in its bid to get the federal loan guarantee. In addition to
wage cuts for salaried personnel, the airline said it would soon seek
wage cuts from union workers.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, Tilton said, "I'm going to go at it in a very
different way." Rather than having management draw up a new recovery
plan to present to labor, "I want it consensual on the front end,"
with United's unions helping to devise the effort, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I now have the time and protection in [Chapter] 11 to have this
dialogue," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding more management-labor squabbles will be crucial, because
history shows passengers will keep boarding an airline in Chapter 11
if its service doesn't falter, said William Rochelle, a partner at
the law firm Fulbright &amp; Jaworski who has handled airline
bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   "After all," he said, "Continental did it twice and used the
second one quite successfully."</TE>
<TE>   United's bankruptcy filing is an ignominious chapter for an
airline that was once the nation's largest and most profitable, a
carrier whose "Friendly Skies" advertising jingle was nearly a
household phrase. By the late 1990s, United not only boasted one of
the best route systems in the world -- with hubs in California,
Chicago, Denver and Tokyo, among others -- but it also was riding the
strong economy.</TE>
<TE>   United was the airline of choice for business travelers, who
thought little of paying $2,000 for a one-way domestic ticket to make
a business meeting. That was especially true in California, as United
exploited the fortunes of Silicon Valley computer companies and the
plethora of dot-com firms that populated the state.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in 1998, United earned an operating profit (before
one-time gains or charges) of nearly $1.5 billion on revenue of $17.6
billion. But as the new millennium dawned, the economy weakened and
the technology "bubble" began to burst. Business travel began a
prolonged skid whose severity surprised even veteran airline
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it was obvious that United's labor and other costs
remained too high given the now-reduced level of travel -- and the
much lower fares that business travelers and even leisure passengers
were willing to pay. Of every dollar that United spends, 41 cents
goes to labor.</TE>
<TE>   When 2001 was over, United had lost an industry record $2.1
billion on revenue of $16 billion, and the airline has lost an
additional $1.7 billion in the first nine months of this year. UAL
listed assets of $22.8 billion -- by far the largest for an airline
Chapter 11 filing -- and debts totaling $21.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Tilton and the unions reached the last-minute
agreement on wage cuts in hopes of winning the federal loan
guarantee, the plan still fell short in the eyes of the U.S. Air
Transportation Stabilization Board.</TE>
<TE>   The board's decision was the last straw, because United faced $920
million in debt payments due Dec. 2 and could no longer borrow from
the financial markets on its own. Chapter 11 became its only
recourse.</TE>

<DL>CHARLESTON, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>A man trapped for nearly a week in his car after it plunged into a
ravine survived in the freezing cold by melting snow for water and
eating packets of Taco Bell sauce, rescuers said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Ward, 32, suffered a broken hip in the Dec. 2 crash and
couldn't get out of the car. He was found Sunday by Terry Likens,
captain of the fire department where Ward is a volunteer. "I don't

<LD>   Ward was in serious condition after surgery. Both of his feet were
frostbitten.</LD>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Carrying puppets, signs and roses, hundreds accompanied a pickup
carrying the coffin of peace activist Philip Berrigan as it wound its
way Monday through the rough neighborhood where he once served as a
priest.</LD>
<LD>   Family members stood in the back of the truck along with the plain
wooden coffin, hand-painted with red roses, as bagpipers played
"Amazing Grace" while the procession marched to the funeral at St.
Peter Claver Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   "He was bigger than life -- extremely human and heroic and
committed," said actor Martin Sheen, who marched in the funeral
parade. "He was a great inspiration and a mentor to me and others."</LD>
<TE>   Berrigan, a former Roman Catholic priest, died of cancer Friday;
he was 79.</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan staged some of the most dramatic anti-war protests of the
1960s and was arrested at least 100 times. He served a total of 11
years in prison for his anti-war activities.</TE>
<TE>   He led the "Catonsville 9," a group that used homemade napalm on a
small bonfire of Selective Service draft records at a parking lot in
the Baltimore suburb May 17, 1968. His brother, the Rev. Daniel
Berrigan, also was a member of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan's daughters, Frida and Kate, read a list of the jails and
prisons throughout the country where they visited their father.</TE>
<TE>   "He learned patience through bolts and bars ... through long
sacrifice and little reward," Daniel Berrigan told the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Some mourners carried sticks topped with cloth birds with tattered
wings; others sang hymns and Buddhist monks chanted and beat drums.</TE>
<TE>   Ched Myers, 47, an activist, writer and teacher from Los Angeles,
said Berrigan was "a historic pioneer in the act of civil
disobedience."</TE>
<TE>   In the church, mourners held signs reading "Arm the World With
Hugs," "Wage Peace" and "Plowshares Versus Depleted Uranium," a
reference to the name of Berrigan's Plowshares for Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great prophet of peace," said Father John Dear, 43, a
Jesuit priest who lives in Cimarron, N.M. "He spoke the truth against
war."</TE>

at this time" against Thomas Murphy.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy, 35, chairman of the anthropology department at Edmonds

<KH>ECONOMIC TEAM SHAKE-UP</KH>
<HD>Democrats Try to Find Their Voice on Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democrats are gleefully seizing on the White House shake-up of
economic advisors as evidence that its policy has failed, but they
are also acknowledging another bracing reality: They don't have a
coherent economic policy of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Still reeling from the November elections, House Democrats on
Monday convened a two-day closed-door meeting to hear advice from
economists and begin developing an economic growth plan that pulls
their frayed party together.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats are under pressure to quickly resolve their postelection
family feuds because President Bush is expected to unveil a new round
of tax cuts to spur the economy early next year.</LD>
<TE>   A shaky consensus among Democrats is emerging around a few broad
notions. Support is building for a short-term economic stimulus
package of tax cuts and unemployment benefits, and a growing number
of Democrats have been emboldened to challenge parts of Bush's 2001
tax cut -- at least for upper-income taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   But the opposition party is still speaking in a jumble of voices:
potential presidential candidates trying to break out of the pack;
governors struggling to balance their own budgets; cautious
congressional leaders struggling to straddle party divisions; balky
rank-and-file lawmakers fuming at the party's clumsy handling of
economic issues during the 2002 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what the Democratic agenda is," said Rep. Bob
Filner (D-San Diego) as he headed into the House Democrats' conclave.
"I hope we have one -- and very soon."</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of gloomy postelection introspection, Democrats
celebrated a flash of good news over the weekend when Democratic Sen.
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana won reelection in a runoff against Suzanne
Haik Terrell, the Republican elections commissioner in Louisiana, who
had vigorous backing from Bush. That victory, the Democrats said, was
a vindication of their view that the 2002 elections did not signify a
broad mandate for GOP economic policies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a myth out there that this last cycle was an overwhelming
victory for Republicans," said Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota. "Well, I think Louisiana demonstrated without a
doubt that there wasn't any overwhelming victory at all."</TE>
<TE>   And as Bush moved Monday to patch up the holes in his economic
team by naming a replacement for Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill,
Democrats said the maneuvering signaled a failure of economic policy,
not just of personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a point where the economy has not worked," said House
Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, who convened the
party caucus on the economy as one of her first acts after being
elected leader in November. "It finally has dawned on the president
of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   But especially in the aftermath of the 2002 elections, Democrats
believe that they cannot afford to just criticize Bush. They are
eager to formulate an alternative economic policy -- and blame some
of their election losses on their failure to do so sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "People knew what we're against but didn't have as good an idea
what we were for," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose). "We didn't do
a good enough job of outlining that."</TE>
<TE>   Doing a better job won't be easy because Democrats find themselves
in a box: If they push an economic stimulus plan, they risk
increasing the deficit -- a potential blow to the party's
long-standing effort to change its image as a pack of tax-and-spend
liberals. A new round of tax cuts also would compete for resources
with other Democratic priorities, such as a prescription drug benefit
for the elderly and education programs.</TE>
<TE>   When asked earlier in the day about the Democrats' economic
program, Daschle said it included aiding financially strapped states,
increasing the minimum wage and extending unemployment benefits --
aims widely shared by Democrats. Much more divisive is whether to
revise Bush's $1.3-trillion tax cut passed in 2001 and being phased
in over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The party has not found a common position on the centerpiece of
Bushonomics," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy
Institute, a centrist research group in Washington. "That's the
elephant in the living room. That hurt us in the midterm election."</TE>
<TE>   Before the election, few Democrats were willing to tamper with the
tax cut. Now, more and more leading Democrats -- especially among
potential presidential candidates -- are arguing for a freeze or
delay in aspects of the Bush plan such as the final phases of the tax
cut for upper-income brackets and the elimination of the estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats in Congress remain wary of rolling back even
part of the tax cut -- because many voted for the bill or because
they fear that Republicans will portray it as an effort to raise
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Calvin M. Dooley (D-Visalia) warned that a partisan fight
over freezing the Bush tax cut could make it harder to sell
Democrats' ideas for economic stimulus proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democratic message on tax cuts in the short term for
stimulating the economy could be overshadowed by a proposal that has
a freeze" on future tax cuts, Dooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea that is gathering steam is a temporary cut in payroll
taxes -- the 7.65% tax paid by both employers and employees into the
Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Payroll tax relief appeals
to many Democrats because it helps working poor families who do not
earn enough to pay income taxes and thus are unaffected by income tax
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Versions of the idea -- often referred to as a "payroll tax
holiday" -- have been promoted by sources as diverse as liberal Sens.
Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) and John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), the newly reelected
centrist Landrieu, conservative Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), and the
Business Roundtable, a Washington-based association of corporate
chief executives.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its bipartisan pedigree, a payroll tax cut is no slam dunk
because it runs into resistance in both parties. The White House has
given the idea the cold shoulder, in part because of its high cost --
about $100 billion for a six-month tax holiday. Some Democrats are
wary because half the price tag goes to employers, not employees.
People in both parties fear that it further weakens the ailing Social
Security financing system.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of problems with it," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui
(D-Sacramento).</TE>
<TE>   As they craft an economic strategy to counter the White House,
Democratic leaders must also heed the views of a rising force in
their party: governors.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, many of those governors and governors-elect met in
Washington with Daschle and Pelosi to help craft a party message. It
was clear that the task would not be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Many governors, facing looming budget problems at home, said they
would push for more federal aid for education, transportation and
health care -- another claim on the Treasury that could increase the
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   And while the idea of making Bush's 2001 tax cut permanent is
heresy among most Democrats, Gov.-elect Bill Richardson of New Mexico
said he would support the idea -- as long as it is tied to a package
of job creation and investment he and other Democrats can support.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be careful to have a positive economic growth message
-- not just criticism of the president," Richardson said.</TE>

<HD>FDA Orders 10 Web-Marketed Drugs Seized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government on Monday ordered 10 prescription drugs to be
confiscated at the border if patients buy them abroad instead of
through their doctors, calling the medications too risky for
unsupervised use.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are drugs ranging from the acne treatment Accutane to a
version of the date-rape drug GHB that is used to treat narcolepsy.
All can cause serious side effects and are sold in the U.S. only
under severe restrictions, such as curbs on which doctors can
prescribe them and which patients qualify.</LD>
<LD>   But the Food and Drug Administration noticed Internet
advertisements for some of the drugs that entice patients to order
the medications directly, ignoring safety restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   It is illegal to sell prescription drugs without a doctor's OK, so
the FDA is taking steps to shut the sites -- and warned consumers
Monday not to buy the drugs in question over the Internet. Because
some of the Web sites are foreign, the FDA also asked U.S. Customs
Service officials to seize shipments from abroad. The drugs include
Accutane, Actiq, Clozaril, Lotronex, Mifiprex, Tracleer, Thalomid,
Tikosyn, Trovan and Xyrem.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a loophole we're seeking to plug," FDA drug chief Dr.
Janet Woodcock said.</TE>

<HD>Law May Be Seeking OK for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Vatican trip prompts rumors of a filing. Or, he could be
stepping down, others say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law consulted Monday with the Vatican during an
abrupt trip to Rome, stirring speculation that he was stepping down
or arranging for the Boston Archdiocese to declare bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese shed no light Monday on the purpose of Law's
visit, which came amid a new groundswell of criticism among
once-loyal parishioners and priests about his handling of sexual
abuse cases against priests.</LD>
<LD>   "He's lost his diocese," said Father Robert Bullock, a leader of
the Boston Priests Forum, a group that represents about half of the
approximately 600 priests in the archdiocese. "He's in hiding. He
can't appear in public here. We need new leadership."</LD>
<TE>   Law's trip comes a week after thousands of pages of the
archdiocese's personnel files were released, painting a grim picture
of rogue priests who used drugs and engaged in sex. In one case, a
priest reportedly seduced girls studying to become nuns, telling them
he was the "second coming of Christ." In another case, the documents
say a priest fathered at least two children and abandoned their
mother while she was suffering a drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an archdiocese financial panel authorized Law to seek
Vatican approval for an unprecedented bankruptcy filing to deal with
the 400 or so lawsuits brought by alleged victims of pedophile
priests.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, priests have begun circulating petitions among
the clergy calling on Law to resign, joining a chorus of
parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   The pope is the only church official who can appoint or oust
bishops. Even when a bishop resigns or retires, he cannot leave his
post without the pope's authorization.</TE>

<HD>Lott Tries to Quell Furor Over Remark</HD>
<DH>Senate leader apologizes after he boasts that his state had
backed Sen. Thurmond's segregationist run for president in 1948.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)
apologized Monday for a statement he made last week at a birthday
party for a fellow Republican that critics said reopened some of the
country's old racial wounds.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a celebration for centenarian Sen. Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina on Thursday, Lott noted that Mississippi had backed
Thurmond's segregationist Dixiecrat presidential candidacy in 1948.
It was one of four states, all in the South, that Thurmond won that
year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're proud of it," Lott then added. "And if the rest of the
country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</LD>
<TE>   That comment, broadcast on C-SPAN, drew immediate condemnation
from civil rights leaders and some Democrats and was still rippling
through Washington over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice President Al Gore called on Lott to apologize,
describing the statement as "racist."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson went a step further, calling on Lott to
step down as leader.</TE>
<TE>   For Lott, the reaction to his comments was no small matter. In
1998 and 1999 he was forced to answer questions about his contacts
with the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that fomented
controversial rhetoric on race and immigration. Leaders of the group
denied that they were racist but acknowledged taking provocative
stands.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Lott repudiated "white supremacist or racist views by
this or any other organization."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the senator issued two brief statements in which he
sought to quell the new criticism.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, he said his remarks should be considered in context
of "a lighthearted celebration of the 100th birthday of legendary
Sen. Strom Thurmond" and should not be construed as an endorsement of
segregation.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, he went a step further.</TE>
<TE>   "A poor choice of words conveyed to some the impression that I
embraced the discarded policies of the past," Lott said through press
secretary Ron Bonjean. "Nothing could be further from the truth, and
I apologize for my statement to anyone who was offended by it."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the incident at a news conference Monday, Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he accepted an
explanation that Lott had given him in a phone call earlier in the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of times when he and I go to the microphone and
would like to say things we meant to say differently," Daschle said,
"and I'm sure this was one of those cases for him, as well."</TE>

<HD>Bush Proposal Protects Firms From Age Bias in Pension Plans</HD>
<DH>The regulations would shield employers when they switch
from traditional retirement benefits to a 'cash balance' arrangement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration plans to propose new regulations today that
would protect employers from age discrimination liability when a
company converts its traditional retirement pension benefit to a
different arrangement called a "cash balance plan."</LD>
<LD>   Such conversions typically mean less money for workers closer to
retirement age. Currently there is a moratorium on government
approval of conversions. But that would be lifted if the regulations
are approved after a public comment period and an April meeting of
the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   Cash balance plans usually consist of a percentage of pay by a
worker plus interest that can be paid out as a lump sum if the worker
leaves the company after working there for a certain period. Unlike a
401(k) plan, employees neither own the accounts nor make investment
decisions. Unlike a traditional pension plan, the worker isn't
guaranteed annual benefits after retiring.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say the proposed rules favor employers by allowing them to
establish all the terms of the plan, including the return rates paid
and the value of a worker's current benefit in the old plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is deregulation of pension plans and it is going to cost
employees dearly, especially employees over 40 years of age," said
Rep. George Miller of Martinez, ranking Democrat on the House
Education and Workforce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Companies increasingly converted their costlier traditional
pension plans to cash balance plans starting early last decade. The
plans are cheaper to administer and attract younger workers because
of their portability. Pension laws prohibit companies from reducing
benefits that already have been accrued. But they can cut or
eliminate future benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Firms that eliminate their traditional pension plans are subject
to an excise tax of up to half of any surplus assets in their pension
trusts. But to avoid the tax and still do away with a costly pension
plan, many companies are choosing to convert to cash balance plans.</TE>
<TE>   About 19% of all Fortune 1000 companies offered them in 2000,
according to a General Accounting Office study. The GAO is the
investigative arm of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But more than 800 claims of age discrimination have been filed
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over conversions to
cash balance plans.</TE>
<TE>   That's because older workers don't get the future benefits
promised under traditional plans -- only what they have earned --
when their plans are converted. Under cash balance plans, companies
pay a fixed percentage of a worker's annual salary toward retirement.
Older workers have less time to accrue those new benefits, and end up
with less than the promised benefits under the traditional plan.</TE>
<TE>   For example, James Bruggeman, a worker in Tulsa, Okla., told
Congress two years ago that the benefits he expected under the old
plan would have been 30% higher than under the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   Often older workers go several years without earning any benefits
after the transition. Called a "wearaway" period, that happens when
the balance of an old pension account being converted is higher than
what would be earned in the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal being issued by the Treasury Department says that
wearaway periods are not forms of age discrimination, a Treasury
official said Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Also, no age discrimination exists if older workers are offered
the same percentage of salary benefit or more in their cash balance
plans. The interest earned on the account also must be at a
"reasonable rate" determined by the employer.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Charged in Shooting of Priest</HD>
<DH>Cleveland rectory was set ablaze to cover killing, police
say. Man training as aide is held.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>A man recently dropped from training to become a Franciscan brother
was charged Monday in the slaying of a Roman Catholic priest who was
shot to death and burned in a rectory fire, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Montgomery, 37, had been training to be an assistant at the
priest's parish but not to conduct religious rites. He was charged
with murder and arson, Police Chief Edward Lohn said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have not given a motive for the killing of Father
William Gulas, 68, priest of St. Stanislaus Church nine years.</LD>
<TE>   Montgomery was in the seventh year of an internship to become a
Franciscan brother when the order's head of training traveled from
Chicago last week to tell him he was being fired, said Father Thomas
Luczak, an official with the Franciscans.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery had been transferred from Chicago to St. Stanislaus
this summer. Gulas reported on Montgomery's performance but did not
conduct or discuss a review with him, Luczak said. He also said it
was clear Montgomery was not suited to be a brother, but did not give
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Gulas was shot once in the chest and struck on the head Saturday
before the fire was set, the coroner said. His body was found in his
first-floor office.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery had spoken with television reporters Saturday as
authorities removed Gulas' body from St. Stanislaus.</TE>
<TE>   "The flames were that high, I could not do anything," Montgomery,
who was comforting parishioners outside, told the media.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't hear him. He was probably overcome by the flames by
the time I got there."</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing a variety of tasks -- elementary, fundamental tasks
-- housekeeping to helping out at the parish house," Franciscan
spokesman Ned Whelan said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire caused an estimated $50,000 damage to the church, which
was dedicated in 1891 and is on the National Register of Historic
Places.</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Retreating From Renomination of Cuba Hard-Liner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with resistance from key Senate Republicans, President Bush is
backing away from renominating Otto J. Reich, symbol of the
administration's hard-line stance toward Cuba, as his top diplomat
for Latin America, Reich's allies have confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   For two years, Bush has stood by the outspoken Cuban American
despite fierce opposition from Democrats who said Reich was
unqualified for his job and tainted by his role in the Iran-Contra
scandal. But the prospect of a bruising confirmation battle in a
Senate under Republican control has forced the president to consider
naming him to a senior White House position that does not require
Senate approval, Reich's allies said.</LD>
<LD>   "The political reality is that the renomination process is not
going to be an easy one," said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), a
key Reich supporter and a leading advocate for the Cuban American
community. "President Bush understands that fully, as does Otto."</LD>
<TE>   Reich's political supporters have been in "intense negotiations"
with the White House regarding his future, Ros-Lehtinen said, and
predicted the issue would be settled soon.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to abandon the fight may signal a more pragmatic
approach to Cuba at a time when powerful Republican-led farm-state
interests are pushing for a further easing of the 40-year-old embargo
on trade with the island, some experts contend.</TE>
<TE>   Reich has been a forceful advocate for maintaining economic and
political pressure on Cuba, and limiting contacts between Cubans and
Americans. Under his stewardship, the United States has reduced both
the number of Cubans who can come here for cultural contacts, as well
as the number of private U.S. groups entitled to visit Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, it signals that the deepening split within the
GOP over how to treat the hemisphere's last communist regime is
forcing the administration to adjust its approach.</TE>
<TE>   The move could expose Bush to some political risk in Florida with
his Cuban American supporters, especially if Reich is not given
another high-profile post. Cuban Americans were a key constituency
for Bush in Florida in 2000 and for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, in
his reelection campaign this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush named Reich assistant secretary of State for Latin America
last year through a special appointment procedure called a "recess
appointment" after Senate Democrats blocked a confirmation vote.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat, who first became widely known during the Iran-Contra
scandal of the 1980s, was forced by law to give up the assistant
secretary post when Congress adjourned Nov. 22. He has since been
serving as a special State Department envoy to the region.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had hoped that Reich would have a better shot at
confirmation with a Republican-controlled Senate. But Sen. Richard G.
Lugar (R-Ind.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has said he would prefer another candidate. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell has also argued privately that the
administration would be better off avoiding a polarized nomination
fight, according to people close to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters complained that the State Department has treated
Reich shabbily. They pointed out that he was abruptly moved to the
envoy post Nov. 22, although he had been told some time before that
he would be named envoy when the recess appointment lapsed. When
Reich returned from an official trip to Brazil, he found that his
nameplate and picture had been taken down from a State Department
wall, and his office had been moved from the sixth to the first
floor, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Reich's supporters also complained that he has been kept out of
the public eye in recent weeks, and was notably left behind when
Powell recently visited Mexico and Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials said the department moved hastily to
change Reich's job only because of the requirements of the law.</TE>
<TE>   They maintained that he cannot perform the duties of assistant
secretary, lest he violate the law -- and draw criticism from
opponents in Congress and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Reich had strong advocates in the Senate during the last term,
including Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.).</TE>
<TE>   But even though the GOP won a majority in the Senate in the Nov. 5
election, Reich's support was damaged as Helms and Torricelli
announced their retirements and Lugar moved in line to take over the
foreign relations post.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Sens. Charles Hagel of Nebraska and Mike Enzi of Wyoming,
are considered likely to vote against Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Reich has provoked controversy as assistant secretary of State.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have contended that he has spent too much time focused on
Cuba and not enough on other Latin American nations, even as Latin
America's economy has headed into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar believes Reich has not been "vigorous" enough in the job and
also does not have the strong bipartisan support he should to do the
job properly, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Reich became well-known during the Iran-Contra scandal because of
his leadership of the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America
and the Caribbean. The office came under criticism for a campaign to
promote the Reagan administration's support of the Nicaraguan contras
against their government.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters contended that Reich has been an effective advocate
for Bush's views. They noted that Bush has steadfastly supported
Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Ros-Lehtinen and other allies hope Bush will make Reich a senior
White House envoy to Latin America. Reich could still be influential,
Ros-Lehtinen argued, because he would have access to Bush and the
leverage he would need to continue directing a vigorous policy on
Cuba. She insisted that a decision not to renominate Reich would not
represent a withdrawal of support from him personally or his
hard-line policies.</TE>

<HD>$5 Dispute Could Decide Fate of Legal Aid Program</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court will decide whether escrow interest can be
used for low-income people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The Supreme Court took up a $5 dispute Monday to decide
the fate of a little-known legal aid program that supplies $162
million a year to aid the poor, the elderly and the disabled.</LD>
<LD>   The case centers on the interest held in escrow for a few days, or
weeks, by law offices or real estate firms. The short-term depositors
unwittingly -- and sometimes, unwillingly -- contribute a few dollars
to a novel legal aid program begun in 1981.</LD>
<LD>   The year before, Congress for the first time allowed banks to pay
interest on checking accounts. Seeing an opportunity, the state high
courts told lawyers and real estate firms to set up interest-bearing
trust accounts with the money they were required to hold in escrow.</LD>
<TE>   The tiny amounts of interest earned on millions of short-term
deposits is now the nation's second-largest source of legal aid,
second only to the federally funded Legal Services Corp. California's
program was created by state law and yielded $8.3 million for legal
aid this year, according to the state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   The money pays for legal aid lawyers who help low-income people
with all manner of civil court problems, from divorces, domestic
violence and child custody orders to disputes over medical care,
housing and employment.</TE>
<TE>   These lawyers are "at the core of our system of justice -- by
enforcing federal and state laws against wrongdoers who violate
them," said the AARP, the group that represents retired and older
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But the legal aid program has a powerful enemy in the Washington
Legal Foundation, a conservative group in the nation's capital. It
has funded an 11-year legal attack on the program, known as IOLTA,
for Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are finally in a position we've fought more than a decade to
reach -- a position where we can deal a death blow to the single most
important source of income for radical legal groups all across the
country," Daniel Popeo, the foundation's general counsel, said in a
fund-raising letter in September. "We're going to end this abominable
program! We must!"</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, two former Reagan administration lawyers, representing
the foundation, urged the high court to rule the IOLTA program
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "This is private property. And it was taken," said Harvard law
professor Charles Fried, who served as Reagan's solicitor general.
"We are entitled to a declaration" that the entire program is
unconstitutional, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was assisted by Donald Ayer, his deputy during the Reagan
years.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor immediately challenged Fried where
his case was at its weakest. Who has suffered a real loss here? she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   In its lawsuit, the foundation said it represented two Seattle men
who may have lost as much as $7 because of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Brown deposited $90,000 for two days with a real estate firm
and says he could have earned $5 in interest. The other plaintiff,
Greg Hayes, said he deposited $7,000 for a few days and that he might
have earned $2 in interest.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the program argued that a bank would have charged
more in fees to set up such an account than these short-term
depositors could have earned in interest.</TE>
<TE>   In her questioning, O'Connor asked: "How is it a taking if the
compensation is zero?"</TE>
<TE>   Fried responded that the interest is the private property of the
owner and thus is worth something. "We don't concede it has no
value," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the high court gave the foundation a partial
victory in a Texas case.</TE>
<TE>   On a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that the interest in these
short-term accounts was property. But it stopped short of deciding
whether using the interest was a "taking" of private property.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Amendment says "private property [shall not] be taken for
public use without just compensation."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 case split the court along conservative-liberal lines.
The court's conservatives formed the majority: Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Dissenting were the liberals, Justices
John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington state case heard Monday will decide whether
diverting the interest to legal aid unconstitutionally "takes" the
property of the depositors.</TE>
<TE>   It pits two groups with similar names and opposite ideologies:
Washington Legal Foundation vs. the Legal Foundation of Washington,
based in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Two Clinton administration lawyers, Walter Dellinger and Seth
Waxman, joined in defending the program. Dellinger, a former
solicitor general, said the government must compensate someone when
it takes something of value.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of the 'just compensation' is your loss. If your loss
is zero, you aren't entitled to compensation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy and Scalia spoke up for the challengers.</TE>
<TE>   "So the government is free to take someone's property if it can't
be valued?" Kennedy asked in a jab at one lawyer defending the
program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a whole lot of money, but it's their money," Scalia
added.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg sided with the defenders. Where is
there evidence of "a net loss"? Stevens asked, since the bank fees
would exceed the interest earned. Last year, the issue split the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel struck down the
Washington state program as unconstitutional, but the full court
revived it in a 7-4 decision.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor figures to tip the outcome in the high court, which will
rule in several months.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Prepares Itself for a Transit Strike</HD>
<DH>No solo commuting in Manhattan is among the plans
considered if workers walk out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With a threatened transit strike six days away, New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday outlined a series of contingency plans
-- including a virtual ban on single-occupant commuter automobiles in
Manhattan -- should the city's 34,000 subway workers and bus drivers
walk off the job.</LD>
<LD>   "New York will not be brought to its knees by an illegal,
irresponsible strike," the mayor said, announcing emergency
guidelines under which all highways, bridges and tunnels into
Manhattan would be restricted to cars with four or more people during
the workweek, and two or more riders during the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg, who frequently takes the subway to work, said he would
bicycle to City Hall if a strike shuts the nation's largest public
transportation system. "People in this city are tough," he said at a
City Hall news conference, flanked by commissioners and agency heads.
"They'll figure out how to cope."</LD>
<TE>   New York's transit workers voted overwhelmingly last weekend to
authorize a strike beginning Sunday, when their contract expires.
Union negotiators and the state-run Metropolitan Transportation
Authority remain far apart; the Transit Workers Union is seeking a
24% raise over three years, and state officials are offering a wage
freeze next year, with anyfuture raises tied to increased
productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Although state law specifically forbids strikes by public
employees, union chief Roger Toussaint has refused to rule out a work
stoppage. Bloomberg blasted that stance Monday, saying a transit
shutdown could cost the city $100 million to $350 million in daily
economic productivity and cause disruptions for the estimated 7
million people who use public transportation every day in New York.
Gridlock could also choke city streets and endanger lives by stalling
emergency vehicles in traffic, he warned.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do everything in our power to stop such a strike, and we
will not let a strike stop us," Bloomberg said. "A strike would be
more than inconvenient; it would endanger human life and devastate
our economy. We will fight this using every legal means available to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved to block a
similar strike, hours before TWU workers were set to walk off the
job. He secured a court order authorizing draconian fines of $25,000
per day or more on individual workers and escalating,
multimillion-dollar fines against the union for each day of the
strike. The TWU reached a three-year wage agreement with negotiators
at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   But not all strikes have been averted. During the spring of 1980,
an 11-day stoppage played havoc with nearly 600,000 students who use
public transportation, and millions of New Yorkers scrambled for
alternative ways to get to work. Bloomberg has said the potential
damage might be greater this time, because it would come during the
middle of the busy holiday season, affecting untold numbers of
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that calmer heads will prevail and that there will be no
strike," he said. "But meanwhile, we simply have to prepare as best
we can."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond workday restrictions on private automobiles, Bloomberg
outlined expanded taxi and ferry service that would operate during a
strike, plus restrictions on weekly street sweeping programs and
hours during which trucks can make deliveries on city streets. In
addition, key streets like Madison and Fifth avenues would be largely
reserved for emergency vehicles. The mayor said further restrictions
would be unveiled later this week.</TE>

<HD>Court Hands Cheney a Win on Disclosures</HD>
<DH>He doesn't have to reveal the names of people he met with
privately or what they spoke about while formulating Bush's energy
policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit seeking
to force Vice President Dick Cheney to disclose whom he met with last
year during the drafting of the Bush administration's energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   In a historic constitutional showdown between the legislative and
executive branches, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates ruled against
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. In
its first such suit against the White House, the GAO had sought
records of the participants in and topics of private meetings held by
an energy task force headed by Cheney.</LD>
<LD>   "No court has ever before granted what the comptroller general
seeks," Bates wrote, noting that neither Congress nor any of its
committees had issued a subpoena for the information or authorized
the suit.</LD>
<TE>   Comptroller General David M. Walker, who is the head of the GAO,
said he would decide whether to appeal after reviewing the decision
to "fully understand the basis for it and its potential implications"
and after consulting with Democratic and Republican congressional
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who along with Rep. John D.
Dingell (D-Mich.) first sought the information, said the decision "by
a Republican judge" was not the final word. Bates was appointed to
the federal bench by President Bush last year.</TE>
<TE>   But the suit was filed before Republicans expanded their majority
in the House and gained control of the Senate in the November
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Vice President Cheney's cover-up will apparently continue for the
foreseeable future, unless a Republican Congress demands appropriate
disclosure," Dingell said. "I'm not holding my breath."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, said that if the case is
not appealed, "they should close up the GAO. If GAO doesn't have the
authority to enforce its investigations, it has no reason to exist."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokeswoman said the court's decision
"protects and respects the right of the president to have an
independent decision-making process. Allowing the GAO to sue the vice
president without legal authority would improperly interfere with the
president's ability to formulate the best possible policies for the
American people."</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in February, is part of a larger struggle between
Congress and the White House over access to government records, a
struggle that the judge noted in his opinion dates back to the early
days of the republic.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the White House energy plan contend that it was heavily
influenced by industry lobbyists to promote oil and gas drilling and
nuclear power.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say secrecy is necessary for presidents
and their staffs to seek candid advice.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has also accused the GAO of exceeding its
authority and vowed, if necessary, to invoke executive privilege, the
right of a president to keep secret the advice and deliberations that
go into his decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's important that the president can receive
unvarnished advice," a White House spokeswoman said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing the decision, Harold H. Bruff, dean of the University of
Colorado School of Law, said, "Before we have a collision of the size
implied by a congressional demand for documents held near the center
of the executive branch, I'd want to know that Congress, in the form
of one of its houses or an authorized committee, really wants to
press a subpoena."</TE>
<TE>   "GAO, as a subordinate instrumentality, lacks that heft, and the
statute is unclear whether it even authorizes GAO to seek documents
at this level. Judicial forbearance is wise in this situation, and
that's what we got," Bruff said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, and the
Sierra Club, an environmental group, are suing Cheney to force
disclosure of the task force documents.</TE>
<TE>   The organizations are using a different legal theory -- that the
task force is subject to a federal law that is designed to open
government panels to public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "The vice president may not have to give documents about his
energy task force to the GAO anytime soon," Judicial Watch President
Tom Fitton said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said Judicial Watch was confident it would prevail
in this case.</TE>

<HD>Bush Nominee Drops Augusta Membership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an announcement apparently motivated by political considerations,
John W. Snow, President Bush's nominee for Treasury secretary, said
Monday he was resigning his membership at Augusta National Golf Club.</LD>
<LD>   During a morning news briefing before Bush officially named Snow
the nominee to replace the fired Paul H. O'Neill, White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer had said the Augusta National membership of
Snow, a 63-year-old chairman of rail freight network giant CSX Corp.,
would not be a "disqualification."</LD>
<LD>   Three hours later, Fleischer announced Snow would leave the club
and insisted that had not been suggested by the White House. Snow
resigned one week after former CBS president Thomas H. Wyman became
the first to defect because of national criticism of Augusta for not
allowing female members.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who says he will organize a protest during
Masters week if Augusta National does not admit a woman, said: "This
draws the president into it. His non-decision is a decision, that he,
in some sense, approves of Augusta's position. Ultimately, this was
going to embarrass the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fleischer, "That's an individual decision that [Snow] makes.
It is not, in the president's judgment, a disqualifying matter in
appointment to Cabinet secretaries."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Burk, head of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, called Snow's resignation "a very significant step
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) commented through a spokesman: "I'm
glad Mr. Snow walked away from this club and I hope he'll walk away
from a failed economic policy and set us on a new course."</TE>
<TE>   Burk predicted the Augusta National resignations would continue
and urged Rep. Amo Houghton (R-N.Y.) and former Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, along with several corporate chief executives, to
disassociate themselves from the club.</TE>
<TE>   "I am dismayed that the [Bush] administration said this should not
be a disqualifying factor," Burk said. "This makes it clear it will
be -- from now on."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National spokesman Glenn Greenspan said the club had no
comment.</TE>

<LD>   San Diego State (3-4) at Long Beach State (1-4), 7:30, XTRA (690)
-- First-year Long Beach Coach Larry Reynolds, previously at Division
II Cal State San Bernardino, is still looking for a Division I win.
The 49ers' only victory was against Cal State Monterey Bay, an NAIA
school. San Diego State, a former rival of the 49ers in the old
Pacific Coast Athletic Assn., lost to No. 1 Arizona, 89-81, in its
last game, while Long Beach was beaten by UCLA, 81-58. Four players,
led by 6-foot-9 center Mike Mackell (17.4 points), score in double
figures for the Aztecs.</LD>
<LD>   UC Santa Barbara (3-3) at California (3-1), 7:30, KEYT (1250) --
Cal, which has won 20 consecutive home games against nonconference
opponents, has made 21 three-pointers in its last two games. Santa
Barbara, led by guard Nick Jones (13 of 22 three-point attempts), is
shooting 46.2% from behind the arc. Golden Bear forward Joe Shipp
averages 22.5 points a game.</LD>

<HD>The Checks Will Be in the Mail</HD>
<DH>Buying out Toledo's contract will cost UCLA $1.34 million,
but won't cost taxpayers anything.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Toledo's contract as football coach at UCLA had six years left,
at $578,000 a year, but that does not mean UCLA will pay him the
$3.468 million that adds up to. Nor will Toledo be homeless and
destitute soon.</LD>
<LD>   His contract was a rollover deal, meaning it kept adding a year
each year, as long as he stayed and the school wanted him to stay.</LD>
<LD>   But once the school stopped wanting, as was announced Monday
afternoon by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, the payoff portion of
the rollover deal kicked in. And that meant:</LD>
<TE>   * Toledo's buyout, if he doesn't work anywhere else for the next
six years, will be $1.34 million.</TE>
<TE>   * The $1.34 million breaks down to the full $578,000 for next year
-- including salary, media-appearance money and his portion of the
school's shoe contract with Adidas -- plus five years to complete the
six-year deal, but at his base salary of $153,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   According to UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins, the deal also holds a
provision for reductions in the total payout once Toledo gets another
job. For example, if he gets an assistant's job for $53,000 some
year, UCLA will pay him $100,000 that year.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said that although UCLA is a public institution,
supported for the most part by tax dollars, Toledo's buyout,
obviously funded while the school is paying its new coach at the same
time, will be handled by the athletic department budget. Thus, no tax
money is tapped here, at least not directly.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said Bruin finances could handle this football-coaching
double dip.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a healthy state in that regard right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin athletic department operates on a $40-million annual
budget, and Guerrero said that was funded entirely by ticket revenue,
television rights revenue, about $2 million in student fees, and
donations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Guerrero didn't address it directly as the case here, the
donation category is where wealthy alums can contribute to the cause,
in boosting the amount available for a new coach or making sure the
athletic director can afford to fire the old one.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>It was Quentin Richardson's turn Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Limited to six minutes during Saturday's victory over the
Minnesota, Richardson played 33 on Monday against New Orleans,
scoring 16 points and taking eight rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Piatkowski, who played 40 minutes and scored 19 points
against the Timberwolves, had three points in 15 minutes against the
Hornets. As in Saturday's game, matchups dictated Coach Alvin
Gentry's moves.</LD>
<TE>   "They have small guards," said Richardson, a shooting guard who
often is the Clippers' first substitute into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "So coach knew I was able to post up on them, and we went at it
right from the start. We are playing together and trying to do what
coach wants us to do and just keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's outside shot isn't as sound as it was at times last
season, but he made up for it Monday with a variety of moves around
the basket. Most impressive was a thunderous dunk off Elton Brand's
miss that gave the Clippers a 73-65 lead early in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Mavericks recovered from their 30-point collapse
Friday against the Lakers by rallying Saturday past Golden State.

beginning play in 1980-81.</TE>

<HD>Leclerc Close to Returning</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Leclerc went through the motions during practice Monday, looking
very much like someone getting ready to play. Whether he will be in
the Mighty Duck lineup Wednesday against Washington remains to be
seen, but he is inching toward that game.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc has missed 10 games because of an injured left knee that
required arthroscopic surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt pretty good," Leclerc said. "There was nothing about the
knee that held me back. I hope I'm ready to go because I'm tired of
beating [assistant coach] Paul MacLean one on one. There is going to
be some swelling and some pain, I'll be able to play with that."</LD>
<TE>   Leclerc, who has two goals and nine points, will practice again
today and then decide whether he will return to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The news was less promising for defenseman Ruslan Salei, who has
missed five of the last six games with a strained right side. He was
reexamined by the team doctor Sunday but is no closer to returning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Samuel Pahlsson, who left minor league Cincinnati in early
November, has returned to Sweden, unhappy that he is still property
of the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "I will stay [in Sweden] until I'm cleared to leave the Mighty
Ducks," Pahlsson said in Ornskoldsviks Allehanda, a Swedish
newspaper. "I will not return to Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone has been asking for him. Duck officials have made
attempts to trade Pahlsson, but were not offered suitable
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim knows what I want and I got bored hanging around and
waiting," Pahlsson said. "Since I am not allowed to play in the NHL,
I thought it was just as good to go back home to Sweden. Since I'm on
strike, I might as well be in Sweden."</TE>

the answer to one of them. Capitals wallowing in weak Southeast
Division. Those Pittsburgh days must be looking pretty good to
Jaromir Jagr at this point.</LD>

<LD>Pete Carroll, head football coach at USC, was the guest speaker
Monday at a luncheon recognizing the 26 football teams that will play
for 13 Southern Section titles this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It provided an opportunity for key players to size up each other
at the annual affair and to hear Carroll's comments praising the
talent.</LD>
<LD>   "Southern California football is tremendous," said Carroll, whose
Trojans will play in the Orange Bowl. "It's enough to put us where we
are and put [other] Pac-10 teams in the spotlight."</LD>
<TE>   But the spotlight Monday belonged to the participating teams, such
as Phelan Serrano, which goes into its Division VIII game against
host Fontana Kaiser with a 13-0 record -- one of six remaining teams
that has not been beaten or tied.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, second-seeded Serrano will be an underdog at Fontana High on
Saturday when it takes on top-seeded Kaiser (12-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't give us a snowball's chance," Coach Ray
Maholchic said. "I told the players, it doesn't get any better than
going out and proving yourself when nobody believes in you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a true test of character, of what you can show."</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for all Southern Section championship football games are
on sale at participating schools.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the Division I, II and VI games will also be available
at the Edison Field box office, but only on game days, beginning at 9
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Separate tickets are required for each game.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are $8 for general admission, $12 for club-level reserve,
$9 for upper deck-level reserve and $10 for terrace field-level
reserve.</TE>
<TE>   General admission tickets are $4 for children 13 and under.</TE>

<HD>It Takes Tough Dove to Put Taft in Finals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's all you need to know about quarterback Cary Dove of Woodland
Hills Taft High, one of the most gifted college prospects in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, he had Taft on the verge of winning the City
Championship at the Coliseum. All the Toreadors had to do was get off
a punt. On the game's final play, the punt was blocked and the ball
was recovered by Dorsey's Henry Madge in the end zone for a
touchdown. Taft lost, 19-14.</LD>
<LD>   The next morning, Dove was on crutches from an ankle injury. He
spent three hours in an emergency room after the game, getting home
at 4 a.m. He felt miserable that his team had lost and would have
preferred to stay home and sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, he got up at 7 a.m. to appear on a cable television show
because he had promised to, win or lose. His father has taught him to
honor commitments, and the sight of a groggy, disappointed Dove
sitting through a rehashing of his most disheartening athletic moment
provided a compelling glimpse into his character.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Noah Smith has known Dove since kindergarten and is never
surprised by Dove's resiliency or toughness.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never look at Cary and feel depressed because he always
picks you up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith remembers the time when they were 11 and playing football
barefooted on a grass field. Dove broke his toe on a sprinkler but
refused to leave the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how competitive he is," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Dove's development into a 6-foot-3, 175-pound All-City quarterback
who has committed to California has helped make Taft (13-0) a strong
favorite to defeat West Valley League rival Lake Balboa Birmingham
(10-3) in the City Championship game Friday night at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Dove has passed for 3,071 yards and 30 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Before his junior season, Dove was so lightly regarded that most
Taft observers were predicting someone would transfer in to take over
the quarterback duties. Coach Troy Starr hardly offered a ringing
endorsement of Dove's skills.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think he could do it," Starr said. "He struggled with
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Dove was convinced he'd be able to learn the position.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never a doubt in my mind," he said. "I had to focus on
what I wanted to do. I didn't have any give-up in me."</TE>
<TE>   Starr expected perfection, and there were some loud, emotional
face-to-face encounters.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you tougher mentally," Dove said. "The only thing he's
trying to do is make you better. He makes you understand you can't
slip by. I don't take it personally. My dad always says, 'If I'm not
around and if there's an adult supervising you, they're your father.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Dove wasn't strong enough or fast enough to scramble
out of the pocket. This season, with 15 added pounds, he gained the
ability to pick up yardage with his legs. In a league game against
Birmingham, he carried a Patriot lineman clinging to his leg into the
end zone for a touchdown. That never could have happened last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel everything is easier than last year," Dove said. "Before
games, I get nervous but not as nervous. I'm not racking my brain
because I know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The most excited person should be California Coach Jeff Tedford,
who offered Dove a scholarship last summer when few others were
willing to pull the trigger. Dove is scheduled to graduate early so
he can arrive in Berkeley next month.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd be all over him," Starr said of college recruiters if Dove
were still available. "He's throwing 70-yard balls right now. What's
he going to do when he's 6-4, 200 pounds? His upside potential is
frightening. That's what has people drooling."</TE>
<TE>   Dove, though, understands where he fits in the scheme of things.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done everything I need to do," he said. "I don't have to
prove anything. All I need to do is go to college, do good, get a
degree."</TE>
<TE>   His parents are divorced, but they have raised him with values
that he never forgets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so glad I have a father so supportive of me," he said.
"A lot of kids out here don't have fathers. I'm just very
appreciative both [my parents] taught me good morals, and I feel
happy I have two parents behind my back."</TE>

<TE>   The only way Santa Ana Mater Dei could have toppled Long Beach
Poly last week in a Division I semifinal was for 16-year-old
sophomore quarterback Jason Forcier to hang tough in the face of
adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Forcier had completed only one pass in eight attempts until he
connected with Corey Boudreaux for an 80-yard touchdown pass in the
fourth quarter that delivered a 21-20 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see it in his eyes," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson
said. "He wanted it so bad. That's the separator from a kid who's
going to be good to a kid who's going to be great. He's been growing
up every week."</TE>
<TE>   Forcier used to live in San Diego and was commuting to Mater Dei
via train before moving to Orange County. He will start at
quarterback in the Division I final against Los Alamitos on Saturday
at Edison Field.</TE>

<LD>Playing short-handed certainly wasn't a problem for the Kings last
season, when they led the NHL in penalty killing.</LD>
<LD>   That hasn't been the case lately. After 26 games, the Kings rank
14th with an 83.8% success rate, and have given up four power-play
goals in their last two games against Columbus and Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   But with players returning from injury-caused absences,
improvement may be on the way.</LD>
<TE>   "We're finally back to using the same personnel that we used last
year," Coach Andy Murray said. "We can now pair C.J. [Craig Johnson]
and Smoke [Bryan Smolinski]; [Eric] Belanger and [Ian] Laperriere
together, and [Adam] Deadmarsh and [Ziggy] Palffy. That was the group
we had last year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After tonight's game at Nashville, the Kings will play six of
their next seven against teams with .500 or better records. But
because the Kings are playing the same Predator team that handed them
a 3-2 defeat at Staples Center last week, they know they can't be
caught looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a real sense of urgency right now," Murray said. "We have
to get points right now. We can't wait five, six, seven games for
guys to get back and to get comfortable with each other again. We
lost some points at home."</TE>

<LD>Tonight, at Nashville, 5 p.m., Fox Sports Net -- The struggling Kings
haven't lost in Nashville since 1999. But they hadn't lost at home to
the Predators for two seasons ... until last Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday, at Dallas, 5:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net -- The New York
Yankee School of Management seems to work deep in the heart of Texas.
The Stars handed out some hefty checks last summer and have the best
record in Western Conference.</LD>

Lemieux comes west for the first time since 1996. The Kings didn't
miss him. Lemieux has 59 points in 25 games against them.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday, at Phoenix, 4 p.m. -- It's tiring enough having to play
back-to-back nights, but Kings get thuggish Coyotes in second game.
The Coyotes average 18 penalty minutes per game, third most in NHL.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers have won two in a row and looked much better beating the
Utah Jazz Sunday night than they had in losing to the Jazz five days
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   But Coach Phil Jackson isn't satisfied. "We're not clicking on all
eight cylinders," he said after practice Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson is concerned about turnovers -- 21 against the Jazz,
leading to 25 points -- and isn't pleased that his team wasn't able
to put away the Jazz after leading by 20 midway through the fourth
quarter. The Lakers won, 110-101.</LD>
<TE>   "We should have been able to pull the regulars out and let them
rest the last five minutes of the game," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Besides Shaquille O'Neal rounding into shape, another key reason
for the Lakers' recent success is improved shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers shot 51.4% Friday, when they erased a 30-point deficit
to beat Dallas -- mainly because of a 16-for-18 fourth quarter -- and
they shot 50.6% against the Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   They're shooting 42.4% for the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Kareem Rush aggravated an injury to his left wrist Sunday
and is listed as day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who has averaged 23.3 points, 9.3 assists, seven
rebounds and 2.5 steals in the last four games, was named Western

<HD>Dolphins' Victory a Rush for Williams</HD>
<DH>Miami running back has a 216-yard game, including 63-yard
touchdown, in 27-9 rout of Chicago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Shortly after retiring Larry Csonka's number Monday, the Miami
Dolphins retired the Chicago Bears.</LD>
<LD>   It was Ricky Williams who put them out to pasture, leaving Bear
defenders in his vapor trail with a 216-yard performance that gave
him the NFL rushing lead and paved the way for a 27-9 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who a week earlier gained 228 yards in a snowy loss at
Buffalo, became the third player in league history to record
consecutive 200-yard games, joining Earl Campbell and O.J. Simpson.</LD>
<TE>   Something gained, something lost. By virtue of Williams reaching
1,500 yards -- and he has precisely that many -- Miami has to give
New Orleans a first-round pick in this spring's draft. But it's safe
to say the Dolphins will make that sacrifice with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now he's running as good as anyone," quarterback Jay
Fiedler said, "and he's really carrying the load."</TE>
<TE>   The yards might not come so easily Sunday when the Dolphins (8-5)
play host to the Oakland Raiders, who have the third-ranked rushing
defense and have won five in a row. That's clearly the game of the
week, and also pits quarterback Rich Gannon, a strong MVP candidate,
against a Dolphin pass defense that consistently ranks among the
league's best.</TE>
<TE>   "You always relish a challenge like that," Dolphin safety Brock
Marion said. "They've got Tim Brown and Jerry Rice, and Gannon's
really getting the ball to them. We've just got to make sure we go
out and execute."</TE>
<TE>   Consider Chicago executed. This game was a mismatch throughout,
even though the scoreboard didn't always reflect it. The Dolphins
owned the first half -- outgaining Chicago, 293 yards to 37, and
limiting the Bears (3-10) to two first downs -- yet only built a 14-0
lead. Things would have been more lopsided had Miami not lost two
fumbles inside the Chicago 10, one recovered on the seven and the
other in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't do that anymore," Dolphin tackle Todd Wade said. "That
was ridiculous on our part. We're a better team than that, and we
can't afford to be turning the ball over like that. If we do that
against Oakland, that could be the game."</TE>
<TE>   How fitting that after a gloriously imperfect first half, the
Dolphins spent halftime celebrating the 30th anniversary of their
perfect season. A huge stage was wheeled onto the field, the lights
were dimmed, and legendary coach Don Shula brought the crowd of
73,609 to its feet. Csonka was honored, and most of the other members
of that 17-0 squad gathered around the dais, their receding hairlines
and exceeding waistlines a stark reminder of how long their record
has stood.</TE>
<TE>   A brief but heavy rainstorm rolled through in the first half, and
probably played a part in Miami's three fumbles, two of which were
lost. The downpour also had thousands of fans reaching for their
raincoats. The skies cleared in the second half, though, and the
monsoon of a running back took over.</TE>
<TE>   With 9:28 to play in the third quarter, Williams broke around the
right side, found a crease, and ran untouched 63 yards into the end
zone. He's known as more of a bruiser than a burner, but he has shown
impressive bursts of speed this season. His 216 yards are the most
ever against the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to get our guys covered up, then we watch him do
his thing," guard Jamie Nails said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was beaming afterward, leading a reporter to ask if he's
having more fun this season than any other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to call it fun," he said. "It's more rewarding when you
work as hard as I did in the off-season and get these results."</TE>
<TE>   Bears' starting quarterback Jim Miller was carted off the field
with a knee injury late in the third quarter and replaced by Chris
Chandler. It was a miserable night for Chandler, too, who completed
seven-of-17 passes with two interceptions in about one quarter's
work. He was replaced by Henry Burris, who accounted for Chicago's
only touchdown with a six-yard pass to Marty Booker in garbage time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the diagnosis is for our problems," center Olin
Kreutz said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Year's Day plans of NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue could
hint at the league's vision for the return of pro football to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Tagliabue, who has never attended a college bowl game, will be a
guest of ABC at the Rose Bowl game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to the Rose Bowl this year just to get up close and
personal with the stadium," Tagliabue said. "So we're going to keep
it under active consideration."</LD>
<TE>   In the ever-shifting L.A. landscape, the Rose Bowl has emerged as
the current NFL front-runner. Earlier this fall, Tagliabue said the
league would consider awarding a Super Bowl to Pasadena, provided it
be played in a "significantly renovated" Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The only conceivable way such renovations could take place would
be if an NFL team were to make the stadium its home.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, the San Diego City Council will vote
today on whether the city attorney is authorized to talk to Charger
officials about renegotiating the team's Qualcomm Stadium lease, or
whether a specially appointed task force will consider the issue
later. The Chargers are ready to discuss eliminating the
controversial ticket guarantee and the trigger clause that could let
them out of their current lease.</TE>
<TE>   "For months, we've been trying to engage the city," said Mark
Fabiani, the Chargers' point man on new stadium issues. "This is
probably the last best chance to get those discussions started."</TE>

<HD>Future Is Still Cloudy for Grimson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stu Grimson thinks he aced his sports psychology final, but he's less
sure how he did on his computer class final. "It was one of those
multiple choice tests," he said. "It was pretty tough."</LD>
<LD>   Difficult though it was, it was nothing compared with what he has
faced the past year.</LD>
<LD>   Grimson, a former Mighty Duck and King who signed with the
Nashville Predators in July 2001, has been sidelined for nearly a
year because of post-concussion syndrome. He last played Dec. 12,
2001, four days after taking a nasty punch during a fight with
Edmonton enforcer Georges Laraque, and only recently has he been able
to ride an exercise bike without feeling nausea or vertigo.</LD>
<TE>   "Somebody who suffered the same blow might have been back the next
game," said Grimson, one of the NHL's career leaders in penalty
minutes. "Everybody is wired different and it seems everybody has
different circumstances for recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "A broken bone, you can pretty much put a stamp on it and say it
will take an athlete six weeks to recover. With something like this,
you don't know. It's like no ailment I've experienced in my career."</TE>
<TE>   Grimson built a career on toughness. Hugely popular wherever he
played, he lost few fights. But in this injury, he might have met his
match.</TE>
<TE>   He's not sure how many concussions he had in 14 NHL seasons, but
he's aware head injuries ended the careers of Dave Taylor, Pat
LaFontaine and Jeff Beukeboom, among others. He talked to Beukeboom
and to former Duck teammate Paul Kariya about their ordeals, but in
the end, it's his battle alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm in a little better spot. At least I feel I'm able to
begin some sort of rehabilitation," he said. "I've been on the bike
three days a week and I'm able to build on that a little bit. Until
then, when I was working out, I'd get pressure in my head and
headaches. I still feel them from time to time, but for the most part
I'm able to have a pretty normal day. If I do anything too physical,
they flare up."</TE>
<TE>   He enrolled at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., to keep
busy and have something to fall back on if he can't play again. "I'm
realistic, given I'm 37 and certainly at the back end of my career,"
he said. "My focus is to just get back to leading a normal life, and
I'll make a determination from that point."</TE>
<TE>   Nashville Cats</TE>
<TE>   In their fifth season, with no playoff appearances, the Predators
are no longer a novelty and are playing before shrinking crowds. They
raised season ticket prices for the first time before this season but
promised to refund the difference between the old prices and the new
if they don't make the playoffs -- and it looks as if they'll have to
dip into the till to pay those refunds.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators, who face the Kings tonight at Nashville, have the
fewest points in the Western Conference (20) and the fewest wins
(six) in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Progress probably is never coming as fast as anyone would like,
whether the manager, players, coaches or fans," said David Poile, the
Predators' general manager. "I still believe the path we've chosen is
the right path, but it's not a clear path. We've got a lot of shrubs
in the way that need to be moved.</TE>
<TE>   "The philosophy we've undertaken is to use our young players.
There's a price to pay, and every game you see a little glimmer of
hope, but sometimes, you take a step backward."</TE>
<TE>   Center David Legwand, the second overall pick in the 1998 entry
draft, has shown glimpses of high-level skill, but he's not at the
level of Boston's Joe Thornton, who was drafted first in 1997 and is
dominating games. But the Predators, who have little depth, expected
more than a goal and seven points out of Scott Hartnell, chosen sixth
overall in 2000, and 6-foot-3 center Denis Arkhipov (one goal, 12
points).</TE>
<TE>   Money Makes the World Go 'Round</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine's annual listing of franchise values has the Red
Wings as the NHL's most valuable, at $266 million, and the Toronto
Maple Leafs as the most valuable Canadian franchise, at $187 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers were second overall, at $262 million, Dallas was third
($254 million) and Colorado fourth ($250 million). At the bottom were
Edmonton ($86 million), Buffalo ($92 million) Calgary ($94 million),
Ottawa ($95 million) and Vancouver ($110 million).</TE>
<TE>   Forbes also said the Maple Leafs led the NHL in operating profits
with $24.2 million, more than double runner-up Minnesota's $12.1
profit. Washington had the biggest operating loss at $25.4 million,
followed by St. Louis, at $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   Deja Vu All Over Again</TE>
<TE>   Ron Wilson, hired last week to replace Darryl Sutter as coach of
the San Jose Sharks, can be abrasive and long-winded, but he's never
dull. He's also a better than decent coach.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, let go by the Capitals after last season, got more out of
the early Ducks than their talent warranted. He guided the Capitals
to the Stanley Cup finals in 1997-98 and to 102 points in 1999-2000,
the second-best total in club history, but he was dismissed when they
missed the playoffs last season. Perhaps that will make him more
humble than in his Duck days, when he and club president Tony Tavares
engaged in a battle of egos that set the team back several years.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's hiring deprives the Sharks of any excuses for continued
underachieving. If they're good enough for observers other than
Wilson to have picked them as a Cup finalist, now's the time they
must start proving it.</TE>
<TE>   Flames' Follies</TE>
<TE>   The top candidate to replace Greg Gilbert as coach of the Flames
is Jim Playfair, who coaches their top minor-league affiliate.
However, Ted Nolan was the winner of a fan poll at globeandmail.com
as well as on the Flames' Web site and in a local radio station's
poll.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he has a chance of actually being hired.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan hasn't been offered a head-coaching position since the
Sabres fired him after the 1996-97 season, and a story last week in
the Windsor (Canada) Star offered some insights about why. Several
general managers were quoted anonymously as saying they'd never hire
him because he went behind the back of then-general manager John
Muckler and directly to owner John Rigas during a power struggle,
marking him as a back-stabber. But that defense has a gaping hole:
Mike Keenan also has been accused of insubordination more than once
and still finds employment rather easily.</TE>
<TE>   It's more likely the old boys' club is uneasy with Nolan being
"different" -- he's of native American heritage -- and won't ignore
convention to hire him. He erred in turning down two assistant
coaching opportunities, but by now deserves another chance.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Gauthier, fired as the Ducks' general manager after last
season, has been popping up at Arrowhead Pond and Staples Center
lately to stay in touch with the game -- and, perhaps, to remind
people he's out there and available. "I'm just watching, observing,"
said Gauthier, who has stayed in Southern California because he
doesn't want to take his kids out of their schools. Asked if he's
waiting for a call about another job, he demurred. "We'll see," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Nash, chosen first overall by Columbus in the June entry
draft, is among the rare players able to make the leap from junior
hockey to a regular role in the NHL. The 6-3, 188-pound winger ranks
among rookie scoring leaders with six goals and 13 points in his
first 26 games and gets ample power-play time.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Pavel Bure and the Rangers were showing signs of life,
Bure suffered a potentially serious knee injury. He got the bad end
of a knee-on-knee collision with Buffalo's Curtis Brown last Friday,
and indications were he might have torn his left anterior cruciate
ligament. He will undergo arthroscopic surgery this week so doctors
can assess the damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' willingness to give Thornton a $5.5-million contract
extension is out of character, but it's smart. It ties him up through
the 2003-04 season, the last under the current collective bargaining
agreement, and indicates the Bruins intend to build their franchise
around him.</TE>

<HD>OneWorld's Fine Is Puzzling to Connor</HD>
<DH>His crew's latest run for the America's Cup is over, while
the censured Seattle team will sail on in the competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The steaks were burning and Dennis Conner, no longer the skipper but
still the chef, was cooking.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember when you broke the rules, you got thrown out," he said
at an impromptu news conference that took him away from a final team
barbecue for the ninth America's Cup effort of his sometimes stormy
sailing career. "Where did all of a sudden you get fined for breaking
the rules?"</LD>
<LD>   His reference was to Seattle's OneWorld, which was fined $65,000
-- about the price of a headsail -- but escaped disqualification,
although the America's Cup Arbitration Panel found it guilty of
possessing design secrets appropriated from Team New Zealand.</LD>
<TE>   The departure of Conner's team was a disappointment to him
because, with two boats and adequate sponsorship, he seemed to have
his strongest team since he'd brought the Cup back from Australia in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   It also leaves the competition without an all-American team.
Nationalism may be passe in the America's Cup, but all 16 Stars &amp;
Stripes crew members were U.S. citizens. OneWorld usually sails with
only two Americans on board, tactician and double Olympic medalist
Charlie McKee of Seattle and navigator Kevin Hall of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The other U.S. entry, San Francisco's Oracle BMW, sails with six
or seven, among them helmsman Peter Holmberg of the U.S. Virgin
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld, which swept Team DC, 4-0, in the quarterfinal repechage
round, has been allowed to continue into the Louis Vuitton Cup
challenger semifinals against Italy's Prada, which had joined Conner
in the submission to the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Prada was delighted to start the series with a significant edge.
The panel ruled that OneWorld must forfeit one win in each subsequent
series it may sail, which means that all the Italians need to do is
break even this week.</TE>
<TE>   It's scheduled as a best-of-seven series, but if OneWorld wins
four races and Prada three, it will actually be a 3-3 tie, forcing an
eighth race to determine a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Even if OneWorld prevails against Prada, the same rule will apply
in a knockout repechage series against the loser between
Switzerland's Alinghi and Oracle BMW.</TE>
<TE>   Team Dennis Conner also had protested OneWorld to the
International Jury, which deals in racing issues concerning "fair
sailing" -- e.g., using an illegal boat built with someone else's
design information. The day after the panel's decision, Team DC
sought to withdraw that protest.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had our day in court," he said.</TE>

<HD>Guerrero Finally Decides to Throw in the Towel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you listened to UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, and
successfully deciphered the double talk Monday, he apparently decided
keeping Bob Toledo around wasn't going to be good for appearances, so
he fired him and put the Towel Waver in charge of the football team.</LD>
<LD>   Most Bruin fans, of course, are familiar with the big goof who
stands on the sideline waving a huge towel over his head as if
hounded by a swarm of flies, but now to help clear the air further,
he'll be coaching UCLA in a bowl game.</LD>
<LD>   Now how is this going to be for appearances -- the Bruins running
onto the field for the Las Vegas Bowl led by their head coach
frantically waving a white towel, and the TV announcers doing
everything they can to convince a national TV audience UCLA is not
surrendering to start the game?</LD>
<TE>   As you might imagine, this was a very tough decision for Guerrero,
who was making his first personnel move as AD, replacing Toledo with
either the Towel Waver or Mister Eight Clap, the alumni cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   I guess we know who will be taking Steve Lavin's place in a few
months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT PRESS time NCAA officials were still checking their records to
see if UCLA will be the first team ever guided by an accomplished
Towel Waver, which I'm sure would make Bruin fans mighty proud.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 17 years of coaching experience and 10 in administration,"
Ed Kezirian said. But more importantly, I wanted to know, how many as
a Towel Waver?</TE>
<TE>   "Eight years," he said, and if he's going to do the coaching and
UCLA has to pay Toledo through 2003, it seems pretty logical to me
who should be waving the white towel from now on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GUERRERO SAID the Towel Waver will be flanked by the offensive and
defensive coordinators during the game, which begged the question:
"Who makes the crucial call in the bowl game on third-and-10 with the
score tied, 14-14?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have a phone in the press box and will be calling
down," joked Guerrero, and I guess in his zeal to be more competitive
with USC he's also going to act like Mike Garrett. (Who do you think
is on those headsets with Pete Carroll?)</TE>
<TE>   Now if he truly wants to be like Mike, and I get the shivers even
suggesting such a thing, then instead of putting together lists of
coaching candidates, he ought to walk around the UCLA campus, get
lucky and bump into a has-been coach who is visiting their child who
just happens to already be enrolled at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE WHOLE thing is a farce, of course, and right now I'm talking
about the state of college athletics because of what has happened to
a truly decent man, who exceeded preseason expectations, guided his
team to a 7-3 record only to lose two in a row to a pair of the BCS
final eight and then lose his job.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were picked before the season to finish sixth in the
Pac-10, then lost their senior starting quarterback and still earned
a bowl berth with freshmen playing the quarterback position and
everywhere else in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday we learned it really didn't matter what happened this
season because the "UCLA family," and the media were never going to
stop dredging up the sins of the past, Guerrero said, and so all this
nonsense about the new athletic director waiting all the way until
Sunday to make his decision on the fate of Toledo -- was just that --
nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say that's when I made my confirming decision," he said,
which means his first impression was his lasting impression, and I
wonder what his first impression of Lavin was?</TE>
<TE>   For the last few months there was very little contact between
Guerrero and Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting two weeks ago Guerrero could offer Toledo no
assurances despite a job well done this season.</TE>
<TE>   It was unfair, but since everybody likes a fresh start and the
hope it offers for beating USC, winning the Pac-10 and gaining BCS
recognition, the UCLA family and the media are going to embrace this
change.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo got the bum's rush in the end, and he deserved a lot
more for the entertainment his teams provided each Saturday, and the
way he conducted himself through both the highs and the lows of it
all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT APPEARS now that Mike Riley is going to talk to UCLA today, the
ideal choice to eventually put USC in its place.</TE>
<TE>   Riley was on the verge of taking the USC job before it was offered
to Carroll, but elected to stay with the Chargers while his kids
finished school in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   He changed his mind at the last minute, and was about to accept
the job again, but Carroll was sitting in Garrett's office in the
process of striking a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Riley is assistant head coach and secondary coach of the New
Orleans Saints, although his family remains in San Diego. It's known
he would love to have the opportunity to coach the Bruins, and he
offers UCLA strong Pac-10 credentials, working as an assistant at USC
and head coach at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, one of the most likable coaches in all of sports, like
Carroll, appears to be better suited to the college game because of
his enthusiasm and ability to make connection with recruits.</TE>
<TE>   He would be the ideal hire for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Rouss4:</TE>
<TE>   "Phil Jackson's coaching style is unique. He does not have to rant
and rave. Some buffoons like you would not understand that. It's
called quiet intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   It's called quite rare when an e-mailer doesn't rant and rave, as
you know.</TE>

<HD>Demand for World Cup Spots Rises</HD>

<LD>South America might be willing to give some ground in the battle over
how its teams qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, but it is
not about to budge on how many teams will be allowed to qualify.</LD>
<LD>   Nicolas Leoz, who has ruled CONMEBOL, the South American soccer
confederation, since 1986, said Monday in Asuncion, Paraguay, that
the continent deserves five guaranteed places at the quadrennial
world championship.</LD>
<LD>   That would be an increase from the guaranteed four places it had
in 2002, when Uruguay defeated Australia in a playoff to earn a fifth
spot at the Korea/Japan '02 tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it should be five," Leoz told Reuters, indicating that
FIFA could be in for a fight because Asia also has demanded five
places, instead of four, and Oceania has demanded one guaranteed spot
without having to go through a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Leoz said CONMEBOL's executive committee today would
reconsider its plan to have each of its 10 nations play the other
nine in a marathon, 18-game, home-and-away World Cup qualifying
series that would stretch from 2003 to 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Leading European clubs have denounced the plan, since it means
they would have to give up their South American players far more
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Summer Tour</TE>
<TE>   The details of Manchester United's summer tour of the United
States were hammered out Monday, and the English Premier League team
will play Club America of Mexico at the Coliseum at 2 p.m. on Sunday,
July 27.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition will be the second in a four-game, four-city trip
for Manchester United, which also will play Glasgow Celtic at
Seahawks Stadium in Seattle on July 22; Juventus at Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J., on July 31 and Barcelona at Lincoln Financial
Field in Philadelphia, on Aug. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca's Coach</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Lebrija, president of the Mexican league club Toluca, named
Alberto Jorge as the team's new coach following the resignation
Sunday of Wilson Graneolatti after the Red Devils had won their
quarterfinal series against Chivas of Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge, who is from Argentina, will have only a couple of days to
familiarize himself with the players before Toluca's two-game
semifinal series against Santos Laguna on Wednesday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Graneolatti said his decision to quit was "irrevocable" after
Lebrija tried to bring former coach Ricardo Lavolpe back for one game
after Toluca's loss to Chivas in the first game of the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Robson's Choice</TE>
<TE>   Former England and current Newcastle United Coach Bobby Robson
said he had turned down an offer to coach Benfica before the
Portuguese club last week named Spain's 2002 World Cup coach, Jose
Antonio Camacho.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that if I took the job, I would have become the only
manager in the history of football in Portugal to have managed the
top three teams in their country as, of course, I have also been with
Sporting Lisbon and Porto," Robson told the Evening Chronicle
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me an hour to make my mind up, but I only needed
minutes to tell them no."</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   The United States will send its men's under-23 national team --
its potential Athens 2004 Olympic team -- and its women's under-19
national team to the 2003 Pan American Games, Aug. 1-17 in the
Dominican Republic, U.S. Soccer announced.... Two goals by striker
Richard Morales earned Nacional its third consecutive Uruguayan
championship Sunday as it defeated Danubio, 2-1, in the second game
of the two-game series in Montevideo, Uruguay. Nacional won the first
game by the same score.... Universidad Catolica, Cobreloa, Colo Colo
and Universidad de Chile advanced to the semifinals of the Chilean
championship.... Sporting Cristal won its 14th Peruvian championship.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Setting Its Sights on Riley</HD>
<DH>Sources say Field, a Bruin representative, has made initial
contact with former Oregon State coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, USC was searching for a football coach and turned to
Mike Riley after serious talks with two other candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's UCLA looking to fill a spot and Riley appears to be No. 1
on the list.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours of firing Bob Toledo, sources said, the Bruins
dispatched representative Bob Field to New Orleans where Riley
currently serves as the Saint defensive backfield coach.</LD>
<TE>   The men have a personal history: Field coached at Alabama in the
early 1970s when Riley played defensive back for the Crimson Tide. It
was not known if Field planned to offer Riley the job or if this was
only a preliminary meeting. Neither could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   This much is certain: UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said
Monday that he had a preference for hiring "someone with West Coast
ties," someone who understood "the Pac-10 and the importance of
rivalries." As a former coach of Oregon State and the San Diego
Chargers -- not to mention a stint as assistant for USC -- Riley
fills those requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the 49-year-old was a coaching candidate in Southern
California, speaking with USC, Riley was restricted by a contractual
obligation to the Chargers. No such impediment appears to exist now.</TE>
<TE>   However, he's been prominently mentioned in connection with the
vacancy at his alma mater, Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   While the loudest buzz in and around the UCLA football program
focused on Riley, there was talk of other potential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Denver Bronco assistant Karl Dorrell, a former Bruin receiver,
said he received calls from UCLA boosters promising to recommend him
for the job.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how much influence they might have, but Dorrell
said, "I'm sure they've got a voice."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would be interested, the 38-year-old replied: "Oh, are
you kidding me? It would be a very, very enticing situation."</TE>
<TE>   Other possibilities included:</TE>
<TE>   * Greg Robinson. The defensive coordinator for the Kansas City
Chiefs was an assistant at UCLA from 1982 to '89, a stretch that
included three Rose Bowl victories. USC Coach Pete Carroll, a
longtime friend, said: "He's very experienced and knowledgeable."</TE>
<TE>   * Rich Brooks. A source inside the athletic department said
officials were interested in the former Oregon and St. Louis Ram
coach who has been away from football for more than a year since his
surprise retirement from the Atlanta Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   * Norm Chow. The USC offensive coordinator has been mentioned as a
candidate to fill the vacancy at Utah. Monday, he said he had not
heard from UCLA but would be interested. "How could you not be?" he
asked. "That's one of the prominent programs in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Redskin assistant Marvin Lewis, who reportedly turned
down the job at Michigan State, was also mentioned, as were
Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris, Illinois Coach Ron Turner and Iowa
Coach Kirk Ferentz.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero declined to comment on any of these possibilities and did
not give a time frame for his search.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the sooner, the better," he said. "There is no
deadline. Individuals are still in bowl games and some are in the NFL
ranks."</TE>

<HD>Focus Turns to Recruiting</HD>
<DH>Toledo's firing means UCLA must act quickly to ease burden
on newcomers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC football Coach Pete Carroll sympathized with Bob Toledo, calling
the firing of his cross-town counterpart a "hard time for coaches and
their families."</LD>
<LD>   "I feel bad for him," Carroll said at a speaking engagement
Monday. "He had a winning program and did a lot of great things."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for Toledo, beating USC wasn't one of them. The
Trojans extended their winning streak against UCLA to four games with
a 52-21 victory Nov. 23, and the fear in Westwood is that Bruins are
getting thumped again by their rivals -- in recruiting.</LD>
<TE>   With only six commitments from high school seniors, UCLA lags far
behind USC, which has received nearly 20 commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Kimbrel, who works for an Internet recruiting service, says
UCLA needs to act quickly in finding a new coach to avoid falling
further behind and possibly losing some recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Now until Feb. 5, the start of the signing period, is considered a
critical time.</TE>
<TE>   "They have some catching up to do, but UCLA is in a unique
situation," Kimbrel said. "Kids want to play there. They just have to
get the right guy in there. And the sooner the better."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ghebreselassie, a wide receiver from Chula Vista Bonita Vista
High, said he was uncertain if he would honor his commitment to the
Bruins. He was unaware Toledo had been fired when contacted Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked, to tell you the truth," Ghebreselassie said. "They
had a really young team this year. I thought they would give him at
least another year.</TE>
<TE>   "But, to be honest, I'm kind of happy about it. This season was
kind of a bust for them. I just hope they find a new coach soon so I
can talk with him."</TE>
<TE>   Another recruit, offensive lineman P.J. Irvin of Agoura High, took
news of the coaching change in stride and said he would honor his
commitment to the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably all happened for the best," Irvin said. "Athletic
Director [Dan Guerrero] knows what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   Two highly regarded high school seniors -- linebacker Michael Okwo
of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa and receiver-defensive back Steve Smith
of Woodland Hills Taft -- said a coaching change might prompt them to
reconsider the Bruins. Neither player had UCLA high on his list of
prospective schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It could help them move up more," Okwo said. "They're starting a
new program."</TE>
<TE>   Devin Stearns, a wide receiver from Gardena Serra High, planned to
visit UCLA this weekend but said he intends to reschedule his trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really affect my decision," Stearns said of the
coaching change. "I thought Coach Toledo was going to stay and was a
good coach. Unfortunately, it didn't work out."</TE>
<TE>   The father of Dennis Keyes, a running back-defensive back from
Lake Balboa Birmingham High, said his son would honor his commitment
to UCLA if the new coach retains one of two assistants -- Gary
Bernardi or Todd Littlejohn.</TE>
<TE>   "My son fell in love with UCLA and the campus," said the elder
Keyes, who is also named Dennis. "He wants to go there. But he
doesn't want to go there if he doesn't know any of the coaches."</TE>
<TE>   If neither Bernardi nor Littlejohn is retained, Keyes will choose
from Washington, Arizona and USC, his father said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Still basking in the glow of its selection to the Orange Bowl, USC
held its annual awards banquet Monday night at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire Hotel, an event that also kicked off Carson Palmer's
postseason tour.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer, an All-American who became the Pacific 10 Conference's
all-time passing leader in leading the Trojans to a 10-2 record, was
selected by teammates as the Trojans' most valuable player.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer and safety Troy Polamalu leave today for Orlando, Fla.,
where they will take part in Wednesday's announcements of several
national awards. Palmer is a finalist for the Davey O'Brien award as
college football's top quarterback and the Walter Camp award as top
player.</LD>
<TE>   Polamalu is a finalist for the Thorpe Award as best defensive
back.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Palmer will be in Louisville, Ky., to receive the
Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's top senior
quarterback. Then, it's on to New York for the Heisman Trophy
announcement on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited. It should be fun," said Palmer, who on Monday
finished second behind Iowa quarterback Brad Banks in voting for
Associated Press player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, who was selected All-America for the second consecutive
year, was chosen by teammates as the Trojans' most inspirational
player. Polamalu suffered a high ankle sprain against Washington
State on Oct. 5 but missed only one game.</TE>
<TE>   In team awards selected by coaches, senior guard Zach Wilson was
offensive lineman of the year, sophomore end Kenechi Udeze was best
defensive lineman and senior cornerback Darrell Rideaux was best
special teams player. *</TE>
<TE>   The two players happiest about USC's Orange Bowl date against Iowa
are freshman wide receiver Mike Williams and freshman safety Mike
Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is from Tampa, Fla., Ross from St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep telling the other players that I've only been to Miami
twice," said Ross, who received the team's John McKay Award,
presented to the underclassman with the most competitive spirit. "I'm
not an expert on all the places to go, but we're going to have a good
time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said he has not been contacted by
Utah to formally interview for the Utes' head coaching position....
Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua said he will have surgery on Dec. 24 to
repair the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>1996</LD>
<LD>   Record: 5-6, 4-4, tie for fourth in Pac-10.</LD>
<LD>   High point: A 48-41 victory over USC in double overtime in the
finale made for a pleasant off-season.</LD>
<TE>   Low point: Three losses to teams ranked No. 6 or higher --
Tennessee, Michigan and Arizona State -- in his first five games as
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Toledo, a default choice as coach, enjoyed a
honeymoon period and began to develop sophomore quarterback Cade
McNown into a winner.</TE>
<TE>   1997</TE>
<TE>   Record: 10-2, 7-1, tie for first.</TE>
<TE>   High point: UCLA won its last 10 games, including a 52-28 blowout
of No. 13 Washington, a 31-24 victory over USC and a 29-23 Cotton
Bowl victory over Texas A&amp;M -- the school that fired Toledo as
offensive coordinator in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: The Bruins opened with a 37-34 loss to Washington
State, a game that cost UCLA an outright Pac-10 title and raised
questions about Toledo's game management.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Toledo was hailed as a savior in Westwood, and the
momentum carried into the following season.</TE>

<TE>   1998</TE>
<TE>   Record: 10-2, 8-0, first.</TE>
<TE>   High point: Behind the passing combination of McNown and receiver
Danny Farmer, UCLA won its first 10 games to run its winning streak
to 20 and position itself for the national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: The Bruins had a complete defensive breakdown in a
49-45 loss to Miami in the regular-season finale, then lost the Rose
Bowl to Wisconsin, 38-31. Toledo forced defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti to resign after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: The debacle at Miami dashed hopes of the first UCLA
national title since 1954 and marked the first time Toledo was
accused of shirking blame.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1999</TE>
<TE>   Record: 4-7, 2-6, ninth.</TE>
<TE>   High point: The Bruins upset No. 23 Washington, 23-20, in
overtime, spoiling first-year Husky Coach Rick Neuheisel's chance to
beat his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: The handicapped parking scandal set a negative tone
early, but just as bad was scoring a total of 14 points in
consecutive conference losses to California, Oregon State and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: The glaring hole at quarterback with McNown gone
dogged Toledo for the rest of his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2000</TE>
<TE>   Record: 6-6, 3-5, fifth.</TE>
<TE>   High point: UCLA upset No. 3 Alabama in its opener and No. 3
Michigan two weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: For the third year in a row, the Bruins finished
poorly, and a 38-35 loss to USC was especially painful.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Bruin followers began to wonder whether Toledo would
ever recapture the glory of the 20-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2001</TE>
<TE>   Record: 7-4, 4-4, sixth.</TE>
<TE>   High point: Behind a talented group of seniors, the season began
with six victories in a row and tailback DeShaun Foster bolted into
serious Heisman Trophy contention.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: Losses to Stanford and Washington State were bad
enough. But the season spiraled when the NCAA suspended Foster for
the last three games because he drove a car that didn't belong to
him. The situation hit bottom when it came to light two days before
the USC game that quarterback Cory Paus had failed to inform Toledo
about two drunk driving convictions. The coach allowed Paus to play,
the Bruins lost, 27-0, and the team was accused of quitting.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Although outgoing Athletic Director Pete Dalis stuck
by Toledo, the seeds were planted for the coach's dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2002</TE>
<TE>   Record: 7-5, 4-4, tie for fourth.</TE>
<TE>   High point: The season opened with victories over Colorado State
and Oklahoma State, and after Paus was injured in a loss to
California, the Bruins reeled off three victories in a row, seemingly
saving Toledo's job.</TE>
<TE>   Low point: UCLA surrendered 100 points in blowout losses to USC
and Washington State, prompting Bruin fans to leave the Rose Bowl
early in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: The losses to the Trojans and Cougars made it easy
for Guerrero to justify firing the coach.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Gets First Look at Report</HD>
<DH>Despite U.N. members' complaints, Washington ensures that
it sees Iraq's entire declaration on its arms programs before anyone
else.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Overcoming initial objections from some U.N. members, the United
States got a jump Monday on analyzing Iraq's voluminous weapons
declaration after pushing through the weekend to get the original
sent down from New York.</LD>
<LD>   The 11,807-page declaration was whisked overnight from New York to
Washington after a weekend of intense diplomacy by Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell and U.N. Ambassador John D. Negroponte, who helped
convince the 14 other Security Council members to change the
arrangements for reviewing the document.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists and intelligence experts immediately set to the
laborious task of dissecting the document even as it was copied for
U.N. weapons specialists and the permanent members of the Security
Council.</LD>
<TE>   The only part of the document made public Monday was its table of
contents, whose entries include "nuclear materials," "terminated
radiation bomb project" and "production of ricin toxin."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the first tentative analyses of the dossier, the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said Baghdad's
2,400-page section on nuclear weapons, which is being analyzed
separately from sections on three other categories of weapons, looks
very much like its statements from before 1998, when previous weapons
inspectors left Iraq, according to Mark Gwozdecky, an IAEA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The declaration lists Iraq's research on and development of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as ballistic
missiles. It contains recipes for the production of agents and
weapons and includes the names of foreign suppliers that provided
Iraq with essential elements.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may be several days before U.S. intelligence concludes
its analysis, the Bush administration is already expressing doubt
that Baghdad fully disclosed its arsenal. The White House expressed
particular alarm Monday over Iraq's apparent acknowledgment Sunday
that it had been close to building a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of overall Iraqi statements, you need only look at the
wistful way that leading Iraqi generals describe how close they came
to getting nuclear weapons. That's why the United States is skeptical
of Iraqi intentions," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The way Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime publicly "yearned"
to build a nuclear arsenal "gives reason to pause and recognize that
Iraq is a threat," Fleischer added.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi report says where the weapons work took place, but
authorities in Baghdad say all specialized weapons facilities have
been destroyed or converted to peaceful uses.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council has been concerned about the document's
dissemination, not only because the report provides information on
Iraq's weapons-making techniques, but also because it contains the
names of countries and companies that assisted Iraq with equipment
and know-how.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, with British backing, made the case that it
should take the sealed set of documents and CDs when it arrived in
New York because the U.N. copying services were too slow and insecure
to handle the job.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend contacts reflect the degree to which Washington has
retained control over the Iraq crisis, even under an international
aegis.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, Negroponte called Colombian Ambassador
Alfonso Valdivieso, current president of the Security Council, to
inform him of a brewing deal among the five permanent council
members.</TE>
<TE>   "He said they wanted to make some changes to the previous
understanding, and that was it," Valdivieso said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Syria was the only nation clearly against the changes, according
to diplomatic sources. Mexico resisted at first, having pressed
Friday for all 15 members to receive the same version of the
declaration at the same time, as a matter of fairness. But Powell
persuaded Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda, according to a
Western diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the decision was Colombia's. At 11:30 Sunday night,
Valdivieso decided to allow the U.S. to take the Security Council's
sole copy. "I took the decision," Valdivieso said. "It's the
presidential prerogative, but it was on the basis of consultation
with the council."</TE>
<TE>   In comments to reporters Monday morning, Negroponte called it "a
win-win situation," portraying the decision as the United States
doing a favor for the 14 other members, not as Washington subverting
the council.</TE>
<TE>   Dismissing what he called "invidious comparisons" about the five
permanent members getting an unedited version while the remaining
members receive an edited one, Negroponte said: "This is not a
question of asserting some special privilege on the part of [the
five]. It's more a question of drawing on the expertise of the
declared nuclear weapon states," who can help with "precisely the
kind of analysis that everybody is trying to achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Making the copies "is simply a service we are providing to the
other countries," he said. Britain and France reportedly received
their copies late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Syria strongly protested Monday that the U.S. had shattered
Security Council protocol and taken the council's copy of the
declaration without the agreement of all its members.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed, we are not happy," said Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe. "It's
in contradiction to the political logic, to the procedural logic, to
every kind of logic in the Security Council.... It's against the
unity of the council as well -- all members of the council should
have access."</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby criticized Colombia for the
unequal distribution of the declaration. "All members should have the
same access to information in order to assess if Iraq is in
compliance with its obligations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although reportedly unhappy with the decision, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan publicly supported it.</TE>
<TE>   "If the council decided to do that, it is their right, and I will
not quibble with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "War is not inevitable." If Hussein continued his
apparent cooperation with the U.N. and the inspectors and disarmed,
"I would see no reason for war," Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration dismissed Iraq's apology for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which led to a 12-year international drama and
the current crisis. The State Department called the speech released
by Hussein over the weekend a continuation of Baghdad's "outrageous,
inflammatory and bellicose rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   "In this speech, Saddam Hussein again called for action against
regimes in the region, praised those who use violence for political
ends, attempted to shift the blame for the brutal invasion of Kuwait.
These are just further examples of the threat the Iraqi regime
represents to its own people and the people of the region," said
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a State Department official contended that the speech
actually backfired on Hussein by leading Persian Gulf nations to
appeal to Washington for protection -- and potentially helping the
administration build a coalition from countries long reluctant to get
involved in any U.S.-led military operation.</TE>
<TE>   The official said several nations contacted the State Department
on Monday to express their concern about Hussein's call on Arabs to
topple their governments.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq on Monday, weapons inspectors visited sites that may be
related to both nuclear and chemical weapons. An IAEA team went back
to the Al Tuwaitha Iraqi Nuclear Research Center, where several tons
of uranium are stored under IAEA seal. The team took samples from the
center's radioactive treatment facility as well as a sewage system
and land in the surrounding hills 12 miles south of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's last known nuclear program was at Tuwaitha. It also was the
site of the earlier Osirak reactor, which was bombed by Israel in
1981. Iraq's declaration contains more than 180 pages on the Tuwaitha
installation.</TE>
<TE>   The IAEA team also visited two other sites, Ash Shakyli and Al Qa
Qaa, to take inventory and collect samples to check for radioactive
material.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate inspection, U.N. specialists toured the Al Tariq
General Co. in Fallujah, where, the U.S. and Britain have charged,
Iraq reconstructed a chemical weapons facility destroyed in a 1998
U.S. airstrike. Iraq says the plant now makes chlorine and phenol.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. is slowly increasing the number of inspectors on the
ground in Iraq. In addition to the 25 who arrived Sunday, up to 30
experts are scheduled to arrive today, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On another front in the U.S. campaign to pressure Baghdad, the
United States moved Monday to widen its support of Iraqi opposition
groups. The White House announced that six more groups would be
eligible for funds from the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act, which provides
money for support of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The groups include the Assyrian Democratic Movement, the Iraqi
Free Officers and Civilians Movement, the Iraqi National Front, the
Iraqi National Movement, the Iraqi Turkmen Front and the Islamic
Accord of Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Inland Water Sale Rejected; Coastal Cutback Threatened</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CENTRO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Imperial Irrigation District on Monday defiantly refused to
approve a large-scale water sale to San Diego County, despite blunt
warnings from the federal government that such a move will mean a
severe cutback to coastal Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Governing board members said they bitterly resent the escalating
threats by state and federal officials for the Imperial Valley to
either sell part of its water or face dire consequences, including
having the board disbanded, state projects for Imperial Valley
rejected, and the valley's own water supply reduced.</LD>
<LD>   "If you push me around, I'll push back," said board President
Stella Mendoza. "We'll see them in court. I'm willing to pay for our
defense.... Without water, the Imperial Valley is nothing."</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has vowed to immediately suspend rules
allowing coastal Southern California to receive surplus water from
the Colorado River unless the Imperial board approved the San Diego
transfer by Dec. 31. The deal is key to satisfying the
administration's demand that California reduce its overall use of the
river.</TE>
<TE>   Other Western states, particularly Arizona and Nevada, are eager
for California to use less Colorado River water so that they can
begin to receive their full entitlements.</TE>
<TE>   After voting down the proposed 75-year deal to San Diego 3 to 2,
the Imperial board voted to have their lawyers draft a potential deal
of 3 to 5 years in hopes that will keep the federal government from
following through on its threats.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley rejected
the idea of a 3- to 5-year deal, and said it is now a near certainty
that Southern California will suffer a reduction in water.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial board also voted to begin a legal defense fund. In
anticipation of the vote, the board had already voted to hire the
firm of Ken Khachigian, a Southern California lawyer, water expert,
and Republican political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Bruce Kuhn, who joined Mendoza and Andy Horne in
opposition to the deal, said he expects "the state politicians will
be at our throats and the feds will be at our throats."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal had split the Imperial Valley: the Board of
Supervisors opposed the deal, the United Farm Workers supported it,
and the Imperial Valley Farm Bureau was unable to reach a consensus,
with some farmers opposing the sale of water and others favoring it.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Department of Interior shuts off surplus water for
California, officials at the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California have said they have enough water in storage to offset the
loss for at least two years and long-term projects are in the works
that could replace the surplus water.</TE>
<TE>   It is also unclear whether the suspension of the surplus rules
would mean an immediate reduction or one that would be phased in over
several months.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip J. Pace, chairman of the Metropolitan Water District
governing board, issued a statement regretting the Imperial decision
and saying that the mega-agency still believes that the deal "offers
California the best opportunity to follow through on its commitment
to ultimately reduce its dependence on Colorado River water."</TE>
<TE>   Under the 75-year pact, the Imperial district, the nation's
largest agricultural irrigation district, would have sold up to
200,000 acre-feet of water a year to San Diego, enough to serve 1.6
million people for a year. The price would have brought up to $2
billion to the district during the life of the contract. Imperial
uses more than 3 million acre-feet a year to irrigate 500,000 acres
of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   But board members and some farmers and business leaders complained
that the price offered by San Diego was too low. They also feared
that the agreement would have left the district liable for hundreds
of millions of dollars in projects to repair the Salton Sea, which
could be harmed by a reduction in agricultural runoff from the
Imperial Valley. Federal law requires partners in a water deal to pay
for environmental damage resulting from that deal.</TE>
<TE>   Raley, the Interior official, faxed a letter Monday morning to the
four agencies -- the Imperial district, San Diego County Water
Authority, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and
Coachella Valley Water District -- urging that the lingering dispute
over the sea not be allowed to kill the deal.</TE>
<TE>   California, Raley wrote, must avoid the fate noted by the narrator
of the novel, "The Great Gatsby": "So we beat on, boats against the
current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."</TE>
<TE>   The four agencies, as well as the state and federal governments,
have yet to decide who will pay the tab for any damage done to the
Salton Sea, which straddles Riverside and Imperial counties and
survives on agricultural runoff. The Imperial board wants a promise
by the other parties capping the amount the district will have to
pay.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are already suing the federal government for
allegedly reneging on its obligation to help the birds and fish
survive. The inland sea, although smelly and discolored, is teeming
with fish and serves as a stopover for millions of migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's vote, closely watched by water officials throughout the
West, came after seven years of negotiations that included two
administrations in Sacramento and two in Washington, plus a host of
state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Raley said that he would immediately revoke rules
allowing coastal California to get surplus water if the deal was not
signed by Dec. 31, a deadline set two years ago by the seven states
that get water from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   At stake is 600,000 to 800,000 acre-feet of water a year that
Metropolitan distributes to local water agencies in six Southern
California counties -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   For the San Diego district, the water deal was born of a 50-year
civic desire to have a measure of independence from the Los
Angeles-based Metropolitan district. Forced by the federal government
to join the Metropolitan during World War II, San Diego has grown
into Metropolitan's largest and unhappiest customer.</TE>
<TE>   At the root of San Diego's discontent is a formula that could
allow the Metropolitan district to shift nearly half of San Diego's
water to Los Angeles during a drought.</TE>
<TE>   While Metropolitan officials and board members have said they
would never invoke the formula, they have resisted changing it and
successfully fought a lawsuit filed by San Diego to force a change.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure its own supply of water, San Diego officials began
negotiating seven years ago with the Imperial district. In the search
for more water to serve California, virtually all paths lead to the
Imperial Valley, where farmers enjoy the cheapest, most plentiful
water supply of any region in the state.</TE>
<TE>   There, fear runs deep that politically powerful forces from
outside the Imperial Valley will someday try to steal the valley's
water.</TE>
<TE>   A century ago, farmers guarded their water with shotguns. Now they
employ lawyers. When the government attempted to restrict the use of
water from federal reclamation projects to farms of 160 acres or
less, the Imperial Irrigation District fought to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which ruled in its favor.</TE>
<TE>   "Our water rights have been well earned by the hard work of the
pioneers here," Farm Bureau President Michael Cox told the board. "I
think they deserve to be protected."</TE>

<HD>Universities Struggle to Legislate Student-Faculty Liaisons</HD>
<DH>A Berkeley case highlights the vagaries of campus policy.
But some raise privacy concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein and Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late last year the College of William and Mary in Virginia banned all
sexual liaisons between professors and undergraduates as well as
between faculty and graduate students under their supervision.</LD>
<LD>   This spring, Stanford University toughened its policy to require
professors to give up "any supervisory or evaluative function" over
their campus romantic partners and to report such relationships to
their department chairs or deans.</LD>
<LD>   Ohio Wesleyan University barred faculty from romances with
students they supervise, advise or evaluate.</LD>
<TE>   Sexual relationships between faculty members and students -- a
long-standing feature of campus life -- increasingly are being
legislated out of academia.</TE>
<TE>   But for every school that has imposed a ban, there are many more
that still have vague or loophole-riddled policies -- or no explicit
restrictions at all -- on consensual relationships between faculty
and students.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how strict such policies should be has been
highlighted in the last two weeks by the resignation just before
Thanksgiving of the dean of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.
John P. Dwyer resigned as dean and as a member of the law school
faculty after the university opened an investigation into a sexual
encounter he had two years ago with a female law student.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer's resignation has students, faculty and administrators
questioning the adequacy of the school's policies. Nationwide, that
same question has arisen at hundreds of campuses.</TE>
<TE>   University administrators and professors have been "really
schizophrenic on the issue," said Sheldon E. Steinbach, general
counsel for the American Council on Education.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very concerned about protecting students. At the same
time, they don't want to see faculty members' careers ruined by mere
allegations of impropriety."</TE>
<TE>   Many academics argue that consenting adults who meet on campus
should be free to date. Often, they note, there is little age
difference between junior professors and students, particularly
graduate students. And over the years, faculty-student romances have
led to lots of happy marriages.</TE>
<TE>   But professor-student relationships also have yielded some of
higher education's ugliest sexual harassment complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict seems inherent in educational settings. Students and
faculty members can spend many hours together in often intense
intellectual relationships. At the same time, faculty members wield
extensive power over students, academically and psychologically.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this very strange power balance," said Boalt Hall law
student Jo Ann Virata . "It's not an equal situation at all."</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, Jonathan Petrus, 29, a third-year law student,
argued that "there really ought to be a bright-line rule."</TE>
<TE>   "In order to eliminate the appearance of impropriety, why not
create a policy that prohibits or at least frowns upon [sexual]
relationships between faculty and students? It doesn't seem that
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Some schools have adopted that sort of ban. Generally, they have
been smaller colleges such as Oberlin and William and Mary, located
in towns "where they feel the fabric and community of a campus would
be destroyed if any faculty member got involved with a student," said
D. Frank Vinik, a risk manager and lawyer with United Educators, a
cooperative providing insurance to about 1,000 U.S. colleges and
universities.</TE>
<TE>   William and Mary adopted its ban in November 2001 after two
incidents. First, a former creative writing instructor wrote an
article for GQ magazine in which he portrayed the school as a "moral
mosh pit" and said he had had an affair with a married student that
led to the suicide of her husband. University officials disputed the
story.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, an anthropology professor resigned after
accusations that he had impregnated a student who worked for him and
hounded her with threatening phone calls after learning of the
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The incident at Boalt was far less dramatic. Both sides agree that
it concerned a one-time encounter between Dwyer and a woman who was
not in his class. The encounter, they said, did not involve sexual
intercourse. Dwyer has said it was consensual. The woman, through her
attorney, said that he fondled her after she passed out following a
night of drinking and that his conduct was an assault that should
legally be considered sexual harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty and administrators who oppose across-the-board bans on
sexual contact between faculty and students say they want to ensure
against policies that are so broad that they open the way to faculty
members being abused by false allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "It could become a very dangerous tool in which people could be
accused of things that weren't true," said Philippa Levine, a USC
expert in the history of sexuality and president of the university's
academic senate.</TE>
<TE>   Levine says she considers relationships between professors and
students a "very, very bad idea" but questions whether a ban or tight
restrictions would work.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has not proven itself particularly successful in
legislating around sexuality," Levine said. "Its laws on prostitution
are a very good example."</TE>
<TE>   To stop relationships between faculty and students, "You're going
to have to reprogram people's psyches," said Barry M. Dank, a
sociologist at Cal State Long Beach. Dank, who is 60 and married to
one of his former students, formed a group in the mid-1990s called
Consenting Academics for Sexual Equity to speak out against some of
the first bans on professor-student dating.</TE>
<TE>   "Women tend to be attracted to more powerful men, men with
resources. And men tend to be attracted to physically attractive,
nubile women. All the training in the world is not going to change
that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many students question policies that would bar or inhibit
fraternization between them and professors. Some say they enjoy
getting to know their professors in informal settings outside of
class. Others noted that many graduate students attend schools like
Boalt because of the networking possibilities -- good relationships
with faculty members can often lead to connections for jobs.</TE>
<TE>   And particularly among older graduate students there is resentment
over potential university intrusion on their privacy.</TE>
<TE>   The result of those conflicting interests has been a national
mishmash of policies.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools have sought a middle ground. Stanford's policy,
adopted in May, allows faculty members to date students but requires
them to notify their bosses of the relationship and recuse themselves
from academic involvement with students they are dating.</TE>
<TE>   University officials wanted an approach that "was enforceable,
that made sense and was not so prohibitive as to drive the issue
underground," said Laraine T. Zappert, director of the school's
Sexual Harassment Policy Office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's professionally dumb to be grading someone you're having a
romantic relationship with," Zappert said. "It just defies any sense
of fairness to the person or anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley's policy, adopted in 1994, says professors may be subject
to discipline if they fail to disqualify themselves "from exercising
professional responsibility over a student in cases where a conflict
of interest exists."</TE>
<TE>   Jan de Vries, UC Berkeley's vice provost for academic affairs and
faculty welfare, interpreted that to mean faculty members may not
date students in their classes or whose theses they are overseeing,
but they can have relationships with former students or others not in
their current classes. De Vries would not comment on specifics of the
Dwyer case but said he believes the rules prohibit a sexual liaison
between a dean and a student in his school.</TE>
<TE>   USC has a three-paragraph passage in its faculty handbook saying
that consensual relationships "are discouraged." In legalese, the
policy goes on to explain that faculty members who go forward can't
show favoritism toward those with whom they are having sex, nor can
they penalize those who turn them down.</TE>
<TE>   Others schools, including Caltech, UCLA and at least a third of
the 23 California State University campuses, have not adopted
restrictions on consensual relationships. Officials at those campuses
often take the position that existing faculty conduct or sexual
harassment policies are adequate protection.</TE>
<TE>   The wide variation in policies -- and the lack of clarity at many
institutions -- can, itself, be a source of trouble, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're experiencing here is absolutely how murky the
boundaries are and how hard it is to navigate them," said Gabriela
Kremer, 31, a third-year student at Boalt. "The rules really need to
be clear."</TE>

<HD>Railway Exec Is Chosen for Treasury Post</HD>
<DH>Bush, signaling he is intent on cutting taxes, says he will
nominate John W. Snow to replace Paul H. O'Neill. The response is
muted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Monday that he would nominate the chairman and
chief executive of CSX Corp., John W. Snow, as Treasury secretary,
putting a corporate leader in charge of the struggling economy as the
administration turns its attention toward the 2004 elections.</LD>
<LD>   Snow, a veteran of the Ford administration, brings to the
secretary's high-ceilinged corner office overlooking the White House
a resume that crosses an academic's economic knowledge with the
reality of a quarter of a century in the business world at CSX, a
transportation holding company that grew out of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio
railroad system.</LD>
<LD>   As early as today, Bush is expected to name a second key economic
aide by selecting Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of
investment firm Goldman Sachs to succeed Lawrence B. Lindsey as
chairman of the National Economic Council, a White House advisory
group.</LD>
<TE>   Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill were dismissed
Friday, submitting their resignations as the White House hurried to
spur economic growth before entering the early phases of Bush's
anticipated 2004 reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With the administration working to gain traction on political and
fiscal fronts, the selection of Snow brought a muted response.
Republicans praised it as an opportunity to advance Bush's economic
agenda; Democrats said the agenda itself needed change; the financial
community appeared disappointed that a more dramatic shift from
O'Neill, a former corporate executive who had also worked for
President Ford, had not been found.</TE>
<TE>   The central question is, will Snow be able to restore the
confidence of investors skittish about their future on Wall Street
and of workers wondering whether they will have jobs on Main Street?</TE>
<TE>   "John Snow will be a key advisor on the economy and a key advocate
for my administration's agenda for growth, new jobs and wider and
more international trade," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president said the economy was facing the challenge of
persistent unemployment -- the government reported Friday that
November's jobless rate was 6%, equaling an eight-year high -- while
personal debt was making it difficult for some to save for retirement
and "investor confidence needs to be strengthened in practical ways."</TE>
<TE>   Signaling his continued drive for new tax cuts, Bush noted that
"many Americans have very little money left over after taxes."</TE>
<TE>   He said he would propose "specific steps to increase the momentum
of our economic recovery, and the Treasury secretary will be at the
center of this effort."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Bush said, inflation is under control, mortgage
rates are at historic lows, and the 5.6% increase in productivity
over the last four quarters was the greatest over a similar period
since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   "This economy is strong, and we can make it stronger," the
president said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key roles of the Treasury secretary, that of chief
economic advisor to the president, has eroded over the last two
decades as advisory boards, councils and White House staff members
have all chimed in. The secretary is also the most prominent public
face of administration economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill began sailing through rough waters almost as soon as he
took office. Not only did he encounter a sudden recession, but his
penchant for frank commentary concerning the economy and the strength
of the dollar helped exaggerate Wall Street's inherent skittishness
and annoyed the president and the White House political staff alike.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, 63, stood two steps to Bush's right and two steps behind him
as the president announced his intentions. When it was his turn, Snow
spoke calmly, in a deep voice.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to combat unemployment by working "to strengthen the
current economic recovery and create an environment where millions of
job creators -- those small businesses and partnerships and
medium-size businesses and large businesses -- and investors, all
across America, will grow and prosper."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was low-key.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides had set aside about 30 seats for senior
administration officials in the auditorium of the Executive Office
Building, but half remained empty.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question John is a cheerleader and a quarterback and a
captain," said Paul W. MacAvoy, a professor at Yale University School
of Management.</TE>
<TE>   "He can pull a disparate team together and deal with Congress and
Wall Street and the government agencies and the whole budget
process," as well as taxes, interest rates and exchange rates, said
MacAvoy, who is well acquainted with the job's demands from his
service during the Ford administration on the Council of Economic
Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to get all that straight and sell it."</TE>
<TE>   The first issue for Snow, after winning Senate confirmation, is
gaining support in Congress, the financial community and the country
as a whole for Bush's next economic prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is said by Bush aides and others to be nearing
the unveiling of an economic stimulus package, built on much the same
tax-cut approach Bush has taken to try to rejuvenate the economy over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman and chief executive of Richmond, Va.-based CSX Corp.
since 1991, Snow -- who grew up in Toledo, Ohio, and received a
doctorate in economics from the University of Virginia -- directed
its absorption of Conrail, creating a massive cargo rail network
throughout the eastern U.S.</TE>
<TE>   A former economics and law professor who served as a deputy
undersecretary of Transportation in 1975 and 1976, he helped develop
policy that, the White House said Monday, led to the economic
deregulation of a wide swath of U.S. transportation, including the
rail, trucking and aviation industries. He also was administrator of
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   And as co-chairman of the commission on public trust and private
enterprise at the Conference Board, an influential business policy
group, he has wrestled with the stinging problems posed recently by
questions of integrity and the corporate boardroom.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign
contributions, said that Snow was one of the biggest supporters of
Sen. John McCain when the Arizona Republican sought the presidential
nomination in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, meanwhile, announced that Snow was resigning his
membership in the Georgia's Augusta National golf club, which
excludes women as members and is the home to the Masters golf
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, troubled by the year's corporate scandals, Snow's
efforts to tackle corporate integrity issues drew favor, and his
demeanor was cast as a welcome shift from O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack is steadfast in his commitment to sound business practices
and corporate governance reform," said Richard E. Grasso, chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he has spent some time in Washington working inside
the policy apparatus will serve him well as Treasury secretary," said
Kim Wallace, chief political analyst for Lehman Bros. "The fact that
he is more circumspect in his language, both public and private, will
serve the president better than the previous Treasury secretary."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, responses targeted policy and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the incoming majority leader, said he
looked forward to working with Snow on a "new jobs growth package
that will improve America's economic security."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking a policy aimed at boosting the economic standing of those
in the most need, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota said, "It isn't the names, but the plan that is of concern to
us. Trickle-down economics doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Snow got word of his selection Friday, shortly after O'Neill's
departure was announced.</TE>
<TE>   Snow was scheduled to speak Monday to MacAvoy's class of graduate
students at Yale, but called to cancel, telling his host he had a
fever.</TE>
<TE>   "Potomac fever?" was the retort from MacAvoy on the telephone.</TE>

<HD>A Smooth Operator in Nominee</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In John W. Snow, President Bush has found a smooth corporate fixer as
his new Treasury secretary -- in sharp contrast to the
market-rattling gadfly that the president's original choice, Paul H.
O'Neill, turned out to be.</LD>
<LD>   The 63-year-old chairman of railroad holding company CSX Corp.
wasted no time in showing off his smoothness Monday by virtually
parroting the president in endorsing a "pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda"
-- read "tax cuts" -- that O'Neill spent the last several months
disparaging.</LD>
<LD>   Bush found something else as well in Snow: membership in a
little-noticed fraternity that's hungry to prove once and for all
that it can lead and that has provided much of the current
administration's top talent -- the inner circle of the Ford White
House.</LD>
<TE>   Snow was, among other things, a deputy Transportation secretary in
the Ford administration. If confirmed, he will join such other Ford
alumni as Vice President Dick Cheney (the former president's chief of
staff), Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld (who held the same
position in the previous administration) and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan (Ford's chief economic advisor).</TE>
<TE>   "Our people didn't get the credit" they deserved, the former
president said in a telephone interview Monday. "The problem was we
did a hell of a job turning around the economy, and still I lost the
election to Jimmy Carter."</TE>
<TE>   Snow served in the Ford administration, as did O'Neill, who was
the former president's deputy budget director. The fact that Bush
drew from the same pool in picking O'Neill's successor, as he did in
choosing his just-dismissed Treasury secretary, suggested to many
Monday that the president has little interest in changing economic
directions or even methods, just in getting a better salesman.</TE>
<TE>   Besides their similar Washington lineage, both men ran big,
old-economy companies -- in O'Neill's case, aluminum giant Alcoa.
Both made their names wrestling their firms into the modern age. Both
were active in public affairs. Snow once headed the Business
Roundtable, the premier voice for corporate America. O'Neill was
active in civic affairs in his adopted hometown of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "Their backgrounds look an awful lot alike," said William
Niskanen, chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute here. Niskanen
said the similarity makes him worry that the president's only aim in
replacing O'Neill is to rid himself of the former's abrasiveness in
favor of "someone who can market whatever [Bush political advisor]
Karl Rove comes up with."</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, Snow is much more than a salesman. He has a law
degree from George Washington University and a doctorate in economics
from the University of Virginia. He was one of the earliest advocates
of railroad and airline deregulation. When many of the Ford
administration's railroad proposals died with the end of that
presidency, he pursued them as a railroad executive.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, he
helped devise compromises on such politically thorny issues as
airbags and auto fuel efficiency, according to his boss at the time,
Ford Transportation Secretary William T. Coleman Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very bright guy. He brought new ideas to you every day
and would pursue them," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was loyal; once we worked out a position, he would never go
back up on [Capitol] Hill and try to go beyond me," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the lessons from his first Washington stint that may serve
Snow especially well in the coming months are how to cope with
economic trouble and narrow political margins.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Snow's salesmanship -- his talent to bridge
differences -- could prove crucial. That talent was on vivid display
Monday in two instances.</TE>
<TE>   One of the deepest fissures in the Republican Party is between
supply-siders, who think that cutting taxes and regulations will cure
what ails the economy, and the deficit hawks, who fear that deficits
and the unfunded liabilities of programs like Social Security will
sink the country.</TE>
<TE>   In short order after the announcement that he had been tapped for
the top Treasury job, leading advocates of each camp claimed Snow as
one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is funding Social Security and Medicare. I think
John will see that," said Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the
Blackstone Group, a New York private investment bank and one of the
nation's persistent deficit hawks. Peterson said Snow joined him in
lobbying the Clinton administration to erase the federal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy who believes in growth," countered Ted Forstmann, a
senior partner with Forstmann Little &amp; Co., another New York
investment firm. "He'll be an articulate spokesman for a pro-growth
agenda no matter what Pete Peterson says."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, business leaders and Bush cited among Snow's strengths
his reputation as a leader in the fight for new corporate governance
standards to prevent another Enron scandal. But shareholder activists
say that Snow abused the very rules he endorses as CSX chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Snow earned $2.1 million in cash in 2001, plus $7.1 million in
restricted stock awards, almost $118,000 in premiums from
company-paid life insurance and more than $320,000 in "above market"
interest on deferred compensation.</TE>
<TE>   He signed a new employment contract last year that assures him of
a variety of benefits, including use of private aircraft, after he
retires or even resigns for a variety of reasons. Among the reasons:
"resignation ... so that the executive may fulfill an appointment to
public office."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, activists charged that CSX's board forgave a variety
of loans the company made to Snow at a time when several board
members may have been receiving favorable treatment from the company
in purchasing vacation homes at a CSX development in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy has a problem with compensation and loan forgiveness,"
said William B. Patterson, director of the AFL-CIO's office of
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's charges are unlikely to block Snow's confirmation as
Treasury secretary. But they could raise questions about his
corporate-governance bona fides.</TE>
<TE>   If he gets the Treasury post, he would have to give up the
business perks and would likely have to sell or put in blind trust
any significant investments while he is in office.</TE>

<DL>LA QUINTA, Calif</DL>
<LD>LA QUINTA, Calif. -- Ken Green was smiling Monday afternoon, and for
good reason.</LD>
<LD>   In the final round of the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament at PGA
West, he shot four-under-par 68, climbed 28 spots in the standings
into a tie for 26th, and earned back his playing privileges for the
first time since 1996. The top 35 earned tour privileges for next
season.</LD>
<LD>   Green, 44, a member of the 1989 Ryder Cup team and the winner of
five PGA Tour events from 1985-89, gradually fell into a deep
depression through the early and mid-'90s. He described the last
three years of his PGA Tour stint as "a state of hell" because of
mood swings and his inability to make shots.</LD>
<TE>   "I was full of fear," Green said. "I was like a little puppy with
its tail between its legs. I couldn't pull the trigger on any shots.
It was three years of total fear."</TE>
<TE>   Sleepless nights haunted Green from 1995-97. He went on eating
binges, then wouldn't eat at all. Sappy moments on television made
him cry. He finally sought therapy after a failed relationship in
1997. Doctors diagnosed depression, wrote a prescription, and Green
was a changed man.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a weird disease," Green said. "I just assumed I was having a
hard time battling life's problems, but the doctor told me I better
get on some medication or I was going to be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Green missed the cut in five 2001 PGA Tour events, made one in
four tries this year and played a limited schedule on the Buy.com
Tour. He was encouraged by his performance at Q-school, known for its
gut-wrenching pressure over six grueling rounds. "How I got through
this is amazing," Green said. "I'm proud of myself."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only interesting story of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a final-round one-over 73, Jeff Brehaut finished at
16-under and was the tournament medalist. Woody Austin made birdies
on his final three holes to make the cut by one stroke. Jason Caron
holed a 30-foot birdie putt on the last hole to sneak in by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Yancey, a 23-year-old from rural Virginia who has never
taken a golf lesson, finished at eight-under-par and paced the 18th
hole for nearly two hours before learning he made the cut. Yancey
learned to play in Blackstone, Va., on a beat-up nine-hole golf
course that used to be a cow pasture. He picked his Q-school caddie
in the course parking lot -- because he was wearing a Virginia Tech
hat.</TE>
<TE>   Fan favorite Casey Martin started the day in good position at
10-under, but made double bogeys at Nos. 13 and 14, shot 77, and
finished at five under. He will have a full exemption on the
Nationwide Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad day," Martin said. "This hurts, but it's not the end
of the world. I need to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who has a birth defect in his right leg and sued the PGA
Tour for the privilege of riding a cart, said he had pain in his leg,
but didn't make excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't feeling great, but that had nothing to do with how I
played," he said. "My leg was going downhill pretty quick about five
or six years ago, but now it's kind of leveled off."</TE>
<TE>   Other notables who will be on the Nationwide tour next year are
six-time PGA Tour winner Steve Pate, and Bob May, the runner-up to
Tiger Woods in the 2000 PGA Championship. Scott Simpson, the 1987
U.S. Open champion, was even lower on the list and will have
conditional status on the Nationwide Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest swings of the day were by Carl Pettersson and Barry
Cheesman. Pettersson began the day tied for 64th, shot 66 in the
final round, and earned a PGA Tour exemption. Cheesman was tied for
11th at the start of the day, shot a final-round 82, and fell to the
Nationwide Tour.</TE>

<HD>Odds Are Against Kent, Floyd Donning Dodger Blue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some words of caution for Dodger fans expecting the team to sign
free-agent sluggers Jeff Kent or Cliff Floyd to fill the void created
by last week's trade of first baseman Eric Karros to the Chicago
Cubs: Don't get your hopes up.</LD>
<LD>   According to a baseball source, the Dodgers have all but ruled out
Kent, the San Francisco second baseman who would be willing to play
first base and is looking for a lucrative multiyear deal, and unless
the Dodgers make another move to free up more payroll, Floyd, the
Boston outfielder who can also play first base, is probably out of
their financial reach.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that both players were offered arbitration by their
respective teams, forcing the Dodgers to forfeit a first-round draft
pick if they signed one of them, is another deterrent.</LD>
<TE>   "Realistically, it's not likely that one of those two guys will
sign with us, but I won't rule it out completely," Dodger General
Manager Dan Evans said. "It's still too early in the off-season to
figure out who is available and what our options are."</TE>
<TE>   Those options increased when right fielder Shawn Green told Evans
he would be willing to move to first base -- Evans can now explore
outfielders in the free-agent and trade markets.</TE>
<TE>   But a shift from outfield to first would be radical for Green, and
the Dodgers won't make such a move without lengthy deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   A glance down the freeway reveals the potential hazards. Darin
Erstad moved from the outfield to first base after the Angels traded
J.T. Snow to the Giants before the 1997 season, and while Erstad
quickly developed into an above-average defender, it came at a steep
price.</TE>
<TE>   Having to crouch with his glove near the dirt for every pitch took
a toll on Erstad's lower back and hamstrings, and he developed a sore
shoulder after changing his mechanics to make the across-the-body
double-play throw to second.</TE>
<TE>   Asking the team's best hitter to learn a demanding position could
also affect Green offensively, so Evans' preference as he prepares
for this weekend's winter meetings in Nashville is to add a first
baseman.</TE>
<TE>   The trade of Karros and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek to the
Cubs for backup catcher Todd Hundley gave the Dodgers some payroll
flexibility, freeing about $4 million for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Dodger projections still leave them so close to the
$117-million payroll threshold for the new luxury tax, they have
budgeted only $5 million to spend on a bat and a left-handed
reliever.</TE>
<TE>   That will make it almost impossible for the Dodgers to sign Kent
or Floyd, who are expected to command deals of about $7 million a
year or higher.</TE>
<TE>   There was some speculation the Dodgers could add Kent or Floyd
with some creative financing, signing either to a contract that would
start with a low base salary, say $4 million in 2003, and jump
drastically in 2004 and 2005, when the Dodgers would have more
payroll flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   But luxury tax figures are based on the average annual value of
contracts, not base salaries in any given year, so if the Dodgers
wanted to sign Kent or Floyd to a three-year, $24-million deal that
paid only $4 million the first year, they would still be charged $8
million toward the luxury tax threshold in 2003.</TE>
