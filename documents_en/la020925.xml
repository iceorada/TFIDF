<DH>Honda's Element targets youths with extra cargo room and
funky looks</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Honda's new entry in the light-truck category is one of the freshest
faces to hit the road in years. It also is the first Honda in a long
time that needs an instruction manual--not for the driver, who
probably will love the little Element, but for passersby who will
wonder what it is and why it is needed.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, this is a truck whose design muse was a refrigerator
box. It is part of a new school of anti-style, looking cool because
it doesn't (and succeeding where the unfortunate Pontiac Aztek
failed).</LD>
<LD>   Like a chocolate box, its plain, rectangular package hides lots of
goodies inside. People who buy Elements will know this. Otherwise,
they wouldn't be looking. Although, with prices expected to begin
just north of $16,000 and top out at about $21,000, this trucklet
might make the grade on price alone.</LD>
<TE>   Honda's challenge, if the denizens of the Santa Cruz area in
Northern California are any gauge, will be getting people to look.
The company previewed the Element, due in dealer showrooms in
mid-December, in the hills in and around that laid-back coastal
university town earlier this summer. But in a place where tie-dyed
T-shirts and rusty old VW vans abound, it was hard to get a glance.</TE>
<TE>   When my driving partner and I did attract attention, down by the
Santa Cruz pier, the most frequently asked question--Honda planners,
take note--was "Is it one of those hybrids"?</TE>
<TE>   To see if the Element actually is attractive to the audience Honda
says it was built for, we took an unauthorized detour from the
approved press route and zigged up into the UC Santa Cruz campus.</TE>
<TE>   Honda, after all, says the Element was born of research conducted
in college fraternity houses and at the X-Games. It is aimed at
20-ish males looking for a way to haul their surfboards and mountain
bikes.</TE>
<TE>   So what better place to test its draw than a university campus
perched on a redwood-covered mountain laced with bike trails and
overlooking a Pacific coastline noted for its surfing spots.</TE>
<TE>   Around we drove, passing near-empty dorm complexes (it was summer,
after all) and a dozen or so bus stops, most with a student or two
patiently awaiting a bus and ignoring our silver-and-black Element.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the end of the loop that a bright-eyed cellular
biology student named Stanley Ma, who had just waltzed out of the
last test in the last class of his undergraduate career, saw it. His
face lighted up with a grin, his thumb went up and, as we coasted up,
he hollered: "Hey, cool wheels. Can I have a ride home?"</TE>
<TE>   Ma, it turns out, is an avid surfer and said he spotted the
possibilities of a truck that looks like the Element looks.</TE>
<TE>   He was even more impressed once inside. "Really tight," he kept
muttering on the short trip to his rented cottage in the quietly
aging residential neighborhood just below the campus. "Tight," for
those who don't know, is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   The Element, after all, has a pretty interesting interior with,
among other things, waterproof seat coverings, an instrument panel in
blue, silver or green to match the interior colors, trays for cell
phones, PDAs and MP3 players (the top-of-the-line model even has a
special MP3 jack in the dashboard), five cup holders, two bottle
holders and more interior cargo space with everything inside rolled
up and stashed away--and pretty much everything inside does roll up
and stash away--than anything else in its class.</TE>
<TE>   The double doors on each side open barn-door-like from the center,
and there is no fixed B pillar to divide the resulting gaping
opening. (The B pillar is cleverly designed to be part of the leading
edge of the rear door. It locks into the upper and lower frame
sections to provide strength and an energy-absorbing safety element
when the door is closed, but isn't there when the door opens.)</TE>
<TE>   As a result, if you had a ramp you could literally ride your
mountain bike, or your motorcycle, up into the Element's yawning
interior once the front seats are pushed forward and the rear seats
are either removed or folded up flat against the side walls. You also
can cram a couple of 8-foot surfboards inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Element's floor is flat and covered in washable plastic, the
rear hatch is the clamshell type that provides maximum access, and a
sunroof over the rear cargo area will pop up, or out altogether, to
permit even longer or taller items to be stuffed inside.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Evert, principal engineer on the Element team, said one use
of the removable sunroof "is so that you can stand up inside [with
your head poking out] and change into your swimsuit" without exposing
your elements to the elements and whatever prying eyes are around.</TE>
<TE>   The Element's easy-wipe interior also seems ideal for rolling
parties. And for those who frequently use their cars for
overnighters, the seats fold down and line up to make a pair of
rather lumpy beds.</TE>
<TE>   On the technical side, the Element is based on the Honda CR-V
platform but is tweaked very nicely to provide ride and handling
superior to the little SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly for such a tall (74 inches) truck, the Element has
little roll or sway on corners, thanks to a lowered rear suspension,
stiffer springs and dampers, bigger sway bars and bigger, 16-inch
wheels with 215/70R rubber. It also stops nicely, thanks to 11.1-inch
disc brakes, vented in front and solid in the rear, augmented by an
anti-lock braking system.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the stopping power and suspension finesse come in a
vehicle with little in the way of oomph. The Element's 2.4-liter,
twin-cam four-cylinder engine cranks out 160 horsepower and 161
pounds-feet of torque, sufficient to get it up the freeway onramp and
into the flow of traffic, but far from providing performance anywhere
close to thrilling.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is a Honda, albeit a truck, the Element is expected to
boast fuel economy of 21 miles per gallon around town, 23 mpg on the
highway. And Honda engine engineer Gil Castillo says it will meet
California's Low Emissions Vehicle II standards, which don't take
effect until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In basic dress, the Element comes with a five-speed manual
transmission and front-wheel drive. But an all-wheel-drive version is
available, as is a four-speed automatic borrowed straight from the
CR-V. All-wheel drive with manual transmission won't be out until
next spring, however.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: Honda designed this for the youth set, but its
versatility, fuel economy and low pricing are just as likely to
attract older buyers who can get over its unusual looks. It won't
attract those who need to tow trailers or lord it over everyone else
on the road--they'll be looking at the local Hummer dealer--but it is
an intriguing, fun-to-drive alternative to the ubiquitous small SUV.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing its tradition of featuring an exclusive car in its
Christmas catalog, upscale retailer Neiman Marcus will sell 99
editions of the 2004 Cadillac XLR luxury roadster in the '02 catalog,
which is being mailed this month.</LD>
<LD>   The Cadillac XLR will come in ultraviolet, a color available only

steering wheel and dashboard gauges designed by Bulgari. It will sell
for $85,000.</LD>
<LD>   Two additional Cadillac XLRs will be auctioned off on behalf of
charitable groups.</LD>
<TE>   "Our tradition is to include a sophisticated, stylish, must-have
car each year, and we expect it will be a very popular offering this
holiday season," says Karen Katz, chief executive of Neiman Marcus
Direct.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several years, the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book has
featured a customized version of a high-profile car, including the
Lexus SC430 roadster, Ford Thunderbird, Audi TT, BMW X5 sport utility
vehicle and BMW Z3 "James Bond Edition" roadster.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers strive to have one of their vehicles chosen for the
catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want a Cadillac XLR must call (866) 957-2004 starting at
9 a.m. PDT Oct. 15. Callers will be directed to a Cadillac dealership
to submit a $7,500 deposit.</TE>
<TE>   The two-seater, rear-wheel-drive XLR goes into production next
spring at General Motors' assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., and
will have a high-output 4.6-liter V8 Northstar engine with a
five-speed automatic transmission.</TE>

<HD>Cadillacs, Kias Called Back for Possible Safety-Belt
Problems</HD>
<DH>Restraints might be faulty in some DeVilles, Sephias and
Sportages. NHTSA also lists other recalls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadillac has begun the recall of 269,000 of its 2000 to 2002 DeVille
sedans because of a potential safety-belt problem.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp.'s luxury unit said the front lap and
shoulder-belt retractors in DeVilles built from May 1999 to May 2002
might not remain locked in certain crash situations.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported the problem to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration earlier this month and said it had not yet
determined the proper remedy and did not expect to begin notifying
affected customers of the recall until December.</LD>
<TE>   In a second major seat-belt recall this month, Kia Motors Corp.
said it is pulling in about 200,000 Sephia sedans and Sportage sport
utility vehicles from the 1995 through 1998 model years to fix belts
that may not latch properly.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said it has received 32 complaints, including five reports
of injuries, related to the problem. The seat-belt buckle might not
be latched when the driver or passenger thinks it has been closed,
the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   "We recalled all of the vehicles just to be sure that the seat
belts were addressed," Kia spokesman Kim Custer said. The South
Korean auto maker hasn't yet decided how it will fix the belts and
doesn't expect to find many defects, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, NHTSA has issued its monthly "reminder" list of
significant recalls. The list covers recalls initially announced a
month or so earlier and is intended to alert vehicle owners who might
have missed the original alert or who have not yet been notified by
the manufacturer about their vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Those recalls are:</TE>
<TE>   BMW</TE>
<TE>   34,869 X5 SUVs from the 2000 and 2001 model years, built from
August 1999 to February 2001, to repair a possibly faulty brake pedal
pivot shaft that can separate from its support bracket, causing the
braking system to become inoperable. Owner notification began last
month.</TE>
<TE>   3,531 Mini Cooper coupes, 2002 models built from September 2001 to
May 2002 and equipped with manual transmissions. The transmission
shift cable can detach from the transmission linkage, locking the car
into the last gear selected. Owner notification began last month.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler</TE>
<TE>   88,000 Chrysler Sebring convertibles from the 1996 and 1997 model
years, to inspect and repair frayed throttle cables on models with
2.5-liter V-6 engines.</TE>
<TE>   The frayed cable can cause the throttle to bind or stick,
resulting in loss of throttle control and increasing the risk of a
crash.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler said it began notifying owners last month.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   525,000 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe SUVS and Silverado pickups
and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs and Sierra pickups, 2000 models built
from February 1999 to February 2000, to repair a potentially faulty
air bag system that could keep the front-seat air bags from deploying
in a crash.</TE>
<TE>   Owner notification began last month.</TE>
<TE>   80,000 Chevrolet Trailblazer and other 2002-model sport utilities
recalled to fix fuel-filter assemblies that could become
disconnected. The problem can cause a spill or result in the engine
stopping for lack of gasoline, NHSTA said.</TE>
<TE>   Owner notification is scheduled to begin this month.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   17,551 of its 2003-model Honda and Acura vehicles recalled to
inspect and repair an improperly machined water-pump pulley that can
cause the timing belt to rub against the engine, fray and possibly
fail.</TE>
<TE>   The recall includes Honda Accord sedans, Odyssey minivans and
Pilot sport utilities, as well as Acura CL coupes, TL sedans and MDX
sport utilities, Acura spokesman Mike Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   Honda began notifying owners this month.</TE>
<TE>   Kia Motors</TE>
<TE>   25,000 Sephia sedans, 1998 models built from September 1997 to
April 1998, because of a potentially faulty electrical contact that
can result in inoperative hazard or turn signal lights. Owner
notification began last month.</TE>
<TE>   Rolls-Royce Motors</TE>
<TE>   2,025 various Rolls and Bentley models from the 1999-2002 model
years, to fix a potentially faulty low pressure brake fluid feed pipe
that can trap air, causing excessive brake pedal travel and reducing
the effectiveness of the primary braking circuit. Owner notification
began last month.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   154,593 Toyota Highlander SUVs from the 2001 and 2002 model years,
built from November 2000 to May 2002, to correct an improperly
installed vapor recovery valve hose clamp that could cause a fuel
leakage in certain frontal crash conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Owner notification is to begin this month.</TE>

<HD>Chevy Joins Crossover Pack With Equinox; New Beetle Goes
Topless</HD>
<DH>GM's sport utility is expected in 2004. VW's convertibles
will begin selling this year.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the truck market continues to increase, so do General Motors
Corp.'s offerings in the high-profit segment. GM says it will
introduce the Chevrolet Equinox, an all-new compact sport utility
vehicle, in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The Equinox will be Chevy's first "crossover," combining features
of a passenger car and an SUV, and will be built in Canada and share
its platform with the Saturn VUE sport utility.</LD>
<LD>   "The compact SUV market is the fastest-growing segment in the
industry, thanks to products that have set new standards for the
class," said Marketing Director Margaret Brooks. "We intend to
further raise the bar."</LD>
<TE>   Chevrolet is coming a bit late to the segment, following two
generations of the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester
crossovers. It also follows the upcoming Nissan Murano, Chrysler
Pacifica and Ford CrossTrainer SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Entry-level and luxury crossovers are seen as hot segments in the
auto industry in coming years, and car makers want to grab as much
market share as they can.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox will be built at CAMI, a joint venture between GM and
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp.</TE>

<TE>   Convertible New Beetle</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long time coming, but Volkswagen finally is
releasing a convertible version of the New Beetle it introduced as a
hardtop for the 1998 model year.</TE>
<TE>   First pictures of the factory-produced ragtop Bug were released
this month.</TE>
<TE>   The topless Beetle will hit showrooms this year, initially as a
GLS model with a 2.0-liter gas engine rated at 115 horsepower. Next
year, an entry-level version, the GL, will come to market.</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled for the U.S. next year: GLS and top-of-the-line GLX
models with turbocharged 1.8-liter engines rated at 150 horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen of America says pricing hasn't been set yet.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker is building the convertible alongside hardtop
models at its Puebla, Mexico, plant.</TE>

<HD>Salvage Industry Reforms Enacted</HD>
<DH>Gov. Davis signs two measures that require new types of
vehicle inspections and disclosure of wrecks' histories.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Significant reforms of California's loosely regulated salvage
automobile industry, which was scored in a series of state
investigations and Senate hearings in recent years, were enacted last
week in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The reforms, touted by consumer advocates as trend-setting
advances in auto safety, are contained in two bills passed by the
Legislature and signed by Gov. Gray Davis. The bills (SB 1331 and SB
2076) establish safety rules for the estimated 145,000 wrecked
vehicles that are recycled back onto state highways each year and
place new regulations on the salvage automobile business.</LD>
<LD>   The laws "will save lives and protect unsuspecting consumers from
buying cars built with stolen parts," said Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough), sponsor of one of the measures.</LD>
<TE>   In a Senate Insurance Committee hearing in January, state
regulators cited mounting evidence that consumers are buying repaired
vehicles, previously declared total losses by insurers, that do not
carry required titles branding them as salvage.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 2.4 million
salvage vehicles--about 8% of all registered vehicles in the
state--are being operated in California. Investigations have shown a
pattern of these vehicles being improperly repaired, sometimes with
stolen parts, and recycled from salvage auction pools to used-car
lots.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony by the California Highway Patrol at the January hearing
also shed light on the problem of missing air bags in salvage
vehicles, which are as likely to be late-model luxury cars as old
junkers. The CHP had found air bags missing from salvage vehicles
involved in major injury accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates hoped the Legislature would clamp tough new
restrictions on the salvage industry, including safety inspections of
major vehicle systems, and require licensing of salvage repair
facilities, auction lots and other links in the industry's chain. The
measures stop short of fulfilling all those expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't solve the problem," said Rosemary Shahan, president of
Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. "But it is a good step."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Bill 1331, introduced by Speier, requires that salvage
vehicles be inspected by the CHP to ensure that they are equipped
with proper air bags and that their vehicle identification numbers
are valid.</TE>
<TE>   "Air bags are the most important part of the bill," said Richard
Steffen, staff director of the Senate Insurance Committee. "It
requires the salvage rebuilder to get an inspection."</TE>
<TE>   Air bags are among the most expensive equipment to replace on a
damaged vehicle. Because they typically deploy in major collisions,
most salvage vehicles require air-bag replacements, which cost an
average of $1,800 each.</TE>
<TE>   The new vehicle identification number inspections also will make
it more difficult for rebuilders to weld together sections of a
legitimate salvage vehicle and a stolen vehicle, using the legitimate
vehicle's VIN to make the resulting car or truck marketable.</TE>
<TE>   The bill recognizes the existence of salvage rebuilders, but
leaves the industry largely unregulated. Because salvage rebuilders
do not repair vehicles directly for consumers, they have been exempt
from licensing rules of the Bureau of Automotive Repair.</TE>
<TE>   SB 2076, by Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), closes existing
salvage title loopholes that exempt leasing companies, self-insurers
and financial institutions, among others, from some of the disclosure
requirements for salvage vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   State investigations have found cases in which leasing and rental
companies have recycled their wrecks into the salvage system without
salvage titles or making other disclosures to the end buyers.</TE>
<TE>   It would eliminate those exceptions, helping to avoid the finger
pointing that often occurs when disputes arise over disclosure
lapses, Shahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Steffen said he believes that the new requirements are "consistent
with what the governor wants."</TE>
<TE>   A third consumer measure, SB 1743, also by Speier, was vetoed by
Davis. It would have required the DMV to set up a publicly available
database of all salvage vehicles to let consumers check whether cars
they are considering buying have ever been totaled.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would have required salvage auction companies to
obtain a state license, a first step in regulating the system that
takes wrecked vehicles from insurers and recycles them onto the
highways.</TE>
<TE>   In vetoing the measure, Davis said the state could not afford the
database or the proposed licensing system, which would cost an
estimated $450,000.</TE>

<LD>Most salad dressings contain a substantial amount of oil or
mayonnaise that will send calories soaring. But the cranberry
vinaigrette in this salad uses only a small amount of olive oil for
flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Cranberry juice, dried cranberries and fresh rosemary give the
dressing a boost. Combined with rice vinegar, they make for a nice
mellow dressing that goes well with the apple and pear slices.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinkle a few toasted walnuts over the top to finish the salad,
which is perfect for early fall meals.</LD>

<LD>Portabello mushroom, goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes--a pizza
topping, right? But this combination works surprisingly well tucked
inside an omelet.</LD>
<LD>   The mild tang of the cheese marries nicely with the heartiness of
the mushroom and the bite of the tomatoes. You'll also find that this
is a colorful filling for the eggs.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to use a nonstick pan for the omelets, and heat the pan
first, then add the oil.</LD>
<TE>   Keep things simple with the omelets by serving mixed greens tossed
with your favorite dressing, and sliced focaccia. The bread would be
delicious dipped in olive oil seasoned with freshly cracked pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Portabello Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 large portabello mushroom, diced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup thinly sliced basil leaves, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon pepper, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons milk</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce goat cheese</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the
shallot and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 1 minute. Add the
mushroom and cook until soft, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes.
Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, half the basil and half of the salt
and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet or an omelet pan over high heat.
Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, milk and remaining salt and pepper
together in a large bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Add 1 teaspoon of the oil to the pan and swirl it around so the
pan is evenly coated. Pour half the eggs into the pan. Use a
heat-resistant rubber spatula to lift the edges of the cooked egg
toward the center of the pan so that the liquid portion will run
underneath and set better. When the eggs begin to set and the bottom
is lightly browned, about 1 minute, carefully flip the omelet over in
the pan. Spread half the mushroom filling onto half of the omelet and
sprinkle half the goat cheese on top. (The omelet should take about 2
1/2 minutes to cook.) Fold the omelet and turn it out onto a warm
serving plate. Sprinkle the omelet with half of the remaining basil
for garnish. Keep warm. Repeat to make one more omelet.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not for an ordinary recipe would I get up at 4:30 on a Sunday morning
to peel potatoes and cut up chicken. The dish that inspired me was
Chicken Hamin in "Sephardic Israeli Cuisine: a Mediterranean Mosaic"
by Sheilah Kaufman (Hippocrene Books, $24.95). Hamin, the Sephardic
equivalent of cholent, is a dish that cooks for many hours at low
heat, enabling Jews to avoid cooking on the Sabbath and yet have a
hearty dinner.</LD>
<LD>   I had tasted hamin before and it was pretty dull, but Kaufman's
recipe includes dates, cilantro and caramelized sugar as well as the
usual chicken, vegetables and lentils. This was intriguing. It needs
to cook for 12 hours, though, so it had to go in the oven early to be
ready for dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the details were fuzzy, as is true of other recipes in
this interesting but rather unpolished little book. How should the
carrots be cut? Shouldn't the dates be pitted to prevent cracked
teeth? And wouldn't it be a good idea to skin the chicken to cut down
on fat? Olive oil goes in the casserole first, but nothing is
sauteed. This seems odd, considering that the cooking starts on top
of the stove.</LD>
<TE>   And what size pan? I used the biggest I had, an old Descoware
Dutch oven that holds about 6 quarts. By the time I added 6 cups of
water to a pot jammed with ingredients, it was so full I didn't dare
bring it to a boil as directed, only to a gentle simmer. The recipe
ought to specify an 8-quart container.</TE>
<TE>   Getting something so heavy in the oven was difficult too,
especially when one is barely awake. But I managed and went back to
bed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Chicken Hamin was cooking away. As it boiled, hot
liquid bubbled onto the oven floor, even though the pan was covered.
The spill turned into steam, which seeped through the sides of the
oven door and condensed into brown rivulets on the white enamel. But
the aroma that filled the house was marvelous, as if a pot of Boston
baked beans were in the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve hours later, it was done. I lifted the lid and gasped.
Inside was a mash as black as charcoal. A disaster--and guests were
waiting to eat! I dreaded even a little taste, but I had to know what
had gone wrong. Gingerly, I took a little of the blackened meat off
the top, expecting the worst: a burned, inedible, unsalvageable
cinder of a meal.</TE>
<TE>   But I was stunned again. The Chicken Hamin was actually juicy,
aromatic and delicious--the dark color came from caramelization, not
from burning. The flavor was as sublime as the appearance was awful.
It was slightly fruity and subtly sweet from the dates and rich from
the vegetables. The chicken was perfectly tender. It was a wonderful
tapestry of flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner that night was very good. The accompaniments were two other
recipes from the book: zucchini with sauce, a boring name for nice,
cold marinated zucchini with dill, and tomato spread, which is a
Middle Eastern-Mediterranean tomato and green pepper stew also known
as shakshouka.</TE>
<TE>   The zucchini method also needed refinement. Two pounds of sliced
squash was too much to cook in a medium pot, and the slices on the
bottom became overdone, while those on top were just right.</TE>
<TE>   The spread was right on, full-flavored and mellow. And versatile
too. I have used it as a hot side dish, a dip for tortilla chips and
a pasta sauce.</TE>
<TE>   But the hit of the night was Chicken Hamin. It was worth the
struggle and spills, and this winter, I'm sure, I'll be setting my
alarm clock again.</TE>
<TE>   This recipe has been slightly modified from the original in
"Sephardic Israeli Cuisine."</TE>
<TE>   Chicken Hamin</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 13

<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 large onions, sliced</TE>
<TE>   10 small boiling potatoes, peeled</TE>
<TE>   3 carrots, cut up if large</TE>
<TE>   1 cup lentils</TE>
<TE>   1 chicken, (about 4 pounds) cut into serving pieces, skinned if
desired</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 dates, pitted</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   About 6 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 225 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the oil in an 8-quart pot. Add the onions, potatoes,
carrots, lentils, chicken, cilantro, dates, and salt and pepper to
taste.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the sugar in a small skillet over medium heat until melted
and dark brown but not burned. Add to the pot. Add enough water to
cover the ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the pot and place in the oven. Bake 6 hours, then test for
seasonings and add more salt and pepper if desired. Bake, covered, 6
hours longer.</TE>

<LD>Cabbage is one of my favorite vegetables, especially this time of
year. Its versatility is amazing.</LD>
<LD>   Use it raw in salads and slaws or cooked in soups, casseroles,
pastas and sandwiches. And don't forget about sauerkraut, made from
fermented cabbage.</LD>
<LD>   Cabbage, along with broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, is
a cruciferous vegetable. Cabbage is a good source of vitamins,
especially C and A. And it is low in calories. Typically you'll find
three kinds in supermarkets--green, red and savoy.</LD>
<TE>   That being said, consider the following recipes using cabbage. The
pappardelle with cabbage in cream sauce may sound humble and
peasant-like, but it's one of those great surprise dishes.</TE>
<TE>   It's mouthwatering and makes a lovely, fresh presentation. Cooking
the cabbage in tandem with the pappardelle is easy--just add the
cabbage a few minutes after the pasta--and also sweetens up the
cabbage flavor. Serve this pasta as a main dish, first course or side
dish.</TE>
<TE>   This sandwich comes from Ina's Restaurant on Randolph Street in
Chicago. It's certainly a match for the famous Reuben but instead
features sauteed red cabbage for the sauerkraut, apples for the
corned beef and includes the traditional Swiss cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Fall coleslaw with apples and bacon proves that coleslaw is a
recipe that has infinite variations. Here, the apples and bacon make
it a good pairing with roasted pork, lamb, poultry or game.</TE>
<TE>   Pappardelle are long, flat, wide Italian noodles. The same weight
of fettuccine can be substituted, also traditional egg noodles.</TE>
<TE>   Pappardelle With Sweet Cabbage in Sage Cream Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup minced shallots</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh sage</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound dry pappardelle</TE>
<TE>   1/2 head small green cabbage, about</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 pounds, cored, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, preferably
Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving</TE>
<TE>   Sage sprigs, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. When
hot, add the shallots and garlic. Cook until warmed through, about 2
minutes. Add the cream, sage, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the pepper and
nutmeg. Stir well; simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about
3 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Bring a 4-quart pot of salted water to boil. Add the pappardelle.
With about 6 minutes to go, add the cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente, about 7 to 10
minutes total. Drain well; transfer to a large, shallow serving bowl.
Toss with the cream sauce and 1/3 cup of cheese. Serve hot, garnished
with sage sprigs. Pass grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese separately.</TE>

<TE>   Ina's Grilled Gruyere, Red Cabbage and Apple Sandwich</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter, divided, plus more for griddle</TE>
<TE>   1 red onion, thinly-sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 small head red cabbage, about 3/4 pound, quartered, cored,
thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, halved, cored, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Dijon mustard, to taste</TE>
<TE>   8 slices each hearty rye bread</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 ounces Gruyere cheese slices</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. When the butter is sizzling, add the onion and
cook, stirring often, until softened but not brown, about 4 minutes.
Add the cabbage and vinegar. Cook gently, covered, until the cabbage
is tender but still textured, about 12 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of
sugar, the caraway seeds, salt and pepper to taste. Cook gently 5
minutes longer, stirring often to prevent burning.</TE>
<TE>   Toss the apple slices with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar
in a large bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in an 8-inch nonstick
skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter starts to brown, add
the apple. Cook until golden and tender but still intact, about 6 to
8 minutes, stirring often.</TE>
<TE>   To assemble, generously spread Dijon mustard on 4 bread slices.
Cover the mustard with the warm apple. Cover the apples with a cheese
slice. Divide the warm cabbage equally among the remaining 4 slices
of bread. Place a cheese slice on the cabbage. Leave the sandwiches
open-faced for cooking; then close after cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 250 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the griddle over medium heat and lightly butter. Place 2
open-faced sandwiches on the griddle. Cook, tented with foil, until
the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Close the sandwich, pressing
it lightly together. Turn it over and place on a baking sheet. Keep
warm in the oven while cooking the remaining sandwiches. Serve warm.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One night about a year ago, Katie Williams walked down the steps of a
dark and dingy nightclub in Highland Park to hear a band. But she
couldn't keep her eyes off the dusty old snack bar languishing in the
corner, a grim curve of counter with an even grimmer-looking kitchen,
all closed up tighter than a drum.</LD>
<LD>   All that potential, wasting away.</LD>
<LD>   She went home and told her twin sister, Lecie, about her latest
restaurant fantasy. "Katie is always seeing restaurant possibilities,
everywhere she goes," says Lecie. "But she was pretty persistent
about this one."</LD>
<TE>   The persistent sisters quickly opened the Gutter, a funky little
restaurant in the corner of Mr. T's Bowl in Highland Park. They had a
definite idea about the food they wanted to serve--the sorts of
things they loved to eat back home.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a long tradition of good bar food in Wisconsin, tavern
food," Katie says. "People don't just go into a bar to drink, they
enjoy eating too. Most bars have a really good sandwich that they're
known for, or a hearty soup. And that's what we wanted to serve."</TE>
<TE>   And they do, nearly one order at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters--the Gutter girls, as the regulars call them--have a
devoted following, a motley group that includes a foodie or two,
never mind that everything is served on paper with plastic utensils,
and to be honest, they didn't spiff the place up all that much, at
least not to the naked eye.</TE>
<TE>   Six colorful lanterns now shed light over the restaurant's low
counter, beckoning patrons to the eight stools and three mismatched
booths. Behind the counter is a clean little kitchen with a grill, an
oven with no temperature gauge, six gas burners and a deep fryer.
There's a large refrigerator, a freezer and a sink. In this small
space the sisters have choreographed a patient dance of baking pies,
biscuits and bread pudding; grilling sandwiches and ladling soup,
and, on the weekends, making pancakes and egg concoctions.</TE>
<TE>   "One of us has to be what we call the Mastermind," said Katie, 31.
"It's a weird, insular world back here, and the Mastermind keeps
track of the timing of the orders and makes sure everyone gets their
food at the same time and that it's hot. The other one preps, makes
toast, assembles sandwiches and fills the dessert orders."</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s and '80s, while the Williams sisters were growing up
in Wisconsin and learning to cook from their mother and bake from
their grandmother, Mr. T's Bowl was a popular drinking spot for some
of the longtime residents. In the '90s, the twins were off to UC
Berkeley. Eventually they ran a theater in San Francisco. Back in
Highland Park, the bowling alley's wooden lanes were being replaced
with a stage, a dance floor and a soundboard. All the while, the
snack bar was opening, closing and reopening, attempting to serve
American or Mexican fast food to a clientele with more charm than
money, most of their money going to the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays the food at the Gutter is anything but fast. There's no
microwave oven, no blender, no prep cook. The Williams' favorite
appliance is a food mill. "We like the flavor that comes out when we
mill ingredients for soups or our homemade ketchup," Katie says.
"It's a Zen-like experience, milling big batches of ketchup."</TE>
<TE>   The sandwiches are twisted variations of old standards. The tuna
melt is made with roasted pasilla chiles and pepper Jack cheese. The
cold meatloaf sandwich on white bread is served with the standard
mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato, but homemade ketchup adds a little
kick. The fries are studded with garlic. Artichoke hearts add flavor
and texture to the tangy potato salad. The soups are hearty. Lecie
usually bakes a pie, and there's bread pudding served with rhubarb
sauce or fried bananas.</TE>
<TE>   At breakfast, the pancakes are fluffy (barely stir the batter,
Katie advises). The hash browns are made from fresh grated potatoes
and the orange juice is freshly squeezed. The popular Breakfast Bowl
is hash browns topped with scrambled eggs, turkey chili and Cheddar
cheese. And for vegetarians there's the Hippie Bowl, tofu scrambled
in fresh ginger peanut sauce.</TE>
<TE>   When the Gutter opened in August 2001, the first months were
tough. There were loud punk bands most nights of the week, a surreal
karaoke night on Thursdays. The sisters were getting lots of advice
from the folks at the bar. There were some opinions about what should
be served: hot dogs, popcorn, chips and candy bars. "Price everything
the same price as a drink," was a popular suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   But they stuck to their menu, cooking good home-style food and
shopping daily for fresh ingredients. They managed to coexist with
the bar scene and the bands. And the word has spread about the good
food. The weekend gets busy and everybody waits. Most people are
patient, but a few aren't.</TE>
<TE>   Trixy, the waitress (and there is never more than one), explains
for the fourth time that, yes, they could add more tables down by the
stage. "But the kitchen is so small that the orders would back up
even more and people would have to wait longer," she says. "That
would take all the fun out of this job."</TE>
<TE>   The Gutter is in Mr.T's Bowl, 5621 1/2 N. Figueroa Ave., Los
Angeles (Highland Park). (323) 256-4850.</TE>

<TE>   Allie's Cherry Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour,
plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   This is from Katie and Lecie Williams' grandmother, Allie
Katherine Hibbard. The crust is adapted from "The Joy of Cooking."</TE>
<TE>   FLOUR PASTE PIE CRUST</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sifted flour</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup shortening</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   Sift together the flour and salt. Remove 1/3 cup of the mixture
and mix with 1/4 cup water into a paste.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the shortening and butter into the flour mixture. Incorporate
the paste quickly into the flour and form into 2 balls; the second
ball should be about 3/4 the size of the bigger ball. Flatten into
disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   CHERRY FILLING</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 (14.5-ounce) cans pitted red tart cherries packed in water,
drained, with juice reserved</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon lemon zest</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon rum</TE>
<TE>   Mix together the sugar, cornstarch and salt; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Bring the cherry juice to a boil in a saucepan. Add the sugar
mixture and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the
heat and stir in the cherries, butter, lemon juice, lemon zest and
rum. Let cool to warm, 10 minutes, before filling crust.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Flour, for rolling</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out the larger dough disk on a lightly floured surface into a
circle large enough to fit into a 9-inch pie plate with a 1-inch
edge. Place the circle in the pie plate, then fill with the Cherry
Filling. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch rectangle. Cut
the dough into lengthwise 1-inch strips. Arrange the strips on top of
the pie in a lattice pattern. Roll and crimp the edges of the crust.</TE>
<TE>   Set the pie in the center of the oven, placing a sheet of foil
beneath it to catch any drips. Bake until the crust is golden and the
filling is bubbling in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. If the edges of
the crust become too dark while baking, cover them with strips of
foil.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last two decades, dozens of boutique olive oil producers
opened in Northern California, and their oils became a
much-appreciated staple at the area's farmers markets. By contrast,
market-goers in the Southland have largely missed out--at least until
last month, when Willow Creek Olive Ranch started selling its
deliciously spicy extra-virgin oil.</LD>
<LD>   Mata Iaia, daughter of the owner, sells three blends of oil at the
Palos Verdes and Torrance markets. Her premium product, made from the
most recent harvest last winter, is called Pasolivo. Rich and fruity,
with a pleasing tinge of bitterness, this blend of Mission,
Manzanilla and Sevillano varieties is more intensely flavored than
oils familiar to most Americans. It would be ideal as a dipping for
bread, or as a finishing touch for soups or other dishes.</LD>
<LD>   For those who prefer a mellower taste, she has a Farmers Market
blend, made from the previous crop, which was harvested the year
before. It's a good all-purpose oil for cooking or salads.</LD>
<TE>   "Olive oil changes over time, becoming less pungent," said Iaia's
mother, Karen Guth, who established her 55-acre orchard in Paso
Robles five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Guth's 8,000 trees are the largest planting on the Central Coast.
She grows strictly for oil, and most of her trees are juicy Tuscan
varieties, such as Lecchino, Mariolo and Pendalino, which bore their
first crop last winter.</TE>
<TE>   After tasting a blend of these Italian varieties, pressed at the
farm, she decided to sell limited quantities called Pasolivo Italian
blend, starting at markets this weekend. It's much more peppery than
their regular Pasolivo blend, said Guth, who is accredited as a
taster by the California Olive Oil Council.</TE>
<TE>   A 500-milliliter bottle of the Pasolivo or Italian blend is $16;
the Farmers Market blend costs $10 for 750 milliliters. Willow Creek
Olive Ranch also sells by mail order at www.pasolivo.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes farmers market, at Hawthorne Boulevard and Silver
Spur Road, is on Sunday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Torrance, 2200 Crenshaw
Blvd, is on Saturday and Tuesday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Hot tip: Another vendor at the Palos Verdes and Torrance markets,
June Kashima, has an unusual treat for just a week or two: freshly
harvested walnuts, still in their smooth green husks. At this stage,
known as "milky" in Europe, the kernels are moister and sweeter than
regular nuts but can be used in all the same ways.</TE>
<TE>   Kashima also has jujubes, small reddish-brown fruits that most
resemble sweet apples in flavor, though they are not as juicy and
crunchy. Sometimes called Chinese dates when dried, jujubes are much
beloved in parts of Asia from Korea to Iran but are just beginning to
catch on here.</TE>

<HD>Saving the Best for Last</HD>
<DH>After a summer of glorious tomatoes, a final pleasure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the grandest of pleasures have a way of becoming pedestrian when
they are too easily available. There's no better example than
tomatoes in September.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few months ago, even the barest hint of a really ripe
tomato was enough to make us faint with anticipation. Today it's
distressingly easy to pass by an entire mound of them at the farmers
market and think, "Not those again." For cooks, this is the time of
year that separates the men from the boys. It's easy enough to be a
genius in June; getting the same reaction in late September takes
inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of weekends ago, my wife and I were visiting my daughter
at college in the far northwestern corner of the state. We do this a
couple of times a year and it has become a ritual that one night I
cook dinner for all of her friends. (Actually, it's one of my
favorite parts of the visit. There are no more appreciative eaters
than college students.)</LD>
<TE>   So Saturday we went together to the farmers market they have on
the town square. While she worked her weekend job making balloon
sculptures for kids, I foraged. By the end of the morning, every
little girl in town had pink balloon butterfly wings and every little
boy a sword and scabbard. I had kale to braise with garlic, green
beans and tiny new potatoes for salad, and some spindly celery that
was perfect for dressing with anchovies, garlic and olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, tomatoes. Tomatoes by the bagful--Brandywines,
Beefsteaks, Early Girls ... green tomatoes, yellow tomatoes and even
some that were nearly purple. I picked a half-dozen or so of the most
interestingly shaped and colored ones and sliced them up for a
platter salad, topped with thin pale rings of red onion. But most of
them I saved to stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Stuffed tomatoes are not only delicious, there is also something
definitively homespun about them. They're the culinary equivalent of
an old-fashioned quilt: something beautiful you've stitched together
out of scraps of things you just happen to have lying around.</TE>
<TE>   There are all kinds of ways to stuff tomatoes. When it's very hot,
I might make a light lunch from a salad of smoked fish and mayonnaise
I've spooned into a hollowed-out raw tomato. This is also good made
with something as everyday as canned tuna, or maybe some of that
grilled chicken left over from Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Cooking the tomato concentrates its flavor, turning it from a
handily shaped receptacle into the focus of the dish. Stuffings can
be as simple as bread crumbs rubbed with garlic and parsley, or some
cut up bits of mozzarella mixed with a couple of chopped anchovies.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can get more elaborate. I've got a soft spot for tomatoes
stuffed with rice. That's partly because they taste so good, partly
because the process is so curious. The two factors are connected.</TE>
<TE>   I use raw rice to stuff tomatoes and it cooks with only the
moisture that comes from the tomato--no water added. This takes
longer than cooking rice the normal way; while that's usually done in
15 to 20 minutes, it takes nearly an hour inside the tomato. But the
flavor more than makes up for the little bit of extra time and
effort.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to remember that this dish needs to be warm or hot
when you serve it. Chilling rice after it is cooked firms up the hard
starches. This is called retrogradation, and it's a similar process
to that which stales bread (it's also the reason you chill rice
before stir-frying it--the extra-firm grains won't break up into mush
the way just-cooked ones will). If you've refrigerated leftover
stuffed tomatoes, warm them in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes
before serving.</TE>
<TE>   Season the rice however you want. Instead of prosciutto, use fresh
sausage you've browned or even dried salami that you've minced. In
fact, even though this recipe is improved by pork products (just like
almost everything else in life), you can leave them out entirely to
make a vegetarian entree. Just amp it up with chopped herbs--basil,
oregano or mint--and fold a little cheese into the filling.</TE>
<TE>   Follow the basic guidelines to get the amounts right. A half-cup
of raw rice will stuff about four big tomatoes or six smaller ones.
And do be sure to baste the tomatoes a couple of times while they're
cooking. The first two or three times I tested this recipe, the very
top layer of rice dried out and was crunchy. A drizzle of oil and
spooning some of the cooking liquid over the top solved that problem.</TE>
<TE>   You can even use this recipe to stuff zucchini. You know, if
you're completely sick of tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tomatoes Stuffed With Pine Nuts and Prosciutto</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 45
minutes</TE>
<TE>   To use this stuffing with zucchini or other summer squash, replace
the chopped tomato pulp with an equal measure of canned crushed
tomatoes. To create the hollow, remove the seedy interior of the
squash and discard it. A large squash will take 3 to 5 tablespoons of
raw filling, a small one 1 1/2 to 2. The gray-green squash found in
Latino markets tends to be particularly good for stuffing, but round
sunburst or pattypan squashes are good too.</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, about 3/4 pound</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce prosciutto, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 pounds tomatoes, about 4 large or 6 medium tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup raw rice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup toasted pine nuts</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 cup canned crushed tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   1 to 1 1/2 ounces pecorino Romano, grated, about 3/4 cup</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Choose a baking dish just large
enough to hold all of the tomatoes. Smear the bottom and sides with
olive oil. Thinly slice one of the onions and scatter it across the
bottom of the baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   Mince the remaining onion and cook it slowly with 2 tablespoons of
olive oil in a large skillet until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the
garlic and the prosciutto and cook until the onion is softened, about
5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the onion is cooking, slice the top half-inch off of each
tomato and reserve the tops to use as lids. Using a spoon or
melon-baller, scoop out the pulp of each tomato, being very careful
not to break the sides. Sprinkle the insides of the tomatoes lightly
with salt.</TE>
<TE>   Chop the pulp and add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of it to the onions. Cook
until the pulp begins to melt, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and cook
another minute. Stir in the pine nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt and the
white wine and remove the pan from the heat. The mixture should be
soupy; you should have about 2 cups of filling.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the crushed tomatoes into the baking dish and stir it to
lightly coat the bottom. Place the tomatoes cut side-up in the baking
dish on top of the onions and crushed tomatoes. They should sit
upright; if they don't, cut a thin slice from the bottom of each
tomato so that they will.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the rice filling into the tomato shells, but don't overfill
them--the rice will swell as it cooks and can easily burst the sides
of the tomatoes (indeed, big beefsteak-type tomatoes have such thin
walls that collapse is almost inevitable). Large beefsteak tomatoes
will hold 3 to 5 tablespoons of filling each; smaller tomatoes will
hold 2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons each. Drizzle a little olive oil over
each tomato and replace the tops at a jaunty angle.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake 20 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and spoon some of the liquid from the
bottom of the pan over the rice. Replace the foil and continue
baking, basting every 20 minutes or so. Cook until the rice is
swollen and chewy but not chalky at the center, 40 to 60 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   When the rice is cooked, remove the foil and the tomato lids and
sprinkle the top of the rice with the grated cheese. Return to the
oven and bake until the cheese has browned lightly, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Replace the lids and let stand 10 minutes before serving hot, or
serve warm.</TE>

<LD>Before Terry, I had an unbreakable rule about cooking with wine
vinegar. Prefer lemon. Then a former colleague from the London
Independent, a crime correspondent named Terry Kirby, set two tightly
sealed jam jars on my desk. One contained a fleshy-looking substance
suspended in red liquid. The other contained a fleshy-looking
substance in white liquid. "They're mothers," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Vinegar mothers, he meant. Starter cultures to convert wine to
vinegar. One of Terry's mothers was for white wine, the other for
red. They were French, he said, and 200 years old. That was in 1989.
I'm not sure that I ever thanked Terry. I certainly never thanked him
properly. Once I had the wit to uncap his mothers, I not only started
making wine vinegar from them, the resulting vinegar transformed how
I cooked, how I ate and how I thought about food.</LD>
<TE>   Real wine vinegar, I discovered, had unique bite and savor.
Vinegar awakened foods, then refreshed them. It gave a dash of
brilliance to just about everything it touched. It revealed the charm
of the greatest of all French sauces--the vinaigrette. It transformed
soups and redefined gravy. It improved cheese, woke up sandwiches,
became so basic that it sits out on the counter with salt and pepper.
It didn't supplant lemons--you can't make hummus with vinegar--but
for so many jobs in the kitchen, vinegar now brings a liveliness, an
immediacy and complexity that lemon juice simply lacks. I became so
used to its invigorating shot of acid, the vogue for thick, sweet
balsamic vinegar never dented my household.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, I discovered why all those years ago I thought that
I preferred lemon. I phoned Ernie Farinias, a winemaker and resident
"vinegar-ologist" at UC Davis' viticulture and oenology department.
Then I tracked down Sonoma vinegar-maker Karen Fahden. They explained
that most industrial wine-vinegar plants are places where rot-gut
wine goes to die.</TE>
<TE>   It is a case, it seems, of bad wine in, bad vinegar out. The word
vinegar comes from the French vin aigre, for "sour wine." While wine
is made in a process called "primary fermentation," in which yeast
converts the sugar of grapes into alcohol, vinegar is the result of a
secondary fermentation. In this, bacteria called Acetobacter aceti
convert the alcohol into acetic acid. The better the wine, the better
the vinegar. If you use a good cabernet sauvignon, you'll get a
tannic richness and deep fruit flavors. A zinfandel will have a
dancing freshness. If the wine has been aged in oak, there will be
resinous aromatic notes. If you use barely fermented grapes or bad
wine, as much of the vinegar industry does, you'll get something
sharp.</TE>
<TE>   Wine, and Time</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that the best way to ensure a steady supply of good
wine vinegar is to make it yourself. All this requires is a vessel of
some sort, a dark cupboard and the odd glass of wine left over from
good bottles to toss into it.</TE>
<TE>   My own conversion to home vinegar making was not immediate. I
tended to finish my bottles of wine. Terry's 200-year-old mothers
turned 201, then 202, still in their jars. Eventually, I bought an
expensive stoneware crock from a French kitchenware shop on Kings
Road. I decanted the red mother into it using a long-handled pair of
metal tongs. This impressive new vessel had a lid at the top, where
you could empty in the contents of unfinished glasses and bottles of
wine. Down near the base of the crock, there was a cork plug fitted
with a wooden spigot, where you could draw off finished vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   Once I unbottled Terry's mother, it seemed rude not to give her a
little taste of whatever I was drinking. As the vinegar level
steadily rose above the spigot, the crock started to leak. I
rechecked the instructions and found that I should have soaked the
cork stopper in water first, so it could swell and plug the hole. I
put the thing in a plate to catch the seepage.</TE>
<TE>   In no time, Terry's mother was swimming in about a gallon of
Beaujolais, Cotes du Rhone and Barbaresco dregs. The contents smelled
less like vinegar than like an uncleared kitchen table the morning
after a dinner party. Italian friends, a pair of restaurateurs, asked
if Terry's mother had been exposed to metal. I remembered the tongs.
I might even, I realized, have given her an inquiring poke.</TE>
<TE>   "Metal kills mothers," said one of the restaurateurs, the one who
didn't cook. They had friends who had killed their mother too, she
added, but who revived it with expensive wine. I went home and gave
Terry's mother an entire bottle of Barolo.</TE>
<TE>   This lifted the wine level to the top of the crock. Terry's mother
smelled better, but not like vinegar. Then I did my first thing
right: I left Terry's mother alone, for three, four, five, maybe six
months. Only when the leak started seeping over the rim of the plate
and across the floor of the cabinet was I driven to investigate. The
slick consisted of some surprisingly delicious vinegar. The quality
held inside the crock. I drew off bottle after bottle. I'd given some
away as Christmas presents before I read Richard Olney, cookery
writer and authority on things French, who recommended that the
vinegar should be filtered. From that day forward, sediment, bits of
mother, the odd vinegar fly were trapped by a paper coffee filter set
inside a funnel.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the crock around the kitchen, I discovered that the
fermentation could be sped up by placing the crock in a warmer spot,
slowed down by putting it in a cool one. It slowed down dramatically
if I filled the crock more than two-thirds full (a no-no):
Acetobacter, it emerged, need air. Thank you, Richard Olney, for
instructing someone almost instruction-proof to always draw off
finished vinegar before adding more raw wine to the top.</TE>
<TE>   More thanks for the tip that the vinegar continues to mellow and
improve once bottled. There is a school that insists on finishing
homemade vinegar in oak wine barrels. My own feeling about this is
that wine these days sees more than enough oak at wineries.</TE>
<TE>   I got two crocks for Terry's white mother, one for Alsace-style
whites, one for champagne, but I was out of my depth. I cannot claim
expertise with white wine vinegar. The ones I made were fine, but to
my taste, they remained yeasty, never quite completing their
conversion to an acid state. I'm told by Farinias and Fahden that I
probably should have diluted these with water. It seems that white
wine contains a higher percentage of sulfites and that these,
otherwise very useful preservatives, may have hampered the action of
the Acetobacter.</TE>
<TE>   The Unstoppable Red</TE>
<TE>   But once it got going, undiluted, my red wine vinegar kept
fermenting nicely. I expanded the operation to two vessels, a large
holding jar where the lid sat loosely on the top and fermentations
started. The original crock became the finishing tank, where mature
vinegar was never more than two weeks away in what I now reckoned was
about a three-month process from leftover wine to vinegar. I needed
two jars because my friends and I were now consuming vinegar as fast
as I made it.</TE>
<TE>   My liberal hand with vinegar owes much to exposure to Jeremy Lee,
officially the head chef at the Blue Print Cafe at the Design Museum
in London, unofficially a dear friend. One day we were in my galley
kitchen. I was very pleased with a batch of bread I'd just baked and
some cheese I'd secured, Mrs. Kirkham's Lancashire. I handed him a
sandwich made from it. He shot me a devilish grin, reached for olive
oil, doused it with that, then picked up the red wine vinegar,
sprinkled this lavishly over it as well, slapped the sandwich shut
and took a deep bite. I wanted to scold him for tampering with my
masterpiece, but my hunger was too powerfully aroused. I immediately
imitated him. It was superb.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy also taught me about red wine vinegar and spinach. He
considers it to be one of the holiest marriages in cookery, right up
there with tomatoes and basil. We all hear about deglazing--it sounds
so fancy and chef-like--but he taught me to put a quick shot of red
wine vinegar into a skillet after cooking lamb chops at home, or any
kind of chop, or even eggplant, to let it sizzle, turn off the heat,
then quickly melt in a small knob of butter. The flavor of the jus,
heck, gravy, that fabulous sauce, mingling with lamb chops, fried
tomatoes and buttered spinach still plays in my dreams. I now deglaze
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy and I used to haunt the restaurant of another chef,
Alastair Little. One of his signature dishes was oysters with a
ramekin of shallots in red wine vinegar. The idea was to order them
with napkins tucked in your collar and plenty of champagne as a
euphoric retort to the saltiness of the oysters. The vinegar dressing
didn't dwarf the shellfish but highlighted its meatiness and somehow
brought a rush of sea right to the table.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for vinegar recipes can be tricky. Vinegar trade
associations tend to promote the likes of vinegar cookies and vinegar
pies. To my mind, this is as silly as calculating how many vinegar
bottles stacked end to end it would take to reach the moon. Vinegar
is rarely a main ingredient.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking about Jeremy's spinach salads, that gravy, even vinegar
spooned over oysters, it occurs to me that vinegar doesn't
necessarily read as itself in a dish. It's a condiment. Its kiss of
acid causes us to sit up straight and exult at the deliciousness of
whatever we've seasoned with it. Chef and cookery writer Deborah
Madison talks about it "brightening" food. In "The Greens Cookbook,"
she taught us to not just make lentil and spinach soup but to revive
it just before serving with an invigorating lick of red wine vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   I can think of only one recipe in which vinegar is the rightful
star. It is, of course, the French classic sauce vinaigrette. You
don't need fancy oil, even olive oil. Just good vinegar, and good
mustard. Put artichokes in a pot, or wash salad leaves. It's even
good on boiled potatoes, beans, or, if you're stuck with earthquake
rations, canned peas. Now, start with a tablespoon of red wine
vinegar. Add a pinch of salt. Taste. Add Dijon mustard, or, if you
have it, the superb Pommery Moutarde de Meaux. Taste. If you've got
herbs fresh or dried, got time and the inclination to chop, add
chopped herbs. Ditto a clove of garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Taste. If you don't have herbs and garlic, don't worry. It doesn't
need it. Now add oil, mild olive oil or plain old vegetable oil.
Whisk. Taste. Finish with freshly ground black pepper.</TE>
<TE>   When I moved to Los Angeles from London four years ago, I left
Terry's mothers behind, and all their starchy folds so heavily
impregnated with 200 years worth of collective Acetobacter. But I was
sure that California would be as full of good vinegar as it is of
good wine. I found otherwise. Fahden confirms my impression. There
are a few good ones, she says. Her family business makes vinegar for
all sorts of clients--she won't name them--and the quality varies
according to what they are given to process. (Her tip to shoppers:
Look for a wine varietal name on the bottle, say, cabernet or zin.)</TE>
<TE>   But most winemakers wouldn't dream of making vinegar themselves,
she says. They are so terrified of inadvertently contaminating their
wine-making machinery with Acetobacter that they don't even want to
drive on her property.</TE>
<TE>   This is paranoid. Acetobacter, it turns out, is ubiquitous. It's
in the air, in the environment. While this spooks winemakers who are
worried the wine will make vin aigre instead of vin, it is the best
of news for the home vinegar maker. It means anyone can trap it. They
don't need Terry's mother.</TE>
<TE>   A Good Mother</TE>
<TE>   However, there are many strains of Acetobacter, and some produce
better flavors than others. Hence, the belief in mothers. Some
starters with supposedly primo culture are sold on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Myself, I just took a huge pickle jar, the catering-issue ones you
see at club stores. (The smell of dill persisted for a while but
faded and didn't hurt the vinegar.) The Acetobacter might have been
hanging around in the jar from the pickling vinegar, or they might
have been resident in my kitchen. Whichever, they found their way in
the jar, which I kept with the lid on, but unscrewed, with a
gathering pool of wine just waiting for them. Slowly the wine began
to turn to vinegar, good vinegar. Only three years into the operation
is a slight layer of mother slowly forming.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the fancy French crock and Terry's mother, the pickle jar
doesn't get Barolo anymore. Or Barbaresco. Those Piedmontese reds are
prohibitively expensive here. But it does get a steady trickle of
California zinfandels, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignons and the odd
splash of chianti. As in London, I am now up to two jars. I saw an
iced-tea maker for six bucks in Ralphs. It had the opening at the top
and a plastic spigot that doesn't leak for drawing off vinegar. The
pickle jar now serves for primary fermentation, the iced-tea one for
vinegar that is finished or finishing.</TE>
<TE>   The bumblebees on it are a bit tacky, but nobody sees them. The
only rule for using glass jars is to keep them in a dark cabinet, or
even paint the outside to keep sunlight from the vinegar. On the
other hand, if you want it on your counter, Sur La Table has a nifty
ceramic crock for a reasonable $24.95.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you do, don't buy a crock with a metal spout. Metal, I
find, doesn't kill mothers, the folds of cellulose that will
eventually build as a byproduct of the conversion of alcohol to
acetic acid. But vinegar will corrode the metal. If too much mother
builds up, it should be taken out to make room for more wine. The
fleshy mother doesn't have any magical properties itself, but it will
be impregnated by your strain of Acetobacter. By all means, fish it
out, bottle it and give it to a friend.</TE>

<TE>   Warm Spinach Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Jeremy Lee, chef of the Blue Print Cafe in
London. Our kitchen staff thought this was only one poached egg short
of a meal. From England, Lee adds that it's also a splendid
accompaniment for calf's liver.</TE>
<TE>   4 small boiling potatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 slices bacon, cut into small strips</TE>
<TE>   2 small shallots, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 sage leaves</TE>
<TE>   1 (6-ounce) bag spinach</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Boil the potatoes over medium heat until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Cool, then slice about 1/4-inch thick, not too thin.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a wok or deep frying pan over medium-high heat and fry the
potatoes in the oil until golden, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
Add the bacon and fry 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallots and cook 1
minute. Add the sage, then spinach, and toss together. Remove from
the heat. Add the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, and serve
before the spinach completely wilts. Eat immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Chicken Braised With Figs, Honey and Vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour,
plus 12 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from the new "Zuni Cafe Cookbook" by Judy
Rodgers (W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $35). Rodgers begins this recipe with a
note about how to select a ripe fig, the sort now filling market
stalls. "Shrunken and wrinkled is actually good, as long as it is
heavy," she explains. She ends with a word on the role played by the
vinegar in this dish. It "adds a bright but unstable note of acidity,
which will fade with boiling, so simmer for only a minute or less."</TE>
<TE>   4 chicken legs (about 1/2 pound each)</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   About 2 tablespoons mild-tasting olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 onion (about 1/2 pound), root end trimmed flat, peeled and cut
into 8 wedges</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   About 2 tablespoons dry white vermouth</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   A few black peppercorns, barely cracked in a mortar</TE>
<TE>   About 2 tablespoons cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   About 1 tablespoon honey</TE>
<TE>   8 to 10 ripe fresh figs</TE>
<TE>   Trim the excess fat from the chicken, season evenly all over with
salt (we used a scant 3/4 teaspoon per pound of chicken). Cover
loosely and refrigerate. This is best if refrigerated 12 to 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees</TE>
<TE>   Pat the chicken legs dry; this will make them less likely to
stick. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat, then
add the chicken legs, skin side down. The oil should sizzle, not pop
explosively, when you add the chicken. Adjusting the heat as
necessary, cook until the skin is evenly golden, about 8 minutes.
Turn the legs over and color only slightly on the other side, about 4
minutes. Pour off the fat.</TE>
<TE>   If your skillet is ovenproof, arrange the onion wedges in the
spaces between the chicken legs; otherwise, transfer the chicken to a
shallow flameproof braising dish that will easily hold the chicken
and onions in a single layer and add the onions. Add the wine, the
vermouth and enough stock to come to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Bring
to a simmer and add the bay leaf, thyme and cracked black
peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   Place, uncovered, in the oven, and cook until the meat is tender
but not quite falling off the bone, about 40 minutes. The exposed
skin will have turned golden and crisp, the liquid ought to have
reduced by about half. Remove from the oven and set on a slight tilt
so the fat will collect at one side of the pan.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the vinegar and honey and warm slightly. This takes 10
seconds in the microwave. The vinegar should dominate but without
making you squint. Trim the stems and cut the figs in half.</TE>
<TE>   Skim as much fat as possible from the braising liquid, then set
the pan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and swirl as you reduce the
liquid to a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes. Distribute the figs
evenly around the pan, add about 2 tablespoons of the vinegar-honey
syrup and swirl the pan to diffuse the bubbling, amber syrup without
smashing the tender fruit. The sauce will be glossy. Taste--it should
be rich and vibrantly sour-sweet. Add more of the syrup, to taste.
The vinegar will fade with boiling, so simmer for only a minute or
less.</TE>
<TE>   Serve each chicken leg with 2 wedges of sweet, soft onion and 4 or
5 figs halves, bathed in a few spoonfuls of the sauce.</TE>

<LD>To make red wine vinegar, you need two vessels: a 1- to 2-gallon jar
and a vinegar crock or sun tea maker with a spigot at the base. The
rest is simple:</LD>
<LD>   * Pour leftover red wine into the big jar, cover the top with
muslin and secure it with a string or rubber band. This will allow
air but keep out dust and bugs. You can set the lid on top, but do
not screw it down. Do not fill the jar more than two-thirds full.</LD>
<LD>   You can leave wine sitting in the jar to attract a wild culture of
Acetobacter--I did and it worked fine--or, for sure-fire starters,
get a vinegar mother or starter. (Grape and Granary, 1035 Evans Ave.,
Akron, Ohio 44305, [800] 695-9870, sells starters for $7.95 plus
shipping.)</LD>
<TE>   * Store the jar in a dark, cool pantry or cupboard. After five
weeks, taste or smell the wine. If it has pleasing hints of vinegar,
pour two-thirds of it into the vinegar crock, leaving a third in the
jar to start the next batch. This way, the almost-vinegar can mature
in the crock without new wine diluting its acidity. (Note: it may
take up to two months for the wine to turn.)</TE>
<TE>   * Get a cycle going in which you routinely add wine to the large
jar but every so often shift two-thirds to the finishing crock.</TE>
<TE>   Before doing this, check the finishing crock and draw off any
vinegar that is ready, funneling it into a bottle through a paper
coffee filter. This fermented vinegar will continue to mellow and
improve in the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   * Troubleshooting: Complete fermentation should take about three
months in a dark cupboard kept at about 70 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   * If the crock attracts vinegar flies, just filter them out and
resecure the muslin. "They're just protein," says UC Davis' Ernie
Farinias.</TE>
<TE>   * If there is no fermentation with white wine, the sulfite level
may be too high. Try diluting it, four parts wine to one part
distilled water.</TE>
<TE>   * The acidity of the wine makes it an inhospitable place for
food-borne pathogens, so there are no food safety issues with a plain
homemade vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   However, infusing vinegar with herbs may introduce harmful
bacteria and should not be attempted without expert advice. For more
information, UC Davis has a Web site at

<LD>Gallo is on the move.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, the E&amp;J Gallo Winery acquired Louis M.
Martini, one of the Napa Valley's oldest and most respected wineries,
along with hundreds of acres of vineyards in Napa and Sonoma
counties, including the historic Monte Rosso vineyard, one of
California's viticultural treasures.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Gallo purchased the Mirassou Vineyards brand and
inventory. Mirassou is another old California name--the family has
been producing wine for six generations. In this deal, the Mirassous
will keep their winery and vineyards in Santa Clara and Monterey
counties, possibly to start a new brand. Meanwhile, Heather, David
and Mark Mirassou will work for Gallo to help produce and market
Mirassou wines.</LD>
<TE>   At first glance, these acquisitions appear to be a dramatic sign
of deepening woes in the wine industry--of Gallo, the world's largest
wine producer, buying out smaller, struggling labels. The moves are
also an example of Gallo's eagerness to establish itself among the
state's most respected winemakers, and shed lingering associations
with the low-end wines largely responsible for the company's success.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to it than that. What we're seeing is a new
Gallo.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Gallo has always created its new brands from scratch.
If it needed a new winery, it built a facility such as the large
Gallo of Sonoma winery near Healdsburg. It currently has four large
wineries in California producing wine under more than 20 labels,
including Indigo Hills, Gossamer Bay and Rancho Zabaco.</TE>
<TE>   Wine produced in those facilities can now be bottled under the
Martini and Mirassou labels, so both probably will expand
significantly once new marketing campaigns are underway. Gallo won't
comment on its plans for Martini or Mirassou estate wines. Both
wineries still have wines from the 1999-2001 vintages on the market.
Any changes in winemaking style would begin in the 2003 vintage, with
the new wines reaching consumers in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Gallo is, first and foremost, a sales and marketing machine. If it
holds true to past patterns, its vast grape and wine resources will
flow into expanding the Martini and Mirassou brands to volumes that
would boggle their founders' minds. Terms of both sales were not
released because all three companies are privately held.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors see Gallo as the 300-pound gorilla that gets what it
wants. Many regard it as the Titan that protects California wine
interests in an often-hostile political environment. Regardless,
Gallo is on the move in a way that it hasn't been before--not only
expanding, but shifting focus.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't just about making a lot of money from California wine.
It's about California. The state's wine industry has been pummeled by
post-Sept. 11 economic woes and over-planting. In particular,
mid-size wineries--those producing 100,000 to 500,000 cases a
year--have suffered from the drop in restaurant, hotel and airline
business. They've also been hit by a trend toward consolidation among
distributors (down to a handful from nearly 50 in the 1970s), which
has made it difficult to bring more products to the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has set up another kind of consolidation: big fish
gobbling up little ones. Wine industry analyst Rich Cartiere,
publisher of Wine Market Report and Global Wine News, notes that the
Gallo deals were well-timed to take advantage of the trend toward
wine distributor consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   "Gallo's clearly taking an opportunity here," he says.
"Consolidation is wreaking havoc with wine brands. It's created a
bottleneck in the distribution system so that a big swath of wine has
to move through a narrow funnel to get to the consumer. It's really
hard for a mid-size winery to go it alone."</TE>
<TE>   That was a big factor in the Martini family's decision to sell,
says winery President and Chief Executive Carolyn Martini. "This year
has been a 'Perfect Storm.' It's worse than just the stock market.
There's an oversupply of wine. Destination hotels and airlines are
down, and those are our key accounts. Liquor sales have gone up and
wine sales have gone down. And brokers who have been in business 35
or 40 years are suddenly gone." Finally, she says, she and her
brother, winemaker Michael Martini, became overwhelmed. "It got to
where we're all looking at each other, saying, 'Do we want to keep
fighting this battle?' It's just pretty difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Louis M. Martini is one of California's oldest family-run
wineries. It has been a pillar of the Napa Valley wine community
since its doors opened immediately after repeal of Prohibition in
1933. The Mirassous claim to be America's oldest wine family. Their
150-year saga began when vintner Pierre Pellier arrived from France
in the early 1850s. He settled south of San Francisco in what is now
the Santa Clara Valley, where he planted vines and began producing
wines in 1854. He had come to California seeking gold, and he found
it when one of his wines won a gold medal at the 1858 San Francisco
Fair. In 1881, Pellier's daughter married a neighbor, winegrower
Pierre Mirassou, who became a partner in the family wine business.
Successive generations of Mirassous carried on the family business.</TE>
<TE>   "They sold wine out of the trunk of their car, building the brand
on relationships," says company marketing director Heather Mirassou,
who is Pellier's great-great-granddaughter. By the early 1980s, the
Mirassous were producing 380,000 cases a year. At that point, the
fifth generation, headed by Daniel Mirassou, decided to pull back and
concentrate on their strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd been making everything for everybody," says Heather
Mirassou. "So we decided to focus on what we produce best, which is
cool-climate varietals." They scaled back to around 150,000 cases,
primarily Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Blanc from their chilly
Monterey County vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   E&amp;J Gallo was founded in 1933 by Ernest and Julio Gallo, the
California-born sons of immigrants from northern Italy. Their
immediate and lasting success was based on an ideal partnership:
Julio found his passion in growing grapes and making wine, while
Ernest discovered that his inner businessman was a sales and
marketing genius. Early on, according to family lore, the brothers
made a pact: Ernest told Julio, "I'll sell as much wine as you can
make," to which Julio replied, "I'll make as much wine as you can
sell."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 20th century, E&amp;J Gallo was producing
approximately 60 million cases a year of fortified, sparkling and
still wine, along with brandy, under more than 30 different brands.
It remains the largest single buyer of grapes in the world, and its
mammoth production center in Modesto is bus-ride big, including
facilities for manufacturing glass bottles and labels.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the Gallo brothers formed relationships with other
winemaking families. Their 1977 purchase of the large Frei Brothers
ranch in northern Sonoma County was the foundation of a separate
entity within the company, Gallo of Sonoma, focusing on high-end
varietal wines. Gallo had been buying grapes from the Frei family
since 1934. After acquiring the Frei ranch, it reconfigured the
property using surplus heavy equipment from Alaskan Pipeline
construction. Gallo planted new vines and built a new winery, then
launched the Gallo of Sonoma label.</TE>
<TE>   The latest acquisitions continue Gallo's evolution away from the
cheap fortified wines and generic blends that built the business.
"This shows the resiliency of Gallo as a family corporate entity, to
be able to reinvent yourself so thoroughly and change directions
without internal disruptions," says Cartiere. "One of Gallo's biggest
problems has been overcoming its own names," low-end wines like
Thunderbird, Night Train and Annie Green Springs. "But it's committed
to doing that," he says. "They've come to recognize that it's going
to take generations, and meanwhile they need to use other tactics to
maintain market dominance." Now the tactic is to reach out to some of
the old wine families who worked alongside Ernest and Julio Gallo to
raise the California wine industry from the shambles of Prohibition.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest, at 94, is still active in the business, now largely run by
the family's third generation. Julio Gallo died in 1993. His
granddaughter, Gallo of Sonoma marketing director Caroline Coleman
Bailey, believes he would be pleased by the acquisitions. "It mirrors
what Julio and Ernest started," says Bailey. "It's all about family,
and keeping family wineries in the family. That's what's exciting. My
grandfather would be smiling right now."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd have to spend $100 for a major Bordeaux to do better than this
California Bordeaux-style blend. The Titus estate, just north of St.
Helena on the Silverado Trail, is run by brothers Eric and Phillip
Titus, who split caring for the vineyard and the winemaking. The
winemaking is as graceful as it gets. This wine has a little Petit
Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc in the blend. It has a
wonderful balance, bright luscious fruit and just a light touch of
oak. The tannins are supple enough that you can drink this now or
keep it around for a special occasion.</LD>
<LD>   About $34. Available at Gerlach's Liquor in Pasadena, (626)
799-1166; Grape Connection in San Diego, (619) 523-6441; Malibu

<DL></DL>
<LD>You walk into an alley and the high wattage from an almost full moon
falls underfoot as smooth as spilled paint; you look over your
shoulder expecting to see footprints as if in snow. Music, jazz and
rock and New Age rises with the smell of incense from open doorways.
On the south side of the alley is an apartment building, long and
tall. All the lights are on in the bottom flat. There are many
windows revealing different rooms; given the moon, the music, it is
impossible not to look.</LD>
<LD>   In the dining room a television set flickers in the corner; the
empty chairs are canted toward the screen. Along wainscoting a plate
rail is lined with figurines; not all of them are distinguishable,
but there is a shepherd, a shepherdess and at least two figures
dancing in the regalia of pre-revolutionary France. The next room is
the kitchen; tea towels hang from a rack on the wall. Beside the
detergent, ceramic roosters line the shelf above the sink. It looks
like a painting, or an Kienholz installation, like the stage before
the performance begins. You try to imagine who lives there, what they
are doing right now, how much they are--or are not--like you.</LD>
<LD>   You have only been in the first five galleries of Art Crawl 2002
and suddenly, in an alley between Berendo and Heliotrope, just south
of Melrose, the line between art and real life seems irrevocably
blurred.</LD>
<TE>   It is called the Art Crawl, but in a way the art is beside the
point. Last weekend, for the fifth year, people of all sorts made
their way through the art galleries of Echo Park, Silver Lake and Los
Feliz, and they did encounter art--some of it good, some of it weird,
some of it weirdly good.</TE>
<TE>   But much more is on display than the art. The neighborhoods and
the people and the artistic life, with all its cliches--red wine in
small clear plastic glasses still prevails--and reassuring splendor.
In the alley off Berendo, a couple of artists have opened their
studios. The work is interesting but not nearly as interesting as the
peephole they have provided into their lives. The actual loft on
which a bed is barely visible behind batik curtains, the clothing
stored on purloined department store racks, the teeny-tiny stoves,
the boxes of granola and seriously old pizza. These are places
outside time and place, you are in "Crime and Punishment," you are in
"An American in Paris," you are deeply, deeply in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a few yards away from one of the studios, a man is
relieving himself behind the open door of a red Jeep in a small
parking lot behind one of the storefronts. He looks straight at you
and smiles. He seems sober. Next door, voices are raised in an
actorly way during a rehearsal at Sacred Fools Theater. Couples pause
to listen, stroll along the alley, onto the street, holding hands,
looking like twentysomethings on a first date. From Melrose to
Hollywood Boulevard, up along Silver Lake Boulevard and especially on
Echo Park Avenue, the night teems with bohos, or to use the more
recently coined upscale term, "bobos," in love. With each other, with
the art, with reminders that there are a lot of small but wonderful
things right around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Walking along Sunset Boulevard, between the clean white chic of
Rain Heron and the recently artsified Alvarado Arts Building, it is
impossible not to notice how fabulous this stretch of the street is.
Splattered by the gentrification that has been spilling out from Los
Feliz/Silver Lake into Echo Park during the last five or six years,
these 20 or so blocks are perhaps the perfect mix of the real and the
terminally hip. Coffeehouses elbow Laundromats, gallery space stands
alongside taco stands, boutiques bloom next to mattress stores and
tchotchke emporiums.</TE>
<TE>   In front of a storefront Catholic church bathed in the glow of
nearby neon, the line between real and imagined again wavers. In the
back of the dim room hangs a large portrait of Christ surrounded by
wreaths of white artificial flowers. It is Jesus in his glam/rocker
phase, all eyes and really great hair. The windows are crisscrossed
by bars painted white. Two women are sitting on a bench in the back.
They are facing each other but their mouths do not seem to be
moving--what is art, really?</TE>
<TE>   Cruising the streets, it is easy to spot the different galleries.
Long before their addresses are visible, they are marked by small
crowds of darkly clad people, many of whom are scrutinizing small
fuchsia bits of paper on which the map of the event is drawn. They
are people who are not normally at the corner of Sunset and Alvarado,
of Melrose and Berendo on a Friday night, or any night, for that
matter. One of the points of the art crawl is that maybe this could,
and should, change.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the half-dozen galleries and shops on Echo Park
Avenue, however, the large crowd seems not at all out of place. Here
are the young artists with their small-paned, development-girl
glasses and multiple piercings, the striking sideburns and variations
of chin hair. There seem to be no bared midriffs, and for a moment
that is almost unnerving. But neither is there is an age requirement
for cool; there are folks in their 40s and 50s and 60s, some with
children drowsing on their shoulders, many with dogs, all leaning
against each other, laughing and yawning, enjoying the cool darkness
as it settles its rump onto the still warm sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   A sign on one storefront says the occupants have gone to see the
erotica show at Arthouse, and it reads like an invitation. Up and
down and over the hills of Echo Park, you walk like a cartoon
character climbing mountains. You come to a bungalow lighted up
golden and red and you can hear the sound of a voice reading through
the windows, although you cannot distinguish the words.</TE>
<TE>   A friendly young man tells you that there is a reading going on in
the front room, but you can go on through the back to look at the art
and help yourself to snacks. You walk into the kitchen and on the
counter are bowls of pretzel sticks and Chee-tos and a plateful of
cupcakes decorated to look like women's breasts.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms of the house have very little furniture and there are
many paintings, mostly phallic in nature, and vintage porn-movie
posters. On one wall, a series of old snapshots shows women who could
be your mother baring the tops of their gartered legs. There are a
lot of people here, sidling past, holding their beer cans at chest
level, smiling vaguely. It is like every college party you have ever
been to, only in one room a young woman is sitting in front of a
small audience reading erotica in a fast flat voice.</TE>
<TE>   So here you are, looking at flowered phalluses and listening to
rapid descriptions of oral sex. You are eating stale pretzel sticks
and holding hands with your husband, and outside the city is backlit
by a moon so bright you can hear it burn.</TE>
<TE>   It is not at all erotic, but it is quite something--to know that
art lives, quick and relentless, in places you have forgotten about,
in ways you didn't expect.</TE>

<DH>Cesar Millan helps incorrigible canines roll over a new
leaf, find 'fulfillment'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Fulfillment" is the newest buzzword among dog lovers, who
increasingly seem inclined to figure out what their dogs were born to
do--and then attempt to let them do it.</LD>
<LD>   Herding breeds must herd; hunting breeds must hunt, and so on. The
idea is that when dogs satisfy their biological imperatives, they
will feel Fulfilled and therefore be more even tempered, obedient,
have a more positive attitude.</LD>
<LD>   Now we hear the F-word from Cesar Millan, who runs a
rehabilitation center for delinquent dogs--a kind of last-chance boot
camp for three-strikes canines who fight, bite, run away and disobey.</LD>
<TE>   Millan, 27, owns the Dog Psychology Center of Los
Angeles--a 2-acre clinic in a downtown warehouse, where he guides
unbalanced dogs back to happy, productive lives. He talks like Freud,
looks like Rudolph Valentino and acts like Merlin the wizard when his
deep, silent stare causes peace to descend upon even the most unhinged
of his quadruped clients.</TE>
<TE>   He spends at least four hours a day hiking the nearby hills with a
pack of 30 unleashed, highly aggressive dogs trailing behind him.
They are his patients. And they are plagued with problems that range
from moderate antisocial behavior to belligerence that puts them in
what Millan calls "the red zone." That is: They plunder, pillage,
maim and maul.</TE>
<TE>   But they can all be healed, he says, if only we start Fulfilling
their needs. "If a high-energy dog is not fulfilled," he becomes
aggressive and will not obey. "It is like with people. When a man
wants his woman to cook for him, he has to learn to fulfill her needs
before he can ask for such a thing, no?"</TE>
<TE>   No comment. Millan is married to the lovely Illusion, also 27, who
works with him. He says he has had to learn more about humans than
about dogs, who were his closest companions from the day he was born
in Mazatlan, Mexico, and all the while he was growing up. "I
literally lived, slept, ate and played with dogs all my life. My
grandfather and father knew all about dogs and gave their knowledge
to me."</TE>
<TE>   Treatment starts daily at 6 a.m. That's when he loads the van with
the pack and drives to one of many nearby sylvan spots where he does
therapy. A hillside road near Avenue 52 in Highland Park is one of
his favorites. There, he power-walks uphill, nonstop, at precisely
3.5 miles per hour--the perfect pace to keep the dogs focused on him
as they expend their abundant energy, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "On this typical route, we walk to the top, which takes an hour.
We stop at a lake, where the dogs cool down. They swim. They relax.
After 30 minutes, we walk for another hour. We enter a wooded area,
where I allow them to relieve themselves in the trees. They have
exactly five minutes to come back for formation. I walk again for an
hour, and they follow. A pack leader doesn't have to talk. When he
moves, so does his pack."</TE>
<TE>   They stop to play ball for 30 minutes--there's one ball in his
backpack for each dog. Then Millan follows the same routine going
downhill and piles the 30 animals into his 15-person van.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the center, he inspects for cuts and ticks, massages their
muscles, gives them a three-hour nap before they are fed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not training. That's not what we offer. This is rehab,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   "People send dogs to me as a last resort. They cannot live with
them anymore." Most of his patients come from very good homes, Millan
says. They have had the best of everything: food, toys, trainers,
indoor and outdoor space. But they are still so dangerous and
ill-behaved that they are on the brink of being considered unfit to
live. And that is because their needs have not been met. They are not
Fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs of homeless people are much more fulfilled than the
pampered dogs of Palos Verdes and Beverly Hills, Millan says.</TE>
<TE>   "You never hear on the news that a homeless person's dog has run
wild or attacked. And most of those dogs aren't even on leashes," he
says. "But they follow their leaders everywhere. That's because every
day is a new challenge, an adventure. They walk to new places, see
new things, their minds are focused, their bodies active. That's what
they need. Exercise first, then discipline and then love."</TE>
<TE>   And when they walk together, Millan adds, you almost always see
the homeless person in front and the dog behind him or at his side.</TE>
<TE>   But go to almost any upscale neighborhood, Millan says, and you'll
see the dog on a leash, in front of the person who's walking him.</TE>
<TE>   "Position means a lot. If the dog is in front, and you are in
back, you are the follower. You have no power over him if he gets
excited or anxious. Dogs don't listen to followers. They need to be
led."</TE>
<TE>   Millan says even a palace can be a prison for a pooch. A woodsy
fenced acre can feel like county jail. "No matter how big the yard,
it is like a penitentiary because it is already familiar, and it has
walls the dog cannot get beyond." His frustration level builds up. He
starts to have ... issues. And you do the dog no favor by taking him
from the house to the doggy day-care place to play, Millan says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like taking a tiger from one zoo to another zoo."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Rankin, who is registrar at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in Simi Valley, is one of Millan's clients. Her 5-year-old
coon hound, Elvis, is a 75-pound, powerful specimen of a hunting
breed who became "the sticking point" in her divorce, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We both loved him and didn't want to give him up. We
had different ideas of what was best for him." Both knew that Elvis
needed an attitude change--or else.</TE>
<TE>   "He was already on heavy tranquilizers, and even that did no good.
He was so aggressive and mistrustful of strangers that we couldn't
have guests at our house." He bit Rankin on the face and foot, she
says, and bit her ex-husband too. After she got legal custody of the
dog, she took him to Millan, who kept him for five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis comes home. He's totally changed. He's happy. He likes
people. He knows how to play with other dogs. People are no longer
afraid of him. He kisses them." Rankin says she considers Millan the
dog world equivalent of the woman who taught Helen Keller. "Cesar was
able to break through to the Elvis that I knew was inside."</TE>
<TE>   Millan's clientele includes the dogs of many actors and directors
(such as Ridley Scott, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Will Smith), as well as
some low-income dogs who've landed in shelters where their bad
behavior makes them impossible to place. The shelters send them to
him for rehabilitation so they can find homes. He charges private
clients $40 to $80 per day, depending on the dog's diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Koch, a lawyer for Los Angeles County, rescued Rusty, a
starving mixed-breed mutt that her sister had found. He was
aggressive, didn't like people he didn't know, couldn't get along
with the other two dogs in her home.</TE>
<TE>   "At the park, he would go nuts and try to attack strange dogs. We
got trainers for him, but that didn't work. We were desperate for
help."</TE>
<TE>   A friend told them about Millan, who came to their house. He
showed how to make Rusty more secure, through exercise and
discipline. "Basically, we had to demote all three of our dogs to
pack-member status, with my husband and I as their leaders. This
worked."</TE>
<TE>   They and their three dogs spent several sessions hiking with
Millan and his pack. "We saw a different Rusty start to emerge. He
began to relax, to walk with the other dogs. He wasn't fearful or
angry anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Millan, she says, "has a gift. I hate the word 'awesome,' but
that's what he is. He communicates across species without saying a
word. We wanted Rusty to live. He made that possible."</TE>

<DH>Karim Rashid and Pia Myrvold's Cybercouture line shuns

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--In an age of instant messaging and virtual reality, many
fashion designers are still living in the past. Between Marc Jacobs'
1950s coats, Diane von Furstenberg's Sandra Dee dance skirts and Zac
Posen's 1940s pinup dresses, few shows here this week did anything to
break fashion's nostalgic spell.</LD>
<LD>   But on Saturday, Karim Rashid, the product designer known for his
"Oh" chair and his ego, collaborated with Norwegian-born artist Pia
Myrvold to show a small collection called Cybercouture, featuring
some of the week's more forward-looking clothes.</LD>
<LD>   Presented at the Felissimo Design House, the line included
polyester Lycra mini-dresses in techno-inspired geometric patterns
designed and printed digitally; white denim skirts with zipper
pockets for cell phones and jackets with pouches on the back for MP3
players; neon pink polyester Lycra skirts and sexy cropped tops with
reflective silver seams; and easy-fitting black jackets covered with
Rashid's signature cross, circle and blob icons. Like the
customizable shoes on the Nike iD site, nikeid.nike.com, some pieces
can be made-to-measure with custom-print options at
www.cybercouture.com.</LD>
<TE>   "Style should speak about the day in which we live," Rashid said
earlier in the week at his Chelsea studio. "But instead of using the
Digital Age for creating originality, it's only being used in fashion
as a tool of efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Myrvold, who started out as a painter in Norway, has been
designing clothing for more than 10 years while also working in other
mediums, including the Internet, video, music and architecture. When
she had her first fashion show in Paris in 1992, her line was picked
up by Charivari, a now-defunct New York boutique known for stocking
conceptual designers such as Martin Margiela and Helmut Lang in the
1980s and '90s. Other shows followed, but she felt her work was never
understood, especially in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I had problems with journalists," she said. "I wanted to drive
fashion into the next revolution, and I was sitting in an environment
occupied with nostalgia."</TE>
<TE>   When Myrvold was invited to show in New York in February 2001,
Rashid was in the audience. "I liked her point of entry into fashion
from the perspective of an artist," said the designer, who had his
own clothing line in Canada, the Babel Fashion Collection, from 1985
to 1991. Rashid's role in Cybercouture was limited to creating
prints, but he is looking to launch a clothing line; Myrvold is
hoping to find other collaborators in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's show didn't draw any high-profile fashion magazine
editors, just friends, family and a handful of curious reporters.
Cathy Klima, an advertising executive tagging along with freelance
editor friend Sue Mutz, found the collection "futuristic but not over
the edge."</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like something they'd wear in L.A.," Mutz said. "At the
Mondrian."</TE>

<LD>How Do Hurricanes Get Their Names?</LD>
<LD>   Hurricane season is here. That means you are probably hearing
about severe weather systems that could turn into hurricanes. For
hundreds of years, big storms were named after saints' days. Later,
meteorologists used longitude and latitude positions to identify
them. But they realized first names were easier to use when tracking
bad weather, so they started using women's names. In 1979, they added
men's names to the lists.</LD>
<LD>   The World Meteorological Organization rotates among six name lists
for hurricanes. When a weather system starts turning
counter-clockwise and has wind speeds of 39 mph or greater, the
Tropical Prediction Center assigns the next name from the current
list in use. Thus, the 2002 list will be used again in 2008. Names of
hurricanes that have caused lots of damage or deaths are retired from
the lists.</LD>
<TE>   The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites have been
tracking severe storms for more than 25 years. TV weather broadcasts
use GOES data to show viewers what's happening. The satellites fly
high above the Earth. Scientists (and kids getting ready for school)
get an amazing look at intense weather systems.</TE>
<TE>   Two GOES satellites operate in "geostationary orbit." That means
they stay in roughly the same place above the Earth at all times.
GOES-East watches over North and South America and the Atlantic
Ocean. GOES-West observes North America and the Pacific Ocean.
Between the two satellites, they cover the entire Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   So, now that we are in the middle of hurricane season, look for
GOES images of the storms in the news. They'll be the ones with the
giant swirling clouds crawling across the ocean. You can also see if
any of the severe weather systems in the Atlantic are named after you
at kids.earth.nasa.gov/archive/hurricane/names.html. Those of you
named Quinn, Ursula, Xander, Yvonne or Zelda will be out of luck
though. They don't use the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z for major storms.

one spot on Earth, go to spaceplace.nasa.gov and click on "Dr. Marc's
Amazing Facts."</TE>

for some stuff. He gets some shampoo, toothpaste, face cream, nail
polish, hair remover, a dandruff cure, cleaning for false teeth, ant
spray, hair spray, pink plaster, lipstick and more. Finally he said,
"Done!"</TE>

<HD>Union Says Paper Won't Practice What It Preaches</HD>
<DH>Publisher of pro-labor LA Weekly says it 'wouldn't be
democratic' for ad staff to organize without a vote</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bitter dispute over unionizing the LA Weekly's advertising
department has deeply divided journalists and managers at the
traditionally pro-labor paper, leading some reporters there to
question the state of alternative journalism itself.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1989, the Weekly's 50-odd editorial employees have been
members of the International Assn. of Mahinists and Aerospace
Workers, a union the paper's original organizers chose because they
regarded the Newspaper Guild as insufficiently assertive. Last May,
members of the paper's advertising staff--concerned about escalating
sales targets, post-Sept. 11 layoffs and other job security
issues--petitioned to join their colleagues' local.</LD>
<LD>   Given the Weekly's unwavering editorial stance as a reportorial
champion and unapologetic political ally of organized labor,
employees were stunned when the paper's recently appointed publisher,
Beth Sestanovich, and her aides deployed every means at their
disposal to try to defeat the organizing campaign.</LD>
<TE>   As a consequence, this Friday's representational election is
deemed too close to call.</TE>
<TE>   "This began as an ugly situation and has gotten increasingly that
way," said writer Erin Aubry Kap- lan, who is president of the
Weekly's union local. "I assumed--naively, I now realize--that the
Weekly's management would never oppose union organizing. However,
they're truly fighting us tooth and nail. It has been very
disillusioning to people who assume the Weekly stands for the rights
of working men and women."</TE>
<TE>   But Sestanovich said, "We believe that when you look at the highly
individual and entrepreneurial work of advertising salespeople, union
representation just isn't in the interest of those employees. We
coexist with our existing union without friction, and I know that it
has surprised many of its members that we would contest extension of
their union. But I feel strongly that every employee has a right to
make a free and informed choice about this."</TE>
<TE>   David Schneiderman, president of New York-based Village Voice
Media, which owns the Weekly and five other so-called alternative
publications, did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Though labor-management relations at the Weekly have heretofore
been amiable, the recent situations at other Village Voice Media
properties have been different. Earlier this year, the Voice came
within 24 hours of a strike, and a contentious organizing effort was
defeated at the chain's Cleveland Free Times. (For the record, the
Los Angeles Times has no unionized employees and, for more than 100
years, has strenuously resisted any attempt at organization.)</TE>
<TE>   The Weekly, however, regards itself as Los Angeles' "progressive
bible." For many years, its labor reporting was the local gold
standard, and its leading political commentator--the indispensable
Harold Meyerson--played a leading role in chronicling the rise of
organized labor in Los Angeles and, particularly, its contribution to
Latinos' social and political progress.</TE>
<TE>   So it came as a shock when Weekly managers forced a
representational election by rejecting card check organizing, the
process by which a union is recognized if the majority of a
bargaining unit's members sign membership cards. Editorially, the
Weekly is one of the nation's strongest proponents of card check
organizing.</TE>
<TE>   Sestanovich said that she "insisted that there be an election
because it wouldn't be democratic or fair for me to assume
unilaterally that everyone in a bargaining unit wants to join the
union. I think each person should get the facts and decide according
to their conscience. I know that disappoints some people around here.
But while our editorial policy is pro-union, it also is
pro-democracy. Sometimes I think some people would say that our
editorial policy is anti-business. But I have no intention of
interfering with what our editorial employees write, even though we,
too, are a business."</TE>
<TE>   Sestanovich twice increased the size of the bargaining unit to
widen the pool of potential voters to 29. Employees were instructed
to attend mandatory meetings where--according to documents reviewed
by The Times--they were told that voting for the union would imperil
their existing pay and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In a note provided to The Times, Sestanovich told an advertising
employee who had requested a salary discussion that she was legally
precluded from talking about the issue until after the election. "If
the union becomes your collective bargaining representative, neither
the LA Weekly nor I will be in position to negotiate individually
with you about your compensation...." the publisher wrote. " ...
Assuming that the union isn't voted in, we can sit down promptly
afterward and be in a position to discuss directly with you the
status of your compensation."</TE>
<TE>   "It is the height of hypocrisy for this to go on," said Weekly
writer Howard Blume, who is the union local's vice president. "The
Weekly always has been associated with progressive politics and the
promotion of the union movement in general. This paper has written
article after article decrying the very union-busting tactics our
management now is employing within our own building. Without our
sense of social mission, this paper is nothing but an L.A. Magazine
that comes out once a week on inferior, ink-bleeding paper."</TE>
<TE>   Children of the 1960s' social ferment though they may be,
so-called alternative papers have in recent years become less and
less distinguishable from their conventional counterparts. Politics
and social activism have frequently been nudged aside to make way for
entertainment and soft-focus cultural journalism.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a major difference between many alternative weeklies and
their "straight" competitors now is the former's libertarian social
views, which enable their publishers to accept lifestyle and sexually
oriented advertising other media forgo. As a consequence, many
alternative publications are capitalist cash cows. The Weekly,
according to its staff members, has used cost-cutting and layoffs of
nonunion employees to maintain a profit margin of more than 20%--a
figure that would set even the eyes of Gannett Co. executives
aglitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I find this all very disillusioning and disheartening," said
Kaplan, the local president. "This has caused a lot of us to reassess
this paper. We're fine with our work, but our workplace has changed.
We journalists truly feel an obligation to support organized labor,
and if our paper doesn't, it raises questions about who we are."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Fintan O'Toole, who lives in Dublin, is the Irish Times' drama
critic. He is the author of numerous books, including a biography of
dramatist Richard Sheridan and, most recently, "Shakespeare Is Hard,
but So Is Life," which was just published in England:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm embarked on a big project, which I think will turn out to be
a series of books about Ireland and American popular culture. It's an
attempt to unwrap the origins of important American myths about
America. I have a notion that the sources of most influential
American myths are elsewhere because you are an immigrant culture and
that it might be valuable to start retelling some of those stories
from their 'elsewhere' of origin, if you will.</TE>
<TE>   "So, this first book is about a man called Sir William Johnston,
who was from a little village about 30 miles north of Dublin and who
went to what is now New York state in the 1730s and became an
Iroquois Indian. He was from a Catholic family that had married into
the Protestant gentry to hold on to their land--not an uncommon event
in Ireland at the time. His Protestant uncle had an interest in the
North American fur trade, and Johnston went over to help out. He
quickly established himself among the Iroquois because he traded
fairly, and he married into their Mohawk band, an advantageous
alliance, since they were essentially the middlemen in the great fur
trade. At the time, the Iroquois Confederation was a major North
American military and economic power, and dealing with it was a major
preoccupation of British diplomacy. Johnston became an incredibly
important figure in that process.</TE>
<TE>   "He built a great Georgian mansion not too far from Niagara. This
book will deal with his role as a conduit for the idea of the
wilderness as a thing to be exploited and civilized, and with the
romantic and heroic figure he became as a consequence. He was also a
very early example of what we've come to think of as American
multiculturalism--an Irish man who was made a British baronet and yet
thought of himself, at least some of the time, as an Iroquois, who
often wore their native dress. His is what we now think of as the
typical American story, one that has made American culture so
powerful around the world."</TE>

<LD>Every morning the students rushed to the back bulletin board to see
the current photo display about one of their classmates. Others
talked about their autobiography booklets.</LD>
<LD>   "My mom gave me loads of information about my family to add to
what I wrote yesterday," a girl claimed.</LD>
<LD>   A boy spoke up. "My dad wants me to include his experience in the
Marines."</LD>
<TE>   "When I told my family what we were doing in class, they all
pitched in to help," another boy added.</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda whispered across the aisle, "Those bigmouths. I didn't
mention a thing to my mom. Did you, Tonya?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, never," Tonya answered.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher stood in front of the class and announced, "I've
corrected the spelling and grammar mistakes for those of you who
handed in work yesterday. You may copy it in your notebook any time
you get a chance."</TE>
<TE>   "Does it have to be in ink?" a girl asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to you. It will certainly look nicer and last longer,"
the teacher responded.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we write about today?" everyone asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen to mine," the teacher said, starting to read hers. "In
kindergarten, I learned how to behave. While creating clay vases for
our mothers, I threw a clump of clay at a girl I didn't like. It
broke her vase. The teacher made me give her the dainty one I made. I
had to take her ugly one and glue it together. I was ashamed when I
had to hand it to my mother."</TE>
<TE>   The teacher then wrote on the board: "School Memories--each grade,
K-6, remembrances of teachers, class events, special friends,
favorite subjects, description of building and classroom, etc."</TE>
<TE>   "This I'll write about, especially some of the dumb teachers I had
and how they treated me," Rhonda said under her breath.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," agreed Tonya.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Rhonda's and Tonya's attitude ever change?</TE>

<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. While teaching, she joyfully
participated in writing projects with her students. As you can see,
she is still writing today and hopes her students are doing likewise.

<LD>Slash, former guitarist with Guns N' Roses, stood on the rooftop of
the Louis Vuitton shop in Beverly Hills on Monday night and let loose
with a rocking rendition of the "The Star-Spangled Banner." He then
tossed his pick down to a well-heeled and well-dressed crowd of 1,200
whose members forked over $1,000 per ticket to the fifth annual
"Jaguar's Tribute to Style on Rodeo Drive" fund-raiser.</LD>
<LD>   Before the evening event ended, with songs from Pauletta
Washington, wife of Denzel, Charles Veal Jr. and "American Idol's"
Kelly Clarkson, more than $750,000 (including $120,000 from a lively
auction) had been raised for the Entertainment Industry Foundation's
newly formed National Arts Education Initiative that will support
five Los Angeles area inner-city arts groups.</LD>
<LD>   "Honey, L.A. doesn't need a football team. We need a dance
academy. Tonight, it's all about the children and the arts," said
choreographer Debbie Allen as she kicked off the night's
entertainment with dance as the centerpiece. Allen's dance academy
troupe as well as the New York-based Complexion ensemble performed to
standing ovations.</LD>
<TE>   Guests gathered around long white tables set up by caterer Along
Came Mary for a Tuscan feast.</TE>
<TE>   Between bites, when they weren't chatting on cell phones,
comparing cell phones or borrowing cell phones, the guests listened
to operatic selections such as "Carmen" and "La Boheme" playing in
the background.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the night, the crowd mixed and mingled along
fashionable Rodeo, closed between Dayton and Brighton ways, as
participants sipped wine, window-shopped and viewed "Objets d'art," a
30-piece collection of one-of-a-kind evening gowns from Giorgio
Armani, Christian Dior and Badgley Mischka, jewelry totaling more
than 300 carats, vintage and historical items dating to the 1850s and
five pairs of shoes worn by Marilyn Monroe in the late 1950s. The
items will be displayed at stores on Rodeo for the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   As guests partied--women dressed in everything from sequined
cocktail dresses to blue jeans, stilettos and the latest Tod's bag;
men in dark business suits and everyone wearing a sleek Swatch watch
that served as the ticket for admittance--tourists gathered along
barricades snapping photographs of arriving and strolling celebrity
guests Angela Bassett, Lisa Kudrow, Kelsey Grammer, Macy Gray, John
Ritter, Jackie Collins, Marilu Henner and Jane Leeves, among others.
"I'm glad to be here tonight to support the cause," said Ritter, who
attended the Emmys at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday evening and
earlier Monday rehearsed for his new sitcom. "But I'm more glad to be
here when Rodeo Drive is shut down because I've always said that
Rodeo Drive has to be shut down," he cracked.</TE>
<TE>   Grammer, one of the evening's several celebrity co-hosts, joked
about the pronunciation of the word jaguar. "Ja-gu-aaar. Ja-guuu-ar,"
he repeated and then gave up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really about the children who have a natural relationship to
the arts," he said about the night's purpose and message.
"Unfortunately, a lot of kids today have never been to a play or a
museum, so tonight we are here to ensure that they will."</TE>
<TE>   The evening's beneficiaries included InnerSpark/California State
Summer School for the Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art, P.S.
Arts, Shakespeare Festival/L.A., and Teach for America.</TE>

Benjamin Netanyahu had breakfast with some Hollywood players. These
weren't his usual conservative hosts but mostly liberals, among them
TV legend Norman Lear, "Rock the Vote" co-founder and record
executive Jeff Ayeroff, and film director Jon Turteltaub.</LD>
<LD>   Most had paid $10,000 apiece for this sit-down, money that was to
seed a new Hollywood group seeking to somehow help Israel in the
court of public opinion.</LD>
<LD>   After listening to what some perceived as Netanyahu's right-wing
politicking, though, many were overwhelmed with the sense that Israel
was in desperate need of a distinctly Hollywood commodity: the public
relations blitz.</LD>
<TE>   There's hardly a cause in the world that isn't attempting to
harness Hollywood's star power to raise awareness and cash. Elizabeth
Taylor drew the limelight to the AIDS crisis, for example, and
Charlton Heston has become an advocate for the right to bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the question of Israel and whether to wholeheartedly embrace
its cause is posing a surprisingly provocative and uncomfortable
dilemma for many in the industry, all the more notable because the
movie business was founded by and is still well-populated by Jews.
It's one issue on which few are speaking out, rare in a town where
people spout off on almost every political concern from guns to
whales.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a puzzling silence," says Dan Gordon, screenwriter
of "The Hurricane" and a strong supporter of Israel. "We're in an
industry that takes stands on everything. People can't shut us up!
I'd love to see the indignation about homicide bombers that is
reserved for smokers. You smoke in this town, and you're dead. Rob
Reiner will come after you."</TE>
<TE>   Like Jews in many communities in America, Jews in Hollywood are
divided, from those who support Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
government to others who question his settlement policies or
commitment to the peace process but don't want to do so publicly for
fear of appearing anti-Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Jews elsewhere, though, those in Hollywood are in the hot
seat because of who they are and what they do. They also spring from
an industry with a history of ambivalence toward its heritage. And
though few in Hollywood are nervous about appearing pro-environment
or anti-smoking, there is trepidation about the unwelcome typecasting
that being unabashedly pro-Israel might bring. "One of the
stereotypes is that the Jews control the media," says David Brandes,
writer-producer of the 1991 film "The Quarrel." "A lot of Jews have
been intimidated unnecessarily because of the stereotype."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Jews in general know what to do, and Hollywood
knows even less what to do," journalist-turned-screenwriter Andrea
King says. "Jews in Hollywood have never been big flag-waving Jews to
begin with. If the Jewish community is struggling, then the Hollywood
community is paralyzed."</TE>
<TE>   Publicist Howard Bragman goes further: "It's easier to come out as
a gay in Hollywood than as a Jew. I'm frankly shocked at how many
people are in the closet about their Jewishness."</TE>
<TE>   Now a nascent effort, spearheaded by a mostly younger group of
rising players, is trying to challenge the status quo and galvanize
Hollywood's powerful communication machine.</TE>
<TE>   Unofficially spearheaded by Dan Adler, a 39-year old Creative
Artists agent who organized the Netanyahu breakfast, the effort,
dubbed Project Communicate, this fall will launch a marketing push on
college campuses. The idea is "to create defenders and advocates of
Israel," says Adler, the son of a Holocaust survivor whose group is
trying to navigate Hollywood's political divisions by adopting a
non-ideological stance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be pro-humanity and pro-solution, rather than
simply pro-Israel," he says. As for creating advocates and defenders
of Israel in Hollywood, that could be a unique challenge of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's consul general in L.A., Yuval Rotem, says he's made
dozens of phone calls trying to get a high-profile Hollywood figure
to visit Israel and so far has failed. "Ever since March, when we
lost 140 people in one month, which was the trigger for our incursion
into the territories, I've asked this question over and over again:
'Where have they been?' " Rotem says.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the movie industry's founding, many Jews in Hollywood
have had ambivalent feelings about their heritage. The founding
studio chiefs, primarily Jews, were leaders in the charge for
secularization and ultimately assimilation. According to Neal
Gabler's book "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented
Hollywood," they tended to compensate for their ethnicity, and rebuff
the anti-Semitism they faced, by promulgating an image of America as
a corn-fed, Midwestern, paternalistic utopia.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, with the exception of Holocaust-related films and
documentaries, it's not uncommon for projects to be dismissed as "too
Jewish." There have been few movies made about Israel, although David
Mamet is developing a project about the formation of the Israeli air
force, as is the production company run by director Robert Zemeckis
and Jack Rapke.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't identify with what's going on there. They're
Americans and interested in making movies and making money," says Zvi
Howard Rosenman, producer of such films as "The Family Man," who is
developing the air force movie with Zemeckis.</TE>
<TE>   "We are 60 years away from the Holocaust," says David Lonner, 40,
a partner at the talent agency Endeavor who also runs the
entertainment division of the Jewish Federation of L.A., a social
services charity. "And, obviously, out of the Holocaust, Israel was
born."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent fund-raising foray for the federation, Lonner
encountered at least one producer who was worried that the group's
money would go to the Israeli government. (It doesn't.) "Hollywood is
a community that's classically liberal and left-wing," Lonner says.
"Some people are uncomfortable with the Sharon government and their
policies and the government's view on the West Bank."</TE>
<TE>   Others point to the Democratic Party's lack of leadership on the
issue and to the absence of former President Bill Clinton. Some of
Hollywood's highest-profile players, such as Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg, made support of Clinton their primary mode of
political activism. They're not as involved in public life now that
George W. Bush is in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Other pro-Israel liberals say they feel isolated by the rightward
drift of the larger Jewish community and pressured to toe a strict,
unquestioning, Israel-right-or-wrong line, at least publicly. "I
think Israel is walking down a dangerous road if it doesn't get out
of the territories, but it's hard to say that in public," says one
writer, echoing several others.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberals are on the side of the underdog," says writer-director
Michael Tolkin, author of "The Player" and "Changing Lanes." "The
people who've had their cities turned into rubble look like the
underdog. There's embarrassment about being a Jew and a feeling of
alienation from the Jewish community, a fear that it's been taken
over by the right wing." At times, the left in Hollywood sounds as
anguished as the left in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing everybody shares is total depression and disappointment
over the peace process' failing," says Marge Tabankin, who runs both
Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation, which is devoted to
domestic Jewish causes, and the Streisand Foundation, which handles
actress Barbra Streisand's diverse charitable donations. Speaking
personally, she says, "I don't know where to put my heart and soul in
my volunteer time as a person who cares both about human rights and
the existence of the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. faces the prospect of war against Iraq, producer Sean
Daniel ("The Mummy") notes Israel's precarious position in the
region. If Iraq were to attack Israel, he says, "there would be an
outpouring."</TE>
<TE>   Running through every conversation is an unusual nervousness about
projecting private beliefs into the public arena.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear there's an assumption that the industry is dominated
by Jews and that the media industry is very powerful," adds attorney
Ken Hertz. "Unlike during the time of [late MCA Chairman] Lew
Wasserman, most of these are publicly traded companies, run by Jewish
executives who are not comfortable putting their own religious,
social or cultural affiliations on the company."</TE>
<TE>   Given the supercharged emotional nature of the debate (which is
being waged with heated passion particularly on the Internet), it's
not surprising that some fast-growing urban legends have sprung up,
including one about Jerry Seinfeld's supposedly embarking on a trip
to Israel. (A friend of his announced it in the Israeli press, but
the visit has not yet materialized.) Spielberg has been subject to a
hoax, an announcement sent to dozens of media outlets falsely
claiming that he was making a movie about Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Director Henry Jaglom, whose latest film is "Festival in Cannes,"
is part of the Hollywood crowd that finds itself drawn to the
Internet. Jaglom, who describes himself as a "progressive, pro-Israel
Zionist who's left-wing," became incensed after he received an e-mail
from a producer he barely knew, attacking Israel after the battles in
the Jenin refugee camp. He says she sent it to her 800 closest
friends, most of whom appear to be in the film business. "She started
it. Before that it was a trickle, and now it's torrential," says
Jaglom, who spends several hours a night e-mailing the 4,000 people
in his Israel address book.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Hollywood's boldface names, the people who dot
power lists and whose opinions galvanize the community, have not yet
publicly embraced the issue. Reiner, Katzenberg, Seinfeld, David
Geffen, Harvey Weinstein and Adam Sandler all declined to comment for
this article.</TE>
<TE>   According to their representatives, Geffen, Katzenberg, Streisand
and particularly Weinstein, a Miramax co-chairman, have donated money
to various Israel-in-crisis campaigns. Weinstein has been agitating
behind the scenes, meeting with former liberal Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and arranging for Abraham Foxman, head of the Anti-Defamation
League, to meet with "Life Is Beautiful" actor-director Roberto
Benigni to discuss ways to combat anti-Semitism in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg is one of the Hollywood elite most devoted to Jewish
causes. During the last decade, he spent his $62 million in profits
from 1993's "Schindler's List" on the Righteous Persons Foundation.
Spielberg declined to comment, although his representative, Marvin
Levy, noted that "Schindler's List" ends in Israel and adds, "I think
it should be obvious to people where his heart is." Recently Shimon
Peres, the liberal Israeli foreign minister, has requested a meeting
with Spielberg, pending the scheduling of Peres' next trip to the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   One top player who has been vocal and active is Paramount Chairman
Sherry Lansing. "I've always been pro-Israel," she says. "This is the
first time in my life that I have feared for the existence of
Israel."</TE>
<TE>   The highest-profile entertainment figure to visit Israel recently
has been Mamet, who went to the Jerusalem Film Festival this summer
and toured the sites of suicide bombings with Jerusalem's mayor.
Sandler planned to visit children in hospitals in Israel in August
but pulled out two days before he was supposed to leave because of
the bombing at Hebrew University, according to someone familiar with
his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who recently analyzed American
attitudes toward Israel (partly at the behest of Project
Communicate), believes that one person who could dramatically and
immediately affect public opinion is "West Wing" creator Aaron
Sorkin.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the ability to explain the Middle East situation in a
straightforward, unbiased fashion that will influence America," said
Luntz, once a consultant on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin declined to comment, but he did touch briefly on the
Mideast crisis in last year's season premiere. A schoolchild asks Rob
Lowe's character what you call a country where you can't go out for
pizza without getting blown up. Lowe answers grimly, "Israel."</TE>
<TE>   For the new young activists seeking to draw Hollywood into the
fray, the Wasserman legend hangs heavy. A nonobservant Jew, Wasserman
privately made sure that people opened their checkbooks. One
prominent member of the Jewish community recalls a planning meeting
for a Jewish charity dinner during the Wasserman heyday. The MCA
leader stood up, pointed to each studio chief or his representative,
and announced, "You're going to buy two tables. You're going to buy
three tables." Within 10 minutes, the event was sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Contemplating what it might take to galvanize the Hollywood elite,
Lonner sighs. "It takes a Lew Wasserman."</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, Project Communicate's activism looks much like
Rock the Vote's, which is focused on young people and draws wide
support.</TE>
<TE>   The 100 or so activists behind Project Communicate are mostly
newcomers to Jewish causes. They include Adler, Ayeroff, Bragman,
Lear and Lonner, as well as "Simpsons" writer Jay Kogen, William
Morris agent John Fogelman and Art Levitt, CEO of Fandango, a
movie-related Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the group hired Luntz to run a pair of focus groups
of college students, plumbing their attitudes about the image and
rhetoric from the Middle East crisis. The outcome was that "the
non-Jews were predominantly open to pro-Palestinian messages and the
Jews were utterly apathetic," recalls King, the writer, who attended.</TE>
<TE>   Project Communicate is using Luntz's research to focus its
marketing points, some of which the group hopes will be delivered by
high-profile Jewish celebrities, although specifics of the campaign
are under wraps.</TE>
<TE>   But even Hollywood's most persuasive communicators acknowledge how
hard it is to render the Mideast simple terms.</TE>
<TE>   As Tolkin sees it: "Everybody in Hollywood is obsessed with story
and used to thinking their way out of a plot. There's no obvious way
out of this. I don't know anyone who can get three paragraphs through
a discussion of the Middle East crisis without being struck mute."</TE>

<HD>Redemption Role</HD>
<DH>Michael Chiklis' surprise Emmy for his work in 'The Shield'
is the culmination of a personal and career transformation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-four hours after scoring the biggest upset of Sunday's Emmy
Awards, Michael Chiklis was still caught up in the ensuing whirlwind.</LD>
<LD>   The phone had not stopped ringing, the congratulatory food and
fruit baskets kept arriving at his front door, and Chiklis was still
overwhelmed by his win as outstanding lead actor in a drama series
for his role as a corrupt detective in FX's "The Shield."</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't had any time for reflection," Chiklis said during a
brief calm moment. "I know it's important. There's just been this
deluge of well-wishers and press and flowers and insanity. I hope
soon my wife and I will be able to sit down and say, 'Wow, what was
that?' "</LD>
<TE>   On one hand, that was Chiklis beating out such better-known and
popular competitors as Martin Sheen of "The West Wing," Kiefer
Sutherland of "24," and Michael C. Hall and Peter Krause of HBO's
acclaimed "Six Feet Under." The win was largely unexpected because
"The Shield" is on a basic cable network with relatively low
visibility. Although Chiklis' performance was almost universally
praised by critics, he was considered a longshot in the lead actor
division.</TE>
<TE>   That also represents a creative redemption for the formerly rotund
actor whose career has been marked by controversy and undistinguished
projects. Chiklis raised such ire in Hollywood when he took on his
first major role as comedian John Belushi in 1989's heavily panned
"Wired" that many honchos predicted he would never work again. He
played the balding, overweight title character in ABC's "The Commish"
and Curly in "The Three Stooges." His last series, NBC's "Daddio" was
yanked a few weeks into its second season.</TE>
<TE>   Depressed but determined to change the industry perception of him,
Chiklis underwent a mental and physical transformation, shedding
weight, bulking up and shaving his head. What came out of that
process was his portrayal of Det. Vic Mackey, which was hailed for
its ferocity and edginess. The character is heroic, but he displays a
deep, dark side. At the end of the pilot, he shoots one of his fellow
detectives in cold blood.</TE>
<TE>   Speculating on his Emmy triumph, Chiklis said he believes voters
were impressed by his character and his new look.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they saw the work, and how much work I had put in to
change myself," he said. "I know that Vic Mackey made a certain
impact. But coming off who they perceived me to be made that impact
greater. I mean, I'm 'The Commish.' I'm 'Daddio.' Fellow artists love
a transformation. We seldom get the opportunity to change ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   He said that with the demise of "Daddio," "I hit such a wall in my
life. And now I thank God for that low. That was the crossroads. I
just had this deep level of despair because I knew what I was capable
of doing.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife saw my desire, and told me that if I wanted to turn this
around, I had to change, mentally and physically. And not to take
another job until the right job came along. I told her, 'I make a
comfortable living, and it could get tough.' And she said, 'I will
sell this house and move into a hovel if I have to. But you need to
do this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Six months into losing weight, the actor tagged along with his
wife, Michelle, on a trip to pick up their child at a Gymboree class.
There he met "The Shield" creator Shawn Ryan, who was unfamiliar with
Chiklis' previous work. The two hit it off.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Chiklis said he took another look at the show's pilot.
"What I find myself saying is what a difference material makes," he
said. "And when you have this great cast around you, it makes all the
difference in the world. And it's so great to play a guy that's a
protagonist and an antagonist at the same time. It is a great role in
my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the pressure of the show's second season looms, enhanced by
Chiklis' Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to keep doing what we're doing," he said. "I
will remain true to this character, and not try to outdo it."</TE>
<TE>   He expects the Emmy glow to last for quite a while. He said he was
particularly touched by the reaction of the competitors in his
category to his win.</TE>
<TE>   "Martin and Kiefer were so awesome," he said. "I've just always
admired their work. And here comes Martin running up to me and says,
'Good for you, kid.' And Kiefer gives me this huge hug and is tearful
and says, 'I'm so thrilled that this happened to you.' It was just
one of the best things that's happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Shield" is shown at 11 p.m. Tuesdays on FX. The network is
currently running a "Shield" marathon, showing all of the first
season's episodes at 11 p.m. each night through Oct. 5. FX has rated
the show TV-MALSV (may be unsuitable for children under the age of
17, with advisories for coarse language, sex and violence).</TE>

<HD>'CSI: Miami' Attracts a Lot of Bodies, Helps CBS Win Night</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"CSI: Miami" looked as hot as the show's namesake in its debut
Monday--the first night of the new TV season--to pace CBS to a
clear-cut victory, according to viewing estimates released Tuesday by
Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   The "CSI" spinoff attracted more than 23 million viewers
nationally, the largest audience for a September dramatic premiere
since "ER" eight years ago. The show had more than twice as many
viewers as NBC's own forensic crime-solving series, "Crossing
Jordan," in the 10 p.m. slot.</LD>
<LD>   CBS also controlled the preceding hour with back-to-back new
episodes of "Everybody Loves Raymond," which averaged 23.7 million
viewers one night after three of its stars won Emmy Awards.</LD>
<TE>   The new "CSI" was strong locally as well. The show was watched in
roughly 665,000 homes--or 12.5% of those in the Los Angeles-Orange
County viewing area--from 10:30 to 11 p.m., compared with 180,000
tuned to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" on KABC-TV, helping KCBS-TV's
late news more than double the rating for KABC's "Eyewitness News" at
11 p.m. while finishing just behind KNBC-TV's newscast.</TE>
<TE>   KCBS' good news didn't extend into late night: NBC's "Tonight Show
With Jay Leno" dominated with an L.A.-area audience of roughly
270,000 homes, compared with just over 100,000 for "Late Show With
David Letterman," like "Raymond" an Emmy winner on Sunday.</TE>

<DH>A Broadway veteran has a whale of a good time as Pseudolus
in South Bay Cities CLO's refreshingly silly staging of 'A Funny
Thing Happened.'</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inspired by the plays of Plautus, the comic archetypes in "A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," book by Burt Shevelove and
Larry Gelbart, music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, have been around
for more than 2,000 years and counting. There's the tricky slave, the
philandering lecher, the virago wife, the vainglorious hero, and of
course, the starry-eyed young lovers separated by circumstance who
must be reunited by means fair, foul and hilarious.</LD>
<LD>   The show was first produced on Broadway in 1962 and filmed in
1966. Both versions starred the indelible Zero Mostel as Pseudolus,
the conniving slave whose contrivances fuel the pratfalling plot. A
Broadway revival in 1996, starring Nathan Lane and later Whoopi
Goldberg, established the sheer durability of this classically
inspired burlesque.</LD>
<LD>   Any production of "Forum" rises or falls with the actor who plays
Pseudolus. The play's current production, presented by the Civic
Light Opera of South Bay Cities at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts
Center, fortunately features Bob Amaral in this central, crucial
role.</LD>
<TE>   A Broadway vet, Amaral understudied Lane and Goldberg in the
Broadway revival before taking over the role late in the run. The
wily Amaral knows better than to emulate Mostel's mugging or Lane's
archness. Surprisingly subdued in his opening monologue, he prefers
to sneak up behind you, metaphorically speaking, before walloping you
in the back of the head with his strong voice and solid comic timing.
A laid-back Pseudolus, Amaral takes his time, but he gets the job
done, and he has a whale of a time doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran stage and television director Will Mackenzie directs with
a fine ear and a firm hand, ably abetted by musical director Steven
Smith, who also conducts the full-sounding CLO orchestra.
Choreographer Sha Newman, a South Bay stalwart, does a particularly
noteworthy job with the bumping, grinding courtesans who are the
show's requisite eye candy.</TE>
<TE>   For all its broadness, "Forum" requires formidable finesse. If the
actors oversell the humor, their goose--or, in this case, rubber
chicken--is cooked. Fortunately, this talented assemblage of Broadway
and regional theater veterans keeps the action refreshingly silly,
never strident or overplayed.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if there is a problem with this particular production,
it's that the performances are so crisp, clean and well-timed, they
sometimes border on the lifeless. That's not to say that this isn't
an excellent cast, but a shade more throwaway goofiness is in order.</TE>
<TE>   As Senex, the drooling libertine of the piece, Kevin Cooney
delivers an exacting yet deceptively offhanded performance in just
the right tone. Like Amaral, he's having fun with his role--and his
delight is infectious.</TE>

<HD>Facing Temptation</HD>
<DH>Movies* In 'Elysian Fields,' George Hickenlooper draws on a
little personal experience for the tale of a writer in career
purgatory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GREENBERG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a week before shooting was scheduled to start on "The Man From
Elysian Fields," and the pivotal role of Luther Fox, proprietor of
the Elysian Fields male escort service, had not yet been cast.
Director George Hickenlooper was in the thick of pre-production chaos
when he got a call from London, where it was 4 a.m. Mick Jagger was
on the line.</LD>
<LD>   "I really like the script, really like the characters," he told
Hickenlooper. "Why don't we have dinner on Saturday and talk about
it?" "I was like, 'Oh, yes, sir, I'd love to have dinner,' "
Hickenlooper recalls. "He said he'll be in Venice on holiday. I'm
thinking Venice, California, please. But, no, it was Venice, Italy.
So in the midst of everything, I get on a plane the next day and meet
Mick at his villa."</LD>
<LD>   "There he was, kind of bewildered on the Bridge of Sighs," recalls
an amused Jagger. "I've been to Europe many times," adds
Hickenlooper, "but it was the first time I flew there for dinner."</LD>
<TE>   Things like that had a way of working out on "Elysian Fields,"
which opens Friday. When initial financing fell through, Gold Circle,
the company that produced "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," stepped in with
the film's $6.5-million budget. "This is one of those movies that
fulfilled its destiny the way you would like," says the film's star
and producer, Andy Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia plays Byron Tiller, a struggling novelist living in
Pasadena with his wife (Julianna Margulies) and baby son. When his
second book gets rejected, he becomes desperate and is seduced into
the escort trade by Jagger. The Faustian bargain leads Byron to an
affair with the wife of literary giant Tobias Allcott (James Coburn),
and a collaboration that exploits his talent and threatens his
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Selling out to temptation was a theme Hickenlooper knew something
about. After establishing his reputation as a documentary director
with "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse" (1991), he made
four features, including most recently "The Big Brass Ring" (1999),
based on a script originally written by Orson Welles. Hickenlooper
was married at 21, but with success in Hollywood his marriage came
apart.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a trap we can all fall into," he says. "I was surrounded by
all kinds of hip celebrities, and one night I was at a party at a
very famous producer's house and all the people around me were doing
recreational drugs. I felt like I was in a room with vampires and I
was going to end up a vampire; I thought I was going to end up locked
in purgatory forever."</TE>
<TE>   Hickenlooper can go on at great length about Hollywood and its
discontents, chief among them the postmodern cynicism that he
believes has poisoned young filmmakers. Encouraged by distributors,
he says, they have sacrificed real human emotion for edginess and
hipness.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain level of kitsch where the writer or director
is winking at the audience, and that kind of detachment hasn't really
helped narrative storytelling move forward very far. I'm not
suggesting we all make Douglas Sirk or George Stevens melodramas, but
I'm saying we should make films that are emotionally honest."</TE>
<TE>   When Hickenlooper read the script for "Elysian Fields," he had
just reconciled with his wife after four years, so the story had
personal resonance for him. "I was never a male escort but I did the
whole Hollywood scene, so I could certainly relate to an escort on a
metaphorical level," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Hickenlooper tried to bring as much of himself to the character of
Byron, the struggling novelist, as he could. In collaboration with
Garcia and screenwriter Philip Lasker, he decided to move the setting
from New York to Pasadena, where he lived in a Craftsman cottage not
unlike Byron's. Byron's office in an old building in Hollywood is
modeled after the director's; even the interior clutter was copied.</TE>
<TE>   The screenplay had already gone through some serious revisions by
the time Hickenlooper was hired. "The script was initially a lot
darker and more graphic in its sexuality," Garcia says. "I thought it
needed to be more elegant. You're dealing with a protagonist who is
doing something immoral, so you're walking a thin line as to where
the audience is going to abandon the film."</TE>
<TE>   Hickenlooper wanted to humanize the story. He saw it as a fable of
Byron's descent into hell and his redemption. (Elysian Fields is a
refuge in Hades for the virtuous in Virgil's "Aeneid.") "There is
something otherworldly about the story yet the human emotion is
grounded in reality," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Even Jagger's devilish Luther has become a sympathetic figure,
unlike his defiant Lucifer of the '60s. "In my eternal optimism, I
wanted to believe there was even salvation for the devil in our
postmodern world," cracks Hickenlooper.</TE>
<TE>   Jagger's Luther is a weathered and weary English dandy. He took
the role, in part, because he liked the idea of wearing a suit. ("He
certainly didn't do it for the money," Garcia says.) "I told him this
was not about his rock 'n' roll persona," Hickenlooper says. "I made
it very clear that this was about bringing it way down and
internalizing everything."</TE>
<TE>   With such a short time to prepare, Jagger grabbed what he could
from his own experience and people he knew (he won't say who). When
he showed up for his three-week stint, he realized that Luther should
have a girlfriend to make him more vulnerable, unlike a George
Sanders-type character who's always in control. He recruited old
friend Anjelica Huston to play a longtime client he's in love with.
In one of the film's most striking scenes, he proposes to her to and
she laughs at him.</TE>
<TE>   "He becomes a rather sad figure when he makes the mistake of
thinking she's going to marry him. I don't have a lot of experience
proposing to people and being turned down, but you got to use your
imagination," says Jagger, laughing at the irony.</TE>
<TE>   While the prospect of playing an aging Lothario discouraged more
established actors (Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and Jeremy Irons
passed on the part), Jagger had no problem with it. He brought the
suggestion of decadence to the role simply based on who he is. It's
intriguing to imagine his character as a descendant of the debauched
rock star he plays in the 1970 film "Performance." "His mythology was
a gamble that paid off," Hickenlooper says. "His iconography could
have taken you out of the movie but it works."</TE>
<TE>   The film may strike some as old-fashioned in its storytelling and
traditional moral values, but Hickenlooper says, "If the idea that a
man could get back together with his wife is old-fashioned, then
civilization is in a lot of trouble."</TE>

<HD>Facing Another Culture Clash</HD>
<DH>Theater* Best known as part of a comedy trio, Herbert
Siguenza goes solo in an attempt to finally give Cantinflas crossover
success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Actor Herbert Siguenza is leaning over a narrow counter in a
backstage dressing room, coming face to face with himself in the
mirror. The comedian is 43, balding, lumpy around the middle, and
about to take on the role of a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   This is opening night for "eforeCantinflas!"--a new play about the
renowned Mexican funnyman written and performed by Siguenza, who is
taking a leave from the Los Angeles-based, satirical comedy trio
Culture Clash. In less than an hour, he'll make his solo debut at his
hometown's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, performing for the first
time without his comedic cohorts of 18 years. His partners, Richard
Montoya and Ric Salinas, at this moment are in Washington, D.C., for
the latest Culture Clash production, which Siguenza co-wrote but
which is going on without him.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really scary for me to carry a show on my own," Siguenza
says. "Since I don't have the other two guys, the whole weight is on
me now."</LD>
<TE>   And Siguenza didn't make it easy on himself by taking on a
veritable legend. Cantinflas is a classic of Mexican cinema, a
comedic character as identified with the mestizo nation as Woody
Allen is with New York.</TE>
<TE>   Created by the late actor Mario Moreno, the Cantinflas character
captured the dreams and frustrations of the working-class everyman,
the humble shoeshine boy who stood up to corrupt politicians, the
uneducated street urchin who could talk his way out of any
predicament with a torrent of words that sounded highfalutin enough
to confuse his adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas has been called the Mexican Charlie Chaplin, but his
appeal is not relegated to some silent-film memory. He remains as
relevant to Mexicans today as he was in his heyday of the 1940s and
'50s. As lovable as Red Skelton's Freddie the Freeloader, as witty
and outrageous as Groucho Marx's Captain Spaulding, as gracefully
slapstick as Jackie Gleason's Ralph Cramden, Mario Moreno's
Cantinflas had no peers in the annals of Mexican comedy.</TE>
<TE>   The character's appeal knew no borders in the Spanish-speaking
world, resonating naturally with Siguenza's Salvadoran mother, for
example, who attended the debut in a sequined dress.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas attracted Siguenza's attention for his human qualities:
"for being good and being moral and being upright and never letting
things get you down and being happy with what you have."</TE>
<TE>   Siguenza prepared for more than two years for this moment. He
watched Cantinflas movies until early hours of the morning. He
studied the Mexican comedian's quirky gestures, nervous as a
hummingbird, agile as a bullfighter. He dissected his Spanish speech
pattern, so uniquely nonsensical that it earned a place in the
dictionary. Cantinflando, we learn in Siguenza's clever, biographical
script, means to talk a lot while saying very little.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Siguenza looks nothing at all like the character
he's about to re-create--Cantinflas' wily and noble tramp called "El
Peladito." That's what makes his imminent transformation all the more
amazing. Calmly, the actor applies his own makeup. He accentuates the
comical Cantinflas mustache, two pathetic patches at the sides of the
mouth. He puts on the baggy, low-slung trousers, barely held up with
a rope for a belt. He dons a disheveled wig on his shaved head, then
finally puts on the cockeyed, undersized hat that was a trademark of
Mexico's most beloved movie character.</TE>
<TE>   "Cantinflas was never a victim," Siguenza says of the persona he
has come to inhabit so well. "He was smarter than the rich guy. He
would outwit society. And he was never exploited. In all of his
movies, he would fight, fight, fight."</TE>
<TE>   American audiences knew Cantinflas best as Passepartout, the
bumbling but resourceful valet of David Niven's aristocratic Phileas
Fogg in the Oscar-winning 1956 movie, "Around the World in Eighty
Days." The film, which earned Moreno one of two career Golden Globe
awards, marks the opening of Act II in Siguenza's two-act, almost
two-hour tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas starred in only one other English-language film, the
disappointing "Pepe" in 1960. In Siguenza's play, an aging Moreno,
who had become a fabulously wealthy and well-connected celebrity,
reminisces with a female reporter about the pain of his unrealized
Hollywood dreams.</TE>
<TE>   His main problem was the language, he says in English to the
admiring foreign journalist. His comedy, so grounded in double
meanings, flowery excesses and deliberate misunderstandings, was too
hard to translate.</TE>
<TE>   To prove the point, Siguenza's Moreno does a brief Groucho
impersonation in Spanish, using a famous line ("That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard") that falls flat in translation.
"See, it doesn't work," admits the dejected old comedian.</TE>
<TE>   Honored in His Language</TE>
<TE>   Language is also a big issue for Siguenza's bilingual drama, which
includes long segments in Spanish. In fact, Siguenza re-creates skits
word for word, and sometimes move for move, from some of Cantinflas'
51 movies, such as his breakthrough 1940 classic, "Ahi Esta el
Detalle," which roughly translates as "There's the Rub."</TE>
<TE>   To understand these extended passages, high school Spanish classes
were of no use to the many non-Latinos at opening night last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep wanting a little more English," one man was overheard to
say during intermission. "But then it's like, 'Get over it.' I love
just watching him."</TE>
<TE>   The man turned out to be John R. Killacky, executive director of
the arts center here that helped develop and produce the Cantinflas
project. The play was first conceived by Siguenza shortly after
Moreno's death in Mexico in 1993, but it wasn't realized until his
residency at Yerba Buena two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Killacky said the heavy use of Spanish became a
topic of discussion among the arts center's staff. Some questioned
whether more English would help bring the monolingual half of the
audience along. Others supported Siguenza's choice of preserving his
character's original dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't we have the man we're honoring and the language that he
spoke?" Killacky concluded. "If we're really going to be a
multicultural institution, let's go with it."</TE>
<TE>   In an early draft of the script, Siguenza played a nerdy professor
using a Power Point program to trace Cantinflas' career from his
beginnings with traveling tent shows, or carpas, to his final film in
1982, "El Barrendero" (The Street Sweeper). In the play's final
version, the journalist is a more effective device suggested by
director Max Ferra, founding director of New York's INTAR Hispanic
American Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   It's Not Americanized</TE>
<TE>   Backstage with his supporting cast after the show (which continues
here through Sunday), Siguenza is obviously pleased with the debut.
The script works, he declares, so he has no intention of changing it.</TE>
<TE>   "And he remembered his lines!" beamed his new wife, Adriana, a
high-spirited Glendale schoolteacher who serves as the actor's
live-in critic. Memorizing the long Cantinflas dialogue was extremely
difficult, the couple recalled over lunch the following day at a
favorite Market Street restaurant. The sentences are so fast,
disjointed and illogical.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a conscious decision not to translate it," Siguenza says,
"because I wanted to re-create his bits--how he sounded, how he
dressed. I didn't want to Americanize it."</TE>
<TE>   That's the "militant side of me," Siguenza says, arguing that
people never demand to have Italian operas translated. Should an
artist's work be preserved and respected only when it's considered
high art? "My attitude is, 'No!' " asserts the actor, surprisingly
serious and low-key off stage. "This is the way it is. And it has
just as much validity."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one of the most memorable moments in the play is a
skit that Siguenza translated into English--"for the culturally
impaired," as his Cantinflas character cracks. The scene, about an
incompetent carpenter who creates a crooked coffin with a zipper for
the deceased, is from the film "El Analfabeto" (The Illiterate One).
Although not as inspired as the Spanish, Siguenza's English wordplays
and well-placed colloquialisms give a remarkably good impression of
what Cantinflas comedy was all about. For that moment, Siguenza's
bilingual skills overcome the language barrier that stunted the U.S.
aspirations of Mexico's comedic icon.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to prove that maybe he could have done it," he says.</TE>

<HD>No Need for Doc-- 'MDs' Is DOA</HD>
<DH>ABC's lowbrow series is a klutzy 'MASH' wannabe that fails
miserably in its attempts to mix comedy and drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC's new "MDs" delivers early, with Dr. Robert Dalgety (John Hannah)
having vibrating beeper sex (skip the details) with a female on the
rooftop of Mission General Hospital in San Francisco, then leading
rounds.</LD>
<LD>   It epitomizes a lowbrow hour so terminally afflicted with cliches
and bungled attempts to mingle comedy and syrupy drama that it pulls
its own plug well before the premiere's ending credits.</LD>
<LD>   Its 10 p.m. hospital rival on CBS, the new "Presidio Med," is a
pill itself, but at least more watchable than this unpleasant number
that follows the bittersweet escapades of Scottish Dalgety, the
incoming general trauma surgeon, and Dr. Bruce Kellerman (William
Fichtner), head of cardio-thoracic surgery.</LD>
<TE>   With Dalgety and the biking Kellerman stamped as rule-breaking but
caring renegades who get it together and come through brilliantly in
the clutch, "MDs" is clearly going for "MASH's" Hawkeye and Trapper
John.</TE>
<TE>   There's a hint of Hot Lips in the tsk-tsking of the HMO-run
hospital's new administrator, Shelly Pangborn (Leslie Stefanson), who
last ran an amusement park and faints at the sight of blood. And much
more in Nurse Poole (Jane Lynch), a snide management fink who
champions profits over patients.</TE>
<TE>   As for "MDs" even approaching the dark, layered brilliance of
"MASH," however, lots of luck. The target here is a fat one that's
always available. Big medical institutions have been satirized as
unwieldy, dehumanizing bureaucracies from "The Hospital," a 1971
movie written by Paddy Chayefsky, to NBC's funny second-season comedy
"Scrubs." But the hybridizing in "MDs"--Kellerman wisecracking one
moment and appearing almost suicidal the next moment near where
Dalgety had his beeper action, for example--is klutzy, the mixture of
tones strident. And crises are resolved with smug, self-satisfied
glibness.</TE>
<TE>   After Dalgety and Kellerman ignore hospital policy to save a
patient, naive new intern Maggie Yang (Michaela Conlin) sees them as
gods and says: "You guys are really inspiring." Only if the script
says so.</TE>
<TE>   "MDs" will be shown at 10 p.m. Wednesdays on ABC. The network has
rated it TV-14DS (may be unsuitable for children under the age of 14,
with advisories for suggestive dialogue and sex).</TE>

<HD>From 1973 Jamaican Cult Film to Broadway?</HD>
<DH>Theater* 'The Harder They Come,' reggae's 'Rocky Horror,'
could become a stage musical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS JONES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>TREASURE BEACH, Jamaica</DL>
<LD>A storm had knocked out the power in this remote and inaccessible
corner of southwest Jamaica, a place where the sands are gray, the
August seas stormy, the roads often unpaved and tourists few and far
between at any time of the year.</LD>
<LD>   So the group of men sitting around the outdoor table at a strange
place called Jake's--a collection of rental shacks on a blustery
cliff top designed to appeal to those with a taste for complete and
unpampered isolation--were talking and drinking by candlelight as the
sea pounded just a few feet away.</LD>
<LD>   But in the flicker of the light, a few of the faces looked
strangely familiar.</LD>
<TE>   And unless the crashing surf was playing tricks with the sound, it
sure sounded like they were talking about writing a Broadway musical.</TE>
<TE>   The power suddenly came back on, illuminating the face of Trevor
Rhone, inarguably Jamaica's best-known playwright. The author of
about 20 plays, Rhone is widely studied in college courses on
post-colonial literature. His play "Smile Orange" played widely in
England and Jamaica, and he was feted with one of the so-called
Living Legend awards by the National Black Theatre Festival at its
regular meeting in Winston-Salem, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Although he wrote the screenplay to the movie "Milk and Honey,"
Rhone's career was made about 30 years ago, when he wrote the
screenplay to "The Harder They Come," the low-budget but phenomenally
successful 1973 movie that introduced countless young Americans to
the talents of a young singer called Jimmy Cliff and the pleasures of
a then-largely unknown musical form called reggae.</TE>
<TE>   "The Harder They Come" was produced and directed by Perry Henzell,
a white Jamaican, but long the major force in Jamaica's tiny film
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Henzell pretty much invented Jamaica's film industry (as
well as its mainstream tourist industry), since there had never been
a hit Jamaican movie before 1973. Come to think of it, the list
thereafter also has been pretty short.</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough, it was the bearded, balding Henzell who was
sitting across the table from Rhone.</TE>
<TE>   By now, a visitor's interest was well and truly piqued.</TE>
<TE>   But who was the third man--far younger than the aging Henzell and
Rhone--at the table?</TE>
<TE>   He had to face some intrusive questions from a reporter who first
identified himself, but he generously revealed himself to be a Los
Angeles novelist named Michael Guinzburg, the author of "Beam Me Up,
Scotty," a darkly comic novel with a hero who's a recovering drug
addict.</TE>
<TE>   Had Guinzburg been in this part of Jamaica long?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he allowed, "several weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Work or pleasure?</TE>
<TE>   "Work."</TE>
<TE>   "You must have come here to write," the visitor says.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I had this idea," Guinzburg said. "We're all turning
'The Harder They Come' into a Broadway musical."</TE>
<TE>   Ah.</TE>
<TE>   "The Harder They Come" told the story of a young, would-be singer
played by the effervescent Cliff. After being exploited by his record
label and abused by racist capitalist forces, Cliff's character
became a cop-killing drug dealer but also a popular folk hero. In the
1970s, audiences at scores of campus movie houses in the United
States embraced the film as a timely musical parable of political
revolution, told with Henzell's signature irreverence and joie de
vivre.</TE>
<TE>   Especially beloved of those who went to college in Boston, the
film broke all records and ran for years at the now-defunct Orson
Welles Cinemas in Cambridge, Mass. Although viewed by many critics as
a rough-and-ready affair, it enjoyed almost as many midnight showings
around the country as "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."</TE>
<TE>   And from "You Can Get It If You Really Want" to "Sitting in
Limbo," many of the songs in the movie became hits, ultimately paving
the way for another young reggae singer named Bob Marley, whom
Henzell first began to visit and nurture while researching the movie.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Rhone is talking. "Michael came to us with the idea for
the musical," says the playwright. "And so here we all are. We're
doing a session every day."</TE>
<TE>   "We always knew the triumph of capitalism would be ugly," says
Henzell, rocking back in his chair and muttering about the evils of
American foreign policy. "But we never knew it was going to be this
hideous. People are ready again for 'The Harder They Come.' "</TE>
<TE>   "The score," says Guinzburg, "is unbelievable. It's hit after hit
after hit."</TE>
<TE>   So is the plan just to put the movie on stage?</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," Henzell says, eyes flashing. "Movies are all about
realism. On stage, you can do anything you want, and realism is
death. We're all going to have to let go of the movie as much as we
can."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Guinzburg says that he doesn't want to talk about
business details, since the final deal has not yet been inked. But he
has clearly talked to many of the major Broadway players.</TE>
<TE>   But Ginsburg's idea seems golden--at a time when staged versions
of camp musicals such as "Hairspray" and "The Producers" are the most
popular shows in New York--and here he is in Jamaica, putting these
old collaborators and musical revolutionaries together, coaxing out a
script and making it happen.</TE>

<HD>It's Not HBO; It's TV That's Different</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television folk like to point out that theirs is a truly democratic
medium, in the sense that anyone can vote daily via the remote
control--no butterfly ballots required.</LD>
<LD>   The corollary of this is that everyone feels qualified to opine
about TV, especially when an event rolls around like Sunday's Emmy
Awards--a showcase inviting media outlets that don't regularly stoop
to acknowledge television to discover it, as if that box in their
living rooms suddenly sprouted a head and began demanding attention.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the angle many casual observers have
awakened to is that HBO--a pay cable channel--wins a lot of awards.</LD>
<LD>   What is it about HBO, these drive-by aficionados of pop culture
want to know? Is it the language? The nudity? The bada they add to
their bing that the Jurassic old broadcast networks--knuckling under
to advertisers--can't? And what's wrong with those networks, anyway,
which don't dominate ratings or awards as they once did?</LD>
<TE>   Others proffer conspiracy theories, among them whether HBO somehow
hypnotizes easily manipulated members of the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences--the people who select Emmy winners--with glitzy
premieres, slick ad campaigns and mantle-worthy packaging of its
videotapes. (Based on this assumption, academy voters should begin
craving Taco Bell--you want a Burrito Supreme--any second now.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet like most things TV-related these days, finding answers isn't
simple, and even posing the question--pitting pay TV against "free,
over-the-air networks"--warrants a bit of explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Like the song says, nobody rides for free, and increasingly,
nobody watches TV that way either. Only about one in five U.S.
households currently gets television free in the no-cable,
no-satellite-dish sense of the term. As a result, even the free
networks aren't really, especially for those who subscribe to cable
or buy a dish in part to obtain decent reception of broadcast
signals.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, all of those networks have a vested interest in cable.
So if you're not tuned to CBS, the network's parent company, Viacom,
still wins if you watch Nickelodeon, MTV, TNN, BET or Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   From that perspective, the market share for the networks can
dwindle--which shouldn't be unexpected when most people receive
80-plus channels--while the aggregate reach of the few companies that
own them, thanks to consolidation of ownership, remains largely
undiminished.</TE>
<TE>   As for the perceived worth of the major networks, one need only
see the way people react when deprived of them--as Time Warner
subscribers were a few years ago when the cable operator briefly
dropped ABC in the midst of a contractual spat--to gauge the value
people attach to favorite programs.</TE>
<TE>   We're not accustomed to thinking this way, but what would viewers
pay if told that was the only way they could see this week's season
premieres of NBC's "The West Wing," "ER" and "Friends"? Would they
part with a few bucks a month if that was the only way to continue
their weekly fix of CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," "Survivor"
and "Everybody Loves Raymond"? Maybe even ante up for ABC's "Alias"
to see Jennifer Garner look pensive?</TE>
<TE>   This isn't meant to take anything away from HBO, which, in
baseball parlance, has a batting average that would put it in the
hall of fame.</TE>
<TE>   It's also fair to say this has relatively little to do with
language and nudity, or Showtime--the pork of premium television, as
in "the other pay channel"--would be up to its eyeballs in glittering
paperweights too.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the major networks play a very different game, operating
under a business model that requires them to churn out a higher
volume of original programming and amass the widest audience, viewing
awards and critical adulation as a bonus, not an end in itself.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, HBO's marketing strategy involves creating a drumbeat
any sentient creature would be hard-pressed to miss--a siren song
that says those not anteing up for the channel risk being mocked and
ridiculed if they draw a blank expression when "Curb Your Enthusiasm"
or "Six Feet Under" are referenced at catered parties and pricey
piano bars.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, HBO has brilliantly tapped into the snobbery that
exists vis-a-vis television, positioning itself between feature films
(the ones that aspire to win Oscars, not mollify teenage boys) and
TV--a medium elitists normally admit to watching only when the surf
is about to wash away their beach house or a raging brush fire
threatens to consume their hillside retreat.</TE>
<TE>   The channel's slogan, "It's not TV. It's HBO," reinforces this
image. You can almost hear the refrain above the clinking wine
glasses: "TV? Oh, heavens no, I don't watch TV. I do love 'The
Sopranos,' though."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps foremost, being a subscription service affords HBO the
luxury of being able to patch together a programming quilt to satisfy
customers, rather than aspire to be all things to all
(demographically desirable) people, as the broadcast networks do.
Under this formula, it's fine if mostly women watch "Sex and the
City," teens view a Britney Spears concert, men catch the De La
Hoya-Vargas fight, lonely men stay up late for "G-String Divas," and
pretty much all of them watch "The Sopranos"--just as long as they
keep dutifully subscribing.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, it's actually remarkable that one broadcast
network, NBC, continues to pace the HBO juggernaut, tying for the
most awards at this year's Emmys. Although the networks bluster and
moan about cable's encroachment in this arena, they can't ignore our
award-obsessed culture, as the allure of seeing stars communicate
without a script causes new made-for-TV events to keep springing up
like weeds.</TE>
<TE>   All that's missing, in fact, is an annual telecast honoring the
best in award shows. Some proposed categories: Most irreverent: MTV
Video Music. Most popular: Oscars. Best dressed: Tonys. Least
dressed: (tie) Grammys and Latin Grammys. Most Neurotic Presenting
Body: Screen Actors Guild.</TE>
<TE>   So HBO is right when the channel asserts that it's not TV in the
conventional sense. What TV-watchers-come-lately overlook is that if
your point of reference is the world baby boomers grew up in, when
three networks towered above all, then TV isn't really TV anymore,
either.</TE>

<LD>   Settlement Reached in 'Silence' Case</LD>
<LD>   What price silence?</LD>
<TE>   Six figures--as British musician Mike Batt found out when he
included a minute devoid of sound on "Classical Graffiti," the latest
album by his rock group, the Planets.</TE>
<TE>   Batt agreed Monday to pay an undisclosed sum to the John Cage
Trust, after publishers of the late American composer sued him for
compensation, claiming he had plagiarized Cage's 1952 composition,
"4'33"," which was totally silent. Batt's piece, "A One Minute
Silence," had been credited to Batt/Cage.</TE>
<TE>   Batt has registered copyrights for 4 minutes and 32 seconds of
silence and 4 minutes and 34 seconds of silence. ("If there's ever a
Cage performance where they come in a second shorter or longer, then
it's mine," he told the New Yorker.)</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Riddle, managing director of Cage's publishers, Peters
Edition, who accepted the check, said they were prepared to defend
the concept of a silent piece because it was a valuable artistic
concept with a copyright.</TE>
<TE>   Guilty Plea in Death of Betty Blowtorch Singer</TE>
<TE>   An Illinois man has pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in the
death of L.A. rocker Bianca Halstead, 36, the lead singer for the
female punk band Betty Blowtorch.</TE>
<TE>   Brian McAllister, 34, told a Louisiana court that he was driving
about 100 mph when the incident occurred on Dec. 15. Sideswiping
another car as he was changing lanes, he skidded across the median
and hit a vehicle driven by Colorado resident Robert Fenkel, who has
been confined to a wheelchair ever since. McAllister's car then hit a
pole, cutting his Corvette in two. Halstead, an acquaintance of his,
was in the passenger seat.</TE>
<TE>   McAllister, whose blood alcohol count was measured as .12, wasn't
hurt in the crash. He could get up to 20 years for Halstead's death
and five for Fenkel's injury. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13.</TE>

<TE>   'Sopranos' Question: Was It Inappropriate?</TE>
<TE>   A Miss America judge was wrong to ask Alicia Renee Luciano, Miss
New Jersey, about her views on "The Sopranos" during the interview
segment of Saturday night's pageant in New York City, the contestant
and some Italian American groups said.</TE>
<TE>   The HBO drama focuses on fictional mob boss Tony Soprano as he
juggles organized crime and his family life in suburban New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Luciano, 19, answered that people shouldn't take TV shows
seriously, and that good parenting should offset violence on the
tube. "It was a question that I don't think they would ask of anyone,
other than someone with my background," she told the Daily Record of
Parsippany. N.J. "I wasn't expecting that. Everyone else was getting
questions about how they felt about performance dance and the arts."</TE>
<TE>   Several Italian American groups agreed that the question was
insensitive and insulting to Luciano. Miss America officials could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is turbulence on the Miss Universe front, too:
For the first time in its 52-year history, the reigning title-holder
has been given the boot. Russia's Oxana Fedorova, the first woman
from that country to win the crown, was replaced by Panama's Justine
Pasek.</TE>
<TE>   Pageant spokeswoman Mary Hillard McMIllan said Fedorova "was not
able to fulfill her obligations and her responsibilities," which
included global travel to speak on AIDS awareness. "Being at home was
more important for her," she explained.</TE>

<TE>   More Films to be Saved From Extinction</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-eight films, languishing unseen and forgotten in archives
nationwide, will be the beneficiaries of grants from the National
Film Preservation Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: Duane Kubo's 1976 documentary on the cultural scene in
Los Angeles' Little Tokyo; home movies made by dance luminary
Katherine Dunham in Haiti in 1936; a film clandestinely shot by an
American in 1920s Soviet Russia; a backstage view of opera baritone
Richard Bonelli during the 1930s; a 1973 documentary about the
construction of the World Trade Center; and a student performance by
Ben Vereen.</TE>

reports, a sales pace second only to "The Lion King".... Former First
Lady Nancy Reagan will discuss her husband Ronald Reagan's battle
with Alzheimer's disease on the season premiere of CBS' "60 Minutes
II" at 8 tonight.... Ridley Scott, who just won an Emmy for HBO's
"The Gathering Storm," is embarking on a second TV movie about
Winston Churchill, focusing on his years as prime minister, to be
followed by another dealing with the post-war years.... Paramount
Pictures is developing an updated version of the 1958 Elvis Presley
film "King Creole," the story of a New Orleans dishwasher who gets
the chance to perform for a night. No star has been announced.... R&amp;B
singer Usher will play Marvin Gaye in an episode of NBC's new series
"American Dreams".... ABC is developing a pilot for an hourlong drama
based on John Grisham's bestseller "The Street Lawyer," the tale of
an attorney who leaves a big corporate firm to work for a legal-aid
clinic.... Country singer Merle Haggard, 65, has called off 11
concerts this month because of four herniated discs in his back.</TE>

<HD>'Saturday Night' Shows Sondheim's Roots</HD>
<DH>Shelved for decades, it retains its exuberance in a Musical
Theatre Guild concert performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The buoyant glow of youthful exuberance irradiates Stephen Sondheim
and Julius J. Epstein's "Saturday Night." And if Monday night's
Pasadena Playhouse performance launching Musical Theatre Guild's
seventh season of rarified musicals in concert was representative,
this near-50-year-old charm show won't stay rarified much longer.</LD>
<LD>   In 1955, the adaptation of Epstein's play "Front Porch in
Flatbush" (co-written with twin brother Philip G. Epstein, as was
"Casablanca") was to have been 24-year-old composer-lyricist
Sondheim's first Broadway musical. But after producer Lemuel Ayers'
tragic death canceled the production, "Saturday Night" languished
largely unrealized.</LD>
<LD>   Sondheim finally resurrected it in 1997 in London. A 1999 staging
at Chicago's Pegasus Theatre was followed by an off-Broadway
production in 2000, with Monday's performance marking its local
premiere.</LD>
<TE>   Spanning three consecutive Saturdays in the spring of 1929, the
plot follows ambitious Wall Street runner Gene Gorman (Noel Orput),
whose fellow Flatbush bachelors (Brian McDonald, Richard Israel, Tom
McMahon and James Cooper) establish their priorities in the winning
title number: "I like the Sunday Times all right--but not in bed /
Alive and alone on a Saturday night is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Married pair Celeste (Eydie Alyson) and Hank (Kevin McMahon)
complicate the dating equation by introducing Mildred (Shauna Markey)
to the lascivious porch-sitters. Youngest crony Bobby (Reed Prescott)
boasts of his conquests, but he's not altogether convincing.</TE>
<TE>   More successful at camouflage is Gene, his upper-crust aspirations
driving Epstein's old-fashioned boys-and-girls-together scenario.
After crashing a Plaza Hotel party, Gene meets the pragmatic heroine,
Helen (the marvelous Kim Huber), her Southern-fried accent disguising
her own Brooklyn origins.</TE>
<TE>   Further synopsis would only evoke dizziness. Suffice it to say
that, amid complications blending screwball and sentiment, Gene
abandons his hollow ambitions by evening's end.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein's solid book cleanly motivates Sondheim's uniformly
wonderful songs, their wholehearted accessibility belying the usual
charges of emotional distance and melodic deficiency while
anticipating the future mastery of deconstruction and pastiche.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly describes the Act 1 closer, "One Wonderful Day,"
with its initial lift of Leonard Bernstein's "Christopher Street"
vamp from "Wonderful Town" blossoming into a rocketing group number
recalling Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane at their peak.</TE>
<TE>   Similar craftsmanship graces Bobby's "Exhibit A," an instructional
guide to seduction approaching Frank Loesser; and the Hank-Celeste
duet "I Remember That," which presages "I Remember It Well" from
"Gigi." On Monday night, these guileless pleasures were well-served
by director Michael Michetti, musical director Nick DeGregorio,
wardrobe designer Peter A. Lovello and choreographer Lee Martino, as
well as by the whole cast. Included among their number were Melissa
Fahn, Michael Lorre, Chuck Bergman, Doug Ballard, Gerrard Carter,
Yvette Tucker and the scene-stealing cameos of Joshua Finkel and
Kathryn Skatula.</TE>
<TE>   Given the limited rehearsal time, any occasional fluffed lines,
blurred harmonies or microphone feedback seemed immaterial in the
face of such joyous moxie. My chief complaint with "Saturday Night"
was that it ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night" will repeat at Thousand Oaks Performing Arts
Center, 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Oct. 20, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Good news, America: Bernie Mac is back.</LD>
<LD>   After last week's snoozer of a season opener, in which the kids
were all but absent, some might have wondered if the sitcom's rookie
success last year was a fluke.</LD>
<LD>   Fear not: In tonight's episode, "The Bernie Mac Show" returns to
the crux of its comedy: the big rascal's bombastic, original take on
parenting.</LD>
<TE>   And none too soon: In his new time slot at 8 p.m. on Fox, Bernie
squares off against the season premieres of Damon Wayans'
family-oriented sitcom, "My Wife and Kids," on ABC and the quirky
comedy-drama "Ed" on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   As fans know, "Bernie Mac" chronicles the misadventures of an
upscale couple, Bernie and Wanda (Kellita Smith), suddenly thrust
into surrogate parenthood for two nieces and a nephew. At the Emmy
Awards on Sunday, the series was honored for best comedy writing.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's episode, little Bryana (Dee Dee Davis) loses her
beloved doll Precious after a day at the beach, so Bernie undertakes
a midnight odyssey to retrieve it. Eventually he succeeds, but he
tries desperately to wean Bryana from the doll to avoid a replay.</TE>
<TE>   When reasoning fails--and doesn't it always?--Bernie's patience
wears thin. In a priceless bit, he begs for sympathy from the
audience with a subtitled diatribe drowned out by Bryana's crying.
When Bernie decides to take drastic measures, the plot cleverly
spoofs several movie classics. Jordan (Jeremy Suarez) secretly agrees
to do away with his sister's doll, banking a favor from Uncle Bernie
in "The Godfather" tradition. But let's just say that Precious proves
to be as resilient as a villain in a horror film.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, "The Bernie Mac Show" may quickly put a scare into
its new competition.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a trying season, ABC closed the 2001-2002 broadcast year with a
rare ratings victory, fueled by "Monday Night Football," the "Miss
America" pageant, and previews of its Tuesday comedies "8 Simple
Rules" and "Life With Bonnie," based on viewing estimates issued
Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Last week saw a mix of series premieres and reruns in advance of
the new TV season that officially began Monday, as CBS' latest
"Survivor" capitalized on a "Friends" rerun to top all programs and
help lift "Big Brother 3" to its biggest audience of the summer. The
question is how well the fifth edition of "Survivor" will hold up
against new "Friends" episodes, which start Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   NBC also received a boost from the Emmy Awards, which delivered
the ceremony's second-biggest audience of the last six years. The
telecast faced HBO's "The Sopranos," which averaged 11.2 million
viewers--a drop of 2.2 million versus its record-setting
fourth-season premiere the week before.</LD>
<TE>   The bronze medal went to the WB, with the two-hour season premiere
of "Charmed," on its new night, playing against the Emmys and posting
the network's highest ratings ever for a Sunday--a night where the WB
has traditionally struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Fox introduced four series, scoring the best results relative to
the time period with "John Doe," its most-watched Friday premiere in
five years.</TE>

<LD>Some might argue that change is the sine qua non of musical artistry,
but Rush fans might contend that predictable output yields greater
rewards.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 30 years, the Canadian trio has delivered reliable
musical product to its fans, a silent minority that can still pack
large arenas, as evidenced by Monday's near-sellout at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   What's Rush's secret? Convincing heavy-metal fans that they can
still rock out and feel virtuous about it.</LD>
<TE>   The band's sound was always a pastiche--Led Zeppelin's tuneful
wallop, Yes' odd time signatures and sci-fi narratives--but Rush has
now claimed the territory all to itself. Rush fans cherish the band
because it has not wavered from that original mandate.</TE>
<TE>   The performance at Staples was cryogenically sealed and expertly
executed, a triumph of technical mastery like computer graphics or
cinematic special effects. Guitarist Alex Lifeson pounded metal
chordage and picked speedy solos, drummer Neil Peart (arguably the
star of this band) reeled off tricky tom fills and depth-charge
bass-drum patterns, and bassist Geddy Lee sang in his soprano yelp
while roaming all over his fingerboard.</TE>
<TE>   Old songs such as "Tom Sawyer" and "2112" got the biggest
receptions, but the crowd endured new material as if doing penance
for the hits. An outsider might have chafed at the redundancy and
sheer silliness of it all, but Rush is a band that exists for
initiates.</TE>
<TE>   Innovation is for other people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rush plays Saturday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, 8808 Irvine
Center Drive, Irvine, 7:30 p.m. $31.75 to $91.75. (949) 855-8096.</TE>

<LD>Voting technology--George Skelton's Capitol Journal column in the
Sept. 12 California section said that voters approved a $200-million
bond issue "to move California into touch-screen voting by 2004."
Although many counties plan to use the money for that purpose, it
also could be used for other voting technologies.</LD>

<HD>Disney Board Endorses Steps to Turn Company Around</HD>
<DH>Media: At a closely watched meeting, two members are added
to the company's governance committee in an attempt to boost investor
confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an unusually pointed five-hour board meeting Tuesday, Walt
Disney Co. directors unanimously approved a series of measures aimed
at turning around the entertainment giant and restoring investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   The vote followed what sources described as a blunt meeting during
which Chief Executive Michael Eisner was repeatedly questioned about
whether he could meet a series of financial targets, especially over
the next year. Eisner is encountering mounting pressure from
shareholders and a small but influential group of directors to boost
Disney's sagging earnings and stock price. Chief among them are Vice
Chairman Roy E. Disney and his chief lieutenant, Stanley P. Gold.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the disquiet among some directors, Tuesday's vote on a
long-range strategy for each Disney division suggests that, for now,
Eisner still enjoys the board's backing. Although directors had been
expected to raise the issue of a succession plan for Eisner, the
company would not comment on whether the subject was addressed. A
spokesmen for Roy Disney and Gold also declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   While details of the much-anticipated meeting at Disney's Burbank
headquarters remained mostly under wraps, sources close to the board
said Eisner and President Robert Iger presented a detailed plan to
rejuvenate the company's divisions, including the ABC television
network. The executives outlined plans to develop shows beyond the
current season, a key concern of the board.</TE>
<TE>   The current season that started this week is seen as something of
a watershed for ABC and Eisner's management. The network's prime-time
viewership plunged more than 20% last season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Disney executives presented a plan to broaden ongoing
companywide cost-cutting efforts amid the soft economy that has
especially hurt Disney's theme park business. Disney has already
squeezed $500 million in cost savings in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the board also discussed ongoing efforts to revamp
its corporate governance to address long-standing criticisms from
shareholders that the board is unwilling to challenge Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney has been living on borrowed time with this issue," said
media analyst David Miller of Sanders Morris Harris Group. "Now that
it's fashionable to talk about corporate governance issues, the folks
at Disney know what they have to do and to their credit they're doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Among the specifics announced Tuesday was a decision to add two
existing board members to its governance committee, Judith Estrin,
chief of the technology company Packet Design, and Monica Lozano,
president of Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion, and electing
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell to co-chair the committee with Gold.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has vowed to shrink its board from 16 members to possibly
as few as 12 and redefine what constitutes an "independent" director.
Several long-serving board members may step down as a result of the
changes, including Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we furthered our commitment to ensure that Disney remains
among the most progressive boards in America on governance issues,"
Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock closed at $14.75, down 32 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange, before the company's announcement.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Sell Water Business, Sources Say</HD>
<DH>Media: Firm is expected to announce today that it is
severing last ties with its historic core assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou is expected to announce
today that the company will sever its last ties to its historic core
assets and move forward as the world's second-largest media company,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said Fourtou will announce at a board meeting today in
Paris that he plans to slowly sell off the firm's minority stake in
Vivendi Environnement, the 145-year-old water-and-sewer business.
Former Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Marie Messier was in the
process of transforming the European utility into a media
conglomerate when he was ousted this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Fourtou also will signal plans to keep a minority stake in the
French telecommunications company Cegetel, with an eye to buying
control of that company sometime in the future. Separately, he will
detail about $10 billion worth of non-core assets he plans to sell to
resolve the company's cash crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement, coming after months of wide-ranging speculation
about the future direction of Vivendi, reflects the company's
reality. Since Vivendi bought Universal Studios and Universal Music
Group in 2000, entertainment has dominated operations.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou's declaration also is a recognition that the depressed
market for media properties precludes selling the assets for anything
near what Vivendi paid for them two years ago. Although several
buyers, including Viacom Inc., News Corp. and General Electric Co.,
have expressed interest, they have been looking to take advantage of
a company in the throes of a cash crisis with more than $30 billion
in debt, Wall Street sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to focus Vivendi on its media assets raises as many
questions as it answers, said Michael Nathanson, a European media
analyst with Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co. "What are they going to do with
what they are keeping?" he said, noting that Fourtou has yet to
explain how Vivendi will regain the 80% of its market value lost in
the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has yet to resolve its market dissonance. As a French
company operating under French accounting rules, Vivendi will never
realize a premium market valuation--even if it is a U.S. media
powerhouse, according to Nathanson.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi needs to take the next step and spin off a portion of the
entertainment company in an American public offering if officials
hope to get that proper market valuation, he said. "It's just a
question of when. And whether they add someone else's assets in with
it as well."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, moving forward in its efforts to trim its $19 billion
in media-related debt, Vivendi has received three bids for Vivendi
Universal Publishing, some as high as $3.4 billion--but still less
than the $4 billion Vivendi had hoped to see.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still good news," Bernstein's Nathanson said.</TE>
<TE>   The company bought Boston-based Houghton Mifflin Co., publishers
of American Heritage Dictionary and the "Curious George" series, last
year for $2.2 billion. Vivendi's publishing unit also includes French
educational publishers Nathan and Bordas, dictionary publishers
Larousse and Le Robert, and fiction publishers Robert-Laffont and
Plon-Perrin.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have valued the unit as high as $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Carlyle Group Inc. and Steven
Rattner's Quadrangle Group are among the bidders.</TE>
<TE>   The French buyout firm Eurazeo is leading a group that includes
Carlyle and Credit Agricole. KKR's Group is led by BNP Paribas and
includes Apax Partners, Bain Capital, Blackstone Group, Thomas H. Lee
Partners and Goldman Sachs. Lagardere, France's second-largest media
company, and Quadrangle made the third offer.</TE>
<TE>   None of the parties involved in the bids would comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Seek Additional Aid From Congress</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Carriers tell lawmakers the industry will be near
ruin if the government doesn't help reduce security costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CRAWLEY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The debt-ridden U.S. airline industry will be near ruin if the
government does not help it reduce insurance costs, taxes and other
expenses related to aviation security, the chief executive of the
world's biggest carrier warned Congress on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Without relief, our efforts to control our own costs will likely
be futile," Donald Carty, chairman and CEO of AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, told the House aviation subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   He also warned that any U.S. war with Iraq was a "financially
chilling" prospect because of the potential for sharply higher fuel
costs and weaker demand that would magnify the effect of other
financial problems.</LD>
<TE>   "Such an event really would put a financial burden on this
industry that would inevitably sink several carriers," Carty said.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways Group Inc. is in bankruptcy protection, and UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines may go that route this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines received a $15-billion bailout from Congress last year in
the form of cash and loan guarantees to recoup losses from the Sept.
11 hijack attacks and the subsequent shutdown of the nation's
commercial aviation system.</TE>
<TE>   Leading House Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they would
work quickly to fashion an aid bill on some of the industry's
money-saving proposals. Similar legislation also is taking shape in
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Airline shares continued their slide Tuesday on fears of higher
fuel prices and the dire industry warnings coming from Capitol Hill.
Shares of AMR closed down 62 cents, or 15%, to $3.60. Continental
Airlines declined 83 cents, or 14%, to $4.92. Delta Air Lines dropped
$1.24, or 11%, to $10.06. UAL fell 22 cents, or 9%, to $2.12, all on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes, war-risk liability insurance, unfunded mandates for
aircraft security upgrades and other costs have had a devastating
effect on the bottom line at many big airlines, Delta CEO Leo Mullin
told lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of aviation security in terms of direct expenses and lost
revenue will total about $4 billion in 2002, he said. The figure
could account for 35% of the industry's pretax operating losses this
year, Mullin added.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the government has paid more than $6 billion since
the Sept. 11 attacks to overhaul aviation security, including new
passenger and baggage screening operations at 429 airports.</TE>
<TE>   The industry, arguing aviation security should be a function of
national security, asked Congress on Tuesday to eliminate the
security tax of up to $10 per round trip assessed on tickets last
spring. Airlines say they are unable to pass along the cost of the
security fee to customers because of high costs and price pressures
from discount carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Major airlines lost $7.7 billion last year, and Wall Street
estimates they could lose $5.7 billion to $7 billion in 2002 and as
much as $3.3 billion in 2003. Many big airlines have taken on
enormous debt just to survive, Carty said.</TE>
<TE>   Mullin said security delays, which he calls the "hassle factor,"
have driven air passengers away, especially on trips of 300 miles or
less. "We are losing it to a brand-new competitor, the automobile."</TE>

<LD>After waging a public war against the world's biggest record company
for nearly two years, rock star Courtney Love is expected to settle
her lawsuit in a pact that may be announced as soon as today, sources
said.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the deal, Love is expected to be released from her
contract with Vivendi Universal's  music group and receive a
multimillion-dollar advance on anticipated future sales of releases
by Nirvana, the band fronted by Love's late husband Kurt Cobain, the
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Love created anxiety throughout the music industry last year when
she filed the lawsuit, designed to radically alter the way record
labels do business and release her band, Hole, from its contract with
Universal's Geffen Records division.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for Love and Universal declined to comment on the

<HD>UCLA Forecasters Predict Weak Growth</HD>
<DH>Economy: A second recessionary dip is unlikely and
near-term outlook is relatively upbeat, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA forecasters predict anemic economic growth well into 2003 as the
state and nation continue their slow recovery from last year's
downturn. But they say a second recessionary dip is unlikely despite
a spate of gloomy news that has sent Wall Street reeling of late.</LD>
<LD>   War jitters, slumping leading indicators and a decline in consumer
confidence have heightened concerns that the recovery is stagnating.
Investors have responded by fleeing stocks and seeking the haven of
bonds, driving down both stock prices and bond yields. But Edward E.
Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, which is releasing
its quarterly economic projections today, said the near-term outlook
isn't as bleak as investor behavior would suggest. He said recoveries
are seldom smooth and that some negative data are to be expected
along the way.</LD>
<LD>   Barring any dramatic shocks, he expects the U.S. economy to grow
2.3% this year and 2.7% next year. Growth in California, typically
measured by nonfarm payroll employment, is expected to advance a
modest 1.5% in 2003. That's lackluster expansion compared with the
boom years, but it's expansion nonetheless.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a story of disappointing growth, but it's not the story
of a dip," Leamer said. "It's not as bad as Wall Street thinks."</TE>
<TE>   The first in the nation to predict the 2001 recession and among
the most downbeat about the strength of the recovery, UCLA
forecasters aren't known for their unbridled optimism. They remain
quite pessimistic about the prospects of a quick rebound in business
spending, whose decline pulled the economy into recession. Leamer
said Tuesday's action by the Federal Reserve to leave its benchmark
federal funds rate unchanged signals its willingness to keep the
consumer pump primed. The downside, Leamer said, is that today's low
interest rates are having the effect of stealing sales that might
otherwise have occurred in 2003 or 2004 as consumers rush to take
advantage of low-rate mortgages and no-interest auto financing.
Although those purchases are propping up the economy today, Leamer
said their inevitable slowdown will keep a lid on economic growth
going forward.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the rest of the nation, consumer spending in
California has remained weak despite interest rate incentives.
Taxable sales declined 0.7% in 2001 and are projected to decline an
additional 1.1% this year, according to the UCLA forecast. The
culprits are the technology meltdown and stock market crash that have
put a huge dent in the income derived from capital gains, stock
options and bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA forecasters don't see any quick turnaround in the state's
hard-hit tech sector. Continued job losses in the Bay Area will lead
to a 0.2% decline in nonfarm payroll jobs in California this year.
Unemployment, expected to average 6.4% this year, is projected to
increase to 6.5% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Even Southern California is experiencing puny employment gains.
UCLA forecasters project continued weakness in manufacturing and
construction. Bright spots include a surge in container traffic
through the region's ports, while travel and tourism have made a
strong comeback since the steep downturn after last year's terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's real estate market has continued to
sizzle.In Los Angeles County, for example, the median sales price for
a single-family home hit $286,000 in July, a 17% increase from a year
ago. Meanwhile, growth in rents in the area has been slowing. The
UCLA forecast said that's a sign that housing prices are "moving into
worrisome territory" but are still far from the overheated levels of
the early '90s.</TE>

<HD>Lifeguard HMO to Shut Down by End of Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lifeguard Inc. of San Jose, one of a few remaining regional health
maintenance organizations in the state, will shut down by year-end,
California HMO regulators said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   State officials earlier this month took control of Lifeguard,
which has 168,000 members, after the 25-year-old health plan failed
to meet financial requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Lifeguard's demise, which analysts attributed partly to huge
losses from its California Public Employees' Retirement System
account, will continue the consolidation in the HMO industry.</LD>
<TE>   By year's end, California will have 17 HMOs writing commercial
policies, down from 21 in March, according to Cattaneo &amp; Stroud Inc.,
a health-care consultant in Burlingame, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, that translates to fewer choices, and signals
further decline in HMO membership. By Cattaneo's surveys,
California's HMO enrollment shrank by 640,000 between March 2001 and
March this year, with most of the major HMOs, excluding Kaiser
Permanente, reporting drops.</TE>
<TE>   Many HMO dropouts apparently are switching to less-restrictive
preferred provider organizations, or PPOs.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguard's members are expected to shift to other health plans
offered by employers, which include IBM Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.
and the city of San Jose. Lifeguard was well regarded by consumers
and doctors but had neither negotiating power nor the resources to
compete.</TE>
<TE>   When Lifeguard's attempt to merge with Blue Shield broke down this
summer, Lifeguard had nowhere to go, said Rick Shaw, an assistant
vice president at the rating firm A.M. Best Co. He said a major
factor behind Lifeguard's collapse was significant losses from
thousands of CalPERS members, whose medical claims far exceeded
Lifeguard's premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguard lost $24 million last year. The HMO dropped CalPERS this
year.</TE>

<HD>FDA Panel Backs Approval of Iressa</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The cancer drug developed by AstraZeneca
gets support despite debate over its effectiveness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Tuesday recommended
approval for an AstraZeneca cancer medication that agency reviewers
had criticized for showing only "hints of drug activity."</LD>
<LD>   Shares of AstraZeneca and its closest rivals soared after the
panel of outside experts voted 11 to 3 to endorse Iressa. The FDA is
not required to take the advice of its experts, but frequently does
so.</LD>
<LD>   AstraZeneca said it hopes to receive approval for Iressa soon so
the lung cancer treatment could be on the market by the end of the
year. It would be the first of a new class of drugs that works by
targeting the molecular switches that regulate tumor growth.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's vote was taken as an expression of confidence in the
category of drugs that inhibit a protein called EGFR without the
side-effects of chemotherapy. The protein is present in many cancers
and analysts have predicted that total sales of so-called EGFR
inhibitors could measured in the billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But a series of setbacks this year caused some to wonder whether
the new class was much of a breakthrough. First came the meltdown of
ImClone Systems and its experimental treatment Erbitux, which the FDA
refused to review.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, AstraZeneca disclosed that Iressa failed to help newly
diagnosed lung cancer patients when it was used in combination with
chemotherapy during a so-called first-line trial. The results cast
doubt on whether the FDA would approve Iressa as a drug of last
resort, a third-line treatment for patients who do not benefit from
chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Pazdur, director of oncology drug products for the FDA,
the top cancer drug regulator, told the panel Tuesday that the poor
results in the first-line trial threw "a tremendous monkey wrench" in
the process.</TE>
<TE>   But John T. Carpenter, a panelist and professor of medicine at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, argued that the failure of
Iressa to work with chemotherapy did not mean the drug was not
useful.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells us there is no advantage in adding the drug to chemo,"
Carpenter said.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca presented evidence that showed that the drug shrank
tumors in about 10% of patients who did not improve on chemotherapy.
Iressa relieved symptoms such as shortness of breath and coughing in
40% of patients with advanced lung cancer, according to the company's
data.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, in its negative review of the drug, said the study was
not well-controlled and that patients had a slow-growing cancer and
did not represent a typical cross-section of lung cancer patients.
And some panelists questioned the extent to which Iressa relieved
coughing and other symptoms, since patients reported a just a modest
two-point improvement on a 28-point scale.</TE>
<TE>   But the panel, during a seven-hour meeting near Washington,
nonetheless accepted evidence that Iressa appeared to benefit some
patients with otherwise untreatable cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten percent is pretty substantial," said Donna Przepiorka, chair
of the advisory panel and a University of Tennessee oncologist. "I've
never seen a lung cancer patient whose cancer went away by itself.
Very clearly there are patients whose cancer went away with Iressa."</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates said the vote underscored the gulf between the
FDA and the oncology community and the need for reforms at the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA needs to find a way to get these drugs more quickly to
people who have run out of options," said patient advocate Frank
Burroughs. "We are not seeing that they have the best interest of the
cancer patient in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs is president of the Abigail Alliance, named for his
daughter, Abigail Burroughs, who tried to obtain Iressa before she
died last year.</TE>
<TE>   Before voting, experts heard testimony from cancer patients who
had extraordinary recoveries on Iressa. One patient, a 20-year-old
whose disease had spread from her lung to her brain, said she has no
sign of cancer today.</TE>
<TE>   Another patient, Susan Nelson, a schoolteacher who lives in
Perris, said that before Iressa she had been told a heart and lung
transplant offered her only chance for survival. After a year on the
drug, her tumors have shrunk 95%.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that today's deliberations were a vote of confidence in
Iressa and confidence in the clinical benefits that patients are
seeing in the drug," said Mary Lynn Carver, a spokeswoman for
London-based AstraZeneca.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Goddard, chief executive of OSI Pharmaceuticals, which is
developing a competing drug, said the vote was an endorsement of EGFR
inhibitors. "What came out of the panel discussions," he said, "is
that there is a high level of enthusiasm for this class of drug. That
is what carried the day for AstraZeneca with a fairly mixed bag of
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   In trading Tuesday, shares of AstraZeneca rose $1.24 to $30.64 on
the New York Stock Exchange. ImClone Systems soared 30% to $7.96, up
$1.85 on Nasdaq. OSI, which is developing its drug with Genentech,
rose to $16.73, up $3.64, on Nasdaq. Abgenix, which is developing a
drug with Amgen, rose to $6.81, up $1.02, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor talks between West Coast dockworkers and shipping lines
followed a familiar pattern of promise and disappointment Tuesday as
negotiators tried to hammer out an agreement on the thorniest issue
on the table--the introduction of labor-saving technology at port
terminals.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the group representing shipping lines said sporadic
slowdowns were reported at ports along the coast, and warned that it
remained willing to lock union workers out of the ports if they
persisted. The union denied its members were intentionally slowing
work, but said that congestion at ports because of high volume was
causing delays.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union,
which represents 10,500 dockworkers on the U.S. coast, and the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which is bargaining on behalf of transpacific
shipping lines and terminal operators, said Monday that they appeared
close to introducing labor-saving technology to the docks--a key
obstacle to a contract.</LD>
<TE>   But the deal evaporated at a meeting Tuesday, a PMA official said,
when it became clear that the union and shipping lines understood the
agreement differently.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA reported slowdowns in Tacoma, Wash., Portland, Ore., and
Port Hueneme in Ventura County. The union issued a news release
Tuesday insisting that the alleged slowdowns were caused by a record
volume of cargo.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rite Aid Corp. said its second-quarter loss narrowed as the drugstore
chain reduced costs and increased sales of prescription drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of $105.3 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $245.9 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 4.5%
to $3.86 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Rite Aid benefited from lower interest payments after reducing
debt last year following an accounting scandal under previous
management that forced the company to erase $1 billion in profit in
fiscal 1998 and 1999. Rite Aid boosted sales of allergy drugs and cut
costs by slowing expansion, trimming inventories and decreasing
theft.</LD>

<LD>Japan's economic activity grew in July, defying forecasts that it had
run out of steam after a stronger-than-expected second quarter, the
government said.</LD>
<LD>   The all-industries index, widely regarded as an indicator of gross
domestic product, rose by 0.2% in July from the previous month on a
seasonally adjusted basis, building on a 0.2% gain in the three
months to June.</LD>
<LD>   The July figures showed Japan's economy had yet to stall after
clawing out of its longest postwar recession during the second
quarter.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Health-maintenance organizations that withhold poor performance
ratings are distorting results of a system that compares the quality
of U.S. health-care plans, researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   A review found that a quarter to a half of health plans that gave
their scores to the National Committee for Quality Assurance in the
late 1990s didn't make them public the next year. Those with the
worst rankings were as much as five times more likely to withhold
results the following year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's misleading the American public into believing the quality of
HMO care is a lot better than it actually is," said Steffie
Woolhandler, a researcher and associate professor at Harvard Medical
School.</LD>

practices at major record labels that they say cheat them out of
royalties.</LD>
<LD>   Country music star Clint Black, who appeared at the Los Angeles
hearing with performers such as Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet
Boys and Eagles star Don Henley, told a California Senate committee
on entertainment: "We need to hold them [labels] accountable and none
of us as individuals have been able to do that."</LD>
<LD>   Musicians and artist representatives said they routinely find that
record labels under-report the amount owed to them.</LD>

royalties.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roadway Corp. said a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by a major rival
may help Roadway's sales jump 30% this quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Roadway, the second-largest U.S. trucking company, expects an
influx of orders from Consolidated Freightways Corp. customers to
increase sales in its fourth quarter from the $867.5 million it
posted in the period last year. Its third quarter ended too soon for
Roadway to benefit from Consolidated's Sept. 3 bankruptcy filing, a
Roadway spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell 15% in the quarter ended Sept. 7 to $6.9 million,
or 36 cents a share. Sales climbed 14% to $721.3 million, helped by
regional truckers bought in November.</LD>
<TE>   Roadway shares climbed $3.97 to $34.87 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>* U.S. Steel Corp., the biggest U.S. steel maker, said third-quarter
earnings will be at the high end of analysts' estimate of 43 cents to
75 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   * AT&amp;T Corp. awarded Chief Executive-elect David Dorman 1.37
million stock options and gave millions more to other executives to
help retain top managers. Dorman's options, with a strike price of
$12.34, would be worth $26.9 million if AT&amp;T shares rose 10% a year
for the next 10 years. Also, the Federal Communications Commission
said it was temporarily stopping the informal 180-day merger clock on
Comcast Corp.'s proposed acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband. It expects to
complete the review by Oct. 22.</LD>
<LD>   * Whirlpool Corp. said third-quarter profit would rise more than
forecast, a day after rival Maytag Corp. lowered earnings
expectations because of sluggish sales. Profit excluding some costs
will modestly exceed the $1.57-a-share estimate by analysts.</LD>
<TE>   * Kmart Corp., the financially troubled retailer that is seeking
to boost sales among Latinos, can enter a four-year agreement with
Mexican singer Thalia to promote a line of clothing and makeup, a

<HD>Xerox Says U.S. Attorney Probing Accounting</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Copier giant faces another inquiry after
paying $10-million civil penalty. Shares tumble on news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENDA McCARTHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. said the government has launched a criminal investigation
into accounting practices that earlier this year led to a restatement
of results and a record $10-million civil fine against the copier
giant.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the U.S. attorney office's inquiry surprised investors
Tuesday and pushed Xerox shares down 10.6% to erase nearly six weeks
of gains. Shares closed down 71 cents at $5.96 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox said it learned late Monday of the investigation from the
U.S. attorney's office in Bridgeport, Conn., and promised to
cooperate fully.</LD>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, Delcie Thibault,
cited Justice Department policy in declining to confirm or deny that
a probe is underway.</TE>
<TE>   But Xerox spokeswoman Christina Carone said the investigation
covers accounting practices that were reviewed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC began its investigation in June 2000 based on accusations
by James Bingham, then assistant treasurer at Xerox. Bingham was
fired soon after and has a wrongful termination lawsuit pending
against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Bingham attorney David Golub confirmed Tuesday that Bingham had
met with the FBI, at the agency's request, and is cooperating with
all federal authorities on the Xerox matter. The SEC, in a civil
suit, charged the company with distorting financial results from 1997
to 2000 by recording revenue from equipment-leasing contracts before
actually receiving payments, a practice that inflated revenue by
nearly $6.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the company settled the civil fraud charges with the
SEC, agreeing to pay a record $10-million penalty and restating
financial results for 1997 to 2000, without admitting or denying
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   After the settlement, Xerox said the accounting woes that had
pulled its stock down 70% over two years were a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy told analysts at the time that the
company was moving on and putting full effort into reviving sales and
profit amid a slowdown in corporate technology spending. In July, the
company posted a surprise profit for the second quarter, helped by
aggressive cost-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   But the SEC said at the time of the settlement that its
investigation into Xerox's abuses was continuing. The agency said
that senior executives had orchestrated a scheme of "accounting
tricks" to meet Wall Street growth targets and failed to fully
cooperate with its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Ulysses A. Yannas, an analyst at Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid, said he
doesn't think the criminal probe will affect the company's
operations. "I don't think they'll be going after the company itself.
They might be going after certain individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Former Chairman Paul Allaire and ex-Chief Financial Officer Barry
Romeril may be among the executives under investigation, analysts
have speculated.</TE>

<HD>ABC News, CNN Ponder Merger</HD>
<DH>Media: Sporadic talks have moved to highest level as AOL
Time Warner board examines the idea. But no deal is imminent, sources
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Employees at CNN and ABC News tried Tuesday to figure out how their
lives would change--radically, most likely--if the two news divisions
consummate a possible merger.</LD>
<LD>   The idea, under sporadic discussion for 18 months, reached the
highest levels yet late last week when the board of AOL Time Warner
Inc., which owns CNN, examined the pros and cons of the proposal for
the first time. Walt Disney Co. owns ABC News.</LD>
<LD>   Both parties said Tuesday that no deal had been reached and none
is imminent. But company sources said the discussions were continuing
and were not discouraged in any way by the AOL Time Warner board.</LD>
<TE>   The plan under discussion last week called for spinning off CNN
and ABC News into a separate company in which CNN, because of its
greater revenue, would have a majority stake, as much as 75%. The
combined company, with projected revenue of more than $1.6 billion,
would be able to slash costs by as much as $200 million annually,
leading to heftier profits at both companies, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Any deal would be rife with complications and serious
ramifications for the television news business. CNN's salaries are
markedly lower than those at ABC News, which built its celebrated
stable of editorial employees over three decades partly by paying
staffers handsomely. As budget pressures have mounted in the last
year, ABC News has been asking correspondents, anchors and producers
to accept salary cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But employees had questions about who would have editorial
control, how to merge the two operations' very different styles of
presenting the news and whether such media consolidation would be
healthy. Would ABC News' Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters appear on
CNN? And which overlapping bureaus might be cut?</TE>
<TE>   The merger could benefit ABC News in a place such as Moscow,
where, to save money, the network is closing its bureau. Network
executives say that ABC no longer needs to have a large Moscow staff
now that travel is freely permitted and that a camera operator and a
producer will remain.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, CNN has 41 bureaus outside the U.S. and 10 employees
in Moscow, including two correspondents.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides tried to reassure their jittery staffs Tuesday. ABC
News President David Westin, in his morning conference call with
senior staff, said the division is "stronger than it was a year ago.
That means we have the luxury of doing nothing at all and continuing
to grow our business. It also gives us the luxury of doing a deal--if
any is done--from a position of strength." He said any deal would be
done "with the goal of making ABC News even stronger and better."</TE>
<TE>   CNN News Group Chairman Walter Isaacson told his staff in a memo
that "it's no secret that for many years CNN has had talks with other
news organizations that currently have no 24/7 cable news
distribution about working together or combining assets."</TE>
<TE>   He said the idea was "intriguing, and we expect that these talks
will pick up again from time to time. At this time, CNN is not close
to making a deal, but we will always explore scenarios that can make
our journalism and business even stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen reported from New York, Hofmeister from Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar's Purchase of DirecTV in Trouble</HD>
<DH>Media: Regulators are leaning toward rejecting a proposed
merger of the two satellite TV providers on antitrust grounds,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at DirecTV are contemplating a management-led buyout,
sources said Tuesday, as government regulators move closer to
rejecting EchoStar Communications Corp.'s proposed $15-billion
purchase of satellite rival DirecTV and its parent, Hughes
Electronics Corp.</LD>
<LD>   If regulators reject the merger, some DirecTV executives believe a
buyout of the company would be a better alternative to selling the
leading satellite TV provider to Rupert Murdoch's entertainment giant
News Corp., which lost to EchoStar in a bidding war for Hughes and
DirecTV in October.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes' parent, General Motors Corp., originally put the El
Segundo-based subsidiary up for sale because it needed cash from its
controlling 30% stake in the publicly traded company to fund
automotive operations. "Our priority is getting the merger done.
That's the best possible outcome for all parties," said Hughes
spokesman George Jamison.</LD>
<TE>   However, sources say the auto giant has grown impatient after
trying for more than two years to sell Hughes, and it would not
relish further delays and another lengthy regulatory review that a
new offer from News Corp. could bring.</TE>
<TE>   Last year EchoStar agreed to buy Hughes in a stock and cash deal
worth about $26 billion. Because of a steep decline in EchoStar's
stock, the deal is now worth about $15 billion. But Hughes' market
value is about $11 billion, with GM's stake worth about $3.3 billion.
In today's weakened stock market, it is uncertain whether GM could
demand from another buyer the 25% premium still built into the
EchoStar offer, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Since October, EchoStar and DirecTV have been awaiting federal
approval in the face of harsh criticism of the deal on antitrust
grounds. A marriage of the nation's only two satellite TV providers
would create a monopoly serving 18.2 million subscribers, or
one-fifth of U.S. homes.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say an investor or buyout firm may be interested in
acquiring GM's stake in Hughes given the improvements in DirecTV's
financial performance since last fall.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months DirecTV President Roxanne Austin has told her top
management team several times that the company's improved performance
gives Hughes alternatives that were not conceivable last fall, such
as a management buyout, if the EchoStar deal is rejected, sources
said. Since Austin was installed as president last year, DirecTV's
costs have dropped and revenue and cash flow have improved. But
analysts also question whether a Hughes buyout offer built heavily
around debt would be appealing to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar CEO Charles Ergen is scheduled to appear before the
Justice Department staff late next week. Ergen is the last executive
from either company to be deposed before a scheduled Oct. 8 meeting
at the Justice Department with the two companies. Executives expect
to learn that day whether the agency will approve the
EchoStar-DirecTV merger, and any remaining conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Staff attorneys at the U.S. Justice Department are leaning toward
recommending that the EchoStar-DirecTV merger be rejected on
antitrust grounds, according to sources familiar with the regulatory
review. Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles James, who will make the final
decision, acknowledged at a hearing last week that the merger would
create a pay-television monopoly in many rural markets that don't
receive cable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ergen plans to personally lobby Federal Communications
Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell today in an effort to salvage
the deal. The FCC's self-imposed deadline to accept or reject the
deal expires in early November.</TE>
<TE>   A new wild card in the yearlong review process is Cablevision
Systems Corp., the Long Island, N.Y.-based company that is the
nation's seventh-largest cable TV operator.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision plans to launch its first satellite in March and begin
selling pay-TV service nationwide next summer. But Cablevision
contends that it could be an even more viable satellite TV competitor
under an offer it proposed to regulators this month to buy additional
satellite capacity from EchoStar. Cablevision would like the
government to impose such a sale as a condition of any merger.</TE>
<TE>   The Cablevision offer is sketchy, and critics question the
last-minute offer, given the company's weak financial condition. But
government regulators have asked for more details and plan to give
the offer careful consideration, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a scheduled meeting next week between James and
several state attorneys general who opposed the EchoStar-DirecTV deal
has been postponed until early next month, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   New York, Connecticut and Missouri are among those states that
have hinted that they may sue to block the merger, even if federal
regulators approve it.</TE>
<TE>   "My prediction is that there will be at least a core group [of
states] leaning toward taking some action," Connecticut Atty. Gen.
Richard Blumenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at DirecTV and EchoStar have been putting up a united
front, expressing confidence that the deal--which is still subject to
shareholder review--will be approved.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are less certain. Shares in Hughes Electronics, a GM
tracking stock, fell 41 cents Tuesday to $8.40 on the New York Stock
Exchange. EchoStar shares fell $1.30 to $16.10 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the deal is rejected by regulators, EchoStar must pay
Hughes a $600-million breakup fee under terms of the merger
agreement. The agreement also requires EchoStar to purchase Hughes'
PanAmSat, a satellite company, for about $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But TV industry executives who know Ergen doubt that he will exit
quietly. EchoStar probably will sue the government to save the
merger, sources said. He also is expected to fight GM in court over
the breakup fee and the purchase of PanAmSat, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Hofmeister reported from Los Angeles, Sanders reported from
Washington.</TE>

<HD>EDS Shares Fall Further</HD>
<DH>Technology: The company's move to settle a stock-hedging
program costs it $225 million, spurring one analyst to cut his rating
to 'sell.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. shares plunged anew Tuesday after the
world's No. 2 computer services company said it spent $225 million to
close out a failed hedging strategy on its own stock--prompting a
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst to cut his rating on the stock to "sell."</LD>
<LD>   The settlement of the stock bet could wipe out the company's free
cash flow this year and may hinder its ability to compete for
business, Merrill analyst Steve McClellan wrote in a report. He
downgraded the shares from "neutral" to "sell."</LD>
<LD>   The stock tumbled $4.84, or 29%, to $11.68 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The price had dived 53% on Thursday, after the company's
warning of a steep profit shortfall that management blamed on weak
capital spending.</LD>
<TE>   EDS, like many major companies, buys its stock in the open market
to offset issuance of shares under an employee stock options program.
Beginning last year, EDS took out a hedge against a rising market
price for its shares, using a combination of stock purchase and sales
contracts with other parties.</TE>
<TE>   EDS in effect bought a form of insurance it didn't end up needing
and partly financed that purchase by selling a kind of insurance that
another party collected on.</TE>
<TE>   The unanticipated plunge in the stock left the company with a
$225-million bill to close out the transactions. EDS said it paid the
bill by borrowing $225 million through the issuance of commercial
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service said it may cut EDS' P-1 short-term
credit rating, citing the company's reduced financial outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Rod Bourgeois, an analyst at investment research firm
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., raised the possibility that the
Securities and Exchange Commission may open an investigation of EDS.</TE>
<TE>   EDS, in a statement, said it is not aware of any SEC probe. The
SEC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Large computer services contracts, such as one EDS is negotiating
with Procter &amp; Gamble Co., require upfront investments, and a
restriction in access to capital could make EDS less likely to win
such deals, McClellan said in a note explaining his rating change.</TE>
<TE>   EDS denied that it is facing liquidity problems. But some
investors on Tuesday decided they couldn't risk more disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be around waiting for the next shoe to drop,"
said Brian Eisenbarth, manager of Davidson Investment Advisors'
$200-million Large Cap Value Strategy Fund, who this week sold his
remaining 165,000 shares of EDS.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 25 Wall Street analysts following EDS, McClellan's new
rating is one of seven "sells" on the stock, according to data
tracker Thomson First Call. Three analysts rate it "buy" and 15 rate
it "hold."</TE>

<HD>2 Dissent as Fed Lets Rate Stand</HD>
<DH>Economy: Some analysts interpret the disclosure of
disagreement as a sign board will cut further.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve policymakers acknowledged Tuesday that the nation's
economic recovery remained wobbly and could be damaged by war with
Iraq. But with two members opposed, they voted to leave their
signal-sending interest rate unchanged for a 10th straight month.</LD>
<LD>   Policymakers left the so-called federal funds rate, the interest
that banks charge each other for overnight loans, at a four-decade
low of 1.75%, where it has been since December. In a statement, they
said the economy was growing at a "moderate pace" and that rates
already should be low enough to make it grow faster.</LD>
<LD>   But the central bank, for the first time, revealed immediately
after the vote that there had been disagreement over the rate
decision. It said that of the 12-member board, Fed Gov. Edward M.
Gramlich and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert D. McTeer
Jr. wanted to lower rates.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts interpreted the disclosure as a sign the Fed was
preparing for further cuts--perhaps dramatic ones--if the economy
weakens.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is no longer whether, just when," said Dominic
Konstam, chief of interest rates and Treasuries at Credit Suisse
First Boston in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Fed decision came amid worrisome new signs that
American consumers, whose purchases have kept the economy afloat in
recent years, may be getting cold feet.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board, a New York-based business-research group,
reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 1.2 points
in September to 93.3, its fourth consecutive monthly drop. And the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said its index of chain store sales tumbled
1.7% in the week ended Sept. 14 and 2.7% from a year ago. The
measure's rise until recently was widely cited as evidence that
consumers would keep buying, come what may.</TE>
<TE>   Already bearish investors reacted to the Fed decision by pushing
stock prices lower. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 189.02
points, or 2.4%, to close at 7,683.13, its lowest level in four
years. Nasdaq hit a six-year low of 1,182.17, and 10-year T-notes
fell to another 40-year low, helped by reports that governors wanted
a rate cut.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said central bank policymakers were influenced by at
least three factors in deciding to leave rates unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   First, despite renewed signs of weakness, the economy is likely to
post a healthy 3.5% to 4% growth rate in the nearly complete
July-through-September quarter, and so needs no additional bucking up
for now.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed thinks the economy is improving--that there's nothing
abnormal about this recovery--so it doesn't need to cut further,"
said Dean Maki, a former Fed staffer and now an economist with
Boston-based Putnam Investments.</TE>
<TE>   Second, with the government considering war with Iraq, the Fed
should not squander what little flexibility it still has to reduce
interest rates. Fed policymakers cited the move toward war in
explaining their latest decision, saying that "considerable
uncertainty persists" about the economy's recovery, "owing in part to
the emergence of heightened global risks."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, persistently low interest rates are producing some
unexpected--and unwanted--side effects by scrambling the finances of
Fannie Mae and other mortgage giants and forcing such companies as
IBM Corp. to contribute more to pension funds to ensure they can earn
enough at such low rates to cover all their retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "People become very excited about low rates without thinking it
all the way through," said Jay Mueller, director of fixed income and
chief economist at Strong Capital Management, a Milwaukee-based
mutual fund company. "For every borrower who gets a good deal, there
is a lender who's making less."</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's decision to keep the funds rate unchanged means
commercial banks will leave their prime lending rate--the interest
that they charge their most favored business customers and that is
used as a benchmark for many other types of loans--at 4.75%, its
lowest level since November 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the low rates, American business has been reluctant to
borrow and invest in new equipment. The nation's manufacturing
sector, hard hit by last year's recession but on the mend earlier
this year, lost ground last month and began laying off workers again.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, therefore, have left it to consumers--who account for
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity--to prop up the economy.
They have done so largely by snapping up no-interest financing deals
for cars and low mortgage rates for homes. But some analysts wonder
how much longer that can last.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a limit to how many new cars you need," said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Fed watchers were surprised Tuesday by news of dissent on
the central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
Although McTeer, the Dallas Fed bank president, has openly disagreed
with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in the past, Gramlich, a Fed
governor and former academic economist, is considered a cautious
centrist.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. analysts said the 10-2 vote marked the first
time since May 1998 there had been two dissents and the first time a
governor--as opposed to a Fed bank president--had voted against
Greenspan since November 1995. It also was the first time the central
bank had disclosed the vote immediately after it happened.</TE>

<HD>Energy Shares Fall on Fears of Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Officials vow to press claims against any firm
suspected of manipulating market.</DH>
<SE></SE>

REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks of most energy merchants tumbled Tuesday amid growing fears of
lawsuits and investigations following a ruling that El Paso Corp.
illegally manipulated the California energy market.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso, the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company, was
particularly hard hit for a second day, with its shares dropping
nearly 30%. That followed a 36% plunge Monday, when a federal
administrative law judge ruled that El Paso drove up California
natural gas and electricity prices in 2000-01 by withholding gas
supplies.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was another blow to an energy sector beaten down for
alleged accounting shenanigans, market gaming and sham trades to pump
up revenues.</LD>
<TE>   In the latest development on that front, Dynegy Inc. agreed to a
$3-million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which was investigating alleged sham trades that Dynegy made with CMS
Energy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's shares rose 3 cents to close at $1.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy also said, after the market closed, that an internal review
had found that some of its employees provided inaccurate information
on natural gas trades to energy industry publications, which compile
indexes that influence electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer asked a federal
court in Sacramento to overturn a recent ruling by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission that tossed out claims that California is owed
$2.8 billion in refunds for sales of power between May and October
2000. FERC has refused to consider electricity sales during those
months as part of a larger refund case California is pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   Those moves followed Monday's ruling by FERC Judge Curtis L.
Wagner Jr. that El Paso used a variety of strategies, such as
scheduling downtime for maintenance, to "withhold substantial
capacity" on its major natural gas pipeline to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso disputed Wagner's findings and vowed to appeal to the full
FERC board.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by the El Paso ruling, California politicians and
regulators vowed to press forward with claims against any firm
suspected of withholding power supplies or manipulating the market
during the state's costly energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horrific environment and that's why investors are
bailing," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with
Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to several investigations into market behavior,
"there's the risk of a monster class-action lawsuit," Cartwright
said. "How do you find a jury full of people who didn't feel that
their electricity bills were too high?"</TE>
<TE>   El Paso was the biggest loser in the sector, falling $2.21, or
29%, to close at $5.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, the
stock plunged $4.61, or nearly 36%. An Amex index of 19 utility
stocks, including El Paso, was down 2.5% on Tuesday and has fallen
34.5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Also down was Edison International, which fell $1.35 to close at
$9.15 on the NYSE, a day after a federal appeals panel said
California regulators may have broken state laws in reaching an
agreement with Edison's utility to pay off its power debts.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts supported El Paso's contention that it did not stand
to make huge sums from any manipulation because it hedged its risk on
the pipeline, limiting its profit potential.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a political flair to the judge's decision that
sends a message that the FERC is not company-friendly," said Carol
Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's decision, if upheld, is likely to strengthen California's
hand in two cases pending before FERC: the state's demand for $9
billion in refunds for alleged electricity overcharges and Gov.
Davis' drive to renegotiate some $40 billion in long-term power
contracts at lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, FERC is acknowledging what we knew more than a year
ago--that the energy industry was ripping off Californians," Gov.
Gray Davis said. "But we are still waiting for FERC to order the
companies to refund these ill-gotten gains. It is time for FERC to
stop issuing 'findings' and start issuing refunds."</TE>
<TE>   The issues of California's refunds and long-term contracts could
take months to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Also pending is FERC's investigation of alleged market
manipulation by Enron Corp. and other power sellers. Although FERC
Chairman Patrick Wood had said he hoped to have the investigation
wrapped up by the end of the year, agency spokesman Kevin Cadden
suggested it may take longer.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Garden Grove), chairman of the select
committee investigating price manipulation, said he hoped to convene
a hearing late next month that would examine whether El Paso and
Enron collaborated to control natural gas pipeline capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "There is evidence in our investigation that would suggest that
Enron and El Paso worked together in controlling that capacity," he
said. "If true, that ... would help explain price volatility in
California and move us into the antitrust arena."</TE>

<HD>Government Debt, Not Policies, Could Threaten Business
Climate</HD>

<LD>In the wake of Gov. Gray Davis signing a bill creating the nation's
first comprehensive paid family-leave policy, businesspeople are
fuming. They accuse him and the California Legislature of saddling
them with a continuous series of mandates--regulations that add costs
and hobble their ability to turn a profit. In national surveys,
meanwhile, corporate executives are branding California "unfriendly"
to business.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the anger is superficial and irrelevant.</LD>
<LD>   State government is not reflexively anti-business. Along with
regulations, the state hands out plenty of benefits to industry.
Overall, the Golden State remains a business powerhouse.</LD>
<TE>   "We have the world's No. 1 economy in technology, biotechnology,
entertainment, foreign trade, aerospace and other industries," notes
Stephen Levy, who heads Palo Alto's Center for the Continuing Study
of the California Economy.</TE>
<TE>   But California is nearly No. 1 in another category--</TE>
<TE>   indebtedness--and therein lies a big problem that, over time,
could have serious implications for the business climate in the
state. The danger is that chronic budget deficits will prevent
California from spending to upgrade the basic infrastructure that
businesses must have to keep charging forward.</TE>
<TE>   Needs are great. California will have to spend $56 billion in the
next five years, according to a report that the Davis administration
released recently, to tackle an array of troubles. Among them:
clearing clogged highways to move goods and people more efficiently;
building and repairing the schools that educate our work force of the
future; assuring the availability and quality of water; and creating
an abundance of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The state's pocketbook is bare. It is borrowing huge amounts to
cover expenditures this year and faces a long-term structural deficit
of $5 billion to $7 billion. A structural deficit means that even a
strong economic recovery won't provide enough tax revenue to balance
the state budget. Meanwhile, only New York has more debt outstanding,
and California's shaky situation is threatening to drag down its
already low credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   Such large budgetary difficulties are not distant abstractions but
troubled realities that directly hurt businesses and workers.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno County, the employment center run by Dave Spaur provides
training that aims to qualify young people in Fresno for $13-an-hour
jobs. And, says Spaur, head of the county's Economic Development
Corp., "we place all the center's graduates in jobs." However,
funding to expand the center is not possible in these deficit-ridden
times, and even funding for operations is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, businesspeople aren't all whiners. California
manufacturers face stiff competition from companies in lower-cost
locales such as Atlanta, Denver, Phoenix and Dallas. And many smaller
firms in particular are sure to be hurt by the new family-leave act.
State overtime rules and swelling workers' compensation costs also
are real issues.</TE>
<TE>   But at its best, industry recognizes the need to change--not just
gripe. Brad Hart, president of Roberts Tool, a Chatsworth maker of
hydraulic systems and missile parts, says his 65-employee company has
adopted lean manufacturing techniques to gain efficiency and speed.
As a result, he says, "we're getting lots of orders" while "some of
my old competitors are going out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Hart is no fan of Sacramento politics, but he recognizes that
government is a necessary fact of life. It also is a lifeline to
business in significant ways.</TE>
<TE>   The state, for example, is trying to come up with a program to
protect builders of multifamily housing from the threat of liability
lawsuits. And Davis has just signed legislation supporting stem-cell
research in the University of California system that is designed to
help the state maintain its lead in biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the government's ability to keep lending a helping
hand is threatened by all the red ink.</TE>
<TE>   California manufacturers are now seeking a 5-percentage-point
reduction in sales taxes on new equipment. Yet they are unlikely to
get a break in the current budget climate. In fact, if anything,
business is going to be saddled with higher--not lower--taxes.</TE>
<TE>   There's no real choice. Higher taxes are necessary if this
technology-rich state wants to have the services and support its
world-leading industries require.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell foresees higher levies being
imposed on business services. Other taxes on companies big and small
also are probable. In addition, Connell predicts an adjustment of the
income tax to extract more from upper-income individuals.</TE>
<TE>   So is California really unfriendly to business? We've heard that
one before, says economist Tom Lieser of the UCLA Anderson Forecast,
who is set to present a report on the state's economy today.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time since World War II, California has been
criticized for a poor business climate, high home prices and high
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "These perturbations," says Lieser, "have not ... had more than
temporary impacts on the [state's] long-term trend toward an
increasing share of national population, real output and employment."</TE>
<TE>   Will this juncture be any different? Unless California gets its
budget under control, it well could be.</TE>

<HD>3 to Plead Guilty in Homestore Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three former Homestore Inc. executives are expected to plead guilty
to charges involving an alleged phony revenue scheme at the Internet
home seller in a federal case focusing on advertising transactions
with AOL Time Warner Inc. and other business partners, sources said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Plea bargains have been reached with former executives John
Giesecke and Joseph Shew, both of whom had served as chief financial
officer of Homestore, and former finance department executive John
DeSimone, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Government officials said they expect details of the case to be
announced today in Washington, at a meeting of the national
"financial crimes SWAT team" that was hastily created by the Bush
administration in July.</LD>
<TE>   The former executives are expected to plead guilty to a variety of
charges including conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud, and to
continue to cooperate with investigations of Homestore and its
business partners, including AOL, people familiar with the case told
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke and Shew, along with unidentified co-conspirators, are
accused of concocting a scheme to ensure that Homestore revenue met
or exceeded expectations during the first three quarters of 2001.
According to the federal conspiracy charges, Homestore made nearly
$50 million in fraudulent purchases from software, advertising and
other service companies, which then used $45 million of the money to
buy online ads from a "major media company," which sources identified
as AOL.</TE>
<TE>   AOL allegedly then purchased nearly $37 million in online ads from
Homestore, which booked the money as revenue even though it was
really just the return of Homestore's own funds, according to the
government's charges.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke and Shew also are expected to admit deceiving Homestore's
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission about the company's financial results. In addition,
Giesecke is expected to admit that he misrepresented the company's
finances to securities analysts during a conference call, while
DeSimone will admit involvement in insider trading, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Handzlik, Giesecke's lawyer, declined to comment directly on
the expected charges, but said his client "deeply regrets his past
mistakes and will cooperate fully to bring this matter to a
conclusion." Shew's attorney didn't return a call and DeSimone's
lawyer declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
case involving Homestore, which is based in Westlake Village, will be
used as an example of the federal commitment to pursue corporate
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore, which operates Realtor.com, the dominant home-sales
site on the Internet, and Homestore.com, a home-information site,
admitted this year that it had improperly used ad-bartering deals to
overstate revenue by $81.6 million. Previous civil lawsuits have
accused the company of engaging in "round-tripping" transactions,
allowing it to book bogus revenue and thus meet or exceed its
quarterly projections.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the company is accused in the lawsuits of using
third-party companies such as SFX Technologies and L90, now known as
MaxWorldwide Inc., to funnel money to AOL and then back to Homestore,
where it could be counted as revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Homestore agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit
filed by telemarketing company MemberWorks Inc. that accused
Homestore of securities fraud in connection with its acquisition of
an Internet company from MemberWorks.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate
the deals between Homestore and AOL. AOL spokesman John Buckley said
Tuesday that his company has "cooperated fully with law enforcement
agents in their investigation of Homestore.com."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore executives said Tuesday that an internal inquiry turned
up the accounting irregularities, which the company handed over to
the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The company in January installed an entire new layer of top
management, hiring a new chief executive and chief financial officer
and filling the vacant position of chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Executive Stuart Wolff, who resigned to pursue an
unspecified new venture, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Hanauer, who was named Homestore's chairman in January, said
the company has had no official contact with the SEC or federal
prosecutors since it turned over the evidence from its inquiry in
April.</TE>
<TE>   At the meetings this week in Washington, white-collar prosecutors
from Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and other major cities,
along with officials from the SEC, will share their expertise in
corporate corruption cases with federal prosecutors from scores of
smaller cities, Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said. Fraud
investigators from the Treasury Department and Postal Service also
will take part.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the numbers and complexity of cases involving
executives who enriched themselves by inflating corporate sales and
profits, the task force also will call in experts from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission
and other agencies that have rarely been associated with criminal
prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   With energy, telecom and cable companies among those under
scrutiny, the administration wanted "to enlist whatever expertise we
can," Sierra said.</TE>

<HD>Global Swaps Misled, Data Show</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Officials used deals to boost revenue, meet
forecasts and keep loans in good standing, according to company
e-mails, House testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Executives at Global Crossing Ltd. misled their bankers as well as
investors in undertaking controversial swaps of capacity on their
telecommunications networks to boost revenue and meet financial
forecasts, according to evidence released Tuesday by congressional
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure could give lawmakers important ammunition as a
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee prepares to grill Global
Crossing founder and Chairman Gary Winnick next week. Global Crossing
filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   One e-mail from Global Crossing Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs
warned that Global was at risk of violating bank loan covenants
affecting some $6 billion in financing. Cohrs added that Global's
ability to secure significant network capacity swaps would have "a
big effect" on keeping the loans in good standing.</LD>
<TE>   "We will be tight on our bank covenants as we go through the
year," Cohrs wrote in an e-mail dated May 12, 2001. He noted that
Global soon would exceed the ratio of debt-to-earnings before
interest, taxes, debt and appreciation allowed in its bank loans by
17%.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails point to a compelling motive for the firm's obsession
with meeting quarterly projections and completing last-minute
capacity swaps to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, investigators believed the company engaged in
last-minute deals to avoid disappointing Wall Street. But defaulting
on a debt agreement would have been much worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If you just miss your forecast on Wall Street, it's mainly just a
business embarrassment and your stock price is going to take a hit,"
said Carr Conway, a senior forensic accountant at Dickerson Financial
Investigation Group in Denver. "If you don't make your [bank]
covenants, theoretically the lenders can call your debt. That's so
serious that it had to be a matter of great discussion."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails were bolstered Tuesday by damaging testimony from
eight other telecom executives involved in negotiating the
controversial swaps. The star witness was Roy Olofson, who worked in
Beverly Hills as Global Crossing's vice president of finance before
he was let go last year.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson told the House panel's investigations and oversight
subcommittee that Global's former chief executive, Tom Casey, misled
financial analysts about deals in the first two quarters of 2001 in
which Global swapped network transmission capacity with rivals to
artificially boost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised to hear ... Tom Casey unequivocally state
[to investment analysts] that there were no swaps in the quarter,' "
Olofson said. "There was a general sense of uneasiness about these
swap transactions."</TE>
<TE>   Opening a full day of testimony, Subcommittee Chairman Rep. James
C. Greenwood (R.-Pa.) said deals consummated by Global Crossing and
fellow telecom provider Qwest Communications International Inc. were
questionable, coming at a time when the once-booming
telecommunications market was imploding.</TE>
<TE>   "Were these capacity swap transactions undertaken to respond to
new business opportunities, or were they merely designed to provide
the appearance of expanding business and growing revenues?" he said.
"Evidence uncovered by this committee's investigation suggests that
the latter is true."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the companies were desperate to maintain their
highflying images so that top executives could sell off their stocks
before the true financial health of the companies became known, panel
investigators believe.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, for instance, who has led Global since its founding in
1997, sold nearly 10 million shares of his company's stock for $124
million in May 2001 just as the e-mails released Tuesday were
informing top officials of Global's dire financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after Tuesday's session, Greenwood expressed
satisfaction that his subcommittee was beginning to get to the bottom
of a series of financial scandals in the telecommunications industry
that has rocked Wall Street investors and Main Street pensioners.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mr. Winnicks of the world made millions and millions of
dollars and Mr. and Mrs. America got creamed," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing officials declined to comment on the newly
released e-mails or the specifics of Tuesday's testimony, but a
spokeswoman said the company "has actively cooperated" with the
committee investigation since March and is "eager to resolve these
inquiries and will continue to cooperate. "</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Qwest, which provides local phone service in 14
Western states, also declined to comment on Tuesday's testimony. The
company will "continue to cooperate" with the panel's investigation,
spokesman Tyler Gronbach said. The e-mails and testimony from Olofson
and the other witnesses will lay the foundation for an Oct. 1
hearing, at which Winnick and former Qwest Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio have been asked to testify. They are expected to be grilled
about whether accounting decisions and business deals at their
respective companies were aimed at camouflaging the deteriorating
financial condition at Qwest and Global while top executives sold off
shares.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Qwest board member and former Chairman Philip
Anschutz, the telephone company's largest shareholder, may be called
to testify before the panel, according to committee spokesman Ken
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the witnesses who appeared Tuesday volunteered to
testify and were considered "friendly" to the panel's probe, they
sometimes engaged in finger-pointing and contradicted each other on
key issues.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning Tuesday afternoon from Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin
(R-La.), Kym Smiley, former director of strategic negotiations for
Qwest, disputed claims from Global Crossing witnesses that Qwest's
capacity swaps were contingent upon secret oral side agreements that
gave the company more flexibility to treat the deals as capital
expenses, allowing the company to hide losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you saying Qwest and Global Crossing disagree over what oral
assurances were given?" Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe there was a verbal agreement," Smiley said. "I
have no personal knowledge of a verbal agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Panel members also questioned former Qwest Chief Financial Officer
Robin Szeliga, now a Qwest executive vice president, about whether
the company retaliated against investment banking firm Morgan Stanley
for a negative research report on Qwest by not using Morgan Stanley's
financial management services.</TE>
<TE>   The panel released copies of Szeliga's notes from a June 2001
meeting at which officials agreed to "quietly close Morgan Stanley
out of the company" after the critical note about Qwest. Qwest never
again gave significant business to Morgan Stanley, Szeliga told the
panel.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses said they believed to the end that the
telecommunications market would rebound and that more transmission
capacity would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these transactions were very good transactions," said
Robin Wright, former vice president of carrier sales at Global. She
was among investors who bought more Global shares even as the telecom
market was showing signs of a free fall, she said. "I lost too,"
Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday trading, Qwest shares fell 18 cents to $2.61 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Intertainer Sues Major Studios</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intertainer Inc., a pioneer in online video on demand, has accused
three of the world's largest entertainment conglomerates of
conspiring to inhibit competition with their online venture,
Movielink.</LD>
<LD>   The antitrust lawsuit against AOL Time Warner Inc., Sony Corp. of
America, Vivendi Universal subsidiary Universal Studios Inc. and
Movielink is a last-ditch effort by Culver City-based Intertainer,
which has been trying to win long-term deals for the studios' movies.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
reflects the widespread frustration among independent online music
and movie companies, which have struggled to win licenses from
Hollywood studios and record labels on terms they can afford.</LD>
<TE>   Those complaints persuaded the Justice Department last year to
launch antitrust investigations into the major studios and labels,
focusing on joint ventures such as Movielink and licensing practices
in general. Both investigations reportedly are continuing, but have
yet to produce tangible results.</TE>
<TE>   In its lawsuit, Intertainer accused Sony, Universal and two AOL
subsidiaries, Warner Bros. and New Line, of raising prices to match
what the studios had agreed to pay Movielink. It also alleged that
the studios have withheld programming from Intertainer to aid
Movielink, which plans to begin service later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit accused the studios of price fixing, breach of
contract, negotiating in bad faith and unfair competition.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Warner Bros. responded, "As a matter of policy,
we don't discuss pending lawsuits, especially those that are
ludicrous." Universal, Sony and Movielink declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at studios and labels have said they're eager to take
advantage of the Internet, once they work out new business models and
clear the rights to distribute online. Several studios also have
complained about the picture quality of online video and the limited
protections provided by today's anti-piracy technology.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by Microsoft Corp., Comcast Corp., Intel Corp. and other
corporate heavyweights, Intertainer offers entertainment on demand
through high-speed Internet connections and digital cable TV systems.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the company has been much more successful at winning
licenses from major entertainment companies than most competitors,
many of which have failed for lack of programming and subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   The handful of survivors include CinemaNow, MovieFlix.com and
SightSound Technologies.</TE>

<HD>Dow Tumbles to 4-Year Low on More Bad News</HD>
<DH>Wall Street : Markets suffer another drop as shaky U.S.
economy and the prospect of war with Iraq continue to dampen
investors' spirits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bear looks like it's officially back in charge on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   The most widely watched stock market index, the Dow Jones
industrial average, tumbled Tuesday to close below its midsummer low,
wiping out the last of the late July and early August rally that many
investors hoped had marked the end of the market's misery.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Dow led another broad decline in share prices in
heavy trading as investors fled on concerns about the economy,
corporate earnings and scandals, and U.S.-Iraq tensions.</LD>
<TE>   As stocks fell, Treasury bond yields slid to new generational lows
and gold prices gained.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve's decision to hold short-term interest rates
steady may have helped add to Wall Street's gloom in the final hours
of trading, though the Fed's inaction had been expected.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow closed off 189.02 points, or 2.4%, at 7,683.13, its lowest
finish since Oct. 1, 1998. The day's slide pushed the index through
the previous closing low of 7,702.34 set July 23.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 14.41 points, or 1.7%, to
819.29, holding above its five-year closing low of 797.70, also
reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite, which sank to a six-year low
Monday, continued to fall Tuesday, but marginally. It closed down
2.76 points, or 0.2%, at 1,182.17 after sporting a gain for much of
the session.</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks outnumbered winners by 21 to 12 on Nasdaq and by 23
to 10 on the Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   The shaky state of the economy and the prospect of war with Iraq
continue to dampen investors' spirits, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A weak consumer confidence report Tuesday raised new fears about
the economy's path.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is coming to realize that the consumer is slowly but
surely closing his purse strings," said Kevin Marder, chief market
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Marder said the slide in the Dow to new bear-market-low territory,
joining the Nasdaq index at a fresh multiyear low, indicates that
investor worries "are of a broad economic slowdown encompassing a
vast array of industries, as opposed to the last couple of years,
when it was more tech and telecom reacting to the slowdown in capital
spending."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Koesterich, strategist at State Street Global Markets in
Boston, said the Dow's inability to hold on to the gains made in late
July and early August deals another blow to investor psychology.</TE>
<TE>   "Buying on the dips," the winning strategy of the 1990s, has been
a failed one since the market decline began in March 2000. Yet many
analysts had high hopes that the July lows marked the end of the long
bear market.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dow at a new low, "For the average investor, it brings to
the forefront the problems in the equity market," Koesterich said. He
said the latest slump raises the specter of more redemptions from
stock mutual funds, which had four straight months of net outflows
through August, according to some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Investor sentiment was depressed Tuesday by new profit warnings,
this time from Maytag and forest products company Weyerhaeuser.</TE>
<TE>   Retail stocks continued to sink after Wal-Mart Stores on Monday
said sales are coming in at the low end of expectations, further
adding to doubts about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve, in its statement Tuesday, said it still is
confident the economy is on a recovery path. But the central bank
also said the greater risk in the near term is of more weakness in
business activity. That admission signaled that the Fed stands ready
to cut interest rates if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury securities fell across the board Tuesday, which
analysts said reflected investors' search for a haven as stocks slid,
as well as expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate in the
next few months.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 3.64% from 3.70% Monday,
and is the lowest in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, near-term gold futures in New York gained $2.90
to $325.90 an ounce, the highest since the price peaked at $327.80 on
June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * European stock markets fell to fresh 5 1/2-year lows. The German
DAX index lost 1.4%. The French market fell 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   * Weyerhaeuser's profit warning clipped its stock by $5.94 to
$43.79. Other paper and lumber shares also fell, including Bowater,
down $1.84 to $35.92, and Kimberly-Clark, down $1.38 to $55.75.
International Paper lost $2.21 to $31.94, but after regular trading
ended the company reaffirmed its third-quarter earnings outlook.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks were lower even though crude futures ended at a new
52-week high, adding 6 cents to $30.77 a barrel. Exxon Mobil lost 77
cents to $31.95; BP dropped $1.22 to $39.65.</TE>
<TE>   * Utility shares were broadly lower on new concerns about the
industry's health. Duke Energy fell 57 cents to $19.24, Mirant lost
22 cents to $2.03 and Reliant Resources slid 67 cents to $2.44.</TE>

<HD>SAG Elects Directors to National Board</HD>
<DH>Labor: Members select 46 in a reorganization. Results tilt
toward candidates supporting moderate regime of President Melissa
Gilbert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar-nominated actor James Cromwell and "ER" star Noah Wyle were the
top vote-getters as members of the Screen Actors Guild elected 46
directors to its national board in results tilting heavily toward
candidates supporting the moderate regime of President Melissa
Gilbert.</LD>
<LD>   The election, results of which were unveiled early Tuesday, is
part of a reorganization that involves cutting the union's 107-member
board by more than one-third.</LD>
<LD>   Directors were elected to represent the union's Hollywood and New
York branches, with the other 22 slots to be decided this month from
among candidates representing regional offices nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order" star Sam Waterston received the most votes in the
New York branch. Other well-known TV or film stars winning election
include Richard Dreyfuss, Jane Kaczmarek, Mike Farrell, Valerie
Harper, Esai Morales and Cliff Robertson. Former SAG President
William Daniels was elected as an alternate.</TE>
<TE>   The election is expected to provide a boost to Gilbert and her
less confrontational style as president.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert and her supporters have argued, for example, that actors
were hurt by the six-month strike against advertisers in 2000,
whereas another faction of the union believes that important gains
were made.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert also sought to forge a pact governing relations between
actors and agents that would have allowed agencies inroads into
production. But her opponents persuaded members to vote it down,
arguing that it could create conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Under the union's reorganization, the SAG board will have 69
members, including Gilbert, but only 62 votes because of a
complicated formula aimed at giving additional weight to members of
the union's Hollywood and New York branches.</TE>

<HD>Suit Says Comcast, Cox Left Contracts</HD>
<DH>Internet: At Home bondholders accuse the firms of escaping
deals requiring them to use its service and making an illegal profit
while forcing it into insolvency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bloomberg News</AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. were accused in a lawsuit
by At Home Corp.'s bondholders of making at least $603.7 million in
illegal profit while forcing the Internet-access provider into
insolvency.</LD>
<LD>   At Home, which offered Internet service over cable lines, filed
for bankruptcy protection in September 2001, ceased operations in
February and liquidated its assets. The company once had a
$16.5-billion market value. AT&amp;T Corp., Cox and Comcast controlled At
Home until March 2000, when AT&amp;T agreed to buy a majority stake in
the Redwood City, Calif.-based company.</LD>
<LD>   At Home's bondholders, in the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in Delaware, allege that Cox and Comcast forced At Home into
various agreements that left it "critically weakened." The deals let
Cox and Comcast end their roles as At Home's major customers, while
handing AT&amp;T control, the suit said.</LD>
<TE>   "The March 2000 transactions effectively destroyed any long-term
value of At Home" by permitting Cox and Comcast to escape contracts
requiring them to exclusively use At Home's service, the bondholders
say in their suit.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Cox and Comcast exercised stock options received as
part of the deal, selling their At Home shares to AT&amp;T in exchange
for about $3.4 billion worth of AT&amp;T shares, the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Comcast have said they made a total of $600 million
selling At Home shares and it is probable their "short-swing profits
far exceeded" that total, the lawsuit said. Under federal securities
laws, any short-swing profits from insider trades would have to be
returned to At Home.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast and Cox declined to comment. A lawyer for At Home
bondholders declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Brian L. Roberts, Comcast's president, and David Woodrow, a senior
vice president at Cox, also were named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit asks for a jury trial, the return of at least $600
million to At Home's creditors, and an award of unspecified damages
for violations of duties to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Suit Against Union</TE>
<TE>   Bank Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   A suit that alleged Union Bank helped Reed Slatkin defraud
investors has been dismissed, although a similar lawsuit is still
pending against the bank.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow in Los Angeles granted the
bank's request to dismiss the suit, which was filed by victims of a
multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme run by Slatkin. The suit claimed
Union Bank knowingly helped the scheme by providing Slatkin with
credit, allowing him to commingle personal and investor funds and
lending its name and prestige to his operations.</TE>
<TE>   Union Bank, a unit of UnionBanCal Corp., faces another suit, filed
this month by the bankruptcy trustee for Slatkin's estate, that makes
similar allegations. That suit also named Comerica Inc. as a
defendant.</TE>
<TE>   The investors "have failed to allege that Union Bank was a
fiduciary and that it had a duty to disclose Slatkin's fraudulent
scheme to them," Morrow wrote in an 18-page opinion.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Says Oxford Capital</TE>
<TE>   Falsified Performance</TE>
<TE>   A Maryland investment-advisory firm gained a ranking as one of the
top 20 U.S. money managers the last four years by exaggerating its
stock-picking performance, the Securities and Exchange Commission
alleged Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC charged Oxford Capital Management Inc. with civil fraud
for allegedly submitting false performance numbers to the Nelson
Investment Manager Database, which ranked Oxford's composite stock
funds among its top 20 from 1998 to September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Oxford and its majority shareholder, John Danz, who also was
charged, are contesting the SEC allegations, the SEC said. Oxford,
which manages about $134 million, represented its 10-year annualized
return as 23.4% when it actually was 15.7%, the SEC said.</TE>

<HD>Blair Spells Out Threats Posed by Iraq Regime</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Hussein is making chemical and biological weapons
and trying for a nuclear bomb, the British leader says in summary of
data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British Prime Minister Tony Blair made his case for disarming Iraq to
Parliament and the world Tuesday, accusing President Saddam Hussein's
regime of producing chemical and biological weapons and trying to
develop ballistic missiles and a nuclear bomb.</LD>
<LD>   Convening an emergency legislative debate, Blair presented a
summary of intelligence data asserting that Iraq has attempted to
obtain uranium in Africa for nuclear use, readied biological arms for
deployment at 45 minutes' notice and begun concealing evidence in
anticipation of a return of U.N. arms inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   The report notes that Iraq has failed to obtain vital components
for a nuclear bomb and says it would take one to two years for
Hussein's regime to build one with fissile materials from a
black-market source and at least five years if sanctions were
removed.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, a shortage of missiles restricts Iraq's ability to
deliver chemical and biological payloads, according to the report.
But intelligence gathered in mid-2001 and early this year reveals
that Iraq is hard at work developing long-range missiles able to
strike targets more than 620 miles away. The United Nations has
banned Iraq from possessing missiles with a range of more than 93
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's summary to Parliament came as the Bush administration
pursued its campaign against the Hussein regime Tuesday on several
fronts:</TE>
<TE>   * Amid indications from U.S. officials that the administration
might be ready as early as today to submit a resolution on Iraq to
the United Nations, President Bush kept up his tough rhetoric toward
the Hussein regime. "We don't trust this man," Bush said after a
Cabinet meeting in Washington. "I again call for the United Nations
to pass a strong resolution holding this man to account, and if
they're unable to do so, the United States and our friends will act,
because we believe in peace."</TE>
<TE>   * In Warsaw, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and a CIA
official gave a briefing at a NATO gathering that largely mirrored
Blair's dossier but apparently also suggested that Hussein's
government knows of and tolerates the presence of Al Qaeda leaders in
Iraq, Defense Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   * In Kuwait, 1,000 members of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit
arrived to participate in live-fire training exercises. Defense
officials say the operation, called Eager Mace, was planned long ago.</TE>
<TE>   The much-awaited detailed dossier was based on recent intelligence
but does not contain hard-hitting new information that might be used
to justify immediate military action against Iraq. Nor does that
appear to be its goal. Recognizing European fears that the United
States is rushing to war, Blair emphasized the need to seek
aggressive international weapons inspections before using force
against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I defy anyone to say that this cruel and sadistic dictator should
be allowed any possibility of getting his hands on chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction," Blair said. "I
cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, that he
will use his weapons.... But we know that diplomacy not backed with
the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will."</TE>
<TE>   Blair's earnest and confident presentation got a respectful
response in Parliament, where most lawmakers agree with his stance.
But a vocal minority in the prime minister's Labor Party expressed
the discontent of many Britons.</TE>
<TE>   The dissident legislators said the dossier did not convince them
that a preemptive invasion of Iraq is necessary. They warned about
the dangerous repercussions of such a war in the Middle East and
beyond. And they maintained that Blair is part of a maneuver by Bush
to distract Americans from corporate corruption and economic decline
at home by charging into an ill-advised confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here knows that this is not about whether the inspectors
are going back," said George Galloway of the Labor Party. "The issue
is: Is this government prepared to join in a preemptive attack by the
United States which is not sanctioned by the United Nations? The
British people instinctively know that adding another war to the
Middle East, where there are already quite enough wars, doesn't seem
like a sensible idea."</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister's performance Tuesday reaffirmed his close
alliance with the Bush administration, a partnership Blair described
as vital to Britain's future. Yet he appealed to doubters by framing
the debate as a matter requiring concerted action by the
international community.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not an outline of the case for going to war. This was
supporting evidence for getting U.N. inspectors into Iraq," said
Charles Heyman, a former British military officer and editor of
Jane's World Armies. "He's talking to public opinion in the United
Kingdom, to the U.S. and to the international community. This shows
they are not going to war overnight now, and that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Asked by lawmakers if he endorses Bush's call for "regime change"
in Iraq, Blair insisted that he remains focused on dismantling the
threat posed by the Iraqi arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing," he said. "That
is not the purpose of our action. The purpose is to disarm Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Blair's strategy responds to lingering concerns about a war,
especially one waged by a U.S.- British coalition without U.N.
approval, according to Boris Johnson, a legislator in the
Conservative Party.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is in favor of getting rid of Saddam if a convincing
method can be offered," Johnson said of his party. "But there is
great anxiety about what, precisely, Bush is going to ask us to go
along with."</TE>
<TE>   Blair brought powerful ammunition to the debate Tuesday: the
report by Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, a 60-year-old unit
composed of the chiefs of four intelligence agencies and other senior
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister called the committee "the heart of the British
intelligence machinery" and said it was unprecedented for the
government to publish such a document. The report does not discuss
methods the committee used but says close allies contributed data.
The authoritative tone suggests that the dossier drew from a mix of
high-tech intelligence sources, spies and accounts by Iraqi
defectors.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, one skeptical member of Parliament, Alan Simpson of
the Labor Party, declared: "It is closer to propaganda than it is to
scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, Iraqi officials responding to Blair's litany of
accusations said they want U.N. inspectors to return and determine
the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's "allegations are long," said Amir Saadi, an Iraqi
presidential advisor. "His evidence is short. His evidence is a
hodgepodge of lies, half-truths and unsubstantiated allegations."</TE>
<TE>   The Blair dossier reinforced general allegations that have been
made by U.S. and British politicians and experts with new, concrete
details about the growth of Iraq's secret weapons program since 1998,
when U.N. inspections ended.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein believes that weapons of mass destruction are the basis of
Iraq's regional power and is ready to use them against his own
people, the report alleges. It also says Hussein "remains committed
to developing longer-range missiles."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the development process will be slow and will require
foreign expertise, specialized technology and test flights, the
report concludes, confirming recent assessments by experts that
Iraq's delivery capacities are limited.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq possesses as many as 20 Al-Hussein missiles with a range of
about 400 miles that could strike targets in Israel, Turkey, Cyprus
and Saudi Arabia, according to British intelligence. Iraq hit Israel
with 93 missiles carrying conventional warheads during the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The Al-Hussein missiles either were reassembled recently or
concealed from the U.N., the result of finely honed techniques for
thwarting inspections, British officials allege. Despite Iraqi
promises, the report says, recent intelligence indicates that Iraqi
leaders are discussing ways to cling to chemical and biological arms
even if the world body, in a last-ditch effort to avert bloodshed,
sends back inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq is already taking steps to prevent U.N. weapons inspectors
finding evidence of its chemical and biological weapons programs,"
the report says. "Intelligence indicates that Saddam has learned
lessons from previous weapons inspections, has identified possible
weak points in the inspections process and knows how to exploit them.
Sensitive equipment and papers can easily be concealed and in some
cases this is already happening."</TE>
<TE>   The report says the Iraqi military is trying to defeat future
inspections by creating mobile laboratories to produce biological
warfare agents such as anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin,
according to the accounts of defectors during the last two years.
Those weapons could be delivered by artillery, missiles and airborne
sprayers, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Aerial photos in the report depict suspected centers for the
production of chemical weapons, which Iraq allegedly has in stock and
also can produce. Iraq has reconstructed old production facilities
and built new ones in remote desert areas, such as a large chemical
complex, Project Baiji, a former uranium enrichment base in Al
Sharqat, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, British officials concede that components and
supplies for weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles often
have civilian uses. "Without U.N. weapons inspectors, it is very
difficult therefore to be sure about the true nature of many of
Iraq's facilities," the dossier says.</TE>

<TE>   Special correspondent William Wallace in London contributed to
this report. The British report is available at

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   British Report's Findings</TE>
<TE>   The British government released a dossier Tuesday on Iraq's
weapons programs. The report built on previously published
information but also drew on what it called "significant"
intelligence gathered as recently as this year. Based on that new
information, the government concluded that:</TE>
<TE>   Destructive capabilities</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq has continued to produce chemical and biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   * It has military plans for the use of chemical and biological
weapons, including against its own Shiite Muslim population. Some of
these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * It has command and control arrangements in place to use chemical
and biological weapons. Authority ultimately resides with Saddam
Hussein, although he may have delegated this authority to his son
Qusai.</TE>
<TE>   Delivery systems</TE>
<TE>   * It has developed mobile laboratories for military use,
corroborating earlier reports about the mobile production of
biological warfare agents.</TE>
<TE>   * It has illegally retained as many as 20 Al-Hussein missiles,
with a range of about 400 miles, capable of carrying chemical or
biological warheads.</TE>
<TE>   * It has started to deploy its Al-Samoud liquid-propellant missile
and has used the absence of weapons inspectors to work on extending
the missile's range to at least 124 miles, which is beyond the limit
of 93 miles imposed by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   * It has started producing the Ababil-100 solid-propellant missile
and is trying to extend the range to at least 124 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Covert actions</TE>
<TE>   * It has tried covertly to acquire technology and materials that
could be used in the production of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * It has sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa,
despite having no active civil nuclear power program that could
require it.</TE>
<TE>   * It has recalled specialists to work on its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   * It has learned from previous U.N. weapons inspections and has
already begun to conceal sensitive equipment and documentation in
advance of the return of inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   * It has pursued illegal programs to procure controlled materials
for potential use in the production of chemical and biological
weapons</TE>

<LD>Three gunmen hurling grenades and wielding AK-47s stormed a Hindu
temple, killing at least 29 men, women and children and trapping
others inside for hours until Indian commandos stormed the complex
and killed the assailants.</LD>
<LD>   The attack in Gandhinagar--capital of the western state of
Gujarat, where at least 1,000 died in Hindu-Muslim bloodshed earlier
this year--fueled fears of new, widespread religious clashes.</LD>
<LD>   Police said more than 70 people were injured. No group immediately
claimed responsibility, but Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani
said the incident appeared tied to elections in Jammu and Kashmir
state, the only majority-Muslim state in largely Hindu India.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Charges Paramilitary Commander</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The indictment breaks new ground in relations
between the U.S. and Colombia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>The United States announced the indictment of the leader of
Colombia's feared paramilitary army on drug charges Tuesday, the
first time such a high-ranking figure in the outlaw group has faced
the possibility of U.S. justice.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the U.S. would seek the extradition
of Carlos Castano and two other leaders of the right-wing
paramilitary group for allegedly transporting nearly 15 tons of
cocaine into the United States since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Castano and the paramilitary forces are violent drug traffickers
who "threaten our national security," Ashcroft told a news conference
in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement, coming during a visit to Washington by newly
elected Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, increases pressure on
Colombian authorities to act against Castano.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government has long been accused of working closely
with Castano, whose group is responsible for massacring hundreds of
civilians. The two share a common enemy in Colombia's leftist
guerrilla groups, who want to overthrow the government and replace it
with a Marxist regime.</TE>
<TE>   The cooperation between the Colombian government and Castano's
group has become the chief obstacle to closer relations between the
U.S. and Colombia. Democratic lawmakers have insisted that Bogota
take concrete steps against Castano's group before receiving more
military or counter-narcotics aid. The U.S. has supplied Colombia
with nearly $2 billion in aid over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Castano faces more than 90 charges in Colombia, ranging from
torture to murder. Colombian authorities have never managed to
capture Castano, although he frequently gives media interviews and
has had contact with top Colombian political and religious figures.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian officials said they will carefully study the extradition
request but made it clear they would send Castano to the U.S. if
captured. The Colombian government "must verify that the formal
requirements are completed," said Fernando Londono, the justice and
interior minister.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups welcomed the move, saying the U.S. was
belatedly sending a clear message to Colombians to capture Castano.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good step, but it doesn't solve the problem," said Robin
Kirk, a Colombia expert for Human Rights Watch. "The problem is that
the military continues to work with the paramilitaries."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk also said that if Castano is brought to the U.S., human
rights groups would immediately seek to have him face torture
charges, which can be prosecuted in U.S. courts because of a judicial
treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors swirled Tuesday that Castano was preparing to turn himself
in. He has made vague offers in the past to surrender to U.S.
authorities if indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Local media broadcast a letter Castano supposedly wrote to U.S.
Ambassador Anne W. Patterson on Tuesday offering to hand himself over
to prove his innocence. Embassy officials denied receiving such a
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Castano's lawyer said he had not communicated with his client
since the announcement was made but doubted that Castano will be on
his way to the United States any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that Carlos has made up his mind one way or the
other," said Joaquin Perez, a Miami-based criminal law attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Castano has long admitted that his group relies at least partly on
the drug trade to finance operations for an army estimated at 10,000
fighters. Recently, however, the group has split over just how
involved it should be in narcotics, leading to concerns about a
breakup into numerous smaller, private armies.</TE>
<TE>   In a summit with paramilitary leaders held at a secret location
this month, Castano reportedly demanded that the fighters restrict
their activities to charging "taxes" on the production of cocaine,
giving up protection of drug production and the transport of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia is the source of 90% of the cocaine on U.S. streets and
most of the heroin available on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "We must abandon drugs, or we will all drown in them," Castano
reportedly said after the end of the summit.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's announcement laid out a case alleging that Castano,
Salvatore Mancuso and Juan Carlos Sierra were deeply involved in drug
trafficking. Mancuso is the group's military leader, and Sierra
allegedly was in charge of coordinating its drug shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that Castano and Mancuso personally
stationed fighters to guard cocaine labs in Colombia; met with
farmers growing coca, the base for cocaine; fixed prices in
drug-growing zones they controlled; and provided the cocaine for
numerous shipments to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Perez defended his client's innocence and said Castano believes
that drugs have corrupted Colombia's society.</TE>

<HD>Training Hussein's Opposition</HD>
<DH>Military: The White House, in a reversal of long-standing
policy, is expected to seek approval for preparing Baghdad's foes for
war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Reversing a long-standing policy, the Bush administration is expected
to seek congressional approval soon to provide military training for
up to 10,000 members of the Iraqi opposition, according to
administration officials and Iraqi opposition sources.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to create an array of forces to assist the U.S.
military in a possible attack on Iraq, the U.S. and Iraqi sources
say.</LD>
<LD>   The White House move, which could come as early as this week,
reflects the depth of commitment to toppling Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein--and the quickening pace of military preparations targeting
his regime.</LD>
<TE>   "We have graduated to the next step of regime change," said a
well-placed administration source who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The forces, to be culled from all of Iraq's major ethnic and
religious groups, would be trained in ways to coordinate with and
help American troops. Administration sources insist that they would
not be used to lead the charge against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be trained on U.S. systems and military capabilities,
but that does not mean creating an armed insurrection group to go in
itself as a tripwire [for war]. This is looking at them as support
staff," the administration official added.</TE>
<TE>   To pay for the training, the White House now intends to notify
Congress that it wants to use the $92 million yet to be allocated
from the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act. The measure allows the Pentagon to
provide training, nonlethal goods and services to seven opposition
groups. After the White House notification, Congress then would have
15 days to ask questions or challenge the president's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Of the original $97 million approved by Congress, the Clinton
administration allocated $5 million. So far, only $800,000 has been
spent. About 130 Iraqis have been trained, but all in medical,
computer and communications skills.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Clinton and Bush administrations resisted appeals
from the Iraqi opposition to use unspent funding for military
training or for various military and nonmilitary operations inside
Iraq. Some U.S. officials were concerned that such efforts could draw
the United States into a conflict with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, before any training has begun, the administration's plan
has sparked some controversy, according to Iraqi sources.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Iraqi groups were angered when forms for training by
the U.S. were circulated by the Iraqi National Congress in northern
Kurdistan--without consultations with the two Kurdish groups that
have the only major opposition fighters in Iraq, Kurdish officials
said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi sources said Tuesday that some of the groups eligible for
training are trying to sort out the dispute and coordinate future
recruitment efforts through their London offices.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is also concerned, according to Iraqi sources, about the
impact of strengthening Kurds in tactics that could prove useful in a
possible future bid for an independent Kurdistan on its borders.
Turkey's greatest domestic security issue stems from its own Kurds,
who are agitating for greater autonomy or an independent Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   Key players at the Pentagon, however, have long been pushing to
change the policy against military training. When the act was passed
in 1998, current Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy,
Paul D. Wolfowitz, wrote President Clinton as private citizens urging
him to use the funds for operations inside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony to Congress in 1998, Wolfowitz said: "The heart of
the problem is that the United States is unable or unwilling to
pursue a serious policy in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000 campaign, President Bush promised to fully
implement the act. But the tide did not turn until a meeting last
month with leaders of the reunified Iraqi opposition, when the
administration began closer consultations on both political and
military plans, according to U.S. sources.</TE>
<TE>   "After meeting with the Iraqi opposition ... we decided that this
group is what we've been looking for--a group that can turn the
corner and be a vehicle for hastening Saddam's departure," said a
second administration official.</TE>
<TE>   The diverse Iraqi opposition groups have been notified within the
past two weeks of the administration's intent to offer military
training to as many as 10,000 Iraqis, according to three groups that
represent Shiite and Sunni Muslims and ethnic Kurds. U.S. officials
caution that the number receiving training could be lower.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited about this development. Anyone who can help
the U.S. effort should be given a chance," said Dr. Hatem Mukhlis, a
physician and co-founder of the Iraqi National Movement, one of the
opposition groups.</TE>
<TE>   The training is likely to be outside Iraq, with the forces
empowered to act inside Iraq if Bush makes the determination that the
U.S. will wage a war against Hussein, administration sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In developing options, the administration has explored the
possibility of using some Iraqis as advance teams or forward
observers, which could include assignments such as using laser-guided
systems to identify targets on the ground for U.S. warplanes,
according to Pentagon sources.</TE>
<TE>   Other options under consideration include more sophisticated
military training to enable the forces to target Baghdad's command
and control structure and other key parts of Iraq's infrastructure,
according to the sources.</TE>
<TE>   But these higher-profile options have been scaled back, at least
for now. Under the current plan, the program will focus primarily on
training interpreters, guides and others who can assist in both
Iraq's southern desert terrain and rugged northern mountains. The
plan also includes training new security forces to deal with military
defectors, prisoners of war and possibly local police duties,
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also is going to notify Congress of its intent
to add six more Iraqi groups to the list of opposition forces
receiving U.S. aid and training, the sources added.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sends 200 Troops to Safeguard Americans in Ivory Coast</HD>
<DH>Africa: In a rebel-held city, 161 schoolchildren remain
trapped at their campus in the cross-fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER and DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon dispatched about 200 troops to West Africa on Tuesday to
safeguard 161 American schoolchildren and hundreds of other U.S.
citizens trapped by heavy gunfire in Bouake, a rebel-held city at the
center of a violent uprising in Ivory Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Defense officials declined to give details of the operation, but a
Western diplomat familiar with the region said the troops would try
to get the Americans out of the country, which has been roiled since
Thursday by a coup attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. troops, which include special operations forces, plan to
establish a forward base in nearby Accra, Ghana, to prepare for a
possible move later this week into Ivory Coast, defense officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the U.S. forces are deploying from Germany, according to
officials with the U.S. European Command. The officials said those
troops would link up with other forces in the area and with French
forces already in the country, a former French colony.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. European Command is moving forces to the region to
ensure the safety of American citizens in the wake of the civil
unrest," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Donald Sewell, a Defense Department
spokesman. "The U.S. is committed to ensuring the safety of its
citizens and U.S. forces in the European Command region and remains
ready for any and all contingencies."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer condemned the attempted
coup attempt and the political violence, calling on the parties "to
lay down their arms so that there can be a peaceful resolution."</TE>
<TE>   None of the more than 1,000 Americans known to be in the country
had been harmed by late Tuesday in the fighting, which has left at
least 270 people dead. But Americans in Bouake, the country's
second-largest city, were trapped by heavy gunfire in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stranded Americans are the children, ages 6 to 18,
studying at the International Christian Academy, a boarding school in
Bouake run since 1962 by American church groups for children of
missionaries serving throughout West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The 161 children and 38 administrators, teachers and employees
have been hunkered down in a half-dozen buildings on the campus since
the violence began, said James Forlines, director of Free Will
Baptist Foreign Missions in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, shots were fired for the first time at the school,
which lies in the cross-fire between rebel and government forces,
Forlines said.</TE>
<TE>   The uprising has plunged the country into its worst crisis since
it achieved independence in 1960. Loyalist troops were able to quell
the revolt in Abidjan, the commercial capital, after 12 hours, but
the rebels seized Bouake and the northern city of Korhogo.</TE>
<TE>   The governments of Gambia, Senegal and Sierra Leone are trying to
rescue national soccer team players trapped in a Bouake hotel, where
they were staying during a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   France has sent extra troops and helicopters to reinforce its
permanent presence of 600 troops and to protect 20,000 French
nationals, French officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But United Nations officials worry that many immigrant workers
from neighboring African states are not being protected. Officials
with the U.N. refugee agency reported that since the coup attempt
began, Ivorian police and soldiers have targeted dozens of nationals
from Mali and Burkina Faso, beating them and burning their slum
dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   Ivorian government officials have blamed certain unnamed northern
neighbors, presumably Mali and Burkina Faso, for supporting the
attempted coup.</TE>
<TE>   Malians and Burkinabes make up a large portion of the 5 million
foreign nationals--one-third of Ivory Coast's population--who work on
the country's cocoa and tropical fruit plantations.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim nationals of Mali and Burkina Faso are often perceived
as sympathetic to Ivory Coast's main opposition party, which gets its
strongest support from the Muslim north. Support for the
Christian-dominated government is strongest in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, human rights groups condemned the Ivorian government
for cracking down on local and foreign journalists since the
attempted coup. Editors of four opposition newspapers said they bowed
to government pressure to stop publishing. The BBC also reported that
its correspondent was among two foreign journalists who were briefly
arrested.</TE>

<HD>Singer's Sisters Apparently Abducted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The drama did not end onstage.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Zapata had just finished her performance in "La Casa de
Bernarda Alba," a play that ends with a suicide. Joining in the
standing ovation, witnesses said later, was a man who stalked the
actress and Ernestina Sodi, a former Miss Mexico City, out of the San
Rafael Theater.</LD>
<LD>   Zapata and Sodi, sisters of Mexican superstar singer Thalia,
disappeared five blocks away, after a vehicle blocked the path of
their red Volkswagen Jetta. Hooded men with black gloves and a hammer
smashed the car's windows, witnesses said, and forced the women into
one of two vehicles that had been trailing them.</LD>
<TE>   The incident Sunday night appears to have been the latest in
Mexico's seemingly unstoppable plague of kidnappings. Criminals
extort billions of dollars a year from victims and their companies,
contributing to a feeling among Mexicans--even those who are not
wealthy--that authorities cannot protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Abductions became a leading get-rich-quick scheme in the 1980s,
flourished during the financial crash of 1994-95 and then decreased
somewhat--only to grow more frequent this year. The Mexican business
association Coparmex lists 331 reported cases in 2002, up from 221
last year. In the Americas, only Colombia and Brazil suffer more
abductions. Security experts believe the real number here is four to
five times higher.</TE>
<TE>   Most wealthy families facing a ransom demand do not report
kidnappings to police, because police officers are often accused of
being the perpetrators. Also, kidnap gangs frequently threaten to
kill their hostages to discourage such reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the two sisters declined to discuss the case with
news media and told authorities that they would neither file a
criminal complaint nor welcome police involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "That means they are thinking of paying ransom," Mexico City's top
prosecutor, Bernardo Batiz, told reporters Tuesday. "We completely
respect the family's decision."</TE>
<TE>   The missing women are among the four older sisters of Ariadna
Thalia Sodi Miranda, world renowned as Thalia for such hit songs as
"Amor a la Mexicana" (Love Mexican Style) and such soap opera roles
as that of a poor servant who wins the heart of a rich man. She
performed during last week's Latin Grammys in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Thalia is married to Tommy Mottola, chief executive of Sony Music
Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp. Mexican media speculated that the
gang was trying to extort money from the couple in return for the
sisters' freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Milenio, a Mexico City daily, reported that Thalia and her mother
were en route to Mexico from the United States. It quoted an employee
of Zapata as saying that Zapata's former husband was involved in
ransom negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Batiz said Sunday's incident was a well-organized attack by at
least four men. One witness flagged down a police car, which chased
the gang's vehicles along a major thoroughfare, Circuito Interior, in
the Tlaxpana neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The women's Jetta was found a few blocks from the apparent kidnap
location, along with a gray Ford Windstar van used by the gang.
Police said the van had been stolen last January from a computer
firm.</TE>
<TE>   For all the family's secrecy, the incident received much public
attention and shook Mexico's performing arts community. Zapata, 46,
is a star in her own right, with dozens of Mexican soap opera roles
in a 30-year career. Sodi, a few years younger, is a writer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that in our country, kidnappings are as commonly
discussed as enchiladas," said Leticia Pedrajo, who performed Sunday
with Zapata in the play by Spanish dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca.</TE>
<TE>   "I am dismayed that these things keep happening and nothing is
done about them," Pedrajo said, adding that "you cannot leave your
workplace in peace because you never know whether you're going to
make it home."</TE>
<TE>   After complaints by the Mexican actors union, city officials
agreed to reinforce police patrols outside theaters starting in
February 2001. But the arrangement lapsed a year later during a
change in the city's security hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy families have been known to pay kidnappers as much as $30
million in ransom, but the crime has become so diversified here that
middle-class Mexicans also feel threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Most common is the "express kidnap," in which a victim is
abducted, forced to withdraw money from ATMs and then released.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 such crimes are reported in Mexico each year and are
recorded as violent robberies rather than kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter in Tijuana, seven law students were charged with
kidnapping a 12-year-old girl and demanding $150,000 to pay their
tuition. Maids have been held for a few hundred dollars.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox, elected two years ago, acknowledged this
month that his campaign promise to end such insecurity was still "an
outstanding debt to our citizens."</TE>
<TE>   In his Sept. 1 state of the nation address, however, Fox insisted
that his government was taking action. Federal police, he said, had
broken up 20 kidnap gangs during his administration, arrested 94 gang
members and "resolved" kidnappings involving 142 hostages, all of
whom were freed.</TE>
<TE>   One such gang, rounded up here in July after collecting $3.5
million in ransoms from 11 abductions, allegedly was led by a police
detective and included a former city prosecutor as its "legal
advisor."</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico's weak and corrupt judicial system often lets such
suspects off the hook, discouraging relatives of kidnap victims from
turning to the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Such distrust is evident in the case of the two sisters, and even
more so in the case of Hector Pineda Velazquez.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda, a federal congressman, was seized by masked men from his
ranch in Guerrero state and held for more than a month. His family
did not notify the media or ask the police for help. His son won the
lawmaker's release earlier this month for an undisclosed ransom.</TE>

<HD>Kuwait Exercise Puts Marines Where They Want to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>For the next month, the 1,000 combat Marines from Camp Pendleton who
arrived here Tuesday by sea will be deployed where they say they want
to be at times of crisis: at "the pointy end of the spear."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm out here doing the job I always wanted to do," said Sgt.
Brian Collins, 27, of rural Kansas. "We're trained to move fast and
shoot fast. If called, that's what we'll do."</LD>
<LD>   On the same trackless desert where U.S. forces routed the Iraqi
army in 1991, troops of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit will
conduct live-fire, day-and-night exercises to sharpen skills learned
at a desert fighting facility near Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino
County. A similar exercise was held in recent weeks at an undisclosed
nation in the Persian Gulf region.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Kuwaiti exercise, dubbed Eager Mace, was planned
months ago, the escalating tension between the United States and Iraq
has put the Marines at center stage of a geopolitical hot spot with
an uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines say they wouldn't want it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome to be here," said Lance Cpl. Jason Hardy, 20, of Las
Vegas. "We're trained and we're ready."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the enlisted Marines were in school during Operation
Desert Storm. Some have sought out veterans of that 1991 campaign to
hear what combat was like.</TE>
<TE>   Cpl. Toby Reveles, 21, of Moreno Valley said a sergeant told him
it was a lot like training, just much noisier. Reveles said he
considers the current tension a lucky break.</TE>
<TE>   "I envied the guys from the 15th [Marine Expeditionary Unit] when
they got to go to Afghanistan," Reveles said. "I wished I could have
been there, but now maybe we'll get our chance."</TE>
<TE>   When the joint exercise between Marines and the Kuwaiti military
was planned, the goal was to bolster this desert emirate's sense of
security.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sent here to show the Kuwaitis that we will never let
1990 [when Iraq invaded unopposed] happen again," said Staff Sgt.
Stephen Bright, 32, of Port Orchard, Wash. "Now things are
different."</TE>
<TE>   The speed at which a U.S.-Iraq showdown appears to be approaching
has taken aback some Marines. TV news is available only sparingly on
ship, newspapers arrive days late, and Internet access is limited.</TE>
<TE>   Many Marines and sailors say they have learned most of what they
know about the conflict from e-mails sent by relatives and by that
ever-present mode of military communication: scuttlebutt.</TE>
<TE>   "It really surprised me," said Lance Cpl. Israel Martinez, 28, of
Big Spring, Texas. "I try to keep my mind focused on the training and
not let the news get me all riled up. My wife is concerned, though."</TE>
<TE>   For some more experienced sailors and Marines, the mission here is
deja vu. Russ Lindemann, command master chief aboard the dock landing
ship Mount Vernon, noted that the last time he was in Kuwait was
during Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years later, the same place, the same old problem," he said
while howitzers, tanks and light-armored vehicles were being unloaded
from the vessel for a convoy to a site near Camp Doha, the Army's
rapidly expanding facility.</TE>
<TE>   But for some of the youngest personnel, the trip to Kuwait City is
new, with few reference points. As the Mount Vernon anchored briefly
offshore, several sailors intently scanned the skyline of the
capital, which is dominated by spires and radio towers.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like something out of the Jetsons," said Machinist's
Mate Nicholas Richardson, 20, of Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   For all the expressed eagerness of the young Marines, there were
also expressions of hope that the high-profile exercise will act as a
deterrent to war, a reminder to Iraqis of what happened the last time
they met U.S.-led forces in combat.</TE>
<TE>   One infantry officer, who is reading the works of Chinese
philosopher and military strategist Sun Tsu, was struck by his dictum
that the wise general finds a way to win a war without fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Good advice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Steven Ritchie, commanding officer of the Mount Vernon, said
he hoped two warships and a thousand Marines would get the attention
of President Saddam Hussein and other Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're showing the flag," he said. "By putting Marines ashore,
we're sending a signal to everyone about American resolve." But if
that signal is not received, said Ritchie, a veteran of Desert Storm,
the U.S. military has other options.</TE>
<TE>   "In order for deterrence to be successful, sometimes you have to
swing the bat," Ritchie said. "If we're ordered, we'll swing it and
swing it hard."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Raise Nonviolent Ruckus Over Israel's Moves</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Residents of Ramallah bang pots and pans in the
middle of the night to show their displeasure over curfews and siege
of Arafat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Samir Harb was startled shortly after midnight Monday by the sight of
his 9-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son padding into the living
room in their pajamas, pots and pans in their hands and civil
disobedience on their minds.</LD>
<LD>   It probably shouldn't have surprised him. All of Ramallah was
awake, it seemed, to express its anger over Israel's military
crackdown in a way that has been all too rare in this region of
seething hatred: nonviolently.</LD>
<LD>   But very, very loudly.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday may go down in Palestinian lore as the beginning of the
pots and pans rebellion. Hundreds marched through the streets of
Ramallah, banging on kitchenware, garbage cans and anything else
handy to show their displeasure over months of Israeli-imposed
curfews and last week's assault on the headquarters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat. Thousands more stayed home but
banged away from balconies, out windows and on front porches.</TE>
<TE>   The dead-of-night protest lasted two deafening hours and was
remarkable in at least two ways.</TE>
<TE>   First, both sides showed restraint. Some young Palestinians threw
rocks at Israeli soldiers, and some soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber bullets, but no one was seriously hurt. By the standards of
demonstrations here--two people protesting in Ramallah were killed by
Israeli troops just two nights earlier--it was peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the demonstration was another indication of how the
Israeli siege on the Palestinian headquarters, ordered by Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon to isolate Arafat, has had the effect among
Palestinians of rehabilitating a politician who had been considered
on the ropes just a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of the people who wasn't very impressed with Arafat,"
said Harb, a 35-year-old banker. "But if we feel something against
Arafat, it should be our decision to deal with that. I don't think
Sharon should be the one telling us to change him."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon disagrees, maintaining that Arafat is so untrustworthy a
leader that Israel's security depends on moving him aside.</TE>
<TE>   This point of view, shared by many Israelis, was perhaps best
expressed by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who was quoted this week
as telling European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana: "We
cannot tolerate a situation in which anyone can come and kill us.
This [siege] is taking place because the Palestinians lack anyone
taking responsibility for eliminating acts of terror."</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched the assault on the Muqata, as Arafat's
headquarters complex is known, on Thursday, not long after a
Palestinian suicide bomber struck a crowded bus in Tel Aviv. Six
people, plus the bomber, died as a result of the attack, the second
suicide bombing in two days.</TE>
<TE>   In ordering the surrounding of Arafat's headquarters, and the
destruction of most of it, Israeli officials have charged that it had
become a haven for wanted terrorists. Israel is demanding that the
Palestinians turn over as many as 50 of them. Arafat has refused. The
standoff continued Tuesday with no signs of resolution.</TE>
<TE>   What also continued was the outpouring of sympathy and support for
Arafat, an unthinkable phenomenon to many Israelis, who regard him as
an unreformed terrorist who has at best tolerated, and at worst
sanctioned, repeated attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to understand the mass demonstrations that were held
by Palestinians this week ... in support of Yasser Arafat," the
newspaper Maariv wrote in an editorial Tuesday. "Instead of standing
up to Arafat and his cronies, who represent the failing and tainted
leadership, they go out into the streets and cheer the person who
sentenced them to a life of poverty and shame."</TE>
<TE>   Not all Palestinians would entirely disagree with that assessment.
To many who marched, it was beside the point.</TE>
<TE>   There were two demonstrations in Ramallah on Tuesday--the
pot-banging march in the middle of the night and a more conventional,
smaller rally in the city center in the afternoon. Similar rallies
were held elsewhere in Palestinian communities. In the northern
Israeli town of Nazareth, about 2,000 Israeli Arabs and Jewish peace
activists marched in support of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat, don't be shaken!" chanted the marchers at the second
Ramallah protest.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Arafat," said a middle-aged hotel worker who would give
only his first name, George. "I think he's corrupt." Nevertheless, he
said, he was out protesting "because Sharon is humiliating not only
our people, but our leader. Our leader!"</TE>
<TE>   The midnight march in Ramallah was organized on the fly by a new
group that says it is dedicated to peaceful protest against the
Israeli military occupation and curfews, which have kept hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians from working or going to school.</TE>
<TE>   The group, Nucleus, organized a similar pots-and-pans protest in
April, but it was not nearly as successful, according to Dr. Ahmad
Badran, a Ramallah dentist who is a co-founder. This time, Badran
said, anger over the 24-hour curfews--which are lifted only once
every two weeks or so--boiled over, and some neighborhoods
participated with near unanimity. He said the organizers only had to
post a notice on their Web site and make some phone calls, and word
of mouth did the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The siege against Arafat also played a part, he said. People
wanted to show support "not for Arafat as a person, but as a symbol
of our national struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's popularity has been dwindling, and some Palestinian and
Israeli analysts believed his career was in its twilight this month
when his Cabinet resigned rather than face a no-confidence vote.</TE>
<TE>   Although Arafat was expected to have little difficulty winning
another term as president in elections in January, there was talk of
creating a new post of prime minister that would in effect make the
president a figurehead. Now, reform-minded Palestinians say, that may
all go by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going ahead with reform--and then they do all of this,"
said Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a leading advocate of political reform.
"They are, in my opinion, helping him resist the change."</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Makes Case Against Baghdad to NATO</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary describes briefing for alliance as a
compilation of intelligence data. It apparently also links Hussein to
Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and a CIA official made what
Rumsfeld described as a damning case against Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein to NATO members Tuesday, going beyond showing Hussein's
persistent work on weapons of mass destruction to link his government
to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   The classified briefing largely mirrored the dossier British Prime
Minister Tony Blair released Tuesday, U.S. defense officials said,
but apparently also suggested that Hussein's government knows of and
tolerates Al Qaeda leaders in Iraq. President Bush used a similar
connection--warning about "those who harbor terrorists"--to justify
the war against the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which
described Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a guest.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld said the briefing was a compilation of facts culled from
intelligence gathered by the United States and other nations since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, rather than an analysis and conclusions.
Asked if CIA Deputy Director John E. McLaughlin drew a connection
between Iraq and Al Qaeda in his lengthy intelligence report to
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Rumsfeld said, "Oh
certainly." But he said detailing the link publicly would be "not
helpful" to the Bush administration's war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   He left open the prospect that NATO might participate in a
potential war with Iraq, saying that since the Sept. 11 terror
attacks, the alliance "has accepted fully the risks" posed by weapons
of mass destruction. Bush has said he based his policy of "regime
change" in Iraq on intelligence assessments that Hussein has
continued to develop the kinds of chemical weapons he has used on
Iranian soldiers and Iraqi Kurds and that he is aggressively seeking
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said the briefing offered
new and "highly sensitive information" that left some members asking
tough and searching--but not necessarily hostile--questions.</TE>
<TE>   "The detailed information that was presented today was sobering
and, in many ways, not particularly surprising," Robertson told
reporters afterward. "What we got was a contemporary briefing on the
highest intelligence level on what the United States knows about
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he did not ask NATO members for support in a
potential war with Iraq but expected his colleagues to come to the
same conclusion the U.S. has: Hussein must go.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always found that when people are working off the same set
of facts, they tend to come to quite similar conclusions," he said.
"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts,
but if you're all on the same sheet of music you tend to sing the
same song."</TE>
<TE>   The session failed to persuade French Defense Minister Michele
Alliot-Marie, who told reporters afterward that a war in Iraq could
lead to upheaval among Muslims and would give other nations a
justification for launching preemptive strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is extremely dangerous because it could open all
sorts of possibilities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of the Bush administration's campaign against Iraq by
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and a now-resigned justice
minister who was quoted as likening Bush to Hitler have created a
rift between the U.S. and German administrations. Rumsfeld, who said
Schroeder's comments against a potential war during his recent
election campaign were poisoning the rapport between the two nations,
declined an offer to meet with German Defense Minister Peter Struck
in Warsaw. But Struck tracked Rumsfeld down in an effort to ease
tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday, I shook Rumsfeld's hand, but this has to become more
intensive," Struck said. "I think we'll return to a very normal
working relationship, slowly but surely."</TE>
<TE>   Struck said he hoped Germany's tentative plan, announced Tuesday,
to join with Dutch military officials as the new leaders of the
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan would draw the
nation closer to the United States, which has led the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   As Rumsfeld and McLaughlin outlined U.S. intelligence on Iraq on
the outskirts of Warsaw, a scythe-toting man dressed as the Grim
Reaper and several dozen other demonstrators gathered at the city
center and marched to the U.S. Embassy, where an Iraqi wrapped
himself in his nation's flag, to protest the potential war.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said he was not surprised by Rumsfeld's statement that
he had not considered involving NATO in a potential war on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't really crossed my mind either, and no proposal was put
on the subject today, so it's not really crossing anybody's mind at
the moment," Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   The threats of weapons of mass destruction and terrorists have
prompted NATO leaders to begin planning for a possible revamp that
would make the military alliance more streamlined and able to go
outside its European and North American region. The transformation is
to be the main subject of a more formal Prague summit of heads of
state and government in December. Having launched a transformation of
the Pentagon, Rumsfeld and U.S. military leaders are pressing for a
similar reorganization at NATO.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the secretary proposed that the organization form a
quick-reaction force of 21,000 soldiers who could deploy to hot spots
via land, sea and air within 30 days, a plan that was quickly
embraced by many of those present. As he pitched his plan in a
meeting closed to the public and reporters, he warned that the
relevance of NATO--whose members contributed to the war in
Afghanistan only outside the organization--is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "If NATO does not have a force that is quick and agile which can
deploy in days or weeks instead of months or years, then it will not
have much to offer the world in the 21st century," Rumsfeld said,
according to a senior defense official.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson described the support for the plan as overwhelming,
although a French official said NATO should not operate outside its
members' boundaries. The senior U.S. defense official said none of
the dozen national leaders who spoke on the subject opposed it. The
proposed standing force could take up to two years to assemble and
would therefore be unlikely to participate in a war with Iraq, the
senior defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   "When and if it is created, it certainly could be used in the war
on terrorism," he said.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Bomb Is Years Away, British Say</HD>
<DH>Arms: If sanctions hold, nuclear device will stay beyond
Hussein's grasp, report says. Study reveals effort on uranium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iraq will not be able to produce a nuclear weapon as long as U.N.
sanctions remain effective, and Baghdad is at least five years away
from building a workable nuclear device even if sanctions were
removed, according to a dossier released Tuesday by the British
government.</LD>
<LD>   The report, based on assessments from Britain's intelligence
agencies, provides the most detailed public accounting yet available
of what Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has done to develop nuclear
and other weapons of mass destruction since inspectors from the
United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency were forced
to leave Iraq in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the dossier compiled by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
government backs Bush administration claims that Iraq is actively
pursuing a covert effort to develop nuclear weapons. It discloses for
the first time, for example, that Baghdad has tried to import
"significant quantities of uranium" from Africa since 1998, even
though Iraq has no nuclear power plants and thus "no legitimate
reason to acquire uranium."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and British officials declined to identify the source of the
uranium, but outside experts said authorities have intercepted
uranium smuggled from Gabon and Niger.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the British report discloses that since 1998, Iraq
has repeatedly sought to import specialized machinery, materials and
technology that could be used to construct and operate small gas
centrifuge cascades to produce weapons-grade enriched uranium.</TE>
<TE>   The report notes, for example, that Iraq has made "repeated
attempts" to covertly acquire "60,000 or more" specialized aluminum
tubes that are subject to international export controls because they
can be used to construct gas centrifuges.</TE>
<TE>   In a document released in conjunction with President Bush's Sept.
12 address to the United Nations, the White House said U.S. officials
believe the tubes "were intended as components of centrifuges to
enrich uranium" and thus were proof of Baghdad's nuclear weapons
program.</TE>
<TE>   The British report notes, however, that "there is no definitive
intelligence that [the tubes are] destined for a nuclear program."
Other experts say the tubes also can be used for conventional
artillery in multiple-rocket launch systems.</TE>
<TE>   The British report similarly identifies for the first time a
series of attempts by Baghdad to import "dual use" materials and
technologies that could be employed for benign industrial purposes or
for nuclear weapons development.</TE>
<TE>   Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq has sought to import vacuum pumps that could be used to
create and maintain pressures in a gas centrifuge cascade.</TE>
<TE>   * It has tried to buy "an entire magnet production line" of the
correct specification for use in motors and top bearings of gas
centrifuges.</TE>
<TE>   * It has imported significant amounts of anhydrous hydrogen
fluoride, a gas commonly used in the petrochemical industry but also
needed to convert uranium into uranium hexafluoride for use in gas
centrifuge cascades.</TE>
<TE>   * It has tried to buy a large filament winding machine that could
be used to manufacture carbon-fiber gas centrifuge rotors. It also
has sought to buy a machine that could be used to help balance a
centrifuge while it is operating.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the British report is consistent with U.S.
intelligence. "We wouldn't quibble with it," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   But David Albright, a physicist who worked with the inspections
program in Iraq from 1992 to 1997, said the report was surprising
because the British view the Iraqi nuclear threat as less immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big disagreement with the U.S. over how effective
sanctions are and how close the Iraqis are" to building a bomb, said
Albright, now president of the Institute for Science and
International Security, a Washington think tank. "The British are
saying the threat is not imminent at all."</TE>
<TE>   Most significant, British intelligence concluded early this year
that Iraq "would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon" while
current U.N. sanctions remain effective, according to the report.
Iraq would need "at least five years" to build a bomb if sanctions
were dropped, it adds.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it was able to buy highly enriched uranium or other
fissile material for bomb fuel on the international black market,
Iraq would still need one to two years, the report says. No evidence
indicates that Baghdad has obtained such material from foreign
sources, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Sept. 12 White House paper says Hussein could
build a nuclear bomb "within months" if he obtained fissile material
from abroad. In August, Vice President Dick Cheney warned that
Hussein could acquire a nuclear weapon "fairly soon."</TE>
<TE>   An unpublished U.S. intelligence report is more in line with the
British estimate. It asserts that Iraq could build a nuclear weapon
"by the end of this decade" if sanctions are dropped. "If they can
buy fissile material [from foreign sources], that would drastically
shorten the time," said an intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi crash program to build a bomb was perhaps a year away
from success when it was interrupted in 1991 by the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   After the war ended, inspectors from the United Nations and the
International Atomic Energy Agency uncovered and dismantled a secret
network of about 40 nuclear facilities across Iraq, including sites
used for uranium separation and enrichment and for weapons
development and production.</TE>
<TE>   And in mid-2001, the British dossier  notes, Britain's
intelligence services concluded that after the U.N. inspectors left
Iraq, Baghdad secretly resumed its nuclear weapons research.</TE>

<HD>4 Days After, Hopes for Survivors of Slide in Southern
Russia Dwindling</HD>
<DH>Disaster: More than 100 people caught in path of ice and
mud are most likely dead, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Four days after a huge piece of glacier broke off and went hurtling
down a mountainside, crushing trees, boulders and buildings, hope
faded Tuesday for more than 100 people still missing, among them one
of the most idolized of post-Soviet Russia's new generation of movie
stars.</LD>
<LD>   Director Sergei Bodrov flew to the North Ossetia region of the
Caucasus Mountains hoping for word of his 30-year-old son, also named
Sergei, who was working on a new movie when disaster struck late
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Bodrov achieved cinematic success in the Academy
Award-nominated "Prisoner of the Mountains" and in two crime
thrillers that captured the cynical flavor of 1990s Russia. He had
not been heard of since Friday, nor had any of the 49 members of the
film crew who were with him on the slopes of 16,541-foot Mt. Kazbek.</LD>
<TE>   "It has been four days since the tragedy, and the chances that
anyone else will be found alive are very slim [and] becoming slimmer
and slimmer every hour," said Irina Andrianova, spokeswoman for
Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "Only those who managed to hide have a chance," she said. "Those
who were caught in the mudslide itself and are now under ice have no
chance to survive at all."</TE>
<TE>   "The figures currently stand at nine dead, 31 rescued and more
than a hundred missing," Vladimir Skripak of the search and rescue
service in the republic of North Ossetia said by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions in which our rescue teams have to work are
horrible," he added. "How are they expected to find a hundred people
buried somewhere in the midst of 20 million tons of ice that is mixed
with rock and mud? Almost impossible!"</TE>
<TE>   Andrianova said rescue workers were wading in icy water hip deep,
looking for any signs of life. Debris from the avalanche is sometimes
100 yards deep, she said, making it impossible to imagine anyone
surviving. Even dogs had not been able to detect anything under the
thick blanket of ice and mud.</TE>
<TE>   The calamity stunned residents, who say that such an avalanche
also took place 100 years ago. Authorities have speculated that
global warming might have played a role in destabilizing the glacier.</TE>
<TE>   From the summit to its resting place in the valley six miles
outside the regional center of Vladikavkaz, the glacial mass careered
more than 20 miles downhill, cutting a swath about 1,000 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   Emergencies Minister Sergei K. Shoigu arrived in the region to
take a firsthand look at the devastation, accompanying the elder
Bodrov and his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The only known survivors from the film crew are two members who
happened to leave the area just before the glacier broke apart.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow actor and director Fyodor Bondarchuk, 35, said he
considered the younger Bodrov the first cinematic hero to emerge
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the new hero of our time, the person who this country had
been waiting for. And he already is a legend in Russian cinema," said
Bondarchuk, who said he was clinging to hope that the dark-haired,
boyish-looking Bodrov would be found alive.</TE>
<TE>   Two late-1990s action movies, "Brother" and "Brother II,"
solidified Bodrov's popularity with Russian moviegoers. He played an
embittered army veteran who metes out violent retribution in an
unjust, criminal-infested Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Both films are about a person who takes it upon himself to
dispense justice," Bondarchuk said. "He is the law, and he is forced
to do that in a land of lawlessness. It was something that many
Russian people found very familiar, with so much disorder and
lawlessness in Russia today."</TE>
<TE>   Directed by his father in 1996 in "Prisoner of the Mountains"
(called "Prisoner of the Caucasus" in Russian), Bodrov played a
soldier who embodied and suffered the bitter war experience of normal
Russians in Afghanistan and Chechnya. It has been rare for Russian
cinema to address the Chechen war so honestly, Bondarchuk said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bodrov represents the generation of people 25 to 30 now," he
said. "To many, he is the guy around the corner--someone recognizable
as their neighbor, friend or relative.... I do not even want to think
about what a huge loss Sergei's death would be."</TE>

<HD>Ukraine's Leader Ducks Blows From All Directions</HD>
<DH>Politics: Protesters set up camp outside office while
accusations about arms deal grow stronger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI and MARY MYCIO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>Buffeted by charges that he personally authorized an illegal weapons
shipment to Iraq two years ago, Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma
on Tuesday also had to contend with a coterie of opposition lawmakers
and about 5,000 protesters camping outside his office demanding his
early resignation.</LD>
<LD>   But Kuchma slipped out a side door and likewise seemed prepared to
fend off the latest calls for his ouster, just as he has off and on
for the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Early today, about 50 of the opposition parliament members
remained on the second and third floors of the presidential
administration building and said they were going on a hunger strike.
Kuchma was reported by the Russian news agency Itar-Tass to be
considering meeting with them.</LD>
<TE>   In spite of popular rage over a failing economy, allegations that
Kuchma may have been behind the slaying of a journalist and
frustration that a victory in last year's parliamentary election has
not increased the opposition's power, Kuchma's opponents so far have
failed to bring things to a critical pitch that would lead to his
ouster.</TE>
<TE>   But a new allegation that a secret tape recording captured Kuchma
approving the clandestine sale of Ukraine's new Kolchuga radar system
to Iraq seemed to raise the likelihood of renewed U.S. pressure on
the president.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the fate of Ukraine, a country slightly larger than
France on the eastern fringe of Europe that the United States was
hoping to bring into the community of democracies after the collapse
of the Soviet Union. Over the last 10 years, its economic development
has stalled and Kuchma, in office since 1994, has shown signs of
increasingly authoritarian rule.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,000 people in Kiev marched under cold and cloudy skies
Tuesday to parliament, chanting, "Kuchma out!" Their flags
represented the chief opposition parties: red for the Communists,
pink for the Socialists, white for the centrist Our Ukraine, and
blue, yellow and maroon for the anti-corruption Yulia Tymoshenko
bloc, named for the former deputy prime minister who is one of
Kuchma's most scathing critics.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of confrontation is rising with every day, and we are
entering into a deep political crisis that Ukraine has not seen in 11
years of independence," said former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko,
the leader of Our Ukraine and the leading rival to Kuchma, who has
veered between open challenges to the president and pleas for
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "The essence of the crisis is simple: People voted for certain
people, but the authorities appoint others," Yushchenko said.</TE>
<TE>   Tymoshenko, meanwhile, reiterated the call for Kuchma's
impeachment that she has been making since early last year. "The main
thing that is happening here is that a minority, an absolute minority
[pro-Kuchma parties] has created a majority and continues to run the
country under Kuchma's roof," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The protests Tuesday followed a rally of at least 20,000
protesters Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's demonstrations coincided with an announcement by the
U.S. State Department that it was reexamining its policy toward
Ukraine and "particularly toward President Kuchma."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said about $54 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine had been
temporarily suspended pending the review.</TE>
<TE>   The action came after American officials concluded that a July
2000 recording implicating Kuchma in helping Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein was authentic.</TE>
<TE>   The audiotape records a voice, identified as Kuchma's, authorizing
a secret shipment of Ukrainian-made high-technology radar equipment
to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The tape was part of a series of recordings allegedly made
secretly in Kuchma's office by a disgruntled presidential bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the tapes, revealed earlier, seemed to implicate Kuchma
in a plan to abduct and intimidate journalist and government critic
Georgi Gongadze two years ago. Gongadze was subsequently found slain,
and Kuchma's critics suspect that state security agents carried out
the killing.</TE>
<TE>   In the tape about weapons transfers, purportedly recorded July 10,
2000, Kuchma is allegedly heard talking to an arms export official
and giving a green light for sending a radar system to Iraq that
would make it possible for Iraqi ground stations to monitor U.S.
flights without being detected.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma's press office Tuesday denied the allegations of assisting
Hussein. "Ukraine is prepared to give all information and is open to
all competent international organizations, including U.S. experts on
this issue," it said in a statement. "The president has repeated that
Ukraine did not trade weapons or military technology with Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   According to a transcript, Valery Malev, who was in charge of the
Ukrainian agency for arms exporting, said to Kuchma: "There is a need
for a special operation. We were approached by Iraq through our
Jordanian intermediary. They want to buy four Kolchuga stations and
offer $100 million right away."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested using crates that would disguise the shipment,
according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   The transcript gives this reply from Kuchma: "OK. Go ahead."</TE>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has resolved a bitter debate between the
Pentagon and the State Department about how hard to push for
immediate use of force in a U.N. resolution on Iraq that the U.S. may
present to the Security Council as early as today, U.S. officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But the tough language Washington agreed on may still be at odds
with the closest U.S. allies, signaling a difficult fight ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The differences were resolved when the Pentagon reportedly backed
away from its stance that the U.N. resolution should declare Iraq in
material breach of previous U.N. conditions and therefore conclude
that "no further evidence is needed" to trigger military action if
Baghdad does not show compliance within days. At the State
Department, Middle East specialists had argued that such strong terms
had no chance of Security Council support.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, a U.S. official here familiar with the internal
debate said Tuesday, the administration has ended up with "a more
balanced approach" that may be offered as early as today. The
official requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "But our strategy is and has always been very tough on Iraq," this
official stressed.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration maintains that complete
disarmament--preferably achieved by "regime change"--is its goal but
has made clear that it has no faith in the U.N. weapons inspections
program. The stance puts the U.S. on a collision course with the
other 14 Security Council members, who want to give inspectors a
chance before resorting to military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "Inspectors are one way to disarmament," said a U.S. official,
"but it has proven not to be a good way. Disarmament is the key, and
regime change is the only way to guarantee it." An upcoming meeting
between the U.N. chief inspector and Iraqi authorities "isn't even on
our radar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four Security Council members who could veto a U.S.
resolution, France and Russia have been the furthest from the U.S.
position.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, while holding
firm on the threat of force, appeared also to distance Britain from
Washington's skepticism about the inspection process.</TE>
<TE>   "We want disarmament to work through inspections," said
Greenstock. "That is the key for the U.K. We are focused on
disarmament. The resolution is going to be focused on disarmament.
Whatever decision the U.S. makes on anything else is for the U.S.
alone."</TE>
<TE>   His comments suggested that the U.S. may face a tougher than
expected fight to reach agreement on a resolution that it considers
goes far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The French are holding to their argument for two separate
resolutions, one to empower the weapons inspectors and, if necessary,
a later one to authorize use of force.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not prepared to give a blank check for military action,"
said Ginette de Matha, a spokeswoman for the French U.N. mission.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's developments came as President Bush kept up his tough
rhetoric on Iraq, again declaring that the U.S. is prepared to leave
the U.N. behind if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't trust this man," Bush said of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein after a Cabinet meeting. "For 11 years, he's ignored the
United Nations, and for 11 years he has stockpiled weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I again call for the United Nations to pass a strong resolution
holding this man to account," he added, "and if they're unable to do
so, the United States and our friends will act, because we believe in
peace."</TE>
<TE>   The president's comments followed Hussein's insistence last week
that weapons inspectors must respect Iraqi sovereignty, a term the
White House interpreted to mean that he was keeping "presidential
sites" off-limits to monitors without Iraqi escorts.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council would like to pass a resolution strengthening
the powers of the monitoring program before Monday, when chief
weapons inspector Hans Blix is to meet with Iraqi officials in Vienna
to discuss practical arrangements for his teams' work. U.S. delays in
introducing the resolution might mean that Blix will begin talks with
an outdated mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the inspectors would not be allowed to make
unaccompanied visits to the presidential sites--vast tracts of land
surrounding presidential palaces that encompass hundreds of buildings
where weapons materials or labs could be concealed. The U.S. insists
a 1998 agreement between the Iraqis and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan setting the terms for inspecting those sites must be nullified
with a new resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Blix has outlined a 60-day period for inspectors to revisit old
sites and reequip before starting official inspections. The teams are
then expected to report to the council on Iraq's compliance every 120
days, unless they are blocked or find something.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain would like to compress this timeline to
coordinate it with the best season for a potential military
strike--December through March, when the weather is cool enough for
soldiers to wear full protective gear against chemical or biological
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this jostling, potentially powerful opponents to an immediate
strike against Iraq find themselves weakened, either unable or
unwilling to bring their influence to bear on the issue. For example,
any possibility that continental European allies might try to weigh
in with a common stance in effect disappeared with German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's rejection of military action against Iraq under
any circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's controversial stance was made in the thick of a
political campaign that ended in his reelection Sunday and was
assumed specifically to appeal to anti-American sentiments among
left-wing voters. His position was apparently taken without
consultation with France or other allies. Although weak individually,
America's continental European allies have managed in the past to
influence U.S. policy when they have presented a united position.</TE>
<TE>   "The Europeans are in disarray thanks to Schroeder," noted
Francois Heisbourg, a former senior French Defense Ministry official
who now chairs the Geneva Center for Security Policy. "Maybe they can
put something together, but right now, at this important time, there
is no [common] European stance."</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair's release Tuesday of a
dossier detailing Hussein's continued effort to develop weapons of
mass destruction is likely to dampen public opposition to Blair's
tough stand and make it far harder for critics to attack Britain's
close alignment with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, congressional opposition to a swift strike against
Iraq has weakened markedly in recent days. Although few Democrats
have mounted frontal opposition to Bush's request, those who have
have welcomed the support they got Monday when former Vice President
Al Gore gave a speech criticizing the apparent rush to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), a leading voice of antiwar
sentiment, said he hoped Gore's speech would help move more Democrats
into the camp opposing a military conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an excellent speech and showed real leadership," Feingold
said. "I hope it causes members of the Senate and House to come out
and say, 'What are our priorities?' "</TE>
<TE>   Two House Democrats who have opposed military action announced
that they will be leaving today for a trip to Iraq. Reps. Jim
McDermott (D-Wash.) and David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) will become the
second and third members of Congress to make such a trip in recent
weeks, following a visit by Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.) in late
August.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Bonior said he wanted to "observe the
humanitarian conditions on the ground" a decade after the last war in
the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to be looking at what we did 10 years ago before we
engage in a second major military action against Iraq," the
spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Inside the Minds of Arsonists</HD>
<DH>Not even the most skilled investigators fully understand
criminals' motives. But for one man, setting fires was a way to get
recognition.</DH>

<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching as fire torched dry brush and threatened expensive homes
near Escondido, Steve Robles felt exhilarated and scared.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old had arrived on the scene before fire crews,
looking like any other firefighter in a heavy coat, boots and
goggles. He immediately began knocking on doors, warning homeowners
of the looming danger.</LD>
<LD>   But the fire grew and soon Robles was trapped. Flames charged down
a hill toward him, swallowing sunbaked weeds, backyard sheds and
anything else that would burn, including at least one house.</LD>
<TE>   Then, miraculously, just as the flames bore down on Robles and a
firefighter who had arrived with a hose, the winds shifted. One home
was lost, but the men saved two others. For the moment, Robles was
the firefighting hero he always wanted to be.</TE>
<TE>   But the truth was far different. Less than a month later, he was
arrested on suspicion of arson while driving away from another
wildfire in his white Ford Bronco with "FIRE" stenciled in red on
front and back. The vehicle's lights were rigged to flash like an
emergency vehicle's. But Robles was not a firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Robles would confess to setting the Escondido fire and
six others in the same area that summer in 1997, using a method he
picked up from a reality television show called "L.A. Firefighters."
The blazes torched hills and horse farms east of San Diego and turned
13 homes to ash.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, as Robles sits in a prison cell serving an
18-year sentence, authorities are bracing for the peak of
California's fire season and the possibility that others like Robles
will attempt to purge their inner demons the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "You put them away and there is another to take their place every
year," said John Adkins, an arson investigator with the California
Department of Forestry who arrested Robles.</TE>
<TE>   Arson caused almost $9 million in property losses in California
last year and sent 17 firefighters to hospital emergency rooms,
according to state fire marshals. Since June, four people have been
arrested for setting wildfires in Arizona, California and Colorado;
two of them were firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   One of the firefighters, a 19-year-old San Diego man, was arrested
Aug. 28 not far from where Robles set his fires and was charged with
starting five blazes that destroyed two homes. Arson investigators
said another, more recent wildfire that burned nearly 1,100 acres in
the Glendale foothills is also suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Experts expect 20% to 30% of the nation's wildfires this year to
be the work of arsonists, and not even the most skilled investigators
fully understand why. But they say these criminals' motives range
from simple vandalism or insurance fraud to an emotional jolt that
comes from wreaking havoc--from seeing the flames rise and the fire
crews scramble to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   "They are angry," said Eric Hickey, a criminologist at Cal State
Fresno who has conducted studies of serial arsonists for the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "Some do it for
attention.... They want to be recognized."</TE>
<TE>   The day Robles was arrested in 1997, he complained to
investigators that other students had teased him because he struggled
in school and was assigned to classes for slow learners. Although he
had a thick build and knew how to defend himself, Robles said, he
never fought back.</TE>
<TE>   And he never mentioned the verbal jabs to anyone. But in junior
high school, Robles began slicing bloody tracks across his arms with
a razor blade--his way of coping with the taunts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was shy and more sensitive than other boys in school, said his
mother, Erlinda, who goes with her husband to visit their youngest
son at the state prison near Chula Vista every two weeks. In
contrast, Robles' two older half brothers had excelled in school and
went on to raise families and to establish successful careers in
telecommunications and sales.</TE>
<TE>   When Robles reached high school, he started--but didn't
finish--Police Explorer and Junior Firefighter programs (he did
complete a two-week "Junior Pups" adventure at Camp Pendleton, run by
the Marines). After graduation, Robles signed on with a local
volunteer fire department, a first step toward the California
Department of Forestry he longed to join.</TE>
<TE>   Things soon began to look up, said Robert Madruga, the San Diego
County deputy district attorney who witnessed Robles' interrogation
and later prosecuted him.</TE>
<TE>   "His whole focus became being a firefighter," Madruga said. "He
had realized that he wasn't going to get where his brothers were and
this was the way he could contribute. He could be the hero."</TE>
<TE>   In a Sparky the firedog costume, carrying a Smokey Bear key chain,
Robles tagged along with state firefighters when they gave fire
safety presentations at San Diego County elementary schools. Tucked
in the driver's side sun visor of his truck were pictures of
wildfires he had helped fight. For his 1996 driver's license picture,
Robles wore the navy blue uniform of his volunteer unit.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were proud. In their living room, pictures of Robles
in the uniform were displayed near portraits of him with his
girlfriend at the high school prom. The only thing missing now was a
paid firefighting position. It was a job Robles would never get. He
scored below average on firefighting exams and eventually was asked
to leave his volunteer unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a volunteer fireman is like being a minor league baseball
player," said Kenneth Elliot, Robles' defense attorney. "If you are
not going to move up, they move you out. He was not going to be a
firefighter. When it was taken away from him, he felt he could create
his own success."</TE>
<TE>   He tried to do that, Madruga told a jury at Robles' 1998 trial, by
setting fires.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire is an excellent method to communicate for people who have
difficulty asserting themselves," said Jeffrey Geller, a professor of
psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has
treated serial arsonists. "Fire is simple. It doesn't require you to
talk to anybody and initiate a conversation or explain your needs.
The likelihood is high that you will get your message across."</TE>
<TE>   It also can be an attempt to exercise power, said Timothy G. Huff,
a former arson profiler for the FBI who spent 10 years teaching fire
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   From interviews he conducted with more than 150 arsonists locked
up in state prisons, county jails and mental institutions, Huff and
three other experts conducted what is considered the definitive study
of the mind of the arsonist.</TE>
<TE>   Most arsonists want "revenge against a person or against a group
or against society," Huff said. "It's like, 'I created the damage.
I'm empowered, for once.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robles appeared more interested in recognition than power. He
declined to be interviewed by The Times, but since the day he was
arrested has said that he did not intend to burn homes or injure
people.</TE>
<TE>   "It had something to do with wanting to feel important and part of
something," according to a probation officer's report, presented at
Robles' sentencing hearing, that recommended against probation. "He
set the fires so that he could be called to fight them. He got
satisfaction from fighting the fires rather than setting them."</TE>
<TE>   Near tears during a lengthy session in an interview room at the
Escondido Police Department, Robles told investigators that when he
set fires he would enter a state that was "like a dream." He also
said he set the fires to show people "that life isn't all that
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Robles set the fires while on his lunch break from his
job as a shuttle driver for a Nissan dealership near his Escondido
home, Madruga said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles would prowl secondary roads for the right patch of secluded
brush and pull over. He would light a cigarette, roll it in a
matchbook like he'd seen on TV and toss it out the passenger window
of the Bronco. While waiting the six or seven minutes it took the
fire to ignite, he would position himself to do what he loved more
than anything: appear as the "first responder"--the guy on the front
line who is already battling the blaze when fire crews arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when he thought he was alone, Robles was surprised by two
passersby who stopped to ask what he was up to, according to the
probation officer's report. Just looking for a rock, Robles told the
pair. Later, after a fire in the area had blackened 450 acres and
destroyed 11 homes, the onlookers called the Escondido Fire
Department to report the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   The tip would eventually lead investigators to Robles. On the day
he set his last fire, they pulled him over on an isolated road and,
with guns drawn and trained dogs in tow, ordered him out of his
truck. It was like something from an episode of "Cops," Robles said
later.</TE>
<TE>   Several brush fires in northern San Diego County before the 1997
flurry remain unsolved, and "[Robles] is on the list of suspects,"
Madruga said. The largest was the Harmony Fire a year before his
arrest. That blaze blackened more than 24,000 acres near Carlsbad and
destroyed 120 houses.</TE>
<TE>   Until the day he was caught in an elaborate operation involving
air surveillance and secret cameras, Robles had bargained that
setting the fires and then alerting homeowners to the advancing
flames would earn him another chance as a firefighter, Madruga said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was convinced that the point was going to come when he was
going to be ... highly recognized as this wonderful person," Madruga
said while sifting through boxes of photos and other evidence from
the trial. The forest service "wouldn't have a choice but to hire
this guy."</TE>
<TE>   It was in this hope that Robles had set, then fought, the
Escondido fire in 1997. One of the two homes lost that day belonged
to Adnan Derbas. His 1930s-era house sat on 350 acres with a view of
Lake Hodges and the foothills and ranchland northeast of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Derbas said he has a "bad feeling" about the place now and rarely
returns. Only the concrete slab and parts of a wall and a chimney
remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is a guy who caused me tremendous havoc who doesn't even
know my name," said Derbas, who now lives with his family in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Robles is sorry for what he did, said his mother, who keeps a
candle burning for him on her fireplace mantel 24 hours a day. He
told her the days of setting fires are behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "He still wants to help people in the fire area," she said. "He
told me he would have been out there fighting those [recent] fires.
He just wishes he could be helping. But I told them they don't let an
arsonist have a second chance."</TE>

<HD>Black Leaders Angered by Scene Say 'Barbershop' Needs a
Trim</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Some are irate at irreverent references to Parks,
King and Jackson. MGM won't alter its film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ and GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By almost any measure, the movie "Barbershop" is a Cinderella success
story for Hollywood's black creative community. Written, produced and
directed by African Americans and featuring a cast of popular black
entertainers, it's also been the No. 1 movie in America for two
weekends running.</LD>
<LD>   Yet instead of being a cause for celebration, "Barbershop" has
touched off a furor among some of the nation's black leaders over the
movie's less-than-reverent references to civil rights figures Rosa
Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   While Hollywood is often accused of political incorrectness and
racial insensitivity, the commercial and critical success of this
film, due in large part to black moviegoers, makes this lighthearted
comedy an unusual target for the uproar in black media outlets and
radio stations.</LD>
<TE>   Although the film is shaping up as one of the most successful
movies with a strong African American theme, leaders such as Jackson,
the Rev. Al Sharpton and members of Parks' and King's families are
incensed over one scene that pokes fun at Parks, King and Jackson.
They have called for a public apology from the filmmakers and
demanded that MGM remove the scene from its eventual home video
release. Sharpton has gone so far as to threaten a boycott of the
film if MGM does not reply to their requests by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Chris McGurk said he
was blindsided by the criticism, considering the film has a positive
message and has been embraced by African American audiences. He said
the studio would not issue an apology and would not censor the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "This movie is about freedom of speech in the barbershop whether
it's right or wrong or indifferent," McGurk said. "It's one fictional
character in the movie who is saying that and the 20 other people in
the barbershop disagree and shout him down."</TE>
<TE>   The film's producers, George Tillman Jr. and Bob Teitel, and
director Tim Story declined interview requests. Tillman, Teitel,
Story and writer Don Scott, however, did send an apologetic letter to
Sharpton on Monday saying they "in no way meant to belittle any of
the contributions made by these fine individuals and your
organization to our community and society as a whole." In the letter,
they say they will send letters to Parks, Jackson and the King
family.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who has not seen the movie but read a version of the
script, contended there are certain historical figures who should
never be disrespected.</TE>
<TE>   "You would not make Golda Meir the butt of a joke--it's sacred
territory," said Jackson in a telephone interview. "While we support
these actors, we still must have some line of dignity. That is
nonnegotiable."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who has been outspoken about the low numbers of blacks
represented in movies and TV, infuriated many in Hollywood with his
protest outside the 1995 Oscars. Many African American filmmakers at
the time said protests were not the way to get Hollywood to make more
movies about and starring blacks. Even ceremony host Whoopi Goldberg
made a point of criticizing Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbershop," which stars Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer, has
grossed about $40 million, and has hit a chord among all age groups.
It has begun to cross over to a broader audience, although as of last
weekend 60% of the audience was still African American.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the black creative community expressed outrage at the
campaign against the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are we knocking our own success?" said producer Walter
Latham, the creator behind the successful "The Original Kings of
Comedy" tour and film that featured Cedric the Entertainer and other
top black comedians.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot believe that finally there is this success at the box
office, there is forward momentum, and the negativity is coming from
the same people who are always saying we need more blacks in TV, more
blacks in the movies. There's got to be a better way to criticize
people."</TE>
<TE>   Latham added that the controversy will hurt other black filmmakers
because studios will be reluctant to get involved with urban
material. "Because of this success, I and other producers could have
set up movies like this. This movie has made a huge impact. But now
we've taken a step backward," Latham said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, Latham said, could have approached the makers of
"Barbershop" privately instead of making his concerns public.</TE>
<TE>   Another defender of the movie, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary A.
Mitchell, wrote, "The beauty of 'Barbershop' is that it peels back
the curtain and lets the world eavesdrop on the conversation that
black folks can have when white people aren't around. That's the real
barbershop--and beauty shop for that matter."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who is African American, went on to say, "What remained
was the good feeling you have when you know that despite the
struggles black folks have gone through, we can still laugh at
ourselves and each other."</TE>
<TE>   Lately there have been several films starring African Americans
that have performed well commercially, including "Martin Lawrence
Live: Runteldat," "Friday" and its sequel, and "The Original Kings of
Comedy."</TE>
<TE>   The brouhaha over "Barbershop" involves one two-minute scene
played by Cedric the Entertainer. In jabs at Parks, King and Jackson,
Cedric's character, Eddie, declares, "Rosa Parks ain't do nothin' but
sit ... down." Despite protests from others in the barbershop, he
goes on to describe King in less than flattering terms, and when one
person brings up Jackson, he retorts with profanity. But these
remarks are part of a larger, biting monologue where Cedric's
character takes swipes at numerous other controversial figures in the
black community, including Rodney King and O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Sharpton fired off a letter to MGM President Michael
Nathanson, requesting a meeting and asking for a public apology from
the filmmakers. As of late Tuesday, Sharpton said he had not heard
from the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to hear a response and we will see if [a boycott] becomes
necessary," he said. "If they don't respond, then we must question
people's intentions."</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Steele, a longtime friends of Parks and co-founder of the
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute in Detroit, said Parks was never
consulted about the salty dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Steele, who sent a letter Tuesday to MGM Chief Executive Officer
Alex Yemenidjian, said she had gotten a lot of calls from people who
were very upset.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the movie producers] are talking about coming out with an
apology," she said, noting that she had not seen the film. "I'm
waiting for one. It's horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Among audiences, reaction seemed mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Kalister Green-Byrd, 68, a retired educator who lives in
Haverhill, Mass., said she was outraged by the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely livid," said Green-Byrd. "I grew up in Alabama,
and I was devastated that they would defame Rosa Parks and those who
were so instrumental in the civil rights movement. I didn't like the
whole movie. It was a poor portrayal of black people. I just didn't
see the humor in it."</TE>
<TE>   Andre Brooks, 19, a film student at Cal State Los Angeles, also
said he found the scene offensive. He saw the film in August at the
National Assn. of Black Journalists convention in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see what they were trying to do with the comedy, but I
feel they went a bit too far," Brooks said. "I love the concept, I
love Cedric, but I didn't think those jokes were appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   But outside the Whittier Village Cinemas, Jonathan Ornelas, 28, a
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, said, "I didn't see it as
demeaning at all. It's just the element they are in. They are in a
barbershop."</TE>
<TE>   John Romero, 52, of Pico Rivera agreed. "Cedric was capping on
everybody--this is part of the lingo, part of life in the
barbershop," he said. "I grew up in Echo Park. I didn't grow up in
the black community, but I didn't think it was degrading."</TE>

<HD>Blaze Closes Angeles Forest</HD>
<DH>Fire: The recreational area is declared off limits to
visitors as flames burn 18,000 acres. Hundreds are evacuated, health
advisories are issued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A raging wildfire that has scorched 18,000 acres of Angeles National
Forest and prompted evacuations from upscale homes caused the
shutdown of one of California's most popular recreational areas
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of the national forest, effective until rains bring
the end of the fire season, is the first in more than 25 years. Each
year, 3.2 million campers, hikers and others ply the trails and enjoy
the recreational areas of the Angeles, according to forest service
officials.</LD>
<LD>   The flames, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles, created a mantle
of smoke that polluted the air from San Bernardino to Pasadena,
causing officials to advise residents to avoid outside activities and
canceling outside play time for schoolchildren.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Martin Esparza said the fire, which
was of unknown origin, remained active on three separate fronts:
east, southeast and west, although the flames moved away from homes
in some areas Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people were evacuated and the flames threatened about
1,000 structures, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman
Mark Whaling. Some buildings were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The national forest closure was an "extreme measure taken for
reasons of public safety," said Forest Service spokesman Bruce
Quintelier.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was only 8% contained by midafternoon Tuesday and was not
expected to be under control for several days, Quintelier added.
Officials said higher temperatures could lead to new flare-ups this
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 2,000 firefighters battled the blaze in the San Gabriel
Mountains, which could be seen from homes and freeways across a broad
section of the region. Jagged terrain and choking smoke were major
obstacles, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out Sunday evening on the east fork of the San
Gabriel River. Nearby Camp Williams and Camp Follows were evacuated
that night. About 44 recreational dwellings were destroyed; officials
believe they ranged from primitive shacks to second homes.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday and Tuesday, homes in San Dimas, Claremont, Glendora, La
Verne and a 300-home community named Mt. Baldy Village above Upland
were evacuated as flames ripped through the foothills.</TE>
<TE>   "You could literally feel and hear the whistling of the fire,"
said Daniel McGuire, 20, who helped his parents evacuate from their
home of 14 years. "It was just whooshing by you."</TE>
<TE>   McGuire ran through his home, urging his mother to keep packing
until the last possible minute. "Focus, Mom, focus!" he shouted as he
loaded four cars with the family's belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bright red, like an atom bomb had just hit," said Tim
Durfield, 30, gesturing toward the smoke-covered hill, dotted with
flames, just behind the house where he lives with his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "When you buy a home this close to the foothills, the scenery is
great but the danger is also great," Durfield's father, Rick, said
with a sigh. "This is a risk that you take."</TE>
<TE>   The two men spent all Monday night and Tuesday morning cooking
meals and feeding the firefighters who gathered on the street by
their home. On Tuesday morning, the firefighters ignited a controlled
burn close to the Durfields' house and neighboring homes, hoping to
eliminate brush that could serve as fuel. By setting the burn in the
morning, firefighters believed they would save the homes, which would
be in greater danger when the afternoon winds picked up.</TE>
<TE>   At midday, the scheme appeared to have worked. The blaze had
progressed up the hill, away from homes, rather than down. While the
scrubby land just 30 yards away smoldered, Rick Durfield, a
psychology professor at Azusa Pacific University, said he felt relief
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to concern over saving homes, there was another worry:
air quality. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a
special advisory, forecasting unhealthful levels of fine particulates
in areas affected by smoke.</TE>
<TE>   County health officials urged residents to take precautions such
as keeping their doors and windows closed. They advised those
traveling in cars to roll up their windows and set ventilation
systems to recirculate.</TE>
<TE>   Although air quality was expected to be good to moderate in most
parts of Los Angeles County on Tuesday, pollution levels were
anticipated to reach unhealthful levels in areas affected by the
smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Those areas included the east San Fernando Valley, most of the San
Gabriel Valley, Pomona-Walnut Valley, Norco-Corona, metropolitan
Riverside County and most of the San Bernardino Valley, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exceptionally smoky from Pasadena east to San Bernardino as
a result of the fires, and some smoke has even slipped into the San
Fernando Valley," said Joe Cassamassi, a meteorologist with the AQMD.
"This is due to a strong high-pressure area and stagnant conditions
resulting from light winds. "</TE>
<TE>   Cassamassi said the air district urged people to stay indoors as
much as possible and to limit outdoor excursions.</TE>
<TE>   People with heart disease, asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung
diseases are particularly vulnerable to ill effects from poor air
quality.</TE>
<TE>   School officials near the fire area heeded the advisory.</TE>
<TE>   At La Verne Heights Elementary School, where 407 students are
enrolled, children were kept inside throughout the day, said health
clerk Ulrike Fogg. No playground time was allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, had the luxury of thinking about the air
quality. Ross Banks, 38, an executive with a printing company,
worried about the destruction of his brand-new home in a neighborhood
that he loved because he could hear owls hoot at night.</TE>
<TE>   Banks and his family were initially told they would have an hour's
notice before they were evacuated from the home that they moved into
six months ago. Then a police officer announced that they had 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Banks' 6-year-old daughter, Megan, snatched up her dolls. Kyle, 7,
got his playing cards; Tyler, 8, grabbed his collection of football
and hockey memorabilia. Ashley, 11, took the books that her
grandparents had given her. Banks and his wife collected photographs,
pictures and documents.</TE>
<TE>   Banks dropped off the kids at their grandparents' in San Dimas,
and returned to hose down the house. At 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, filthy and
exhausted, he went to sleep on the floor. After a few hours, he awoke
with a slightly new perspective on the place he calls home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quiet, peaceful, and serene--those are the advantages," he
said. Then Banks turned to face a hillside where flames still burned.
"This, obviously, is the disadvantage."</TE>

<HD>Sting Leads to Sex Abuse Charge Against Ex-Priest</HD>
<DH>Catholics: Orange man's arrest is the first to result from
molestation allegations in Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County authorities arrested a former Catholic priest Tuesday
on suspicion of sexually abusing a teenage girl in the 1970s after
the man allegedly confessed to an undercover deputy posing as his
out-of-wedlock daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald John Plesetz, 59, of Orange is the first priest to be
criminally charged with sexually abusing victims in Los Angeles or
Orange counties since the Roman Catholic sex scandal broke nine
months ago. Plesetz, who left the priesthood in the late 1970s and
works as an administrator for the Orange County Health Care Agency,
was charged with three counts of oral copulation with a minor under
the age of 16. It's unclear why prosecutors did not charge him with
statutory rape; they accuse Plesetz in court documents of
impregnating the girl.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the Orange County district attorney's office said
that in child abuse cases, the statute of limitations does not begin
until the victim comes forward no matter how long ago the alleged
crime occurred. Charges must be filed within a year of that date.</LD>
<TE>   Plesetz's arrest caps a four-month investigation into crimes
authorities said occurred from 1972 to 1974, when Plesetz was a
pastor at St. Edward Catholic Church in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   It comes as advocates for victims of priest abuse criticize law
enforcement for not filing criminal charges in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim, identified in the criminal complaint as "Janet
M.," first met the priest when she was a 13-year-old singer in the
church choir.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charge that Plesetz repeatedly abused her--acts that
ended when she became pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   The priest met with the girl's parents and arranged to pay all
expenses related to the pregnancy, according to court records. The
baby girl, Jennifer, was put up for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities became aware of the incident in June, when Janet M.
filed a complaint with the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Amormino, a sheriff's spokesman, said he didn't know why she
decided to come forward. "I don't know if she lived that long with
anger or what had happened," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators set up a sting two weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   It began July 1 when the woman called Plesetz and told him that
the daughter she had given up for adoption 27 years ago wanted to
meet him.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding me--that's Jen, Jennifer?" said Plesetz in a
secretly taped phone conversation detailed in the criminal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Plesetz met with Janet M. and an undercover
sheriff's deputy posing as her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted having intercourse with the woman and impregnating
her, according to the complaint. Speaking to the deputy that he
believed was his daughter, Plesetz described the mother as "a young
girl who was going through womanly changes and she was very
aggressive. She was beautiful, talented and she knew what she
wanted," according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   On July 3, sheriff's investigators confronted Plesetz, and he
confessed to the crimes, prosecutors said in court records.</TE>
<TE>   But he was not arrested at that time. The case was temporarily
shelved because of the high-profile July 15 kidnapping of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion, which diverted department resources.Detectives
continued to build their case over the last two months and arrested
Plesetz at his home Tuesday. He was being held late Tuesday at the
Men's Central Jail in Santa Ana on $50,000 bail. He is scheduled to
be arraigned Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz is the fifth priest from St. Edward Catholic Church to be
accused of abusing minors over the last three decades. None of the
other priests have been charged.</TE>
<TE>   "We're shocked, saddened and heartsick," said Bishop Tod D. Brown
of the Diocese of Orange, after being told of the arrest. "Our hearts
go out to the victim."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for victims of priest abuse described the arrest as a
milestone. "I think when victims hear about this arrest it's going to
give them hope," said Mary Grant, a Los Angeles-based director of
Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. "It's been a long
process for victims--hundreds have come forward. This is a sign that
this is being taken seriously."</TE>
<TE>   While the Catholic Church in Southern California and across the
nation has paid out millions of dollars to abuse victims who filed
civil suits, criminal charges against priests remain relatively rare.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmed in by statute of limitations laws, faded memories, little
corroborating evidence and the power of the priesthood and Catholic
Church, prosecutors have put few clerics in jail for sexually abusing
minors.</TE>
<TE>   Covertly recorded phone calls and meetings are an increasingly
common device for gathering evidence in decades-old abuse cases where
evidence is slim.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Catholic officials are bracing for possible
indictments of 15 current and former priests on felony sex charges,
according to law enforcement sources. In Orange County, a handful of
priests are under criminal investigation.</TE>

<CX>   Ex-priest's arrest--A story in Section A on Wednesday reported that
Gerald John Plesetz of Orange was the first priest to be criminally
charged with sexually abusing a victim in Los Angeles or Orange
counties since the Roman Catholic sex scandal broke nine months ago.
But the sub-headline erroneously called it the first such arrest in
the Southland. A Pomona priest was arrested in April on four counts
of lewd conduct with two girls in Fontana between 1997 and 2001.</CX>

<HD>U.S. Downgrades Terror Alert Level From 'Orange' to
'Yellow'</HD>
<DH>Security: Potential attack operations were disrupted but
risk remains, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Administration officials on Tuesday lowered the terrorism alert level
from "code orange," which indicates a high risk of attack, to "code
yellow," saying the likelihood of a terrorist strike has lessened but
that the Al Qaeda network still has operatives in the United States
bent on attacking Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The threat assessment level was elevated one notch two weeks ago
for the first time since it was established last March because
authorities said they had received intelligence information about
potential strikes keyed to the first anniversary of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge, head of
homeland security, cited the disruption of potential terrorist
operations in the United States and abroad as the reason for
downgrading the threat level. Those included the recent arrest of six
U.S. citizens near Buffalo, N.Y., who have been accused of providing
support to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<TE>   Ashcroft and Ridge also said in a statement that senior Al Qaeda
operatives have been captured in Pakistan, and that other lower-level
members of the group have been apprehended in Singapore, Yemen and
Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to emphasize that we are not saying there is no risk,"
Ashcroft said at a news conference on an unrelated matter. "We
consider the risk to still be an elevated risk. It's a very serious
risk. And we ask for citizens to remain alert."</TE>
<TE>   In their joint statement, Ashcroft and Ridge said the lowering of
the threat level was "not a signal to government, law enforcement or
citizens that the danger of terrorist attack is passed."</TE>
<TE>   "Detained Al Qaeda operatives have informed U.S. intelligence and
law enforcement officials that Al Qaeda will wait until it believes
Americans are less vigilant and less prepared before it will strike
again," they said.</TE>
<TE>   The change in status, approved by President Bush, came after Bush
met with senior administration officials who review daily
intelligence and law enforcement information and weigh the potential
for attacks on U.S. targets. The threat level was raised two weeks
ago after intelligence agencies warned that Al Qaeda-affiliated
terrorists in South Asia were planning car bombings or other attacks
on American facilities abroad on or around the anniversary of the

<HD>Armey's Remarks Assailed</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmaker's comments were a 'personal attack' on
Jews, Democrats say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), the No. 2 leader in the
House, has come under fire for comments that Democratic critics said
amounted to a "personal attack" on American Jews who do not share his
conservative views.</LD>
<LD>   Armey, speaking at an event in Florida on Friday, was quoted by a
local paper as saying: "I always see two Jewish communities in
America: one of deep intellect and one of shallow, superficial
intellect.</LD>
<LD>   "Conservatives have a deeper intellect and tend to have
occupations of the brain in fields like engineering, science and
economics," Armey said, while liberals flock to "occupations of the
heart."</LD>
<TE>   Armey, who is retiring from Congress this year, is known for his
blunt-spoken, often controversial commentary. His Florida comments
came during a discussion on the Middle East, in response to a
question about why the Jewish American community seemed divided along
ideological lines.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democratic Party leaders issued a statement Tuesday condemning
Armey for what they called "disparaging comments ... about the
millions of Jews and other Americans who happen to disagree with his
right-wing ideology."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), head of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, and Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas), former chair of
the House Democratic Caucus, said in a blistering statement: "Seldom
has the Congress become a better institution due to the departure of
a member of the House leadership. However, it has become clear that
the House will become a more civil and decent institution the day
Dick Armey retires."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to respond, Armey said his comments were not offensive to
Jews, but simply reflected a long-held view about all liberals
compared to conservatives: "Liberals are generally not very bright,
and conservatives are deep thinkers."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Lowey-Frost criticism was "a partisan deal" and
motivated by their frustration at what Armey said is growing support
for the GOP within the ranks of Jewish voters.</TE>
<TE>   But Lowey and Frost said Armey's comments were an indication of
"why the GOP's countless outreach efforts to minority communities
always fail."</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than show true respect to our communities by addressing
our concerns, Republicans merely repackage their far right-wing
agenda," the Democrats said.</TE>

<LD>A man was executed by injection for fatally stabbing two Houston-area
girls in 1992 after they refused to turn down some loud music.</LD>
<LD>   Rex Mays, 42, was convicted of killing Kynara Carreiro, 7, and
10-year-old Kristin Wiley at the Wiley home next door to his house.</LD>
<LD>   Mays confessed to the crime, saying he used knife skills he
learned as a Marine. Kynara was stabbed and slashed 23 times and
Kristin at least 18.</LD>
<TE>   Mays, who occasionally earned money performing as Uh-Oh the Clown
and dressed as Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, killed the girls the

<LD>In what probably was his final speech in the Senate, where he has
served for nearly 50 years, South Carolina's Strom Thurmond bade
farewell to politics.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican, who turns 100 on Dec. 5, gained national attention
as a segregationist in the 1940s and 1950s, but is now known more for
his longevity than his ideology.</LD>
<LD>   Having the dual distinction of being the oldest person ever to
serve in the Senate as well as the longest-serving senator, Thurmond
will retire when Congress adjourns for the year, sometime in the next
few weeks.</LD>

<HD>Senate OKs Special Panel for Full-Scale 9/11 Probe</HD>
<DH>Terror: Inquiry would examine intelligence lapses, and
immigration and aviation security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to form a special
commission to investigate last year's terrorist attacks, an inquiry
that would compare in scale to the historic probes of the Pearl
Harbor bombing and the John F. Kennedy assassination.</LD>
<LD>   The 90 to 8 vote, a key step in creating the panel, reflected
growing sentiment that nothing less than an exhaustive examination
will suffice for an event of the magnitude of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the current congressional probe that is limited to
CIA and FBI lapses in counterintelligence, the 10-member National
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States would be
charged with making a "full and complete accounting" of the episode,
exploring a range of issues--from immigration policies to aviation
security.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not interested in using this commission to point fingers,"
said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who joined Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) in sponsoring the measure. "We need definitive answers that
force us to face what happened and why--answers that ultimately will
lead to a stronger and better America."</TE>
<TE>   The vote came on a day when the White House reduced the terrorist
threat alert in the United States, which had been elevated amid
concern about possible strikes timed to coincide with the first
anniversary of last year's attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon. The administration downgraded the terrorist warning code
system from "orange"--which signals a high risk of attack--to
"yellow."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, testimony at a congressional hearing disclosed that a
memo from a Phoenix FBI agent asking the bureau to investigate Middle
Eastern men at U.S. flight schools focused on a sole suspect who had
repeated contacts with one of the Sept. 11 hijackers. The
suspect--whose identity was not disclosed--may have trained and
screened pilots involved in the plot, agents said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers said the revelation offered further evidence that U.S.
officials had the opportunity to derail the plot months before the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in court documents unsealed Tuesday, federal prosecutors
linked Al Qaeda suspect Zacarias Moussaoui to one of the 19
hijackers, an allegation that goes beyond charges laid out last year
in the government's indictment of the French-born militant.
Authorities said a business card belonging to one of the hijackers
and discovered in the wreckage of the plane that crashed in
Pennsylvania had a telephone number written on the back that matched
a number Moussaoui had called.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure that would create the independent commission to
probe the attacks was proposed as an amendment to legislation
creating a Department of Homeland Security. That bill remains under
debate.</TE>
<TE>   The House earlier this year approved a more limited commission
that would probe only intelligence failures leading up to Sept. 11.
But the strong bipartisan Senate vote, coming days after the White
House dropped its opposition to an independent review, provides a big
push to the idea of a commission with wide-ranging scope and the
resources to conduct a full accounting of the circumstances
surrounding the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A House GOP leadership aide said House members are likely to
support the broader mandate now that the administration has dropped
its opposition to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Don Kettl, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has
been studying the issue, agreed that momentum favored the Senate
proposal. "It's becoming much more likely that the commission's focus
will be broad and sweeping--not just limited to intelligence but
licensed to examine the whole range of issues at play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, top Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee and onetime skeptic of the commission
idea, spoke out strongly in support of a broad probe by an
independent panel.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know our inability to detect and prevent the Sept. 11
attacks was not only an intelligence failure," he said. "It was a
failure of our entire government.... I'm convinced that an accounting
on behalf of the victims, the families left behind and the American
people must include a comprehensive examination of how every relevant
agency of our government performed or failed to perform prior to the
attacks."</TE>
<TE>   The commission would have a broad mandate to examine the findings
of the congressional investigation into intelligence lapses, as well
as the roles played by law enforcement agencies, aviation security,
U.S. diplomacy, immigration and economic policies, including efforts
to stem the flow of assets to terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate legislation, appointments to the commission would
be evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   No current government officials could serve on the panel. But its
members would be drawn from prominent citizens with experience in
such professions as government, law enforcement, the military, law,
intelligence gathering, commerce, aviation and foreign affairs. The
House measure contained a requirement that members include relatives
of Sept. 11 victims.</TE>
<TE>   The commission would have a $3-million budget and the power to
subpoena witnesses and documents.</TE>
<TE>   The panel would submit its initial report six months after its
first meeting, and a final report a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Even some backers of the commission cautioned that such panels do
not always settle matters.</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, skepticism continues about the Warren Commission's
finding of a lone gunman in the Kennedy assassination. And historians
have faulted the panel that probed the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, in which 2,400 people were killed, for placing too much blame
on the top military officers at the naval base in Hawaii and not
enough on government officials in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration initially opposed an independent
commission for the Sept. 11 attacks because it feared the panel could
distract and demoralize intelligence officials working to prevent
another terrorist assault.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House last week reversed itself and supported the
independent review after families of Sept. 11 victims lobbied for the
commission and congressional hearings focused new attention on
intelligence lapses.</TE>
<TE>   An independent commission could help to settle a dispute over
reforms to intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, at least, the intelligence services have been able to
fend off the really big question--reorganizing their relationships,"
said Kettl. "A blue-ribbon commission report could be the one thing
that changes that. That, in turn, could be the truly historic
implication of such a commission."</TE>

<HD>Gulf Towns Prepare for Storm's Landing</HD>
<DH>Weather: As Isidore gains strength, many coastal residents
are heading to safer ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DES ALLEMANDS, La.</DL>
<LD>Coastal residents in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi scrambled
Tuesday to prepare for Tropical Storm Isidore as it continued on a
steady path across the Gulf of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The storm, which gained strength in the warm gulf waters after
pummeling Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, is expected to make landfall as
a hurricane by early Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Although some mandatory evacuation orders have been issued, many
coastal towns are emptying without official prodding. Highway 90, one
of the main roads leading out of coastal Louisiana, was jammed with
cars heading to safer ground.</LD>
<TE>   "We're hauling out of here," said Danny Ray, a 38-year-old pipe
fitter in the fishing town of Des Allemands, about 15 miles south of
New Orleans. "There's no sense taking chances when you have
children."</TE>
<TE>   Hotels north of coastal areas were swamped. "We've been having to
turn people away," said Denise Sullivan at the front desk of the
Ramada Inn in Jackson, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Those electing to stay are stocking up with a vengeance. At
Frank's Super Valu Foods in Des Allemands, the shelves were stripped
of white bread and bottled water. Mothers with toddlers in tow threw
Pop Tarts and soda into their carts, while young men in blue jeans
kept it simple with multiple cases of beer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been insane," said cashier Traci Stanley, 20. "It's been so
busy I almost can't believe there's anything left to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Next door at Allen's Hardware, batteries, ropes and nails are in
high demand. "We're running out of supplies and there's still
tomorrow, when we'll really see the big push," said store owner Allen
Touchard. "The closer the storm gets, the more people are motivated
to protect themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Many here are like Donna Verdin, who keeps the television on all
day to track the storm. "We don't know what it's going to do," she
said. "We're waiting to see which way it turns and if it turns toward
us, we're out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Cunningham weathered a Louisiana hurricane in 1965 and vowed
never to do it again. The roof blew off of the school that served as
a shelter and the electricity was off for days, she remembered. "I
just won't stay anymore. It's too frightening," she said as she
prepared to drive to her niece's home 200 miles north.</TE>
<TE>   Early projections suggested Isidore could come ashore as a major
Category 4 hurricane, but forecasters now predict a minimal Category
1 hurricane with winds in excess of 80 mph. Still, ships pulled out
of the naval station at Pascagoula for safer waters, and Louisiana
Gov. Mike Foster declared a state of emergency, paving the way for
financial help if floods or winds cause major damage.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling on offshore oil rigs ceased as hundreds of oilfield
workers were evacuated. The 1,800-passenger Carnival cruise ship
Jubilee was forced to dock at the Port of New Orleans, aborting a
five-day trip from Galveston, Texas, to the Yucatan Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The storm had much higher winds when it pounded the Yucatan
Peninsula, leaving two people dead, 300,000 homeless and damaging
ecological reserves and ruins.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Merlin Naquin nailed plywood boards to every window of
his tiny bungalow here, saying it was better to play it safe.
"They've been predicting every which way but the right way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stomping along the rising banks of the Des Allemands bayou in her
late husband's rain boots, 64-year-old Josie Frieze can sense the
storm coming. "It's in the air," she said, pausing to study the
darkening horizon. "You can feel something eerie and heavy and you
know something is coming, but you don't really know what."</TE>

<HD>Space Camp Falls From Orbit and Into Foreclosure</HD>
<DH>Science: Kids say they're more interested in Earthbound
pursuits. Events of Sept. 11 also affected attendance at Florida
facility.</DH>

<DL>TITUSVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Here on a school field trip, Grace Wilkowski trooped past cases of
memorabilia from the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions, and etched
acrylic likenesses of the astronauts who were heroes to a generation
of Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Space, remarked the Georgia teen, seems so passe.</LD>
<LD>   "With the problems we have on Earth, space exploration isn't now
our top priority," said the 14-year-old from Savannah who wants to
become a physician. "It's OK to do some preliminary exploration and
stuff, but we need to be able to figure out how to better survive on
Earth together."</LD>
<TE>   That attitude, in a nutshell, may explain the woes of U.S. Space
Camp Florida, a privately run training ground for young would-be
astronauts outside the gates of Kennedy Space Center. Dropping
attendance and related financial problems have forced the facility
and the adjacent U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame into foreclosure, and
barring the eleventh-hour intervention of an angel investor, the
attractions will be auctioned off at a Florida courthouse today. A
related space camp in Mountain View, Calif., went belly up in
January.</TE>
<TE>   One week this month, the Florida camp graduated only 14 children,
though it has room for 276. September is normally a slack time, said
Mary Merritt, director of the camp and hall of fame, but she
acknowledged that enrollment has been falling for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Once such a national passion that astronaut John Glenn, who in
February 1962 became the first American to orbit the Earth, needed
six people to help answer his fan mail, interest in space has been
dwindling among adults and children alike for years, said Jeff Brown,
professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in
Ohio. "As a society," he said, "we've shifted our focus from outer
space to computer space."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Cops and firemen have always been something we valued, but now
the real heroism of their work is evident," Brown added. "I've heard
some little girls say they now want to grow up not to be a
high-fashion model, but a policewoman."</TE>
<TE>   America's first woman in space, Sally K. Ride, said she finds that
while many young people don't know much about the history of the
space program, they are still fascinated by outer space.</TE>
<TE>   "They are absolutely enthralled by astronauts, by space
exploration, by being weightless in space, by looking back at Earth,"
said Ride, a professor of physics at UC San Diego. "It's amazing to
me how many of them yearn to be in the space program."</TE>
<TE>   Space, Ride said, remains a remarkably effective hook to grab and
keep children's attention. The accompanying message to America's
girls from an educational company that Ride has founded, Imaginary
Lines Inc., is that "it's fascinating, cool, OK" to be interested in
math, science and engineering, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If Space Camp felt the shock of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New
York and the Pentagon, Merritt said, it's chiefly because families
became much more reluctant to allow their sons and daughters to fly
unaccompanied on airliners to attend. An economic downturn already
underway also thinned the ranks of parents willing or able to spend
up to $799 in peak season on a five-day virtual cosmic experience for
their child.</TE>
<TE>   "Our enrollment has declined, especially after Sept. 11, but our
organization has not done a good job in marketing itself," Merritt
said. "I think children are still interested in space and dream of
being astronauts."</TE>
<TE>   Space Camp traces its genesis to German-born rocket scientist
Werner Von Braun, who believed youngsters could be lured into
studying the sciences by being exposed to the excitement and romance
of space travel. The first camp opened in Huntsville, Ala., in 1982,
and was so successful that the Florida installation opened in 1988.
Other camps sprang up from Japan to California.</TE>
<TE>   Campers clad in sky-blue flight suits are spun here in
centrifuges, don harnesses that let them walk in simulated lunar
gravity, and work on a "zero-G wall" where pulleys and harnesses
duplicate the weightlessness of space. There are simulated space
shuttle missions, with teams working inside realistic mock-ups of the
spacecraft and mission control center.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida camp alone claims to have introduced more than 50,000
children to the rudiments of imitation spaceflight, including a
seventh-grader in 1993 named Lance Bass, who, as a member of the pop
group 'N Sync, tried to join a three-man Russian crew blasting off
next month to the International Space Station.</TE>
<TE>   Bass, now 23, was bumped from the Oct. 28 Soyuz launch and
replaced by a cargo container when he didn't pay the $20-million fee
demanded by the Russians, but he was reported this week to be at
Russia's cosmonaut center outside Moscow beginning another training
program.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, the Florida facility--a joint venture of the
Astronaut Scholarship Foundation and the Space Camp
Foundation--saddled itself with $10 million in debt to fund
construction of a dormitory and an expanded hall of fame.
SouthTrustBank of Birmingham, Ala., which holds the mortgage on the
properties here, postponed the sell-off once as it negotiated with a
potential buyer, but the auction is now supposed to go ahead. .</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting a little bit worried," Brenda McMillan, marketing
representative for the camp and hall of fame, said Tuesday. "I'd like
to have a white knight come in and save us. I have my fingers
crossed."</TE>
<TE>   For 12 years, Keith Sterner, 35, has worked at the attractions
here. One recent morning, as he showed a visitor around exhibits in
the hall of fame also being toured by the students from Savannah, the
guide couldn't hide his gee-whiz reactions. There was Virgil I. "Gus"
Grissom's silver pressure suit, he marveled, and Wally Schirra's
cramped Sigma 7 Mercury capsule, and the singed Apollo 14 Command
Module, "Kitty Hawk," that flew to the moon and back in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Sterner hopes something with sufficient "glamour and glitz," like
a manned mission to Mars, comes along soon to awaken in others the
same youthful passion for space travel he felt as a child. Space
Camp, he firmly believes, fulfills a need.</TE>
<TE>   "One kid who came here told us this is the first place he'd ever
been where it was cool to be smart," Sterner said.</TE>

<HD>Glacial Melting Takes Human Toll</HD>
<DH>Environment: Avalanche in Russia and other disasters show
that global warming is beginning to affect areas much closer to home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The entombment of a Russian village under 3 million tons of ice and
mud from a collapsing glacier is a sign of the gradual yet vast
climatic changes sweeping the world's mountainous regions, scientists
say.</LD>
<LD>   The disaster on the slopes of the Caucasus Mountains on Friday
left more than 100 people missing and at least nine dead. Researchers
maintain that the avalanche is part of a subtle chain of events that
has transformed once-frozen mountains and is altering the course of
nearby human settlements in unexpected, and sometimes disastrous,
ways.</LD>
<LD>   The changes often have been difficult to perceive, because they
have taken place over such a long period of time and because their
effects are not always clear--some regions have become colder, even
as others warm.</LD>
<TE>   But scientists say there is little question that a world of ice is
in flux.</TE>
<TE>   Glacier National Park in Montana has lost more than 100 glaciers
during the last century, vanished into a slow drip of runoff. In
Venezuela, only two glaciers remain where there were six 30 years
ago. In Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro, about 75% of the glacier has
retreated, leaving some to suggest that Ernest Hemingway's famous
"Snows of Kilimanjaro" will exist only in literature in about a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations Environmental Program completed a Himalayan
glacier survey this summer that found dozens of mountain lakes in
Nepal and Bhutan so swollen from melting glaciers that they could
burst in the next few years, inundating villages throughout the
region.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we fully understand the full extent of these
impacts, but I'm convinced they're happening," said Tony Prato, an
ecological economist at the University of Missouri. "People will
adapt if they can, but it will be painful, and sometimes it will cost
lives."</TE>
<TE>   The human toll has been largely overlooked in the debate over
global warming. Much of the attention paid to climate change has
focused on the Arctic and Antarctic, regions vulnerable to
temperature change but sparsely populated.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian disaster and growing changes throughout the world's
mountainous regions show that the warming of the world's climate is
beginning to affect areas much closer to home--temperate regions that
are often densely populated. The last decade has brought some of the
most rapid change of the century--seven of the last 10 years were the
warmest on record.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to start looking at the human dimension," said Alton C.
Byers, a mountain geographer who studies human effects on the
Himalayas and Andes. "There are many unanticipated hardships for the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Glacial avalanches are not the only worries. Other dangers include
sudden glacial outburst floods that can release vast amounts of water
in seconds. Drought and agricultural crises also are expected to
follow the fading of mid-altitude glaciers.</TE>
<TE>   Although little known, the changing face of the world's mountain
regions is of growing interest to scientists and land planners.</TE>
<TE>   "We think of mountains as being pristine and unimpacted by global
change, yet increasingly they are," said Lisa Graumlich, a climate
expert who directs the Big Sky Institute at Montana State University.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Maili glacier on the northern edge of the
Caucasus Mountains ripped out trees and tossed massive trucks as if
they were toys. It left a 20-mile path of rocky debris, blackened ice
and devastation.</TE>
<TE>   A full scientific assessment of what caused the disaster will take
weeks or months, but Russian officials said this week that the
collapse of the glacier seemed at least partly linked to climate
change. It is a tricky issue because the collapse of glaciers can
depend on a variety of near-term factors, including temperature,
rain, humidity, slope and even the reflectivity of the glacial ice.</TE>
<TE>   But during the course of a century, scientists say, glaciers in a
wide range of locations around the world have undergone an enormous
change in dynamics brought about by the human use of "greenhouse"
gases, such as carbon dioxide, and the decades-long swings in ocean
and atmospheric patterns that can greatly affect weather.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 study by University of Zurich researchers found that
glaciers of the European Alps have lost about 30% to 40% of their
surface area and about half their volume since 1850. Glaciers in the
New Zealand's Southern Alps have lost 25% of their surface area
during the last century, according to another study.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. experts said the Maili glacier incident followed the pattern
of glacier collapse in other areas affected by rising temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Glaciers tend to [collapse] like that when they're receding, and
glaciers are receding all over the world," said Dan Fagre, an
ecologist and expert on the ramifications of glacier loss at Glacier
National Park in Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The breaking off of huge chunks from a glacier is the sometimes
spectacular result of a glacier that is gradually retreating back
into the mountains. Glaciers grow only when the amount of snow they
receive is greater than what they lose by melting. When there is less
snowfall, higher temperatures or both, the "snouts" of glaciers
retreat. Some of the ice breaks off in deadly chunks; some of it
drips away as meltwater.</TE>
<TE>   That seemingly gentle meltwater can be deadly as well. Such water
often pools in the recess left by the receding glacier and piles up
behind a weak natural dam of sediment and stone. Once there is enough
water pressure behind the dam, it can suddenly burst in what is known
as a glacial lake outburst flood, unleashing a torrent of water into
villages below.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's going to go shooting down the flood plain, and in a
mountainous area, that's where the people live," said Graumlich of
Montana State University.</TE>
<TE>   The Dig Tsho glacial outburst in Nepal in 1985 destroyed a
hydroelectric plant, wiped out 14 bridges and drowned dozens of
villagers.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is so obvious, Graumlich said, that some Himalayan
villages have installed primitive warning systems--basically a system
of horns--in attempts to save lives during the next flood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just watching [glacial lakes] form in the Himalayas and
Peru," said Byers, director of research and education for the West
Virginia-based Mountain Institute. "All you have to do is release
that dam and you'll lose vast amounts of water in seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Huascaran National Park in Peru has attempted to monitor and drain
the lakes since they started to form in the 1950s, he said. But the
pace of warming is making such work nearly impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the fears with warming is they'll be forming so fast, no
one will be able to keep a handle on it," he said, "especially in
countries that have no resources or glaciologists."</TE>
<TE>   Civilizations have long settled mountain valleys because of the
continuous water supply that flows from the snowpack and glaciers and
because of the rich soil that forms in such floodplains.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that agriculture co-evolved with glaciers is not
surprising," Graumlich said. Mountains also supply 50% of the fresh
water that is consumed and furnish hydropower, said Prato of the
University of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   As glacial melting proceeds, some farmers are enjoying the
unexpected benefit of plenty of water. Farmers around Mt. Kilimanjaro
have found the water supply so bountiful that they can grow far more
than they need to survive. They are even growing foreign,
water-thirsty crops such as tulips for export to Europe, Graumlich
said.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists point out that eventually the bounty of water will
shrink as the ice disappears.</TE>
<TE>   "More water now means more agriculture," Graumlich said. "But what
will they do when there is much less water later on?"</TE>

<HD>Angels Still Laboring for Berth</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They lose to Rangers, 2-1, for third straight
defeat and remain one step shy of clinching wild-card spot in the
American League playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Good morning, Angel fans. Get any sleep last night?</LD>
<LD>   This isn't really happening, you think. The Angels aren't really
collapsing again. But your heroes were one victory away from the
playoffs four days ago, and they're still one victory away this
morning.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels suddenly went flat Tuesday, and at this rate the
champagne they've been carting around America for a few days will go
flat too.</LD>
<TE>   After a 2-1 loss to rookie Joaquin Benoit and the Texas Rangers,
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia closed the clubhouse doors and told his
players to stop pressing, to stop fighting themselves, to stop
worrying about the playoffs. Worry about the little things, such as
getting a hit with a runner in scoring position, and the big picture
will come into focus by itself.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're lacking right now is the feeling and the excitement of
being the team that's going to win the World Series," batting coach
Mickey Hatcher said. "I don't see that motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Major league officials never bothered to flip a coin to decide the
site of a potential one-game playoff between the Angels and Boston
Red Sox, but look here: The Red Sox won their fifth consecutive game
Tuesday, as the Angels lost their third in a row. If the Red Sox win
all five remaining games--and if the Angels lose all five, the teams
will tie for the American League wild-card playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners are still alive too, with five games left.
They must win all five, including three in Anaheim starting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure mounts with every day that the Angels fail to clinch,
and the Red Sox start 21-game winner Derek Lowe tonight. The Mariners
start crafty veteran Jamie Moyer.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hope to start Ramon Ortiz, who has a cut on the little
finger of his pitching hand. And the Angels face Kenny Rogers, who
once pitched a perfect game against them.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival, a member of the 1995 team that staged the
mother of all Angel collapses, said there is no comparison between
that team and this one.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing went right that year," he said. "We didn't pitch well. We
didn't play well. Right now we're just not getting runners across the
plate. When we do that, we'll be fine.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is nothing like the one in '95. It's going to get it
done."</TE>
<TE>   If the problem is a split focus between clinching a playoff berth
and winning the division title, that problem is about to disappear,
perhaps today. If the Oakland Athletics win tonight and the Angels
lose, the A's clinch the American League West championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing would be to win a game," first baseman Scott
Spiezio said, "and take it from there."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "The fact that it's so close, sometimes it's like a
carrot dangling at you. Some guys might start to press."</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of evidence. The Angels were hitless in six
at-bats with men in scoring position Tuesday, and they're two for 21
in the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy, given two chances to drive in a run
with a hit or sacrifice fly, struck out both times. Center fielder
Darin Erstad committed his first error in 245 games Tuesday; the
Angels have made at least one error in three consecutive games for
the first time since June. On an intentional walk, reliever Brendan
Donnelly nearly threw ball four to the backstop.</TE>
<TE>   Even Scioscia's instincts, so uncannily successful this season,
were off Tuesday. Scioscia used three pinch-runners, none of whom
tried to steal. The one Angel who did, Spiezio, was thrown out on a
busted hit-and-run.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything went wrong for the Angels. Garret Anderson homered,
and Kevin Appier held Texas to two runs over six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia seldom holds meetings, and Kennedy said he didn't knock
over any chairs in this one. He advised his players to shrug off the
pressure, to forget the weight of history, of clinching the Angels'
first playoff berth in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   So far, easier said than done.</TE>

<LD>Thirty years ago this week, Canada's top NHL players faced off
against a team of the Soviet Union's best in an eight-game series
remembered as much for its vicious incidents as for Paul Henderson's
goal in the closing moments of Game 8. Thanks to Henderson, the
Canadians won the Summit Series, 4-3-1.</LD>
<LD>   After 30 years, Bobby Clarke's two-handed slash that broke the
ankle of Valery Kharlamov in Game 6 stands out as the ugliest of the
attacks. Clarke, who was acting on the orders of assistant coach John
Ferguson, has never apologized for his hatchet job on Kharlamov,
perhaps the Soviets' best player in the series.</LD>
<LD>   Henderson, who remains a national hero in the Great White North,
said recently that Clarke's actions were akin to "shooting a guy in
the hallway."</LD>
<TE>   "That's no way to win a hockey game," Henderson told the National
Post, a Canadian newspaper. "Can you imagine a golfer going out and
whacking a guy in the leg? Can you imagine a tennis player doing
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Clarke: "I was young and the series was a war. It was a dirty
series. We did a lot of dirty things to them and they did a lot of
dirty things to us. It got to that level for all of us. It got crazy
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: As he had been in the Summit Series against Canada,
Vladislav Tretiak was in goal for the Soviets when they faced the
United States in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. But he was not in net
for the final two periods of the "Miracle on Ice." Who was?</TE>
<TE>   Warming up for the off-season: Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times
doesn't fault Mariner Manager Lou Piniella for losing his cool last
week:</TE>
<TE>   "You know that first-base bag Piniella shotput down the
right-field line last Wednesday? My guess is, he saw Mariner CEO
Howard Lincoln's face on it.... When there was a chance to get help,
ownership didn't. And that has been the rash under Piniella's collar
since the July 31 trade deadline."</TE>
<TE>   Team player? Karen Guregian of the Boston Herald on Tiger Woods:
"There will always be an I in Tiger. That single-mindedness is what
drove him to be the best player on the planet. For him, it's all
about winning tournaments, making money and cementing his place in
history. To steal a phrase often used with the late Ted Williams,
it's all about being called the greatest golfer who ever lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing for Team USA doesn't exactly fit into any of those
categories because Tiger alone doesn't control the outcome in the
Ryder Cup. He could win every match he plays and still lose."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Vladimir Myshkin replaced Tretiak with the score,
2-2, and one second left in the first period. The U.S. went on to
win, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bison Dele (a.k.a. Brian Williams), the NBA player
who is missing and presumed dead in the South Pacific, was a rabid
fan of the film "Pulp Fiction," recalled Mike Monroe of
Foxsports.com:</TE>
<TE>   "I keep remembering the morning in 1994 when a gifted power
forward named Brian Williams burst into the locker room at McNichols
Sports Arena before a practice session. He was bubbling with
enthusiasm, anxious to tell anyone and everyone he had just seen the
greatest film ever made."</TE>
<TE>   Dele recited one passage "word for word, after having seen the
film not once or twice the previous evening, but three times."</TE>

<HD>Dabord's Respirator Will Be Stopped</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities had hoped to question him regarding
disappearance of his brother, Bison Dele, and two others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miles Dabord, whom authorities hoped to question in connection with
the disappearance of his brother, former NBA player Bison Dele, and
two others, will soon be removed from the apparatus that has been
keeping him alive, his mother said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Phillips said a joint memorial service is being planned
for her sons, Dabord and Dele, a former Clipper and Santa Monica St.
Monica High basketball star who was last seen sailing his catamaran
in the South Pacific with his girlfriend, the boat captain and Dabord
in early July.</LD>
<LD>   The date of the memorial has not been announced; nor would
Phillips say when Dabord will be unhooked from a respirator. "I don't
want a media circus around us on the day my son's life ends," she
said.</LD>
<TE>   Dabord, 35, was the subject of a three-state FBI manhunt until
last week, when he was identified from fingerprints as the man who
was brought to a Chula Vista, Calif., hospital in a coma on Sept. 15.
Phillips said doctors told her the coma was the result of an insulin
overdose and Dabord's not taking his asthma medication.</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators wanted to interview Dabord about the
disappearances of Dele; Dele's girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and
Bertrand Saldo, the captain of Dele's 55-foot catamaran, the Hakuna
Matata.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord aroused the suspicions of law enforcement officials in the
United States by allegedly attempting to purchase $152,096 in gold
using Dele's passport and writing a check on his brother's account
Sept. 5 in Phoenix. He has also been identified by witnesses as the
man who checked in his brother's catamaran--with its name painted
over--using an alias in mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   Erica Wiese, Dabord's former girlfriend, told investigators that
Dabord told her during a telephone conversation earlier this month
that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were killed as a result of a fight on
board. Dabord told Wiese he was not at fault.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have loved to have talked to [Dabord] about his versions
of the events and compare them to the evidence on the boat," said FBI
special agent John Steiner, adding, "Preliminarily, his story doesn't
add up."</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators on Monday wrapped up their work in Taravao,
Tahiti, where the catamaran is docked. Authorities regrouped on
Tuesday in San Francisco to discuss their findings and try to
establish a likely timeline of events.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are using satellite records to create a chronology
of the boat's coordinates based on phone calls that were made from
aboard, French Polynesian law enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Forensic evidence will be processed at laboratories in France and
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot of work to do on this case," Steiner said.
"We're not going to stop investigating because Miles departs. We've
got a lot of leads and a lot of people to talk to, but the most
important one was Miles. It's a huge loss for the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she has hired an attorney to help her coordinate her
status as executor of her sons' estates.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer David Wharton contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Facing a Stark Reality</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Colorado starter gives up one hit in seven
innings, and L.A. falls three behind after 1-0 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a panicky rock climber who can't seem to find a nook or crevice
to dig his fingertips and toes into, the Dodgers have lost their grip
on the National League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   They slipped and stumbled badly in a 1-0 loss to the Colorado
Rockies on Tuesday night, falling three games behind the San
Francisco Giants with five games to play, and they're going to need
FEMA-like assistance from the San Diego Padres, Houston Astros and
possibly the Atlanta Braves to keep their fading playoff hopes alive.</LD>
<LD>   A somber Dodger Stadium crowd of 30,332 saw Colorado right-hander
Denny Stark (11-3) outduel Odalis Perez, giving up one hit over seven
shutout innings, and relievers Todd Jones and Jose Jimenez closed out
the eighth and ninth innings, handing the Dodgers their 12th shutout
of the season.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers must win their final five games--one against the
Rockies tonight and four against the Padres--and the Giants must lose
three of their last five to the Padres, Astros and Braves to merely
force a tie and one-game playoff between the Dodgers and Giants in
Pacific Bell Park Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's prayer time," Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan said. "We
have to win out and hope the worst for San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   The odds of both are long. The Dodgers, who haven't been to the
playoffs since 1996, are scrambling to put a rotation together and
score runs, while the Giants, who have reached the playoffs twice in
the last five years, are 21-8 since Aug. 25 and playing their best
baseball down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco has the experience, they're turning it on at the
right time," Jordan said. "We haven't done that, though it's not for
lack of effort."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the Dodgers tried too hard Tuesday night. They seemed
a little too eager at the plate, swinging at first pitches eight
times. Three times they put the ball in play on the first pitch, and
all three resulted in outs.</TE>
<TE>   They also seemed to lack the intensity that was apparent in San
Diego, where the Dodgers pulled out two ninth-inning wins over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sort of one of those after an off-day downers--we didn't
come out like it was do or die," Jordan said. "Guys were looking at
the scoreboard and getting tighter and tighter, trying to be the
hero. The Giants, they've relaxed more down the stretch. They're not
trying too hard, swinging too hard. You get in trouble that way."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers made a little noise in the ninth when Eric Karros
doubled with two out off Jimenez, but Jimenez struck out Adrian
Beltre on three pitches for his 41st save, as the Rockies continue to
thrive in their role as spoilers--they took three of four games from
the Dodgers in Denver on Sept. 12-15.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had only two other decent scoring chances, putting
runners on first and third with two out in the first and a runner on
third with two out in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   After Shawn Green reached on a fielder's choice and took third on
Jordan's single in the first, Karros popped to second to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the eighth, Grissom's blooper off Jones fell
inches inside the right-field line and inches away from the glove of
diving right fielder Gabe Kapler.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom raced all the way to third with a triple, and up stepped
Paul Lo Duca with a chance to tie the game. Lo Duca, who had struck
out only 28 times this season, tried to bunt on the first pitch,
fouling it off. He then took a called strike and swung through a
third pitch for a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies scored in the first when Kapler smacked Perez's first
pitch into right field for a single. Perez then got Terry Shumpert to
fly to center and Jay Payton to fly to right.</TE>
<TE>   But Kapler stole second with two out and scored on Todd Zeile's
end-of-the-bat bleeder.</TE>
<TE>   Perez (15-10) was strong the rest of the way, giving up only five
hits, striking out eight and walking none in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to take when you get as fine a pitching performance as
you've gotten all year from Odalis Perez," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy
said. "Now, obviously, our hopes are slim. We're not eliminated, but
we pretty much have to win out, that's all there is to it. And we're
going to need help even if we do win out."</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Is Bush a Brawler or a Bluffer?</HD>
<DH>The president has made himself a scary guy in this
face-off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When your eyes adjust to dark places, you can see a lesson of
survival. Straight from high school, I went into the Marine Corps,
and with other young Marines of my day I poked my nose into some of
the toughest saloons along the U.S. West Coast and in five countries
of Asia--straight-shot jukebox dives where trouble kept an open tab.</LD>
<LD>   Again and again, I watched as stray sparks gathered over some
perceived or real slight between trained killers who fed off military
rivalries, testosterone and the fatalism of wartime. Voices roared,
stools toppled onto the floor as men took to their feet and everyone
in the room tensed. Then, at the instant of certain ignition, these
explosions almost always fizzled.</LD>
<LD>   What looked terrifyingly like reckless bravado was, in fact,
bluff. Not the kind of polite bluffing people use in poker. This was
different. These Marines were edgy, wild, theatrical bluffers. They
avoided trouble for the most part by seeming ready, even eager, for
it. Like all good bluffers, they had to convince you they weren't.</LD>
<TE>   Marines were supposed to be just a little nuts anyway, and that
fellow who just bumped you with an elbow might be one of those with a
knife in his boot. Standing up to him meant conveying that you might
be every bit as dangerous or more so. Primeval, you say? OK, but no
less real.</TE>
<TE>   Humans have yet to outgrow their history. As the poet John Dryden
observed, "Peace itself is war in masquerade." Enlarge this approach
to a grand scale. We can call it the new national security strategy
of the United States, as spelled out, in word and deed, by the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Unsettling? Hugely. Hazardous? Without a doubt. Effective?
Possibly.</TE>
<TE>   In the Marines, you could steer clear of this kind of trouble by
staying home at night. But that's no longer an option for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I'm no foreign-policy scholar, but I've spent enough time overseas
in trouble spots to have lost my hope in reason and goodwill. Hoping
to sit down and working things out when the other fellow is drunk,
whether on whiskey or fanaticism, amounts to wishful thinking.
Tensions in much of the world today resemble those in a sweaty,
back-alley saloon more than those in an air-conditioned conference
room.</TE>
<TE>   In this face-off with Iraq, President Bush has flat-out convinced
me, and most of the rest of the world, that he's not bluffing--which
is essential to pulling off any good bluff. I'm with those who think
he's thirsty for this fight. Some people accept that it's for the
sake of U.S. security. Others figure he's out to settle an old family
score or to distract voters from the shaky economy. You pick it, he's
made himself scary.</TE>
<TE>   From what I've seen of the modern world, that's a tactic with a
fair chance of getting you through tight spots with your teeth
intact. I suspect Saddam Hussein is having trouble holding down his
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, when you've watched enough of these blustery
encounters, you realize that it's a thin, shifty line--sometimes so
thin you can't see it--between standing up for yourself and being a
bully.</TE>
<TE>   That accounts for all these questions at home and the storm of
doubts abroad. Why this face-off just now? (Has something changed in
the last 12 months?) Why this target? (Which nation harbors more
terrorists and has brought the world closer to a nuclear exchange,
Pakistan or Iraq?) More to the point, why aren't the answers more
convincing?</TE>
<TE>   Bush's new national security directive and his relentless war
drums proclaim a prerogative for the United States: the right to act
preemptively and unilaterally. In practice, there's not much new
here. Think Grenada or Panama, to name two. But now it's in writing
for all the world to chew over, and Bush has taken to his feet to
show what it means.</TE>
<TE>   If he can pull off his bluff, if he can inspire resolve in the
United Nations--and it's foolish to discount these possibilities--the
United States will have stood down a tyrant and instilled in the
civilized family of nations new confidence in countering fanaticism.</TE>
<TE>   But if he cannot, then there is more to win than a fight along the
Euphrates. Pulverizing a downtrodden foe proves one's might. But to
quiet the murmurs of onlookers, Americans have to show that we're
right too.</TE>
<TE>   We're not just professing ideals, we must live up to them in this
new kind of war against terrorists. That you can't bluff.</TE>

<HD>Hussein's Ungodly Ways Pave Road to Democracy</HD>
<DH>Iraqi dictator has separated mosque and state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie is a senior associate at the Center of
Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C., and a syndicated
columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, there is something good to say about Saddam Hussein: He's
not, and never was, fanatically religious.</LD>
<LD>   Even during the long years that he tormented the Iraqi people by
starving them, gassing them, murdering them and depriving them of the
most basic human freedoms, Hussein never allowed Islam to overrule
him.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, one of the main propaganda tools the Iranians used
against Hussein during their eight-year war with him was that he was
a "heretic" and an "infidel."</LD>
<TE>   Hussein is not an infidel; he just doesn't like sharing power with
anyone, not even Allah.</TE>
<TE>   This explains why Iraq is today the least religious Arab country,
a fact that will make it easier for the U.S.--after it eliminates the
current regime--to set in place on Middle Eastern ground the first
peg for its forthcoming democratic tent.</TE>
<TE>   The key is the separation of mosque and state, for which the world
can thank Hussein. We can make Iraq--minus Hussein and his
cronies--the showcase of democracy for the entire Arab world to envy,
learn from and emulate.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not forget that tradition says Iraq was the original Garden
of Eden, as described in Genesis. It's a country of plentiful
resources because of its good soil, ample water and control of 10% of
the world's oil.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi people are among the most advanced and best-educated
individuals in the Middle East. Iraq is probably the most
technologically savvy society in that area of the world and,
historically, is very commerce-minded.</TE>
<TE>   No Arab country can compete with Iraq for potential natural
integration into globalization, openness and democracy.</TE>
<TE>   One successful democracy may turn the entire Middle East
upside-down by proving to be contagious to the hundreds of millions
of Arabs who have never known personal equality.</TE>
<TE>   If we treat a postwar Iraq the way we treated Germany and Japan
after World War II, we may be able to establish the light at the
beginning of a very long tunnel.</TE>

<HD>New Refugee Rules Favor Efficiency Over Fairness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SANDERS</AU>
<BD>Deborah Sanders is executive director of the Capital
Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition based in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today, new Justice Department regulations take effect that will
dramatically weaken the ability of the country's most important
immigration tribunal to review asylum-related decisions. The
department is placing efficiency above fairness by mandating that the
Board of Immigration Appeals process a staggering number of cases
under unrealistic deadlines.</LD>
<LD>   Board members will be forced to simply rubber-stamp the decisions
of overworked immigration judges, even when the reasoning behind
those decisions contains errors. The new regulations also will limit
the use of three-member panels that provide the sort of checks and
balances that are integral to our government and that traditionally
have considered most appeals. Instead, single board members will make
most decisions, usually without explanation.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department contends that these and other
"streamlining" measures will enable the board to reduce its backlog
of cases, which is indeed large. Yet the department also intends to
reduce the number of board members by almost half, even though
appeals continue to increase.</LD>
<TE>   When asylum applicants do finally present their claim, sometimes
after months of waiting, they may be forced to do so from jail, with
an immigration judge watching via videoconferencing in a distant
courtroom. Because the video camera may break in the middle of a
hearing or testimony may be lost in translation, it is essential to
have a potent appellate tribunal to provide a meaningful opportunity
for appeal. After all, once asylum seekers are turned down, they are
promptly deported to their native countries.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Chen, a woman who, after a forced abortion,
fled China to escape that country's one-child-per-family law. Despite
her credible testimony and a law specifically allowing for such
people to be granted haven in the U.S., the immigration judge denied
Chen asylum.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of her pro bono attorneys, Chen prepared an appeal
to the board, which unanimously reversed the decision of the
immigration judge and ordered a second trial, at which Chen was
granted asylum. But under the new procedures, it is unlikely that
Chen would have had a meaningful opportunity to appeal and instead
would have been unjustifiably sent back to a life of suffering in
China.</TE>
<TE>   Under these new regulations, how will mistakes like the one in
Chen's case be rectified? They won't, because the practical effect of
the rules is to limit board members to about 15 minutes to review
each appeal. Yet for many who escape persecution, being returned to
their native country is a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Countless refugees flee human rights abuses each year. They
deserve due process and a meaningful review of their cases. Sadly,
under these new rules, they won't get it.</TE>

<HD>Pot Got You Confused? You Must Be the DEA</HD>
<DH>Raids on medical marijuana are reefer madness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALD F. UELMEN</AU>
<BD>Gerald F. Uelmen, a professor at Santa Clara
University School of Law, represents the Wo/Men's Alliance for
Medical Marijuana in a federal court challenge to the Sept. 5 DEA
search.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leaders of the federal war on drugs are upset. At the very moment
they were launching a multimillion-dollar media campaign to educate
parents and kids about the risks of marijuana, the city fathers of
Santa Cruz gathered on the steps of City Hall to witness the
distribution of marijuana to the patients of a medical marijuana
collective.</LD>
<LD>   A representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration decried
the confusion this will create among our adolescent population: The
Santa Cruz festivities sent "the wrong message."</LD>
<LD>   That's the same phrase government officials used in 1992 when they
closed down the federal government's Compassionate Investigative New
Drug program to distribute government-grown marijuana to the sick and
dying. When the program was deluged with applications from AIDS
patients, federal authorities decided that compassion was going too
far and closed off new applications because the program was "sending
the wrong message." Distribution was continued for previously
enrolled patients, six of whom still survive.</LD>
<TE>   One of the real ironies of the gathering in Santa Cruz was the
presence of one of those six patients, holding the canister of
marijuana cigarettes she received from the U.S. government, sitting
beside the hundreds of patients whose marijuana had just been taken
away by the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   If kids are confused about marijuana, it's not because they can't
understand why sick people want to use a widely abused drug as
medicine. Even kids can understand the difference between
recreational abuse of a substance and therapeutic use under the care
of a physician. We make that distinction with cocaine and narcotics,
both of which are widely abused but can be prescribed by a physician.</TE>
<TE>   The real confusion about marijuana for most kids is trying to
figure out why it's so different from alcohol. The government's "Open
Letter to Parents" published in American newspapers last week talked
about the havoc that marijuana can cause in high-pressure social
situations, leading to risky decision-making on such issues as sex,
criminal activity or riding with someone who is driving high.</TE>
<TE>   Although marijuana certainly contributes to such risky behavior,
it accounts for a much smaller proportion of teenage sex, criminality
and driving high than does alcohol. Why is a multimillion-dollar
government ad campaign on drug education leaving out alcohol, the No.
1 killer of our teens? It's rather confusing.</TE>
<TE>   The best message to send to young people is the simple truth. And
the simple truth about medical marijuana was with those patients who
limped across the steps of Santa Cruz City Hall. The simple truth has
been discovered by thousands of AIDS patients, wasting away from loss
of appetite, and thousands of cancer patients, vomiting away their
breakfast, lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana helps many of these people when other drugs don't. Their
physicians agree but are prohibited from writing a prescription for
marijuana by federal law. Many of these patients are dying and aren't
particularly concerned whether marijuana is carcinogenic or
addictive. They are more concerned with keeping their breakfast down
and their weight up, so they can benefit from the other medical
treatments their doctors are prescribing.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, 40 of the patients served by the Santa Cruz
collective died, four of them during the week before the DEA raid.
The collective functioned as a hospice, and Valerie Corral, the
director of the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, was holding
the hands of many of these patients when they passed on.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the federal raid, many patients in Santa Cruz have
been condemned to a more painful, agonizing death. If the leaders of
the U.S. drug war think that compassion for the sick and dying is the
"wrong message," they are badly confused. If they think that the
scarce resources available to suppress heroin trafficking and
methamphetamine production should be used to send 30 agents armed
with M-16s into the mountains of Santa Cruz to harass the sick and
dying, they are worse than confused.</TE>
<TE>   They are demented.</TE>

<HD>Piracy May Keep the Beat From Going On</HD>
<DH>Musicians are being robbed of their livelihoods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WARREN</AU>
<BD>Diane Warren's hits include "Unbreak My Heart" for Toni
Braxton, "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" for Aerosmith and "How Do I
Live" for LeAnn Rimes.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a kid, I listened to the radio all the time. I didn't dream of
becoming a rock star. I dreamed of becoming a songwriter. My dream
has come true.</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, the growing epidemic of illegal downloading and CD burning
may make it a lot harder for a dream like mine to come true for other
songwriters.</LD>
<LD>   I struggled for more than 10 years, making the rounds of every
music publisher and suffering countless rejections before I began to
make a decent living from writing music. With my Dad encouraging me,
I persevered and made sure my songs were heard by everyone in the
music industry I could reach.</LD>
<TE>   I believe in what I do and work hard to craft the best songs
possible. And though I don't write songs just for the money, I do
expect to be rewarded for my hard work. Certainly, it wasn't just my
love for writing music but also the promise of being able to make a
living from my craft that helped keep me going in the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Will today's young talent have the same opportunities I did? If
people are not willing to pay for the music they love, why should
anyone be willing to spend the money it takes to make the music?</TE>
<TE>   Record companies put hundreds of thousands of dollars into
producing and promoting our songs for one simple reason: They expect
to earn it all back and then some. But if the fans are stealing music
instead of buying it, what incentive do the labels have to continue?
Would a housing developer lay out millions of dollars building a new
subdivision if he knew that squatters were going to move in and live
there for free?</TE>
<TE>   Fans may think that everyone in the music business is rich, but
that simply isn't true. A lot of great songwriters (and bands) get
only one commercial hit in their career. Their real interest may be
in creating alternative or ethnic music, material that is wonderful
but simply not commercial. The money from that one popular hit makes
it possible for these artists and writers to devote themselves to the
music they really love. To the extent that illegal downloading robs
them of those royalties, it robs them of this freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are the technicians, session musicians, backup
singers and others who play an essential role in helping to make the
music you enjoy. If big-name bands and singer-songwriters start
spending less time in the studio because pirates are stealing their
music, these people will suffer the most.</TE>
<TE>   Music pirates aren't just stealing people's music; they are
stealing people's livelihoods. To put it another way, illegal copying
not only threatens the entire music business, it also threatens
everyone who works in the recording industry.</TE>
<TE>   It's illegal to walk out of a record store with a CD you didn't
pay for. Why should downloading the same music be any different?</TE>

<HD>Accept Schroeder's Offering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Now, boys," a wise parent might say to President Bush and newly
reelected German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. "Don't you think it's
time to shake hands and make up?"</LD>
<LD>   It won't be that easy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's refusal to congratulate Schroeder on his victory this week
did seem petulant. But even if the president had played the
diplomatic game with more maturity, Schroeder's crassly political
manipulation of public sentiment about the Bush administration's
policy toward Iraq would no doubt continue to rankle the White House.</LD>
<TE>   At first it seemed Schroeder was merely reflecting the doubts that
many Germans feel about a unilateral war to topple Saddam Hussein.
But as the campaign went on, the chancellor became increasingly
demagogic, declaring that he wouldn't "click his heels" for
Washington--a line that rudely resonated with his justice minister's
comparison of Bush's tactics to Adolf Hitler's.</TE>
<TE>   On the matter of Iraq, Schroeder was creating a controversy where
none existed. No one was asking Germany for full-scale military
assistance. Meanwhile, Schroeder's ham-handed posturing threatened to
subvert the Bush administration's belated efforts to give the United
Nations a shot at defanging Hussein--exactly what many Europeans had
been clamoring for.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever hard feelings remain after all the harsh rhetoric,
neither the United States nor Germany can afford to prolong their
tiff. As Secretary of State Colin Powell--again, the Bush
administration's seemingly self-appointed cooler head--told Russian
newspaper Izvestia, "Differences and difficulties will arise in any
relationship from time to time, but the strength of the relationship
between the United States and Germany will remain and, I expect, will
thrive and grow."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there are plenty of reasons to think that the nations can
reconcile. Almost a quarter of Americans claim German roots, after
all. The United States is the third-largest exporter of goods into
Germany and the second-largest market for German exports--one likely
reason that our World War II enemy repeatedly shows with actions (if
not words) its support of the United States (if not, in all cases,
Bush).</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Germans spontaneously
gathered at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin for a candlelight vigil of
solidarity that soon extended nationwide. Germany committed 4,000
troops to the Bush administration's Operation Enduring Freedom and
pledged $278 million for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important to the United States, Germany is conducting
more than 30 terrorism-related investigations. It already has
indicted suspected conspirators and frozen bank accounts containing
more than $4 million that might have paid for more mass murder.</TE>
<TE>   By tossing out of his Cabinet the justice minister who made the
Nazi reference, Schroeder has stuck out his hand in apology. The
president needs to accept it. As a wise parent might lecture, you
can't judge friends by a few hurtful words or because they refuse to
go along with everything you want to do.</TE>

<LD>Defense lawyers throughout California are gasping about the lenient
justice system that prevails in the land. Outrage of outrages, they
say they have been victimized by one of their own. Crime victims, of
course, are entitled to sympathy. But in this case, we'd all have to
stop laughing first.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Defender Assn., you see, had kicked attorney
Ana Maria Patino out of its group and its Internet chat room. Now she
stands accused of using the identity of another lawyer to regain
access to the digital coffee klatch and--cover your eyes if you're
squeamish--write mean messages.</LD>
<LD>   Yes.</LD>
<TE>   Well, not just any mean messages. Look at her missive to a former
president of the Orange County Bar Assn., back when she was still
allowed in the chat room: "You never have ceased to amaze me in your
pretentious sense of power which you choose to gloat over people."
Actually, with a tortured sentence like that, Patino probably should
have been charged with "the cold-blooded murder of the English
tongue," as Henry Higgins put it in "My Fair Lady."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she was charged with identity theft, forgery and fraud,
the crimes some thieves use to rob people of their savings and credit
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But since no one lost a single tangible thing, not a life, limb or
nail clipper, prosecutors went soft on Patino. They'd make the whole
thing a civil matter if she agreed to apologize, do community service
and pay $1,500 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Patino admits nothing, except that she doesn't like the
public defenders and they don't like her. Easy to see both sides on
this one.</TE>
<TE>   Acting as if they've never heard of plea bargaining, and figuring
that the criminal courts can't be too busy for a good game of Trivial
Pursuit, members of the association plan to ask a judge to kill the
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   One fumes that prosecutors care more about being tough on "some
indigent client who pocketed something at Mervyn's" than on someone
who had the temerity to upset a pack of lawyers. Imagine.</TE>
<TE>   The State Bar of California plans to investigate. Other than
hoping for action there, the defenders would be best off taking the
experience as a sensitivity lesson: This is what it feels like to be
on the other side of the criminal justice system. Patino the defense
lawyer went and got herself a good defense lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly the way the system was meant to work. Funny that the
defense lawyers aren't applauding.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Bite Out of Spam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's one simple reason why the volume of commercial junk mail
known as spam is expected to increase more than fivefold over the
next four years: It's cheaper than sand. For just $100, an advertiser
can send out 50 million e-mail messages. Doing this by first-class
mail would cost more than $18 million in postage alone.</LD>
<LD>   Just one year ago, spam or bulk commercial e-mail made up about 8%
of all e-mail traffic and was mostly sent by recognizable companies
to willing recipients. Since then, however, spam has careened out of
control, with automated Web site programs and unscrupulous and
unreachable e-mail operators firing off unsolicited, often repugnant
messages that may one day gridlock all Internet traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Today, spam hogs about 40% of e-mail volume--exhausting computer
hard drives, running up consumers' phone bills and exposing anyone
using e-mail, including children, to unwanted pornography at its
aberrant worst.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Trade Commission has been lamely stockpiling consumer
complaints about spam in a database it calls "the refrigerator." It
could do much more to unclutter America's e-mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   By clearly defining what types of spam should be illegal, the
agency could slow the avalanche. And fines on those who keep sending
it--mainly a handful of easy-to-target big players--could pay for
better enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the National Consumers League and other citizens
groups petitioned the commission to issue a rule under which
unsolicited commercial e-mail would be held deceptive and therefore
unlawful if it misrepresented the subject, content or who sent it.
And spammers would have to make it easy for people to get off their
mailing lists.</TE>
<TE>   Some large companies that send e-mail only to people who ask for
it or at least let them easily get off e-mail lists (Charles Schwab
and Procter &amp; Gamble, for instance) object to bills pending in
Congress that would sweepingly ban spam. Even such responsible
e-mailers, however, have supported narrower regulations aimed at
restricting unsolicited spam that is clearly fraudulent, deceptive or
pornographic.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the proposed FTC rule is therefore limited mostly to
a small but powerful group of bulk e-mailers who speciously argue
that any restrictions would violate their 1st Amendment right to free
expression.</TE>
<TE>   But false advertising does not meet constitutional muster. And
just as Americans have always had the right to tell solicitors to
stop haranguing them, Internet users have a right to tell spammers to
stop sending them unwanted missives imploring "Turbo-Charge Your Sex
Life!"</TE>

<LD>Re "A Tale of Life-Saving in Mideast," Sept. 23: I happened to know
Jonathan Jesner, a victim of the Sept. 19 suicide bombing in Israel
and the hero who saved the life of a 7-year-old Palestinian girl when
she received his kidney, which his parents had donated following his
tragic murder. Jonathan was a kind-hearted individual. His parents'
choice to donate his organs and his brother's comment about the
recipient, that religion or nationality was "unimportant," truly
attest to Jonathan's greatness and character.</LD>
<LD>   May his memory be a blessing, and perhaps we can learn a little
from this episode: Even in times of war, there are still those who
value human life above all.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Assault on Arafat's Complex Halted, but Stalemate Persists,"
Sept. 23: Can I be the only person appalled by Israel's recent
assault on the Palestinian Authority? How difficult can it be to
launch an attack with tanks, Apache helicopters and armored
bulldozers (who pays for all that stuff anyway?) against a group
armed only with light arms?</TE>
<TE>   Until Israel realizes that military force alone will be
insufficient to subdue a people whose land and rights are being
stolen from them, there will be no end to the terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   What other options do the Palestinians have? Israel needs a leader
of vision, not this bully, armed by the United States.</TE>

<LD>I cannot let "Archdiocese to Cut Programs, Jobs to Close Budget Gap"
(Sept. 19) go without a response. It is unconscionable for a
religious group to be so unjust to loyal employees. Cutbacks may have
been necessary, but entire departments eliminated? Employees are
being let go who have worked for years for low pay, little
advancement possibilities and nothing paid into unemployment. As a
member of a Catholic religious congregation of women, I must register
my objection to what has occurred and attempt to stand with those who
have been so wronged.</LD>

<TE>   Cardinal Roger Mahony's assertion that funds used to build his
personal "Rog Mahal" were raised separately and have no bearing on
the recent budget shortfall of the archdiocese is patently absurd.
The archdiocese sent out a memo during the fund-raising period
listing the major cathedral donors and informing other Catholic
charities not to contact those donors. Since Mahony's bigwig friends
had already given to his pet project, I guess he didn't want them to
be bothered with giving to actual charities that help real people.</TE>

<HD>Involuntary Treatment: A Court Would Decide</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Legal Threat to Mentally Ill," Voices, Sept. 21: I strongly
disagree with Sally Zinman and her article on the mentally ill. I
believe my son could have been saved by involuntary mental health
treatment. He believed that everyone else was sick but himself. (That
was his paranoia.) Yes, he threatened to "cut me up and flush me down
the toilet," and he tried to hire someone to kill me. This was just
his sickness. He never followed through.</LD>
<LD>   I tried everything I could to persuade him to seek treatment. Then
I tried every type of office, from the Police Department to
psychiatric facilities, to take him. The answer was: "We cannot do
anything unless he harms himself or others." Well, he never harmed
himself or others, but he has been missing now for 16 years. Every
night I pray that he will be found, that he is not in pain, that he
has not harmed anyone. Is he out on the street? In prison? In some
situation where he is unable to help himself? If he had been
involuntarily committed, maybe he could have had some help. He was/is
a brilliant young man who had a wonderful future until he became
sick, and there was nothing that I could do. I could write you a
volume of all that I have tried to do to find my son.</LD>
<TE>   I do hope that Gov. Gray Davis signs the bill to help mentally ill
people. After all, the bill includes a court-ordered hearing; it
would not just be the family who would determine that someone should
be committed.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Ochoa</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article concerning the mentally ill was well thought out. I
am a mentally ill person suffering from bipolar disorder. I am doing
very well, now that I have the option to seek treatment. If I were
forced to be in treatment I would just go away. Many of the
medications they would force on you damage your liver or kidneys or
other organs. It has taken a trial and error of over 100 medications
to find the combination that works for me at this time, and I know it
will not work forever and that new meds will have to be tried. I know
too many mentally ill people--forcing them will only cause them to go
into hiding and stop their meds. Please write Gov. Davis and ask him
to veto AB 1421.</TE>

<HD>Homelessness: New Solutions Are Needed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I applaud Sheriff Lee Baca's attempt to help homeless people
("Sheriff Leads Meeting of the Minds at 'Ground Zero' for
Homelessness," Sept. 20). He is one of the few public officials who
have time for this problem. I work for a church and have homeless
people at my office door daily asking for food, clothes and shelter.
We give what we can, but the problem is getting worse with the
downturn in the economy. I am now seeing people who can barely pay
their rent, asking for food, and people who lost their apartments and
are living in their cars, needing assistance. These are the new
homeless.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps a solution can be found in giving the money to the local
churches and pantries and letting the churches set up transitional
housing. The church will continue to feed these people and work with
social workers on how to get them back into society. We have been
doing it all along. I can guarantee you that very little money would
go to administrative costs because the bulk of the work would be done
by volunteers.</LD>

<TE>   "Leaders Who Look Away" (editorial, Sept. 19) suggests that a
public official's commitment to the issue of homelessness should be
based on his or her attendance at a single event. Though I would have
liked to attend the homeless summit in its entirety, as chair of the
City Council's housing committee I first joined Mayor James Hahn at
the previously scheduled U.S. Conference of Mayors' forum on
solutions to the nation's housing crisis before attending the
downtown summit. That the city had multiple housing events on a
single day should be cause for celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Much of my career has been dedicated to addressing homelessness.
As a policy advisor to Mayor Tom Bradley, I participated in the
formation of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. As a senior
official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I served
as deputy director of the Inter-Agency Council on Homelessness. As
part of the Innovative Cities program, I helped bring Los Angeles $20
million in funding for homelessness programs.</TE>
<TE>   Homelessness did not develop overnight, and it will not be solved
in one day or one meeting. A real, lasting solution requires
long-term commitment and the creative energies of the public, private
and nonprofit sectors.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Iraq's a Loose Cannon, so U.S. Must Fire First," Commentary,
Sept. 23: Avigdor Haselkorn concluded that U.S. unilateralism and
perceived unpredictability will be "better ... for U.S. security and
for world peace." It must be asked critically: better for whose
peace? Better for the peace of taxpaying Americans who will be
funding this $200-billion adventure? Better for the peace of the
Iraqi people, who have suffered grievously during the last 10 years
of American-led bombing and sanctions? Better for the peace of Iraq's
neighbors, who, for whatever reason, seem unanimously opposed to the
impending invasion?</LD>
<LD>   Haselkorn, like so many other hawks in this debate, suggests that
the attainment of this far-off, abstract and lofty ideal of "world
peace" requires, regrettably in this case, war. My suspicion is that
the last thing Haselkorn and his ilk want is world peace. This is
because for them, peace is war and war is peace.</LD>

<TE>   Somehow the idea of going to war with Iraq has become a fait

from why to when. But it has still not answered the fundamental
questions: Why Iraq, and why now? Until it does, we have no right
attacking another country.</TE>

<TE>   I find it hypocritical that we're poised to invade Iraq when
Iraq's invasion of another sovereign nation (Kuwait) was the very
reason we fought against them in the Persian Gulf War. Regardless of
whether or not Saddam Hussein is a despicable person (he is) and
whether or not he has weapons of mass destruction (he might), we
still don't have the right to commit a preemptive attack on Iraq or
any other country; no one does.</TE>

<LD>Re "Park Attendance Drops for 6th Straight Year," Sept. 17: This past
summer my husband and I spent five wonderful days exploring Yosemite
National Park. It was my first time in this wondrous and beautiful
place. We were not only impressed by the awesome scope of Yosemite
but also the concentrated effort underway by park employees to
restore the park to its original natural state. Re-landscaping,
planting and monitoring the water were all activities we observed
when we were there.</LD>
<LD>   We did see a distinct lack of park rangers, and this we were told
was because of budget problems. An entrance fee of $20 is more than
justified and, in my opinion, not enough to preserve this special
site. Make the drive to Yosemite, see it for yourself and share it
with your children. For $20 you get nature at its most breathtaking.</LD>

<LD>John Balzar explains to us how President Bush's tax cuts are "a dirty
deal for the middle class" (Commentary, Sept. 22). The repeal of the
alternative minimum tax was taken off the table in Congress by the
Democrats. The AMT was never favored by Republicans, and that
includes Bush.</LD>
<LD>   To his credit, Balzar did not repeat the Democrats' mantra about
the new rates representing just "tax cuts for the rich." In fact, the
rich will pay a greater share of the federal income taxes after the
cuts become effective.</LD>
<LD>   H. R. Richner</LD>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A popular question among TV talking heads these days is how we are
supposed to pay for the proposed war on Iraq. Allow me to commend
Balzar's commentary to the curious. The answer is clear. This war
will be charged to the middle class. Balzar predicts that the way the
bill will come due is thanks to the alternative minimum tax, a
formula that subtracts certain deductions, resulting in higher taxes
for people earning between $75,000 and $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The AMT was, ironically, enacted to make sure those in the highest
income brackets paid their share, but since half a million--to say
nothing of 75 grand--is scarcely the upper-class income it was in
1969, the burden of paying the AMT has now shifted to the middle
brackets, while those in the true upper reaches will see their taxes
decrease. How much will the AMT funnel into the Treasury? A handy
$141 billion over the next several years. That should pay for a lot
of smart bombs.</TE>

<HD>Gay Man's Sexual Harassment Lawsuit Ruled Worthy of Trial</HD>
<DH>Appeal: Federal court says butler may pursue case against
Las Vegas casino where he worked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A butler who claims he was harassed on the job at the MGM Grand Hotel
in Las Vegas because he is gay is entitled to a trial against the
nation's second-largest casino company, a federal appeals court in
San Francisco held Tuesday in a precedent-setting decision.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-4 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned
two earlier decisions holding that workers are protected under
federal law against discrimination based on color, race, religion,
gender or national origin, but not sexual orientation.</LD>
<LD>   Whether a worker is gay or straight is "irrelevant" to the
protections provided by Title VII of the nation's civil rights laws,
wrote Judge William A. Fletcher. "It is enough that the harassers
have engaged in a severe or pervasive unwelcome physical conduct of a
sexual nature."</LD>
<TE>   Neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor any other federal appellate
court has addressed the issue. Previously, the Supreme Court had
ruled that federal law prohibits same-sex harassment, but that case
did not deal with sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Jon Davidson of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of
Medina Rene, said the ruling could have broad ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "The court was clear that lesbians and gay men are equally
protected from sexual harassment on the job" and the ruling will make
it easier for them to win harassment cases," Davidson said. "A
significant amount of anti-gay harassment is sexual in nature and is
rooted in gender stereotypes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit stems from events that allegedly occurred on the hotel's
29th floor, which was reserved for high rollers.</TE>
<TE>   Over a two-year period, Rene alleged, co-workers subjected him to
crude jokes, called him muneca (Spanish for "doll"), forced him to
look at pictures of naked men having sex, grabbed his crotch and
touched him in other ways that he found offensive.</TE>
<TE>   In his deposition, Rene stated that co-workers teased him about
the way he walked, and whistled and blew kisses at him "like a man
does to a woman."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Rene said the harassment and the casino's
failure to stop it were hard on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried. I couldn't sleep. I said to God, 'This isn't happening,'
" Rene said in a telephone interview from Fort Lauderdale, where he
is now a waiter. If proved, such conduct clearly would constitute "an
objectively abusive working environment" of a "sexual nature,"
Fletcher wrote</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher cited a 1998 U.S. Supreme Court case that expanded
federal civil rights law by prohibiting same-sex harassment. The
ruling stemmed from claims made by a Louisiana man who quit his job
on an offshore drilling platform after he was ridiculed, grabbed and
threatened repeatedly with rape in a shower by two male supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Before that decision, some contended that valid harassment claims
could be filed only by women alleging that men had mistreated them.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be close cases on the question of what constitutes
physical conduct of a sexual nature, for there are some physical
assaults that are intended to inflict physical injury, but are not
intended to have (and are not interpreted as having) sexual meaning,"
Fletcher wrote. "But this is not such a case .... Rene has alleged a
physical assault of a sexual nature."</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher's plurality opinion was joined by four other judges. Two
other judges also agreed that Rene was entitled to a trial, saying he
should have his day in court because he alleged viable claims of
"gender stereotyping harassment."</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters, led by Judge Procter Hug Jr., reiterated the
position Hug took when he wrote the earlier 2-1 majority decision in
the case a year ago: Harassment of gays and lesbians based on sexual
orientation is "appalling" and "noxious" but does not violate federal
law. Hug said the majority decision mischaracterized federal law and
Supreme Court decisions interpreting it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy now because I'm doing something for mankind," Rene
said. He said he sued "because I don't want this to happen to anybody
else. God made everybody equal. We all bleed the same color. It's not
just Las Vegas. It's the country. People think it's a joke and it's
not a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Rene testified recently before a congressional panel in support of
a measure to expand federal anti-discrimination laws by adding
protections for gays.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Mirage, the hotel's parent company, is evaluating its next
move, said Shelly Mansolt, vice president of corporate
communications.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations set forth in [Rene's] complaint have never been
before a jury and therefore have not been established," Mansolt said.
"We do not believe the evidence in the case will support Mr. Rene's
position."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is applicable in the nine states, including California,
within the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction. California and three other
states within the 9th Circuit--Hawaii, Nevada and Oregon--have state
laws permitting sexual harassment suits of this kind.</TE>

<HD>Leon Hart, 73; Won 1949 Heisman Trophy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leon Hart, the rugged two-way end who won the 1949 Heisman Trophy as
college football's top player and helped Notre Dame win three
national titles, died Tuesday. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Hart died of complications from a perforated duodenal ulcer at St.
Joseph Medical Center in South Bend, Ind., the home of Notre Dame,
which he affectionately called Mecca. He had suffered from health
problems in recent years, undergoing a quadruple heart bypass and
battling prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Though Hart was a member of three National Football League
championship teams with the Detroit Lions in the 1950s, he is best
remembered for playing on the great Notre Dame teams of the late
1940s that were coached by Frank Leahy.</LD>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish never lost a game during Hart's four seasons,
compiling a record of 36-0-2 and winning national championships in
1946, 1947 and 1949. They finished No. 2 in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a giant for his era, the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Hart was a
devastating blocker and monstrous defender. He played offensive and
defensive end in the days before two-platoon football turned the game
into one of specialization, and also played fullback in short-yardage
running situations.</TE>
<TE>   "[Tackle] Jim Martin and I were co-captains in '49, and we just
stayed on the field until the score allowed us to leave," Hart
recalled in an interview with The Times in 1987. "I remember Leahy
saying, 'Leon, don't get hurt because you gotta play anyhow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hart never caught more than 19 passes in a season, a reflection of
the run-oriented offenses of the time, but his receptions frequently
resulted in big plays. One of the biggest came during Hart's junior
season in 1948, when he caught a short pass from quarterback Frank
Tripucka and broke several tackles on his way to a 35-yard touchdown
in a 14-14 tie with USC at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "Tackling Hart was like trying to bulldog a full-grown Brahma
bull," said author Cameron Applegate.</TE>
<TE>   Hart learned by telegram that he had won the Heisman Trophy after
the 1949 season. Although teammate Johnny Lujack had won the award
two years earlier, Hart didn't realize the magnitude of the honor and
brought the telegram to his position coach, John Druze.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it was a big deal out of New York and I probably ought
to go," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   Hart and Yale end Larry Kelley, the 1936 winner, are the only
linemen to win the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a badge you wear the rest of your life," said Hart, who was
voted male athlete of the year by the Associated Press in 1949,
beating out Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers and pro golfer
Sam Snead.</TE>
<TE>   Although he cherished the Heisman, Hart auctioned off the trophy
two years ago so he wouldn't have to decide which of his six children
should get it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier to do it this way than to flip a coin and make five
of them unhappy," he said. "It's easier to split revenue than to
split the trophy."</TE>
<TE>   Hart served as senior class president at Notre Dame before
graduating in 1950 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was
the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL in 1950, and helped transform the
Detroit Lions from losers into winners. He played eight seasons and
helped the Lions win titles in 1952, 1953 and 1957. He earned All-Pro
honors in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from football, the Turtle Creek, Pa. native owned a
car dealership in Detroit and later became a market analyst.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, he formed a manufacturing company, Tire Tru, makers of
wheel-balancing material, in Birmingham, Mich, where he lived.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is survived by six children and eight grandchildren. One of
his grandsons, Brendan Hart, is a walk-on tight end for Notre Dame.
Hart's wife of 48 years, Lois, died in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Joan Littlewood, 87; Innovative Stage Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joan Littlewood, one of postwar Britain's greatest stage directors,
whose influential Theater Workshop transformed British drama in the
1950s and '60s, has died. She was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Littlewood, best known for devising and directing the satirical
musical "Oh What a Lovely War," had lived in France since the
mid-1970s.</LD>
<LD>   She died in her sleep Friday night in London while visiting the
home of her assistant.</LD>
<TE>   Dubbed "The mother of modern theater" by the London Independent,
Littlewood was known as a passionate iconoclast who gave "a voice to
the aspirations and concerns of ordinary people on stage."</TE>
<TE>   As artistic director of the Theater Workshop, which was founded in
1945, Littlewood initially presided over a troupe of actors who
toured the countryside in an old truck and performed politically and
socially relevant plays in places such as the Bolton Miners' Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Littlewood's credo was "theater should be grand, vulgar, simple,
pathetic"--"not genteel, not poetical."</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, the company moved into the Theatre Royal, a run-down,
512-seat Victorian-era playhouse outside London in a working-class
area known as Stratford East.</TE>
<TE>   Her actors initially slept in hammocks in the auditorium and
earned only a few dollars a week from the box office proceeds of the
theater, for which they provided maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   But the Theater Workshop quickly earned a reputation for being
what critic Harold Hobson called "England's premier company."</TE>
<TE>   With a "rowdy vitality" that became her signature, Littlewood
shunned conventional acting, fancy sets and even the curtain. She
used revolutionary lighting techniques and filled the stage with
realistic, working-class characters.</TE>
<TE>   She also nurtured young actors and playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   She discovered and directed plays by Irish dramatist Brendan
Behan, including his attack on capital punishment, "The Quare
Fellow," and his Irish Republican Army play, "The Hostage"; and
ex-convict Frank Norman's musical "Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be."</TE>
<TE>   Littlewood also discovered 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney's "A Taste
of Honey," an offbeat comedy about a white girl from northern England
who becomes pregnant after an affair with a black sailor and is taken
care of by a homosexual friend.</TE>
<TE>   Like a number of the plays that debuted at the Theatre Royal, "A
Taste of Honey" transferred to London's West End theater district and
on to Broadway, starring Joan Plowright.</TE>
<TE>   Although Littlewood said she was "disinterested in old theater, in
great genius, in art," she interspersed the offbeat new works with
her own rambunctiously staged versions of the classics.</TE>
<TE>   Among her discoveries was a young actor who starred in her
production of "Macbeth," Richard Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The Theater Workshop's greatest success came with "Oh What a
Lovely War," a vaudeville-style revue of sketches and World War I
songs such as "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" and "Keep the Home Fires
Burning."</TE>
<TE>   Littlewood once said the idea for the musical, which opened at the
Theatre Royal in 1963, grew out of her realization that "war is for
clowns."</TE>
<TE>   "We're mocking the absurdity, the vulgarity of war," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Philosopher and antiwar activist Bertrand Russell said the musical
"brought war to within our grasp, which is immensely difficult."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh What a Lovely War," which became a star-studded 1969 British
movie directed by Richard Attenborough, also had a long run in the
West End, and Littlewood staged the musical on Broadway in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   "How I'd like to start all over again, kicking the bloody nonsense
out of the theater," she told Associated Press drama critic William
Glover at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Eating a breakfast of rare hamburger and a beer at 2 p.m.,
"London's noted stage rebel," as Glover called her, ignored an aide's
suggestion that she mind her tongue.</TE>
<TE>   With a grin, Littlewood said, "They can't make me discreet."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she had been called a crank, an illiterate, a peasant
and--her favorite--a vulgarian.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just a bloody vulgarian," she acknowledged with obvious
relish to a New York Times reporter about the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her detractors' aspersions--she was called a communist by
the BBC in the late 1940s and barred from the radio studio where she
was scheduled to record a play--Littlewood's reputation in British
theater was secure.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote British critic Kenneth Tynan: "It now seems quite likely
that when the annals of British Theatre in the middle years of the
20th century are written, Joan's name will lead all the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Born in London in 1914, Littlewood was the illegitimate daughter
of a young housemaid and a working-class father she never knew.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Littlewood once said, "really hated" her, and she was
brought up in Stockwell by her grandparents, who could neither read
nor write.</TE>
<TE>   Her love of the theater ignited by school trips to the Old Vic,
she left home at 16 after winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art.</TE>
<TE>   She is said to have done well at the prestigious academy, but
dropped out, disgruntled with her fellow students who, she later
said, were "debs and rich Americans acquiring English accents."</TE>
<TE>   Moving north to Manchester, she landed a job in a repertory
theater but quickly grew dissatisfied with traditional theater.</TE>
<TE>   Together with Jimmy Miller, who became her husband and wrote plays
under the name Ewan McColl, she founded the agitprop group Theater of
Action.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, in 1934, she founded the Theater Union, an amateur
group that became known for its unconventional productions of
experimental plays performed in halls and outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Having disbanded when war broke out in 1939, the group reunited in
1945 under the name Theater Workshop.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Littlewood moved the Theater Workshop into the Theatre
Royal in 1953, her husband was out of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Littlewood had a long relationship with Gerry Raffles, the Theater
Workshop's general manager, whom she met in 1945 when he was 16 and
she was 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he finished up with me," she once said. "He was
very handsome. But he did."</TE>
<TE>   After Raffles died of diabetes at 51 in 1975, Littlewood never
directed again.</TE>
<TE>   She left England for France, moving into a two-room flat in
Vienne, near Lyons, owned by an Algerian cleaning woman.</TE>
<TE>   "A slum," she said. "But good people."</TE>
<TE>   She later lived in a small apartment on the Left Bank in Paris,
where she kept in touch with her old theater colleagues in England.</TE>
<TE>   At her request, her ashes will be placed alongside those of
Raffles in Vienne.</TE>

<HD>Mike Webster, 50; Steeler Helped Win 4 Super Bowls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Webster, the rugged Pittsburgh Steeler center who snapped the
ball to Terry Bradshaw to win Super Bowl championships but was beset
by physical and financial difficulties in retirement, died Tuesday in
Pittsburgh. He was 50.</LD>
<LD>   No cause of death was announced by Allegheny General Hospital at
the request of the family, but Webster was being treated in the
coronary care unit after being admitted Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Known as "Iron Mike" when he played because of the strength and
doggedness that allowed him to play 10 seasons without missing a
game, Webster announced in 1999 that the battering had taken a
tremendous toll.</LD>
<TE>   Repeated blows to his head during his 17-year NFL career caused
injury to his brain that interfered with his judgment, memory and
attention span, Webster and his doctors told reporters as he sought
to explain a charge that he forged prescriptions for Ritalin. He said
he used the drug to treat his condition. (Webster was sentenced to
five years' probation.)</TE>
<TE>   He also had numerous financial, family and emotional difficulties,
and was briefly homeless in the early 1990s. Though Webster separated
from his wife, Pam, in 1992, she was there to support him at his
induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997, and he recently
had been living in suburban Pittsburgh with his son, Garrett, a high
school football player.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Webby's life after football wasn't the grandest," said
Bradshaw, who was distraught Tuesday but issued a statement through
Fox, where he works as an NFL analyst. "He went through a lot of
tough years, but never complained about anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike meant more to me than just a teammate because our careers
with the Steelers were so intertwined. He was my center for the last
nine years of my career, when my career really took off as a
quarterback, and I couldn't have asked for a more dependable blocker
and leader in front of me. His arrival was the beginning of our Super
Bowl run, our four championships."</TE>
<TE>   Franco Harris, the great Steeler running back of the 1970s era
that saw Pittsburgh win the Super Bowl in 1975, 1976, 1979 and 1980,
called Webster, the Steelers' offensive captain for nine seasons, "a
great teammate."</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the main reasons why we won four Super Bowls,"
Harris said. (Webster became the full-time center in 1976.) "He was
also a great person and friend. Unfortunately, he had some turmoil
and misfortune after his football career. He is now at peace. We do
miss and love Mike."</TE>
<TE>   A fifth-round draft choice from the University of Wisconsin in
1974, Webster was considered undersized at 6 feet 1 and 225 pounds.
But the Tomahawk, Wis., native made up for any shortcoming with wile
and strength, eventually playing at 260 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike was a little guy with a big heart," said "Mean" Joe Greene,
the defensive tackle who anchored Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain defense.
"He was always smart and quick. Then he got strong."</TE>
<TE>   Webster's toughness made him emblematic of the Steeler era, and he
is remembered for going sleeveless during games even in the most
bitter Pittsburgh cold.</TE>
<TE>   Besides winning four Super Bowl rings, Webster played in six AFC
championship games and nine Pro Bowls. After the Steelers allowed him
to become a free agent in 1988, he joined the Kansas City Chiefs--at
first to be a coach, but quickly becoming the team's starting center.
He played two more seasons before retiring in 1990 at age 38.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Webster was named to the All-Time NFL team, and
former Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll has called him "the best center
ever to play the game."</TE>
<TE>   His heroics had a price.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors told Webster the damage to his brain resembled that
sometimes sustained by boxers.</TE>
<TE>   "A doctor told Mike it looked like he'd been in an auto accident,"
Pam Webster told the Houston Chronicle in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked Mike if he was ever hit in the head, and Mike said,
'Yeah, about 25,000 times.' "</TE>
<TE>   What will be remembered, though, are the glory days of the
Steelers, and the relationship between Webster and Bradshaw born of
one of the most physically intimate interactions in sports.</TE>
<TE>   At Bradshaw's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
1989, he startled and amused onlookers by saying, "What I wouldn't
give to put my hands under Mike Webster's butt one more time."</TE>
<TE>   "I know writers have joked about how much Webby helped me with my
audibles, and some of that is true," Bradshaw said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't have been the player I was without him. We were on the
same wavelength during a game. He was so smart, so prepared for
everything we would face in a game."</TE>
<TE>   What he faced after the games ended was more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I want his family to know that I am deeply saddened by his
passing because I know how much he loved them," Bradshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last [weeks], we've lost Johnny Unitas, Bob Hayes and now
Mike ...."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTPELIER, Vt.</DL>
<LD>A U.S. judge declared the federal death penalty law unconstitutional
Tuesday in a ruling that defense lawyers said could provide a new
argument for challenging capital cases across the country.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge William Sessions said recent cases, including
a U.S. Supreme Court ruling which found that juries and not judges
must hand out death sentences, have rendered existing death penalty
law unusable.</LD>
<LD>   Since the high court's ruling in June, a federal judge in New York
has ruled that capital punishment is in itself unconstitutional.
Other federal judges, in Virginia and Pennsylvania, have upheld the
Federal Death Penalty Act.</LD>
<TE>   Sessions found that capital punishment would be legal if Congress
repaired defects in the 1994 law.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in Vermont and elsewhere have responded to the
high court ruling by taking cases back to grand juries to consider
whether defendants should get the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Sessions ruled that the death penalty law makes no provision for
such action. He also found that giving grand juries a hand in death
penalty decisions is unconstitutional because such panels do not hold
to the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, and because they do not
offer defendants the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in the case of Donald Fell, 22, who is charged
with kidnapping and killing a woman in a November 2000 carjacking.
Prosecutors said they would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Fell's lawyer, Alexander Bunin, called the ruling a landmark that
could jeopardize cases against every defendant facing the death
penalty, including the case of Sept. 11 conspiracy suspect Zacarias
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Martinek, editor of Lawyers Weekly USA, said a higher court
will have to agree with Sessions before that happens.</TE>
<TE>   But, Martinek added, "The intellectual implications for
influencing what other judges might do, potentially influencing what
the 2nd Circuit [Court of Appeals] and maybe the Supreme Court might
do, are pretty big. It's a new idea about how to challenge the
federal death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   In July, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York became the
first federal judge to declare the law unconstitutional. He cited
evidence indicating that innocent people have been executed. The
government is appealing that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The rulings by Rakoff and Sessions will not affect individual
states' death penalty statutes. Thirty-eight states allow capital
punishment, although some have not executed anyone for years.</TE>

<HD>Jury Selection Starts in Einhorn Murder Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Jury selection began Tuesday in the murder trial of Ira Einhorn, and
attorneys for the former hippie guru said they may call musician
Peter Gabriel and actress Ellen Burstyn as witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Einhorn, who is accused of murdering his girlfriend in 1977, spent
two decades hiding out in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Jury selection began with a pool of 120 jurors, about half of whom
were immediately excused after indicating they would suffer a
hardship if forced to sit through a long trial.</LD>
<TE>   Once selected, jury members will be almost immediately sequestered
in a hotel, and allowed to go home only long enough to gather their
belongings. Judge William J. Mazzola said he expects the trial to
last until at least the middle of October. Jury selection is expected
to last at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for both sides read their lists of possible witnesses to
the jury pool. Defense attorney William T. Cannon's list included
Gabriel, a onetime acquaintance of Einhorn, and Burstyn, whose name
appeared in Einhorn's journals seized by police, according to Cannon.
He called them "potential character witnesses" but did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn, 62, arrived in the courtroom smiling and shook hands with
bailiffs and courtroom personnel as he sat down. He consulted often
with his lawyers as questioning started, and Cannon said Einhorn was
"in on the decision-making of every juror who will be accepted in
this case."</TE>
<TE>   The onetime counterculture hero who called himself "The Unicorn"
is charged with bludgeoning live-in girlfriend Holly Maddux to death
and stuffing her body in a steamer trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Her mummified remains were found in 1979, two years after she
disappeared, when neighbors complained about an odor. Einhorn had
told police that Maddux went to a grocery store and never returned.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn was arrested, but released on bail in 1979 after several
prominent Philadelphians vouched for his character. He vanished on
the eve of his 1981 trial and spent 20 years hiding in Europe before
he was arrested in 1997, living with a wife in a converted windmill
in France.</TE>
<TE>   He was returned to the U.S. in July 2001, but only after
prosecutors agreed to a French request not to seek the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>Bush Expected to Name Advisor to Run the FDA</HD>
<DH>Health: Confirmation is likely for Mark McClellan, a
physician and economics expert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush has decided to name a senior health advisor, Mark B.
McClellan, to head the Food and Drug Administration, a key post that
has gone unfilled throughout the Bush presidency, informed sources
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   An official announcement is expected soon, a senior administration
official confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   McClellan, a physician with a doctorate in medical economics, is
expected to easily win Senate confirmation to lead an agency facing
such challenges as bolstering the nation's food safety, ensuring a
cleaner blood supply and expediting the drug approval process. The
FDA oversees a broad array of consumer protection issues from drug
advertising to food labeling.</LD>
<TE>   The 39-year-old native of Austin, Texas, has held a variety of
academic and governmental posts, including deputy assistant Treasury
secretary for economic policy in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   One reason that the FDA post has remained vacant has been the
unyielding opposition of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who chairs
the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, to any
nominee with ties to industry.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional sources indicated Tuesday that McClellan would have
Kennedy's backing.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. McClellan has impressive credentials both as a physician and
as an economist, and I look forward to learning more about his views
on issues critical to the FDA," Kennedy said in a statement issued by
his office.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bush administration, McClellan has served on the
three-member Council of Economic Advisers, a post he assumed after
winning Senate confirmation, and worked on the president's Medicare
reform efforts and his proposal to provide prescription drug coverage
to senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan enjoys the reputation of a policy expert with an
instinct for finding compromises on nettlesome issues.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the Bush administration, he taught health care
economics and practiced medicine at Stanford University. He also has
written widely on cost-effectiveness of medical technologies.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan holds a master's in public health from Harvard, a degree
from the Harvard Medical School and his doctorate in economics from
MIT.</TE>
<TE>   His pedigree also may have helped with the Bush White House.
McClellan's mother is Carole Keeton Rylander, a longtime mayor of
Austin who now serves as the Texas comptroller.</TE>
<TE>   A brother, Scott McClellan, Bush's principal deputy press
secretary, refused to discuss the nomination, citing long-standing
White House policy of never discussing impending personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   "When the president is ready to make an announcement, he will do
so," Scott McClellan said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mark McClellan is a 1985 graduate of the University of Texas with
degrees in English and biology. After earning his advanced degrees,
he obtained dual appointments at Stanford, as an associate professor
in health-care economics and as a physician and teacher at the
school's hospital.</TE>
<TE>   He is married and is the father of 3-year-old twin girls.</TE>

<HD>Alligator Bites Off Man's Arm at Garden in Florida</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>An alligator bit off a man's right forearm, which was retrieved from
the animal's stomach but was too damaged to reattach, wildlife
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Don Goodman, director of Kanapaha Botanical Gardens, was weeding a
waterlily garden Monday when the 11-foot alligator bit his arm off
from just below his elbow, said Justin Lagotic, spokesman for Alachua
County Fire Rescue.</LD>
<LD>   Wildlife officials harpooned the male alligator, said John Duncan,
an officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission. Authorities shot the alligator and slit its stomach open,
finding Goodman's arm inside. The arm was taken to Shands Hospital at
the University of Florida, but doctors could not reattach it, a
botanical garden spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Goodman was in fair condition Tuesday, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The gator probably attacked because it mistook Goodman's hand for
another animal, said Gabe Duclos, a gardener at Kanapaha.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman has been director of the gardens since 1978. It was the
first alligator attack at the park, owned by Alachua County and
maintained by the North Florida Botanical Society.</TE>

<HD>Party Sidesteps Gore's Jab at Bush</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lieberman disagrees with criticism of Iraq
policy. Other key Democrats stay mum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Prominent Democrats stepped gingerly Tuesday around former Vice
President Al Gore's criticism of President Bush's policy on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Gore's vice presidential running mate of two years ago, Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), said he did not agree that action
against Iraq could detract from the overall fight against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "I respectfully disagree with that part of it," he said. "I am
confident the American military can do, and will do, both at once."</LD>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), said he, like Gore,
had "raised the questions: What will it do to our international
partnerships? What effect will it have on the war on terrorism? What
does a preemptive strike mean for other countries? Does it set the
wrong example?"</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats opted for silence on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Terry McAuliffe, national chairman of the Democratic Party, said
through an aide that he would have no comment.</TE>
<TE>   And House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) offered no
immediate response.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks delivered Monday in San Francisco, Gore said he was
concerned that "the policy we are presently following with respect to
Iraq has the potential to seriously damage our ability to win the war
against terrorism and to weaken our ability to lead the world in this
new century."</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president spoke as Democratic congressional
leaders were seeking agreement with their GOP counterparts and the
White House on legislation that would authorize Bush to use force to
move against Saddam Hussein and any Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction. A vote is likely by next week, and overwhelming
bipartisan approval is expected in both the House and Senate.</TE>

<HD>FBI Agent Memo Urged Probe of Suspect Tied to 9/11</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Failure of officials to follow up on the man's
contacts with one of the hijackers is seen as another missed
opportunity for bureau.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A memo from a Phoenix FBI agent urging the bureau to investigate
Middle Eastern men at American flight schools focused on a suspect
who had repeated contacts with one of the Sept. 11 hijackers--a
disclosure lawmakers said signaled yet another missed opportunity to
unravel the plot months before the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect--whom authorities declined to identify--may have
trained and screened pilots involved in the plot, according to
testimony at a congressional hearing Tuesday. The new information
contradicts repeated statements by law enforcement and intelligence
officials over the last year that none of the suspects identified in
the so-called Phoenix memo was linked to Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI has since learned that the suspect in the memo met
repeatedly with Hani Hanjour, who is believed to have seized control
of the American Airlines plane that crashed into the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   In other testimony, a Minneapolis FBI agent said he warned
officials in Washington that Zacarias Moussaoui, accused of being the
intended 20th hijacker, might be part of a plot to "take control of a
plane and fly it into the World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of disclosures indicate the Sept. 11 plot was not as
compartmentalized as U.S. intelligence officials have claimed.
Indeed, the thrust of Tuesday's testimony underscored that a web of
connections between the hijackers and others who had come into
investigators' sights is still emerging.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing focused on lapses in the FBI's handling of the
Phoenix memo and the investigation of Moussaoui, who is awaiting
criminal trial in federal court in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, FBI officials in Washington failed to heed
prescient warnings from field offices.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Hill, director of the congressional investigation, on
Tuesday attributed the FBI's lapses to a "myopic" culture in the
bureau before the Sept. 11 attacks that prevented officials from
recognizing broader patterns and threats.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, FBI officials now theorize that the suspect, who had
significant flying experience, helped to train Hanjour and may have
been screening other would-be Al Qaeda hijackers to determine whether
they were capable of carrying out the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That is an investigative theory" the FBI is pursuing, said
Kenneth Williams, the author of the July 10, 2001, memo urging
officials in Washington to launch a probe of flight schools across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said the FBI had been alerted to the possibility of
terrorists training in U.S. flight schools well before the Phoenix
memo.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she said, an FBI pilot in Oklahoma City wrote a memo
expressing concern about the number of Middle Eastern flight students
he had encountered in schools there, and speculating that they could
be planning attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But even given these previous warnings, and the avalanche of
intelligence traffic warning of imminent Al Qaeda attacks during the
summer of 2001, the FBI essentially dismissed the Phoenix memo.</TE>
<TE>   New York FBI agents who reviewed it found it "speculative and not
particularly significant," Hill said. Indeed, the agents said they
knew associates of Osama bin Laden trained at U.S. flight schools,
but thought the students posed no direct threat.</TE>
<TE>   "The commonly held view at the FBI prior to Sept. 11 was that Bin
Laden needed pilots to operate aircraft he purchased in the United
States to move men and materiel," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the attacks, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and
others have downplayed the significance of the Phoenix memo, saying
there were no links between suspects named in the memo and the Sept.
11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI has since uncovered an alarming connection between one
of the individuals named in the memo and Hanjour, a Saudi citizen who
first came to the United States in 1991. The memo names 10
individuals, none of whom have been identified publicly.</TE>
<TE>   The connections between the suspect and Hanjour date back to 1997,
Hill said, when they began training together at an Arizona flight
school. At least one instructor at the school said the two men may
even have carpooled together.</TE>
<TE>   Records obtained by the FBI indicate the two men were at the
flight school on the same day on at least five occasions. Once, in
1999, the suspect accompanied Hanjour in a training session in a
plane.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities increasingly believe the suspect may have played a
broader role in the plot because he was a veteran pilot training
alongside students with far less experience. "What other reason would
there be for an experienced pilot to be sitting in on Cessna
simulators with these other guys?" one source close to the
investigation asked.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI sought to investigate the suspect in May 2001, two months
before Williams wrote his memo, but dropped the effort after learning
he was out of the country. The FBI didn't know that the suspect
returned to the United States shortly thereafter, having failed to
notify the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the State
Department.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official downplayed the seriousness of the
disclosure, saying when the flight school students were being
monitored, Hanjour had not been identified as an Islamic militant or
a terrorism suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities declined to identify the Phoenix memo
suspect, or his whereabouts, some details appear to match information
about Lotfi Raissi, an Algerian pilot and former Phoenix resident
once accused of helping train some of the hijackers. He was released
on bail in England earlier this year when prosecutors failed to
produce evidence linking him to the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the FBI's counter-terrorism unit in Washington said in
Tuesday's hearing that new bureau guidelines require leads like the
Phoenix memo to be brought to the attention of officials at the
section chief level or higher.</TE>
<TE>   The witness was not identified, nor was a supervisor from the
FBI's office in Minneapolis who described how his office's efforts to
investigate Moussaoui hit repeated, unnecessary snags at headquarters
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities detained Moussaoui in August 2001 on an immigration
violation after his efforts to enroll in courses to fly jumbo jets
aroused the suspicion of a local flight instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota FBI agents quickly sensed that Moussaoui might be part
of a broader conspiracy and unsuccessfully sought to convince
officials in Washington to allow them to seek a warrant to search
Moussaoui's computer and other belongings.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a Minnesota agent told officials in Washington to
inform the Secret Service of their suspicions that Moussaoui might be
part of a plot to hijack a plane departing London for New York,
saying such an aircraft "will have the fuel on board to reach D.C."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Minnesota supervisor said he was so desperate to get
the attention of headquarters that he warned one FBI official that
Moussaoui's aim might be to "take control of a plane and fly it into
the World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not going to happen," the official replied, according to
the Minnesota agent. "We don't know he's a terrorist. You don't have
enough to show he is a terrorist. You have a guy interested in this
type of aircraft--that's it."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington official told investigators he does not remember
this exchange, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, Hill said, the Moussaoui investigation was stalled
over a major misunderstanding of intelligence law, with officials in
Washington wrongly insisting that courts wouldn't issue a search
warrant unless Minnesota agents could show that Moussaoui was linked
to Al Qaeda or another foreign power.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Minneapolis agents spent the better part of three
weeks trying to connect Moussaoui to Al Qaeda even as the Sept. 11
attacks were approaching, Hill said. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.)
likened it to a "wild goose chase."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent searches of Moussaoui's belongings uncovered intriguing
pieces of information, including ties to the owner of a Malaysian
condominium where other hijackers participated in an Al Qaeda
meeting; and a notebook bearing an alternate name for Ramzi
Binalshibh, an alleged Al Qaeda operative who wired money to
hijackers and was recently captured by authorities in Pakistan.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Paul E. Patton, who planned to run for the Senate in 2004, said
Tuesday he will leave politics for the "foreseeable future," four
days after admitting to an inappropriate relationship with a woman
suing him for sexual harassment.</LD>

in the political process, including the U.S. Senate race," said
Patton, who is married. "I must now focus on rebuilding my private
life."</LD>
<LD>   Patton, 65, a Democrat, is in his second term and cannot run for
reelection.</LD>
<TE>   He has planned to challenge Republican Sen. Jim Bunning in 2004
and refused Tuesday to rule out that campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Patton also has been raising money and campaigning for legislative
candidates and Democratic Senate candidate Lois Combs Weinberg this

<HD>Moussaoui Linked to 9/11 Hijacker, Prosecutors Say</HD>
<DH>Courts: The contention of a direct tie between conspiracy
suspect and presumed pilot is made in request to play cockpit
recording at his trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors for the first time publicly linked Zacarias
Moussaoui to one of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers on Tuesday, a move some
legal experts said could bolster the government's effort to convict
the French-born militant of conspiring to help commit the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The allegation, contained in court papers, goes beyond the
indirect connections that the government charged in its indictment of
Moussaoui last year.</LD>
<LD>   But the larger question, several legal experts and Moussaoui's
defense team said, was whether such a link can be proven, and what
the government has in its files to back it up.</LD>
<TE>   In a court filing unsealed Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors seeking the
death penalty against Moussaoui, 34, said they can link him to Ziad
Samir Jarrah, the presumed pilot of the hijacked plane that was
headed for the Washington area but crashed in a Pennsylvania field
after passengers challenged the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found a business card "belonging to Jarrah" in the
rubble with a phone number written on back; phone records showed that
Moussaoui had called that number, the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The document was filed in support of the government's argument to
play the cockpit voice recording from the hijacked plane at trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Jarrah's role as a hijacker on [United Airlines] Flight 93 is
important to the government's evidence linking defendant [Moussaoui]
to the conspiracy," the prosecutors wrote in the filing to the court.
"In the end, the [cockpit voice recordings] constitute probative
evidence that directly substantiates the overt acts charged in the
indictment, thus tipping the scale heavily in favor of
admissibility."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials declined to comment on the legal
filing, as did members of Moussaoui's standby legal team, appointed
by the judge in the case to help him as he acts as his own lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   But defense counsel Frank W. Dunham Jr. said that, in general, he
was skeptical of the link's importance, noting that no such link was
mentioned in the lengthy indictment of Moussaoui last year.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not disclosed key details, including who the
phone number was registered to or that person's relationship to
Moussaoui or Jarrah. "This is a telephone contact on the back of a
business card," Dunham said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Plato Cacheris described the link as "tenuous," and
said that Moussaoui and Jarrah having access to the same phone number
doesn't mean the two ever used it to speak to each other. Even if the
number belonged to an Al Qaeda operative that both men knew, that too
would not necessarily prove that the two men had ever met, much less
discussed the conspiracy and agreed to work together on it, said
Cacheris. "I wouldn't be too excited about it, honestly."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Turley, a defense attorney and George Washington
University law professor, agreed that the disclosure may not bolster
the government's case that Moussaoui was meant to be the 20th
hijacker or that he played some other role in the conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a link, and as tenuous as the link may be as a legal
matter, it is likely to be magnified in the minds of a jury," Turley
said. "I don't think it moves them as a legal matter to securing the
death penalty, but it is likely to add to the weight for a
conviction."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they can prove Jarrah was on the plane by
matching his voice with the voice of one of the hijackers caught on
tape, based on the testimony of one of Jarrah's classmates at a
Florida flight training school who says the voices match.</TE>
<TE>   And they said in the filing unsealed Tuesday that the jury needs
to hear the voice recordings, despite the defense team's contention
that they are too graphic and overly prejudicial to Moussaoui's case.
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said earlier this month that she
probably would reject the government's request to play the tapes
unless prosecutors could demonstrate that they held essential
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case that involves vast conspiracies to commit mass
murder through the intended use of weapons of mass destruction,
including hijacked planes," the prosecutors wrote. "These are the
charges that must be proved in this case, and their violent nature
does not make the evidence any less relevant or more unfairly
prejudicial under the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, has denied being a
part of the hijacking conspiracy, and his lawyers have stressed that
he could not have played a role in the attacks because he had already
been in custody for nearly a month on Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was detained after Minnesota flight school officials
became suspicious of him and called the FBI. Moussaoui was detained
on immigration charges while authorities investigated his alleged
comments about wanting to learn how to fly the "big bird" and other
allegedly suspicious activities.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui has publicly acknowledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden,
admitted to being a member of Al Qaeda and called for the destruction
of the U.S. and Jews everywhere. He has insisted on representing
himself in his trial--with the help of court-imposed standby counsel.
It is one of the few cases in which the government has sought the
death penalty for someone charged with conspiring to commit murder,
as opposed to committing murder themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The trial in a federal courtroom just outside Washington is
expected to start Jan. 6.</TE>

<HD>Progress Seen on West Nile Vaccine</HD>
<DH>Health: Scientists expect tests in months, leading to
prevention of virus for elderly in three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Small studies of a possible vaccine against West Nile virus could
begin within months and a vaccine for the people most at risk of
dying from the virus could be available in three years, federal
scientists told Congress on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The experimental vaccine is built on the long-used vaccine against
yellow fever, a cousin of the West Nile virus. Scientists are hopeful
it will prove safe to use, as well as provide protection for the
elderly, who are at highest risk for getting encephalitis if they are
infected with the virus.</LD>
<LD>   West Nile virus first appeared in the United States in 1999 but
caused an epidemic this year. So far, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has counted more than 1,900 infections and 94
deaths.</LD>
<TE>   But only one out of every 150 to 200 people who are infected
actually become seriously ill. Most either have mild flu-like
symptoms or no symptoms at all.</TE>
<TE>   That has actually complicated scientists' ability to tell if West
Nile can be transmitted through the blood supply. A recent infection
in a woman who received blood from a West Nile-infected donor
suggests that can happen, but the risk is believed low. Still, the
Food and Drug Administration is pushing blood banks to develop tests
that would detect the virus in donated blood.</TE>
<TE>   Studies in animals suggest that immunity to other similar viruses,
such as yellow fever and dengue fever, also provides protection
against the virus, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes
of Health. Based on that knowledge, scientists have put genes from
the virus into the structure of the yellow fever vaccine. Meanwhile,
people's best defense is to wear mosquito repellent containing the
chemical DEET and to eliminate all standing water around their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Most mosquitoes transmitting this virus live in the suburban
backyard," said CDC director Dr. Julie Gerberding.</TE>

<HD>Household Income Drops, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Economy: In addition, the poverty rate rose in 2001, Census
Bureau reports. The last time this happened was in the early 1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The income of American households fell last year and the poverty rate
increased for the first time since the early 1990s, the Census Bureau
reported Tuesday, reversals that could pose problems for the Bush
administration and dramatize the fallout of economic recession.</LD>
<LD>   The trends on poverty and income underscored the reality that a
less-forgiving economic climate has replaced the buoyant growth of
the 1990s, at least for now. To many workers, the recession in 2001
meant a loss of jobs or a cut in working hours. Such changes helped
drag down family income and push people into poverty in much of the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very common pattern," said Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of
housing and household economic statistics at the Census Bureau. "It's
just what we tend to see around each recession."</LD>
<TE>   The trends in income and poverty varied widely by region, racial
group and even age.</TE>
<TE>   The national poverty rate rose to 11.7% in 2001 from 11.3% the
previous year, the first increase since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   But among the racial categories, only whites registered an overall
increase in the poverty rate. The South was the only region where the
overall poverty rate went up.</TE>
<TE>   About 32.9 million Americans were counted as poor last year, an
increase of 1.3 million from 2000. Growth in poverty was concentrated
in metropolitan areas and the South.</TE>
<TE>   The poverty threshold for a family of four was $18,104 in 2001, up
from $17,603. For a family of three, the threshold was $14,128.</TE>
<TE>   As poverty increased, a key measure of income declined. Median
household income fell 2.2% to $42,228, a drop of $934, meaning that
half of households had incomes above $42,228 and half below.</TE>
<TE>   Income levels fell for whites, blacks and Asians and stayed steady
for Latinos. Regionally, income levels fell in much of the United
States except in the Northeast, where they stayed flat.</TE>
<TE>   Although the broad patterns fit with past recessions, some were
struck by new evidence that the poor were trailing further behind the
rest of society than in the past. Those classified as poor on average
fell further below the poverty line than any year since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   By some measures, the rich in 2001 remained just about as much
richer than the poor. Yet 2001 was the first year in which the
richest 20% of Americans earned more than half the nation's total
personal income. The share of income going to the poorest Americans
declined.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor did become poorer in 2001," said Robert Greenstein,
executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal think thank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some commentators predicted harder economic times would
continue to aggravate income and poverty trends. As negative
portents, Greenstein cited the unemployment rate, the rising number
of jobless workers who have exhausted their insurance benefits and
actions by a growing number of states to cut back on social services.</TE>
<TE>   "The increase in poverty is likely to be larger in 2002 than the
increase of 1.3 million people that occurred in 2001," Greenstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although economists rarely pin the responsibility for hard times
on an individual president, the public tends to view matters
differently, and some suggested Tuesday that the trends highlighted
by the Census Bureau threatened headaches for the Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the Democrats will make extensive use of these numbers,"
said Robert E. Litan, vice president and director of economic studies
at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. "They'll say that after a
decade of uninterrupted progress, here we see--early into a Bush
administration--a reversal of some of these gains. I think it will be
a big part of the debate."</TE>
<TE>   In perspective, the numbers announced for poverty and income
remained near all-time bests. For example, the household income
figures, even after adjustment for inflation, were higher than all
years before 1999, and the poverty rate was lower than every year of
the 1980s and 1990s. (The poverty rate of 11.3%, recorded in 2000,
was the lowest level since 1974.)</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials sought to highlight the favorable
trend of recent years, rather than the reversals of 2001, as
arguments to pass a new version of welfare reform. The nation's
welfare program is scheduled to expire in a week, and Congress
remains split over such issues as child-care spending, work rules and
benefits for immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The new census data "continue to underscore the need for
strengthening our efforts to help families move from welfare to
work," said Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary for the Administration
of Children and Families.</TE>
<TE>   Among regions, the Census Bureau reported, median household income
levels dropped 3.7% in the Midwest, 2.3% in the West and 1.4% in the
South. The South continued to have the lowest median income levels in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing in the Midwest suffered a sharp blow, as did areas
of California and elsewhere with major high-tech presences.</TE>
<TE>   "The lingering problems of the manufacturing sector have taken a
toll" in the Midwest, said Scott Hoyt, director of consumer economics
at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "The
manufacturing sector went into it first, and except for a few areas
like autos, hasn't come out of it yet."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the West Coast's decline in household income, Hoyt
continued, "There's a reasonably high probability that all the tech
problems" have influenced the census findings.</TE>
<TE>   Among racial and ethnic groups, median household incomes held
steady for Latinos, but fell 1.3% for non-Latino whites, 3.4% for
blacks and 6.4% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts were surprised at the racial disparities in poverty
trends highlighted by the report. The poverty rate increased for
whites--to 9.9% from 9.5%--and non-Latino whites--to 7.9% from 7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The rate held statistically steady for other major groups,
although in some cases at high levels. The poverty rate was 22.7% for
blacks, 21.4% for Latinos and 10.2% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts offered few instant explanations of why the burden of an
increased poverty rate seemed to fall most directly on whites.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to have an overall trend, it's usually driven by
the largest group in the population," said the Census Bureau's
Weinberg, inviting other explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Wendell Primus, director of income security at the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, suggested that the real test of how
blacks and other racial groups fare in recession may not be over,
given the economy's continued weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The child poverty rate of 16.3% was about the same as the year
before, and well below the child poverty rate of 22.7% in 1993.</TE>

<HD>Nev. Governor Faulted on Surgery</HD>
<DH>Politics: Election foe says Guinn's choice of UCLA for
operation shows lack of faith in state's system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARSON CITY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Kenny Guinn's decision to go out of state for prostate surgery
isn't unprecedented, but his general election opponent says it shows
a lack of faith in Nevada's health-care system.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Joe Neal, considered a longshot to beat the Republican
incumbent Nov. 5, said Guinn could have found decent care in state.</LD>
<LD>   "I do have some concerns that he's not able to trust the doctors
here," Neal said. "That only speaks to his lack of trust."</LD>
<TE>   Guinn consulted with both his family physician, Dr. Sara Smith,
and a specialist, Dr. Ranjit Jain, in Las Vegas before opting for
surgery Monday at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Jain and Dr. Ikram Khan of Las Vegas, who had worked closely with
the governor during the height of the medical malpractice crisis,
were in the operating room when Dr. Jean B. deKernion, chairman of
the urology department at UCLA, performed the two-hour operation to
remove the governor's prostate.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. Bob Miller also left the state for prostate surgery,
opting for Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, when he was the
state's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn, 66, who had registered at the UCLA Medical Center under a
different name, was reported awake Tuesday and feeling better. The
operation was described as a success.</TE>
<TE>   "He's out of bed and sitting in a chair," said Khan. "The patient
is doing very well, cracking jokes."</TE>
<TE>   Guinn's wife, Dema, said the governor was walking up and down
hallways at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   While Guinn is out of state, Lt. Gov. Lorraine Hunt is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully there will not be anything traumatic and he will be
back on the job soon," Hunt said, adding that she has been acting
governor before and does not plan any major actions.</TE>

<HD>Girl's Flu Delays Visit by Mother in Beating Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>A woman arrested after she was caught on videotape beating her
4-year-old daughter could not meet with the girl Tuesday because the
child was sick, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Madelyne Gorman Toogood was scheduled to have a 90-minute
supervised meeting with her daughter Martha, who is in foster care.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Gotsch, an attorney for the state Office of Family and
Children, said Toogood would be allowed to see her daughter today if
the girl has recovered from the flu.</LD>
<TE>   The case has drawn nationwide attention because Toogood was
captured by department store security cameras striking the girl in a
sport utility vehicle Sept. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Toogood, 25, has said that she hit her daughter in the head and
back and pulled her hair but that she did not punch her. She has
pleaded not guilty to felony battery of a child, although her
attorney says there is no way to defend the actions captured on the
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Toogood, who also has two young sons, remains free on a $5,000
bond. If convicted, she faces up to three years in prison. She is
seeking to have Martha placed in the care of a relative while she
tries to regain permanent custody.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor examined the girl at Toogood's request in Bay Head, N.J.,
before she turned herself in over the weekend, officials said. They
said the doctor, Jack Haberman, found no medical problems and no
long-term signs of abuse.</TE>

<HD>Pollution Fears Power the Sale of Ohio Hamlet to Energy
Company</HD>
<DH>Environment: An power firm completes deal that will all but
empty village. There are a few holdouts, but most are happy to get
away from nearby plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A power company finalized a deal Tuesday to buy most of an Ohio River
village where many residents say they are happy to get away from what
they say is a polluting coal plant.</LD>
<LD>   The deal will all but empty Cheshire of its 221 residents,
although about a dozen holdouts have refused to sell.</LD>
<LD>   "All along, we've hoped that the ones who wanted to stay would be
allowed to stay, and that's what will happen," Mayor Tom Reese said.
"But the majority of people wanted to sell."</LD>
<TE>   American Electric Power had coexisted with the tiny river hamlet
for nearly 30 years. But a pollution control system at the plant
periodically caused a blue haze of sulfuric acid to fall over
Cheshire; people complained of burning eyes and nostrils and sores on
their lips and tongues.</TE>
<TE>   Residents hired attorneys to either file a lawsuit or broker a
buyout. The company denies that emissions from the Gen. James M.
Gavin Power Plant are harmful, and it says that the emissions are
below federal and state regulations. Under the deal, residents waive
their right to sue for any subsequent health problems.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it agreed to the buyout because it wanted to
address concerns and allow for expansion. Still, about a dozen people
refuse to sell their land and homes.</TE>
<TE>   Beulah "Boots" Hern, 82, said she won't move unless she gets $1
million for her riverfront property. She was offered $242,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because I'm old doesn't mean I'm stupid," Hern said. "I
don't feel that I'm being greedy. I just want what I think is fair."</TE>
<TE>   The few businesses in Cheshire, mostly supported by coal plant
employees, will also remain.</TE>
<TE>   A small number of senior citizens who agreed to sell their homes
will stay until their deaths, rent-free.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says Visa Pileup Cleared</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The State Department said Tuesday it has cleared a backlog of 10,000
visa applications, most from Muslim countries, that were delayed for
months by investigations into possible terrorism connections.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Richard Boucher said that automation and other
improvements in procedures cleared away the pileup, "and we're able
to promise a more efficient system from now on."</LD>
<LD>   Arab governments and American businesses and universities had
complained about the backlog.</LD>
<TE>   Almost 14% of visa applications from Muslims overseas were slowed
down by the security checks.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be immigrants and other visitors from Egypt, Jordan, Sudan,
Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries were scrutinized in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher refused to say whether the department engaged in group
profiling. But he said one reason for the new security checks system
was a judgment by intelligence agencies that "there are people we
have to pay more attention to."</TE>
<TE>   Jean Abinader, managing director of the Arab American Institute,
questioned why the 10,000 applications were released all at once
instead of earlier, when they had been approved.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind every visa application is a student who now has missed
starting the semester on time," Abinader said. "Or they have not been
able to visit their families, or the United States has lost the
opportunity to do business with those who applied for the visas."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher said foreign governments had complained that students who
went home for the summer could not get back to the United States for
the new school year.</TE>

<LD>Down to their last few outs, the Seattle Mariners rallied to keep
their faint playoff hopes alive Tuesday night, beating the Oakland
Athletics, 8-7, on Scott Podsednik's run-scoring single in the eighth
inning at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   A loss would have eliminated the Mariners from postseason
contention. Instead, Podsednik's two-out single capped a four-run
rally in the eighth inning and kept Seattle in the American League
wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   The A's lead the AL West by three games over the Angels. Oakland's
magic number for clinching the division is two.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Zito was poised to pick up his league-leading 23rd victory
before the A's bullpen blew a 7-4 lead. Oakland had been 81-1 when
leading after seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Chicago 2--Nomar Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez each
drove in runs at Chicago and the Red Sox won their fifth in a row to
keep their slim playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   A Red Sox loss or an Angel victory eliminates Boston from the
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Tampa Bay 0--Jason Giambi hit his 39th and 40th
homers, and Mike Mussina (17-10) pitched a two-hitter and struck out
a season-high 12 at New York for his second shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi had a two-run double and Bernie Williams had his
200th hit for the Yankees, who ended a four-game homerless drought,
their longest since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Cleveland 3--Bobby Kielty's sacrifice fly in the
ninth inning at Minneapolis drove in the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis Burks hit his 31st homer for Cleveland, a two-run drive into
the left-field seats that tied the score, 3-3, in the eighth.</TE>

and extended his streak of reaching base to 50 games.</TE>

<LD>No matter how much this year's Angels might enjoy the thrill of
clinching a playoff berth, the thrill may not be as wonderful for
them as it was for the team's play-by-play man last time around. In
1986, as announcer Al Conin broadcast from the celebration that
followed the clinching of the American League West championship, the
phone rang. His wife was in labor. He had to leave for the hospital
immediately, drenched in champagne.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just reeking," Conin said. "The nurses looked at each other
as if to say, 'This poor baby's got a drunk for a father.' "</LD>
<LD>   Little did Conin suspect that his newborn daughter, Alexandra,
would be old enough to get her driver's license the next time the
Angels made the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Conin, the play-by-play man from 1983 to '92, still lives in
Orange County. He helped coach--and son Adam played for--the 1997
South Mission Viejo Little League team that played for the world
championship in Williamsport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   As a youth baseball coach in the era of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa
and "Chicks dig the long ball" ads, Conin said he appreciates this
year's Angels for showing kids that sacrifice bunts, squeeze plays
and stolen bases still win games.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I'm rooting so hard for them this year," he said.
"They play the kind of baseball I love the most."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz lamented that the Angels had given up a future major
leaguer last week, when they sent right-hander Pedro Liriano to the
Milwaukee Brewers as the final player to be named in the July 31
trade for outfielder Alex Ochoa. Ortiz and Liriano are cousins, and
the two Dominicans had talked about some day pitching together in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to stay here and be on the team with me," Ortiz said.
"He's a good pitcher. In every league he's been in, he's pitched
well, just like me. I don't know why they chose him."</TE>
<TE>   Liriano, 21, has a live fastball and could develop into a prospect
in time. He went 10-14 with a 3.60 earned-run average at Class-A
Rancho Cucamonga, with 74 walks and 176 strikeouts in 167 innings.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Ortiz is the probable starter, although he had a cut on
the little finger of his pitching hand Tuesday and could be replaced
by Mickey Callaway if necessary. In his last five starts, Ortiz is
5-0 with a 2.00 ERA. In his career, he is 9-1 against the Rangers.
The Angels had considered giving Aaron Sele a start this weekend--he
has not pitched since Aug. 20 while rehabilitating a partially torn
rotator cuff--but now plan to use Ortiz and Kevin Appier to keep them
sharp for the playoffs.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Roberts Pointing for Weekend Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An MRI test Tuesday revealed a partial tear of an internal rib-cage
muscle on Dave Roberts' right side, but the Dodger leadoff batter's
condition improved so dramatically Monday and Tuesday he now hopes to
return by the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   After suffering the injury in his first at-bat Saturday night in
San Diego, Roberts said his chances of returning during the regular
season "didn't look good," though he held out hope of playing in the
postseason.</LD>
<LD>   But the inflammation in the area shrunk considerably Monday and
Tuesday, and Roberts' range of motion improved. He expects to begin
treadmill exercises and possibly play catch today.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm excited," said Roberts, who is batting .277 and is tied with
Colorado's Juan Pierre and Florida's Luis Castillo for the National
League lead with 45 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely shooting to come back this weekend, because if we
made the playoffs, I think I'd be doing a disservice to the team if I
hadn't played in eight days," he said. "If I keep improving the way I
have the last few days, it's realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger trainer Stan Johnston was more cautious in his assessment,
saying Roberts would probably miss the rest of the regular season.
But the trainer "wouldn't rule out" a return by this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   If doctors can better pinpoint the area of Roberts' injury in the
next day or two, it's possible he could receive a cortisone injection
to further reduce inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pointless to inject into a big area; it's like putting an
eye drop into a bathtub," Roberts said. "But I'm all in favor of
doing anything to get back onto the field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby, still suffering from a blister on the
middle finger of his pitching hand, did not pick up a ball Tuesday,
but Manager Jim Tracy did not rule out the possibility of Ashby
starting Saturday against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Carrara will start tonight against Colorado, Hideo Nomo
will open the Padre series Thursday night, and Omar Daal will pitch
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If Ashby, who has given up 20 runs in 14 1/3 innings of his last
four starts and didn't make it out of the third inning of Friday
night's 8-4 loss to San Diego, does not start Saturday, right-hander
Kevin Beirne will.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy considered bringing Odalis Perez back Saturday on three
days' rest, but Perez entered Tuesday night's game having already
thrown a career-high 214 1/3 innings, "and that makes it risky
business to consider using him on short rest," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez also had to be shut down for nine days in late July because
of fatigue.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Olausson to Help Fill Void</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest question from the Mighty Ducks' wheeling-and-dealing
summer is on defense, where Oleg Tverdovsky's offensive skills will
be missed.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks' traded Tverdovsky to New Jersey in a six-player deal
that brought forward Petr Sykora, among others, to Anaheim. While it
is true that Tverdovsky was as unhappy being with the Ducks as Duck
officials were unhappy with him, his abilities gave the team an
offensive threat at the blue line.</LD>
<LD>   Filling that void may fall to many, mostly Fredrik Olausson, who
signed as a free agent over the summer. He played 47 games with
Detroit last season.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a Brian Leetch-type guy back there," General
Manager Bryan Murray said. "Freddy has to do a lot of that for us. We
need guys to move the puck and we're hoping to do that with a lot of
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Niclas Havelid and Keith Carney top that list.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock probably will use one forward at the blue line
on the power play, with Sykora being the top choice. Olausson also
will figure prominently on the top power-play unit.</TE>
<TE>   But it is in five-on-five situations where the Ducks need
defensemen who can move the puck and get the offensive rush started,
the way Tverdovsky did.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never replace a great player," Babcock said. "We're going
to do things a little differently. The thing we have to do is make
sure our power play isn't last again. We have to get a fourth guy
joining the rush."</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky was inconsistent last season, finishing with six goals
and 32 points, but he had averaged 52 points the previous two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought in Sykora and that gives us scoring potential from the
blue line on the power play," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Each day, Duck officials are more impressed with forward Andy
McDonald. That shows how much improvement he made during the
off-season, as Murray was already enamored with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just been outstanding," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald had three goals in two games last weekend. A center most
of his career, McDonald has made a smooth transition to the left
wing. Although after McDonald scored two goals at center against the
Kings on Sunday, Babcock said, "I may have to rethink this."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald added 10 pounds, but he also picked up a load of
confidence playing for Canada in the World Championships. He was
named the top forward on the Canadian team.</TE>
<TE>   "That gave me an opportunity to be out there with a lot of good
players," said McDonald, who had seven goals and 28 points in 53
games last season. "That made me realize even more that I can play
here."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's play may cause the Ducks to send Stanislav Chistov to
minor-league Cincinnati, at least to start the season. Chistov, the
fifth player drafted in 2001, is more suited to play on the top two
lines. However, those spots seemed to be filled by Sykora, Paul
Kariya, Adam Oates, Mike Leclerc, Steve Rucchin and, now, McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' improved depth is not only visible in the players that
made the cut Monday, but also by the ones who were shipped out.</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Rob Valicevic and defenseman Todd Reirden, who have 352
NHL games between them, were assigned to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, we left camp and the top two call-ups we had were
[forward] Jonas Ronnqvist and [defenseman] Drew Bannister," Murray
said. "That won't be the case this season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie defenseman Josh DeWolf missed a second day of practice
because of a strained muscle in his rib cage.</TE>

<LD>There are questions to be answered in the $50,000 Black Swan Stakes
today, because only two of the fillies in the lineup have run the
distance, a mile and a sixteenth. This trip would involve only two
turns on a mile track, but at Fairplex they'll be going around three
bends.</LD>
<LD>   Amber Hills is one of those trying the distance for the first
time. She normally finishes her races faster than she starts them and
will get the nod under Martin Pedroza, who is battling Tyler Baze for
the riding championship. Pedroza has been aboard Amber Hills in only
one of her four starts, but that was the day she broke her maiden at
Hollywood Park in solid fashion.</LD>
<LD>   The Ed Moger trainee had to settle for a fifth and a second in her
ensuing two appearances at Del Mar, but she ran both of those in
stakes company. If she can relax early for Pedroza and find a cozy
tracking position, she can get the job done at what figures to be a
square price.</LD>
<TE>   My Honey Bunny is one of four with experience over this tricky
course. She was beaten by a nose in the Bustles and Bows at 6 1/2
furlongs. Jockey Chance Rollins will try to take them gate to wire
and the key to his horse's success will be the amount of pressure she
has to take in the early stages. Speed is always a valuable commodity
here, and she has already shown she knows how to bank around these
tight turns.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Sanger Red; 2. Kipper Edge; 3. Warn Me Again; 4.
Brazil Nut; 5. Royal For Sure; 6. Tick On; 7. Ultimate Prize; 8.
Lethal Lover; 9. Bruneau Dunes; 10. Runninwithscissors; 11. Amber
Hills; 12. Insane Reality; 13. Occupied.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame, BCS Differ on Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notre Dame's 4-0 start has been one of the season's biggest
surprises. It would be a real shock to the Fighting Irish faithful to
learn their team is 3-0.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the record as far as the Bowl Championship Series
is concerned because under its guidelines, teams must win at least
nine "nonexempt" games to be BCS eligible.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame opened the season Oct. 31 with a victory over Maryland
in the Kickoff Classic, which is normally considered an "exempt"
game. But Notre Dame contends it should not be considered an exempt
game because it was played the same weekend most teams started the
season--not a week ahead like most years.</LD>
<TE>   "Our understanding was it didn't qualify as an exempt game because
it was moved off that earlier weekend," Associate Athletic Director
John Heisler said.</TE>
<TE>   The game was originally scheduled for Aug. 24, but was moved
because it conflicted with freshman orientation at Notre Dame. So by
the time the Kickoff Classic kicked off, most teams already had begun
their seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the BCS considers the game to be exempt. If Notre Dame
wanted to appeal that, they would have to go before the commissioners
of the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Heisler said the reason games like the Kickoff Classic are usually
exempt is because the BCS doesn't want certain teams to have an
advantage over others. Because all teams can play 12 games this
season, Notre Dame has no such advantage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame hasn't decided whether it will appeal to the BCS. Asked
if the Irish would consider adding another game to make up for it,
Heisler said the school wasn't considering such a move at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see where we go with it," he said. "We'll get it addressed
here pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting quarterback Jason Gesser and backup Matt Kegel are
questionable for 16th-ranked Washington State's Pacific 10 Conference
opener at California and the Cougars may have to start freshman Chris
Hurd.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser is recovering from a dislocated rib on his right side and
Kegel has a bruised left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Hurd, a freshman from Antioch, Calif., completed five of six
passes for 44 yards in Saturday's victory over Montana State.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bill Drake called Gesser's availability "questionable at
best," but Coach Mike Price called Gesser "questionable or probable"
and said Gesser and Kegel would likely play.</TE>
<TE>   If Gesser is able to play, he will wear a protective flak jacket
like he did last season after suffering a left side rib injury
against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman tailback Maurice Clarett should be back in No. 6 Ohio
State's lineup Saturday for its Big Ten opener against Indiana.
Clarett had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last week and
missed the Buckeyes' victory against Cincinnati.... Michigan State
receiver Charles Rogers, who bruised his ribs in the Spartans' loss
to Notre Dame, said he expects to play Saturday against Northwestern.
Rogers has caught a touchdown pass in 12 consecutive games, tying an
NCAA record, and has eight consecutive games of 100 or more receiving
yards.... Mississippi State running back Dontae Walker has a sprained
shoulder and is doubtful for Saturday's game at No. 22 Louisiana
State. Fred Reid would start if Walker can't play.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa running back Fred Russell is expected to play against No. 12
Penn State after sitting out last week's victory against Utah State
because of a bruised left shoulder.... Tailback Roger Robinson, Utah
State's leading rusher, has left the team, according to Coach Mick
Dennehy. The sophomore from Apple Valley, Calif., also led the Aggies
in punt return average, kickoff return average and all-purpose
yardage.... Air Force will be without inside linebacker Matt McCraney
on Saturday against Utah. He injured his right knee in the victory
against California.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio Express-News reported that Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C.
Slocum has stripped play-calling duties from offensive coordinator
Dino Babers and given them to receivers coach Kevin Sumlin. The
Aggies finished No. 106 out of 117 teams last season in offense and
were ranked 106 this week.... Hawaii Coach June Jones said that
quarterback Jason Whieldon, who attended Orange Lutheran High and
Saddleback College, has returned to the program. Whieldon dropped out
of school and left the team earlier this month because of family
problems. Whieldon had been the backup to starter Timmy Chang.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Learns From Past</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A. adopts grounded approach to playoffs, hoping
to avoid meltdown suffered by record-setting '98 team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a familiar sense of accomplishment enveloping the Galaxy's
Pasadena compound these days, an air of confidence the team has not
exuded since its record-setting season of 1998.</LD>
<LD>   But whereas that Galaxy team strutted into the postseason as the
winningest team in Major League Soccer, then limped out in the second
round of the playoffs, this year's club, which also finished with the
league's best record, has learned about wearing its bravado on its
sleeve.</LD>
<LD>   "That team swaggered a bit more, it was a little more cocky," said
Galaxy captain Cobi Jones, one of five members of the '98 Galaxy
squad still with the team, along with goalkeepers Kevin Hartman and
Matt Reis, midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos and defender Ezra
Hendrickson.</LD>
<TE>   "This team is very confident but it's a quiet confidence. We're
just doing our thing. We still know we're a decent team but we still
have a lot to prove and, as far as I'm concerned--and I think a lot
of the players are concerned--the team to beat right now is still San
Jose."</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean the top-seeded and Western Conference
champion Galaxy is looking past the Kansas City Wizards, tonight's
opponent in a first-to-five-points first-round playoff series. That
lesson was learned four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we had some quality players then, it was an
overconfidence going into the playoffs," said Jones, who finished
second in the league scoring race in 1998 with 51 points on 19 goals
and 13 assists. "We didn't do the right things. We didn't prepare for
the games. And it wasn't a team that won the close ones because we
always blew out teams and when it came to close games, it was very
difficult for us.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot more veterans on this team, a lot more maturity
than the team in '98."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 Galaxy, under then-coach Octavio Zambrano, was an
offensive machine that steamrollered its opposition during the
32-game schedule, going 24-8 with 68 points.</TE>
<TE>   Besides setting still-standing league records in the expansion
year for goals scored, 85, and goals per game, 2.66, the Galaxy also
allowed the fewest goals, 44.</TE>
<TE>   But after destroying the Dallas Burn by a cumulative 9-3 in a
two-game sweep in the first round of the playoffs, the swaggering
Galaxy was left a staggering mess in the Western Conference finals by
the first-year Chicago Fire.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago swept the Galaxy in two games, 1-0 and 2-1 in a shootout.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a different style of soccer then," said Hartman, whose
1.38 goals-against average that season was second in the league.
"Octavio wanted to play a bit of wide-open soccer, try to score as
many goals as we possibly could, and I think in the playoffs that
kind of hurt us because people bunker in and just try to get the
result.</TE>
<TE>   "If you counter on a team that's just flying forward, it's going
to be difficult [on the team that's flying forward]. I think our
philosophy's kind of changed and I think we [now] believe that
defense is going to win us games."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy, many Galaxy players believe, showed up with the
dismissal of Zambrano and the arrival of former UCLA coach Sigi
Schmid six games into the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   But although Schmid has guided the Galaxy to the 2000 Champions
Cup and the 2001 U.S. Open Cup championships, the MLS Cup title has
remained elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid was not around in 1998 but acknowledged that his team has
taken on a different demeanor this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're quieter than we've been in the past," he said. "In the
past, we've talked more about [winning the title]. The guys haven't
spent a great deal of time talking about it but you also know that
it's there and at the forefront of their minds. They're confident and
they know they're going to do well.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's more a situation of where we've talked about it
before and I think everybody's got the attitude now where we're not
going to talk about it, we're just going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   So, is that a sign of maturity from a team that fell flat on its
face four years ago?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," Schmid said, "or a different approach."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson said this season's team is keeping itself grounded by
considering itself the underdog, even though it has won its fifth
divisional title at 16-9-3, led MLS in fewest goals allowed, 33, and
was third in goals scored, 44, in the 28-game season.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't compare this team to the '98 team because the '98 team
didn't really accomplish anything," he said. "I mean, we broke some
records in the regular season but in this league, unless you do well
in the playoffs and make it to the finals, it's not really a
successful year. Especially for the Galaxy because every year we're
in competition for the MLS Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're coming in with something to prove, still, and we want to
get our fans a trophy and we've got to start with Kansas City."</TE>

<LD>The L.A. Marymount girls' volleyball team faced two late deficits
against Santa Ana Mater Dei, but rallied to win the Dave Mohs
tournament championship Monday night at Huntington Beach Edison High,
15-13, 16-14.</LD>
<LD>   Marymount, a well-tested team that is No. 2 in The Times'
rankings, came back from a 12-10 deficit in the first game and a 14-5
deficit in the second.</LD>
<LD>   "They like to get me up and screaming," Coach Cari Klein said.
"When they need to win, they do."</LD>
<TE>   Sixth-ranked Mater Dei did not start any seniors, but still had a
strong run in the three-day tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of crumbled a bit at the end," Coach Craig Pazanti said.
"But [it was] definitely a positive for the weekend."</TE>

<TE>   Carson junior quarterback Beau Davis is not expected to play in
the Colts' home game Friday against Granada Hills Kennedy because of
a pinched nerve.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Bo Napoleon, who played in the second half of the Colts'
39-0 loss to No. 8 Woodland Hills Taft last Friday, will get the
start. Davis was injured in the third quarter, when a Taft defender
hit him hard on his left side.</TE>
<TE>   "Beau hasn't been cleared yet," Coach John Aguirre said, "but
we're expecting that he'll get cleared today for light practice."</TE>
<TE>   Davis completed seven of 15 passes for 138 yards with one pass
intercepted against Taft, and Napoleon was five for 15 for 37 yards.</TE>

<HD>Banning Staying on Course With Veer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The veer option is alive and well at Wilmington Banning High, which
has essentially run it for three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Making it go this season are running backs A.J. Tuitele and
Patrick Perry, who have helped the Pilots to a 2-0 start heading into
a nonleague matchup Friday against No. 9 Manhattan Beach Mira Costa.</LD>
<LD>   Tuitele had 131 yards in a 48-8 victory over Locke. Perry, who
missed the opener with flu, ran for 182 yards in 12 carries and
Tuitele added 132 on the ground in a 28-7 victory over North
Hollywood last week.</LD>
<TE>   Against North Hollywood, Banning's running game was so dominant
that quarterback Damian Satete attempted only six passes, completing
one for 20 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a passing game," Tuitele insisted. "But if we don't
need to throw the ball, we won't. This is Banning. You run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Perry said he and Tuitele make it difficult for defenders to focus
their containment. If the defense totally commits to the option
pitch, Perry said, Satete is just as likely to keep the ball and take
off.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got great confidence in each other," Perry said of
Tuitele. "I know he's working just as hard as I am. When he's doing
well, it motivates me to do just as well."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Ed Lalau said the two players give his team an edge--it's
the Pilots' first 2-0 start since 1991--but he is just as quick to
credit his offensive line: Tusi Bird, Dominic Satete, Roberto
Gonzalez, George Garcia, Tony Mendoza and tight end Jose Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been blessed to have great backs and great linemen over the
years," Lalau said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuitele, a standout free safety who has committed to Oregon, said
this week's regionally televised game against Mira Costa and coming
games against Santa Fe Springs St. Paul and Loyola will give the
Pilots a true sense of how good they can be.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't make this game any bigger than it already is," he said.
"We all know Mira Costa is no joke. From here on out, it's just a
question of how bad do we want it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Gate began the season with the possibility of playing all
its games away from home because its stadium was undergoing a
retrofitting project to meet earthquake codes.</TE>
<TE>   First-year Coach Ed Cantu tried to prepare his team over the
summer by having shirts made that read "Road Warriors."</TE>
<TE>   Contract negotiations with developers delayed completion of the
project until December, at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rams learned last week they will play a regular home
schedule beginning Friday against Locke, thanks to former South Gate
mayor Henry Gonzalez, who helped convince the city to donate portable
bleachers for the school's use.</TE>
<TE>   The bleachers will be set up on the dirt track behind the Rams'
side of the field as well as behind the end zones.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge for the kids," said Cantu, a former defensive
coordinator at Bell. "They're very enthusiastic about the game. I
certainly hope that it can inspire us more than the last two games."</TE>
<TE>   South Gate is 0-2 but can at least look forward to a true
homecoming game next month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Dickson took a circuitous route back to Van Nuys Grant for
his junior season. His coach, Bill Foster, couldn't be happier.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson has rushed for 381 yards in victories over Manual Arts and
San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   Foster believes his talented running back is capable of big
things.</TE>
<TE>   "We watch this guy work out every day at practice and he's as good
as they come," Foster said. "No question, we'd like to see him run
for 2,000 yards."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, Dickson moved in with relatives in Arizona, but
returned to the area a short time later. He enrolled at Lake Balboa
Birmingham in May but attended summer school at Grant.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, the 5-foot-11, 185-pound Dickson ran for 1,386
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'd have been OK without him," Foster said. "But a kid
with that kind of talent can make you a pretty good team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne's first-year Coach Manuel Douglas isn't
discouraged by his team's 0-2 start, particularly because it has one
of the toughest nonleague schedules in the section.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos have been defeated by Venice, which figures to contend
for the Western League title, and by Loyola, No. 2 in The Times'
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Mistake-filled first halves proved costly, because Narbonne
outscored both opponents after intermission.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Narbonne plays host to No. 1 Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to be the best 0-2 team around," Douglas said. "At
least we'll be battle-tested when league starts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Mira Costa-Banning, another interesting
intersectional matchup this week is Dorsey playing No. 7 Santa
Margarita at Saddleback College.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons can make a major statement for the section with an
impressive showing Friday night. Don't expect, however, to see Santa
Margarita playing at Dorsey next season; the arrangement is for only
one game.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Paul Knox said he will no longer schedule top Southern
Section teams if the deal is not reciprocal.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't take on another team without a home-and-home
[arrangement] from here on out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (2-0); 2. Fremont (2-0); 3. Dorsey (2-0); 4.
Birmingham (1-1); 5. Banning (2-0); 6. Carson (1-1); 7. Crenshaw
(1-1); 8. Venice (2-0); 9. Sylmar (1-1); 10. Franklin (2-0).</TE>

<HD>Friends to the End</HD>
<DH>Pain hasn't stopped for the families of Mike Darr and Duane
Johnson, who were close before fatal crash</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Johnson straps on thick arm pads, sets his jaw and orders UCLA
defensive linemen to charge at him, one after another. The assistant
coach makes like an offensive tackle, thrusting his forearm into the
face of each onrushing player.</LD>
<LD>   It's called the pass-rush drill, Johnson's favorite time of day.</LD>
<LD>   For a few blessed minutes, he can forget.</LD>
<TE>   Practice ends and he retreats to his office, plops in the chair
and stares at the photos of his son Duane taped to the computer.
Before calling a recruit or studying game film, Johnson, 47, quietly
sheds a tear.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy miles away at Norco High, Mike Darr Sr. stands in a
bullpen, giving a young pitcher his undivided attention. The
assistant coach cherishes baseball practice.</TE>
<TE>   For a few blessed hours, he can remember.</TE>
<TE>   Darr, 46, cannot bring himself to return to work at the grocery
warehouse that for so long enabled him to provide for his family
while leaving enough time to coach his sons. He whiles away the
morning hours in a living room filled with photos, clippings and
baseball cards of his son Mike wearing a San Diego Padre uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Finally it is time to leave for the diamond, the place he can feel
Mike's presence and the bond they shared.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Johnsons and Darrs, families linked through two decades of
good times and one night of unspeakable horror, are agonizing proof
that children aren't supposed to go before their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Denial, depression and rivers of tears resulted from the deaths of
inseparable lifelong friends Mike Darr, 25, and Duane Johnson, 23, in
an auto accident Feb. 15 in Peoria, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Their mothers still wait for them to walk through the door. Their
fathers see glimpses of them in every player they coach. Their
brothers, sisters and friends struggle to make sense of a tragedy
that tore Mike from his wife and two young sons, and Duane from the
cocoon of a loving family.</TE>
<TE>   "The Darrs and Johnsons were so into their sons and active in
their pursuits," said Darrin Chiaverini, an Atlanta Falcon receiver
who grew up in Corona with both dead men.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents were always on hand. It's a big void in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Mike and Duane had spent the day moving Mike's belongings into an
apartment near the Padres' spring training site. They worked out and
went out for a late dinner and drinks with Padre pitcher Ben Howard.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back to the apartment, Mike's sports utility vehicle
drifted into the dirt center median of the freeway. He overcorrected
and the car rolled across three lanes and crashed through a fence.
Mike and Duane, not wearing seat belts, were ejected and killed.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, in the back seat wearing a seat belt, suffered only a
bruised knee and minor facial cuts. Mike's blood-alcohol level was
0.11, more than the Arizona legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy sent shockwaves from San Diego to Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Mike was a rising star, popular in the clubhouse, an opening day
starter for the Padres in 2001. He was Corona through and through,
having married his high school sweetheart, Natalie, then settling
down to raise a family a cutoff throw from where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Duane was a college football player and former Philadelphia
Phillie minor leaguer, an ebullient brother and son whose radiant
smile lit up a room. He was Mike's constant companion, traveling to
Padre games on airline passes from his mother, Deborah, an America
West employee.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael had charisma, you couldn't help but look up to him, and
Duane didn't have a mean bone in his body," said Chiaverini, who
along with his twin, Ryan, spent countless hours at the Darrs and
Johnsons after their own parents divorced.</TE>
<TE>   "Duane was the fastest kid I've ever seen, faster than the guys in
the NFL, a great athlete in his own right. But he was always the
first to tell Michael or I how well we did."</TE>
<TE>   The families were neighbors, the dads coached the kids and the
moms filled the homes with love. Mike had a younger brother and
sister. Duane was the third of four children.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes there would be six teenage boys piled in a car--Mike and
Ryan Darr, Donald Jr. and Duane Johnson, and the Chiaverinis. They
were the best athletes, popular with girls, rollicking through what
seemed a never-ending California summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I started coaching those boys when they were young," Mike Darr
Sr. said. "All the kids played for me. Watching them grow up was what
we did. It's what the Johnsons did too. It's what we all did
together."</TE>
<TE>   From years of coaching, Mike Sr. and Don knew teens better than
most dads. If they didn't keep the group in line, nobody would.</TE>
<TE>   When the boys hung out at the Johnsons, they trod lightly around
Don, an even-handed disciplinarian they nicknamed Pinky because his
face would color when he got angry. Don looks menacing with his
shaved head and lineman's build, yet UCLA senior Sean Phillips calls
him "an armored car. He's hard on the outside and all the good stuff
is on the inside."</TE>
<TE>   Darrin Chiaverini said, "He was strict with his kids, making sure
they did the right things, and he was the same way with the Darrs and
with me and my brother. I always thought of him as a father figure.
And Deborah, she was like a mom to us. She holds that family
together."</TE>
<TE>   When the boys hung out at the Darrs, they kept an eye on Mike
Sr.'s baseball cap. They'd learned from years of sharing the same
dugout that if it came off, he was about to blow his stack.</TE>
<TE>   "Our house was a gathering place and Duane was a fixture," Mike
Sr. said. "When those boys were all together, they weren't much
trouble at all."</TE>
<TE>   Mike and Duane felt as though they had two sets of parents, two
households they could call home. The families were so close they
might as well have been under one roof. Often they were.</TE>
<TE>   Don and Deborah Johnson took Mike into their home when he had
serious drug problems in high school. Don would pick up Natalie, then
Mike's girlfriend, and attend counseling sessions with him.</TE>
<TE>   By the spring of Mike's senior year at Corona High, major league
scouts were buzzing around the baseball field, and he was clean.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Johnsons] picked me up from school, they really kept after
me," Mike told a reporter at the time. "If it wasn't for them keeping
me in line, I'd still be on drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Said Debbie Darr, Mike's mother: "The Johnsons were a godsend to
me and my family."</TE>
<TE>   That also was when Duane and Mike cemented their friendship. Duane
was the same age as Ryan Darr, and Mike was the same age as Donald
Johnson Jr. But it was Duane who shared his bedroom with Mike and
held his lunch money so it wouldn't be spent on marijuana or speed.</TE>
<TE>   Duane didn't mind--he owed the Darrs his life. Mike's parents had
rushed him to the hospital from an Angel game after he'd had a
near-fatal asthma attack when he was 11.</TE>
<TE>   Don and Deborah were in Camarillo, watching their oldest child,
Denise, race against Marion Jones in a track meet. Debbie Darr rode
in the ambulance holding Duane's hand.</TE>
<TE>   "The Darrs cared for him just like he was their son," Don said.</TE>
<TE>   The Johnson kids lived with the Darrs for several months when Don
landed his first Division I coaching position at Nevada in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday night Corona football games, where Mike was
quarterback and Duane was a running back, the Darrs and Johnsons
would pile in a car and drive all night to Reno to watch Don's team
play on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It was like that with the Darrs and the Johnsons. They were
partners in life, and, ultimately, in tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Johnsons' phone rang on Feb. 15 at 5 a.m. and a friend
informed them that Mike had died in an accident hours earlier. Don
and Deborah reacted as if they'd lost their own son.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, they learned they had.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned the TV on and there was a picture of the accident scene
with the car turned over," Don said. "They said there were two other
passengers in the car, one a fatality. We were torn up about Michael,
but as far as Duane went, the panic button didn't set in quite at
that moment."</TE>
<TE>   Duane had been living with Denise, 27, in Irvine because he was
playing football at Fullerton College. Don called his daughter and
she said Duane had gone to help Mike move into his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Don and Deborah jumped in their car and headed from their home in
Marina del Rey to Irvine. Don's cell phone rang. It was the Arizona
Department of Public Safety, informing them Duane was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "We drove to Irvine and Denise must have just found out because
she had passed out right in front of the house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA coaches and their wives rushed to the Johnsons' side. Cards
poured in.</TE>
<TE>   "It proved that our football team is a family," Don said. "Some of
the cards and things the players wrote floored me."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Padres handled funeral arrangements for Mike.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no better organization in baseball," Mike Sr. said. "We
couldn't have asked for any better. They came in and comforted
Natalie and the kids, they took care of everything."</TE>
<TE>   Almost. Duane, constantly at Mike's side in life, was pulled away
in death.</TE>
<TE>   Duane's body was not the one the Padres transported to Los Angeles
the next day. In fact, his father was unable to get his son's remains
out of Arizona for 72 hours because state offices were closed for
President's Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Duane's funeral was not the one paid for by the Padres, not the
one attended by two busloads of major league ballplayers, not the one
covered by six television stations. His life was not the one saluted
in newspaper columns.</TE>
<TE>   "The Padres should have shipped Duane's body back and the funerals
should have been held together," Darrin Chiaverini said. "They didn't
know Mike and Duane were as close as they were."</TE>
<TE>   The Padres never sent condolences to the Johnsons. No flowers. No
card.</TE>
<TE>   Don suspects that team officials, fearing litigation, instructed
the Darrs to avoid talking to the Johnsons. However, a Padre
spokesman said the team did not provide legal counsel to the Darrs.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres forbade Howard, the survivor, from talking about the
accident. This continues to bother Don, who simply wants to know as
much about his son's death as possible. Did something on the car
malfunction? Was there horseplay? Did Mike fall asleep at the wheel?</TE>
<TE>   Don wrote a scathing letter to the Padres, but he hasn't put it in
the mailbox. He said he has no plans to sue.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit there at the funeral and see Michael's wife and two young
kids, and realize they weren't responsible for what took place," he
said. "We haven't had any legal recourse, and if there were, we
wouldn't take any."</TE>
<TE>   "You tell them not to drink and drive. You tell them not to get in
the car with someone who was drinking. There is no blame to throw.
Two young men are deceased. And money can't bring them back. Money
can't satisfy the pain."</TE>

<TE>   Debbie Darr has a picture of Mike next to her bed. Deborah Johnson
can't yet bring herself to pull out photos of Duane.</TE>
<TE>   Both families turned to their church for answers that still don't
come easily.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the dads get to their deceased sons is the playing
field. Coaching is therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing Deborah needed his comfort, Don contemplated quitting.
Eventually, he realized that life goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a wife, a mother who lost a child, and I didn't want to go
back," he said. "Then other coaches' wives came to the house, and
[UCLA players] would call. That's when we realized you have to still
live your life.</TE>
<TE>   "Duane loved football and I asked myself, 'How would he feel about
it?' I decided he would want us to get our lives back on track and at
least pretend we were normal people again."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin players have developed a more personal view of their
demanding coach with the gruff exterior and soulful eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "He holds it in tight, he has to be the stone of his family,"
Phillips said. "But I've seen him walk over to the stands during
practice to sit and cry. His son played football and every time he
comes on the field or turns on a tape, he is reminded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taught us to live life to the fullest. You never know when
you'll be called. Love your family and let them know about it."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sr. was dealt another blow this summer when the best pitcher
he'd ever coached at Norco, Darryl Kile of the St. Louis Cardinals,
died at 33 of a heart attack. The Darrs had moved to Belmont Shore
but returned to Corona to be near Natalie and their grandchildren,
Michael, 7, and Matthew, 3.</TE>
<TE>   After having not coached the last several years, so he would have
time to watch his son's big league games, Mike Sr. needs to feel a
pitcher's mound under his feet and hear kids chattering around the
infield.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my way out; get out on the baseball field, forget all the
stress and worries," he said. "I don't compare my son with anybody.
He was his own individual. But I can recognize talent and that's what
I'm going to do now.</TE>
<TE>   "When the high school season ends, I'll take my grandsons and
start all over again. Michael was in T-ball this year and we went to
every game. I take him to the batting cages. You live through your
grandkids now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don and Deborah, Mike Sr. and Debbie, they all want the same
thing, for their families to join again, to dare to laugh and cry and
bring a semblance of closure to the most horrendous year of their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through Mother's Day and Father's Day, and we still have
Thanksgiving and Christmas to get through," Don said. "We'll do the
best we can.</TE>
<TE>   "But to really get through the grieving process, we need the
families reunited again, the Darrs, the Johnsons, the Chiaverinis.
That's the way Duane would have wanted it."</TE>
<TE>   The Johnsons' anger at the Padres is awkward for Mike Sr. and
Debbie. But Don visited the Darrs recently and his daughter, Denise,
took her children to visit Natalie's children. The Darrs' daughter,
Angi, and the Johnsons' youngest daughter, Leanna, are close.</TE>
<TE>   "Don and Deborah are the best friends we've ever had," Mike Sr.
said. "We aren't going to lose that relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The heartache will never disappear, but perhaps by leaning on one
another, these two families linked by friendship and fate can make it
through. Their common ground begins on a pastoral hill overlooking
Corona, where the gravesites of Mike and Duane are side by side.</TE>

<HD>Kelly Is Hoping Checks Pay Off in Roster Spot</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Great things were expected from center Steve Kelly when the Edmonton
Oilers selected him sixth overall in the 1995 draft. At 6 feet 2 and
200 pounds, Kelly figured to fit right into the physical NHL. But
after bouncing around for six seasons, and having played only 129
games for five teams, Kelly is fighting to keep his career alive.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, 25, has been unable to shake an underachiever tag ever
since Edmonton gave up and traded him to Tampa Bay after he had
played only 27 games in an Oiler uniform. Now with the Kings, Kelly
is determined to show Coach Andy Murray and his staff that he's a
better, more mature player than he was six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to let them know that I can play here and that I want
to be a full-time contributor in whatever way they see fit," said
Kelly, who had one point in eight games with the Kings last season.
"The big knock on me in the past has been consistency. I've proven
that I can play in the league, but I guess I haven't been getting it
done on a nightly basis. Some nights I've been there, but there have
been other nights when I didn't play up to my potential, for whatever
reason."</LD>
<TE>   With Ian Laperriere still sidelined because of injury, Kelly has
been working hard, hoping to gain a spot as a checking forward.</TE>
<TE>   He got off to a good start when he scored the only goal in the
Kings' 1-0 exhibition game victory over San Jose last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that I'm ready to be a full-time player in the league," he
said. Last season--he started it with abdominal surgery on Sept.
18--Kelly had 31 points in 49 games for Manchester of the American
Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a little frustrating at times, but I feel great about
my opportunity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will play exhibition games tonight at Colorado and
Thursday night against Phoenix at Staples Center.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 9 (Game 2 only).</TE>
<TE>   Radio:  KDIS (710), KTNQ (1020, Spanish).</TE>

Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, 5 PDT; Game 3 (if
necessary) Oct. 2 at Rose Bowl, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Update: The Galaxy and Wizards are starting the playoffs on
different notes, the Galaxy having won its last four games, the
Wizards only one of their last seven. Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz, who
scored a league-high 24 goals, has scored twice against Kansas City.
Wizard midfielder Preki, who led Kansas City with 24 points (seven
goals and 10 assists), had three goals and two assists against the
Galaxy. Although the Wizards have scored more than one goal in only
10 games this season, they are 8-0-2 in those games. Galaxy
midfielders Peter Vagenas (strained right hamstring) and Sasha
Victorine (neck strain) both practiced with the team Tuesday morning.
The Galaxy outscored the Wizards, 7-6, on aggregate goals this
season.</TE>

<TE>   Playoff series: Game 1 Thursday at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro,
Mass.; Game 2 Sunday at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville, Ill.; Game 3
(if necessary) Oct. 2 at Gillette Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Update: New England finished the season with a 5-0-1 kick,
stealing the Eastern Conference crown and accompanying No. 2 seed.
Chicago, which had lost four in a row, needed to defeat Columbus in
the season finale to qualify for the playoffs. MLS scoring champ and
first-year New England forward Taylor Twellman (52 points on 23 goals
and six assists) helped the Revolution become the league's
highest-scoring team with 49 goals. But New England's back line left
much to be desired, giving up the same number of goals. Chicago
forward Ante Razov leads the Fire in scoring with 36 points (14
goals, eight assists). The Revolution, a charter member of MLS, is
only 1-4-0 in the playoffs. The Fire outscored the Revolution, 8-5,
on aggregate goals this season.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Chicago</TE>

<TE>   NO. 3 SAN JOSE</TE>
<TE>   VS. NO. 6 COLUMBUS</TE>
<TE>   Earthquakes (14-11-3, 45 points), Crew (11-12-5, 38 points)</TE>
<TE>   Season series: Tied, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff series: Game 1 today at Spartan Stadium in San Jose; Game
2 Saturday at Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio; Game 3 (if necessary)
Oct. 2 at Spartan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Update: Had both teams won their season finales, the Earthquakes
and Crew would have won conference titles and earned the top two
seeds. Instead, they are coming off crushing defeats and face each
other in what should be the most entertaining first-round series. The
defending champion Earthquakes are not lacking in star power with
World Cup hero Landon Donovan, Jeff Agoos and leading scorer Ariel
Graziani (33 points on 14 goals and five assists). The Crew,
meanwhile, boasts Jeff Cunningham (37 points on 16 goals and five
assists), who had four goals and two assists against San Jose, which
lost only once at home this season, 1-0, to the Galaxy on Saturday.
The Earthquakes have scored a league-high 33 goals at home. The Crew
outscored San Jose, 9-8, on aggregate goals.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: San Jose.</TE>

<TE>   NO. 4 DALLAS</TE>

<TE>   Burn (12-9-7, 43 points), Rapids (13-11-4, 43 points)</TE>
<TE>   Season series: Burn, 2-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff series: Game 1 today at Cotton Bowl in Dallas; Game 2
Saturday at Invesco Field in Denver; Game 3 (if necessary) Oct. 2 at
Cotton Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Update: Dallas found all the motivation it needed in the Rocky
Mountain News earlier this month when Colorado defender Rick Titus
was quoted as saying, "Dallas is done. They peaked too early in the
season." The Burn, which played its last two games with the article
posted in its locker room, begins the playoffs having lost three of
its last four games. The Rapids finished 3-1-1 and has Scottish
forward John Spencer back from a knee injury to join the
three-pronged offensive attack of Chris Carrieri, Mark Chung and
Chris Henderson. Chung (32 points on 11 goals and 10 assists) led the
Rapids in scoring. Dallas forward Jason Kreis (30 points on 13 goals
and four assists) led the Burn, but has only three goals in 19
playoff games. Dallas outscored Colorado, 11-7, in aggregate goals.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Incident Puts Moss in Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Minnesota Viking receiver Randy Moss was arrested Tuesday after being
accused of bumping a traffic control agent with his car.</LD>
<LD>   The 27-year-old agent stepped in front of Moss to stop him from
making an illegal turn in downtown Minneapolis, and Moss used his car
to slowly push the officer for half a block along the street,
stopping when she fell to the ground, police spokeswoman Cyndi
Barrington said.</LD>
<LD>   Barrington said the agent, a city employee but not a police
officer, was not seriously hurt.</LD>
<TE>   Moss was in jail on suspicion of assault with a dangerous weapon,
a felony. Barrington said the county attorney would consider charges
today, and it was unclear whether Moss would be allowed to post bail
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be treated like anybody else," Barrington said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings said the team wouldn't comment about the incident
until it had gathered more information.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Hullerman, 46, said he was parked near the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a really decked-out Lexus pushing the traffic person
along," said Hullerman, who was interviewed by police. "It was really
surreal."</TE>
<TE>   He said the agent was facing forward while sitting on the front of
the car with one hand on the hood and the other hand on her radio as
the car pushed her along. After a few seconds, Hullerman said, "she
fell flat on her face," and the driver didn't get out of his car.</TE>
<TE>   Hullerman said officers arrived and took Moss into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Moss has been in trouble before. He squirted a referee with a
water bottle in 1999 and was fined $25,000 by the NFL, and he abused
corporate sponsors on the team bus in 2001 and was fined $15,000 by
the Vikings, who forced him to attend anger management classes.</TE>

<LD>There is a pingpong table set up for the amusement of the Ryder Cup
players in the U.S. team room at the Belfry, and Tiger Woods was
asked about it Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pop, pop, pop, he got three quick questions.... "So, Tiger, did
you play pingpong last night? How good are you? And who did you
beat?"</LD>
<LD>   Woods tugged on the bill of his cap before answering.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, I played. I'm all right. I beat a few people."</TE>
<TE>   Thank you very much, you've been a great audience, please drive
home carefully.</TE>
<TE>   For Woods, it was an attempt at humor and it went over well, but
there isn't any pingpong tournament going on this week. The fact is,
Woods' record in the Ryder Cup is no laughing matter.</TE>
<TE>   And here is the punch line: The best player in the world has a
losing record.</TE>
<TE>   "If you play poorly, no matter whether you're in a team event or
individual, you're going to get your butt beat; it's as simple as
that," Woods said. "I've played poorly and I've played well and I've
lost both ways. In either case, you chalk it up and move on."</TE>
<TE>   Moving on quickly, Woods is 3-6-1 in the Ryder Cup and the three
quick answers are, yes, he has played; he has played all right, and
he has beaten very few people.</TE>
<TE>   How this has occurred is a mystery as puzzling as why there is
bacon on nearly every sandwich in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Calcavecchia, who is probably going to be paired with Woods
when the matches begin Friday, cannot explain it. "That's a mystery
to me also," Calcavecchia said. "I'm 0-4 in best ball and 4-0 in
alternate shot and you wouldn't think that would be the case, either.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, guys get all jacked up to play Tiger because they know
they've got to play great to beat him. And on occasion, that happens.
A few other occasions, maybe Tiger wasn't at his best.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly wouldn't think that, but he may go 5-0 this week
and all of a sudden be 8-6-1."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly how the U.S. team would like it to add up by
Sunday afternoon, because it probably would mean the U.S. getting out
of town with its hands still on the Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was 1-3-1 in his first Ryder Cup play at Valderrama in Spain
in 1997, his first full year as a professional. He won his first
match, period. Woods was paired with Mark O'Meara and they beat Colin
Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, 3 and 2, in best ball.</TE>
<TE>   They lost to the same pair in the alternate-shot format, 5 and 3.
Nick Faldo and Lee Westwood beat Woods-O'Meara in best ball too, but
Woods and Justin Leonard halved their alternate-shot match with
Jesper Parnevik and Ignacio Garrido.</TE>
<TE>   In his singles match against Costantino Rocca, Woods was trounced,
4 and 2, and it was a point the U.S. could have used. Instead, Europe
won, 14 1/2--13 1/2. Down by five points, the U.S. outscored Europe,
8-4, in the singles, but fell one point short.</TE>
<TE>   It should also be noted that in the 1997 matches, Leonard and
Davis Love III combined for a total of one point, two halves by
Leonard, the British Open champion. Love, the PGA champion, was 0-4.</TE>
<TE>   Love remembers the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get a point," he said. "I can't tell you the matches
I've won. I can tell you all the ones I've lost. And it really wears
on you."</TE>
<TE>   Woods did get two points in the last Ryder Cup, at Brookline,
Mass., in 1999. He and Tom Lehman lost to Sergio Garcia and Parnevik,
2 and 1, in alternate shot, then he and David Duval lost to Darren
Clarke and Westwood, 1-up, in best ball.</TE>
<TE>   Woods and Steve Pate split their matches the next day, defeating
Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez, but losing to Paul
Lawrie and Montgomerie. And with the U.S. trailing again after two
days, 10-6, Woods did his part in the U.S. rout on Sunday, defeating
Andrew Coltart, 3 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won, 14 1/2--13 1/2, winning eight of the 12 singles
matches and halving another.</TE>
<TE>   Woods doesn't have to be reminded of how he has played in the
Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it was better," he said. "That means I would have
contributed more points to my team, but I haven't done that."</TE>
<TE>   Woods hasn't experienced the same problem in his usual work mode,
the individual, stroke-play event. He has played 15 tournaments this
year and won five, 33%.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ryder Cup, his winning percentage--for points in
matches--is only slightly higher, 35%.</TE>
<TE>   There seems to be plenty of time left for Woods to work on the
grading curve. Jack Nicklaus played in six Ryder Cups and left with a
17-8-3 record. Arnold Palmer played in six and was 22-8-2. Hale Irwin
was 13-5-2 in five appearances and Tom Watson was 10-4-1 in four.</TE>
<TE>   If major championship winners such as Nicklaus, Palmer, Irwin and
Watson also made their marks in the Ryder Cup, it's probably going to
happen with Woods too. Clearly, the expectations are there. Woods has
played on a winning Ryder Cup team and a losing one. This week, he
has another opportunity to show what the game's greatest player can
do on one of its greatest stages.</TE>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spark center Lisa Leslie had 24 points and 13 rebounds to lead the
defending champion United States past Australia, 71-56, Tuesday in
the semifinals of the Women's World Basketball Championship at
Nanjing, China.</LD>
<LD>   Shannon Johnson scored 15 of her 17 points in the second quarter,
and Sheryl Swoopes had 13 points and nine rebounds for the U.S.,
which will play Russia in the title game today. Russia defeated South
Korea, 70-53, in the other semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. limited Lauren Jackson of the WNBA's Seattle Storm to
nine points. The Australians were led by Suzy Batkovic's 13 points.</LD>
<TE>   Leslie, playing in her third championship tournament, became the
U.S. team's all-time leading scorer and rebounder in the
championship. Her 376 points surpassed the previous mark of 371, set
by Teresa Edwards from 1986-94, and her 181 rebounds surpassed
Katrina McClain's record of 180 from 1986-94.</TE>
<TE>   "We played pretty good defensively, and really shut Lauren Jackson
down, who is really the key player to their team," Leslie said. "I
thought Penny Taylor played well and really tried to take it to us,
but overall our defense prevailed."</TE>

<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart won't face criminal assault charges stemming from an
accusation by an unidentified woman that the NASCAR driver shoved her
at an August race in Bristol, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Sullivan County grand jury declined to indict Stewart after
hearing a report on the sheriff's investigation following the Sharpie
500 Winston Cup race Aug. 24, District Attorney Greeley Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as I've contended all along, I did not assault anyone and
I'm relieved to know a grand jury has come to the same conclusion,"
Stewart said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 31, is on probation with NASCAR and The Home Depot, the
sponsor of his car, for punching a photographer who tried to take his
picture following the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis on Aug. 4.
Stewart was fined $10,000 by NASCAR and $50,000 by Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart finished last season on probation after slapping a
reporter's tape recorder away and then kicking it under a truck.</TE>
<TE>   The father of Sacramento King star Chris Webber was arraigned in
Detroit on charges of lying to a grand jury about the player's
dealings with a University of Michigan booster.</TE>
<TE>   A plea of not guilty was entered on behalf of Mayce Webber Jr. and
a $10,000 bond was ordered for him. Mayce Webber, Chris Webber and
Charlene Johnson, Chris' aunt, were indicted Sept. 9. All face the
same charges--lying to a grand jury and obstructing justice. The
maximum penalty on each charge is five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.</TE>
<TE>   A $40-million lawsuit Swiss tennis star Martina Hingis filed
against an Italian sportswear maker whose shoes allegedly injured her
feet has been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   State Supreme Court Justice Sherry Klein Heitler said in a ruling
made public Tuesday that New York is the wrong place to try the case
since similar litigation between Hingis and the company, Sergio
Tacchini, is pending in Milan, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   During the U.S. Open in New York in September 1998, Hingis said
she sustained a severe foot injury because Tacchini had outfitted her
with "defective" shoes, "unsuitable for competition." She said the
injury hurt her career.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic swimming champion Jenny Thompson has filed a lawsuit in
New Hampshire, alleging she is owed $280,000 for an endorsement deal
with the marketing firm Envion International.</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneur Matt Freese and real estate developer Ralph Cutillo,
who died last week at age 78, are the defendants. According to the
suit, Cutillo bought Envion from Freese last year.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed this month in Strafford County Superior Court,
questions whether the business actually changed hands and
acknowledges that Thompson does not know which man owes her the
money.</TE>
<TE>   The state has no record of any such business under Freese's name
or Cutillo's, according to the Concord Monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Freese's telephone number is unlisted and he could not be reached.
Cutillo's lawyer, Patrick Wood, said Cutillo never bought Freese's
marketing firm. He also dismissed Thompson's claim that her image was
featured on a Web site owned by Cutillo.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's lawyer, Paul Cox, said Cutillo did use the image.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco receiver Terrell Owens doesn't care if the 49ers were
injured and ailing. He believes they didn't beat the Washington
Redskins badly enough on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to bite my tongue," Owens said Tuesday as the 49ers
packed up for several days off during their bye week. "Like I said,
we need to develop killer instinct, for whatever reason. That's it. I
said what I had to say. I'm not going to backtrack on what I said. I
said what I said Sunday, and that's what I meant."</LD>
<LD>   Owens was angry Coach Steve Mariucci ordered the team to kneel on
the ball for the final two plays of an eight-minute drive, running
out the clock at the Redskin 16. The 49ers won, 20-10.</LD>
<TE>   Mariucci said he decided to play conservatively because several of
his players were out with injuries, and many more were ill from a
stomach virus.</TE>
<TE>   Owens was among several 49ers who wanted to pound the Redskins, in
part because of Washington's 38-7 exhibition victory over San
Francisco at Osaka, Japan.</TE>

Brian Kelly (right shoulder sprain) are listed as questionable for
Sunday's game at Cincinnati.</TE>

<LD>Barry Bonds hit his 45th homer and Benito Santiago drove in four
runs, and the San Francisco Giants moved closer to clinching the
National League wild card with a 12-3 victory over the San Diego
Padres on Tuesday night at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Russ Ortiz won his sixth consecutive start and the Giants, who
have won four in a row and six of seven, moved three games ahead of
the Dodgers in the wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds drove a 1-and-1 pitch over the wall in right field for a
two-run homer in the seventh. It was the 612th career homer for
Bonds, who also drew his major league-leading 64th and 65th
intentional walks, giving him 193.</LD>

<TE>   Arizona had tied the score, 2-2, in the top of the ninth against

<LD>The end came quietly, the scrappiness transformed into a surrender,
the taste simply awful.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not much with math, but I do know a virtual elimination when I
see one.</LD>
<LD>   This was it.</LD>
<TE>   On a smoky Tuesday night in a half-empty stadium, the Dodgers
ended a rebirth season with all the energy of a wake.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were losing, 1-0, to the Colorado Rockies at the same
time the San Francisco Giants were beating the San Diego Padres,
12-3.</TE>
<TE>   That dropped them three games behind the Giants in the wild-card
race with five games to go.</TE>
<TE>   Impossible? Don't listen to me, listen to them.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, after beating the Giants when a loss would have dropped
them three games behind, pitcher Odalis Perez said, "If we didn't win
this game, we were finished."</TE>
<TE>   Today you can take him for his word.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was ready Tuesday against a sorry Rockies' team that was
playing without its two best hitters.</TE>
<TE>   He was, seemingly, the only one.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting smartly for much of the season, the Dodgers began
this last-gasp week by swinging for the fences.</TE>
<TE>   They might as well have been swinging for the golf courses and
hunting lodges.</TE>
<TE>   Eight batters swung at the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Nine batters had finished their at-bats by the second pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, only three batters collected hits.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora, one of the most inspirational players on this team
because he always played to his strengths, flied out to center field
three times. Um, no, fly balls are not his strength.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca, one of the team's best contact hitters, came to the
plate in the eighth inning with the tying run on third base and two
out ... and struck out on three pitches. Including a bad-ball bunt
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre came to the plate with the tying run on second and
two out in the ninth ... and struck out on three more pitches.</TE>
<TE>   After which, organist Nancy Bea Hefley played, "Season in the
Sun."</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, even the fluorescent clubhouse lights seemed dim.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough one to take," said Manager Jim Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   In the next room, Perez, who gave up five hits in eight innings,
was having an even tougher time changing last week's spin.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's hard, we are down," he said, pausing. "But, you know,
baseball is a crazy game."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly is.</TE>
<TE>   After taking victories from surprised teams all summer, the
Dodgers essentially end their season by losing to a team that tried
to give it to them.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies started the game without stars Todd Helton and Larry
Walker--Helton was back in Denver with his wife for the expected
delivery of their first child while Walker was reportedly curled up
with flu (and an 0-for-12 lifetime mark against Perez).</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies ended the game without Denny Stark, a rookie who was
inexplicably removed by Manager Clint Hurdle after seven innings even
though he had allowed but one hit and thrown only 93 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise that, against two Rockies' relievers, the
Dodgers threatened in each of the last two innings.</TE>
<TE>   But it was also no surprise that, given the severe tightening of
their grips, the Dodgers could not make good on their threats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we have talked to guys about in spring training,
it's not like we're just bringing it up in the 157th game," said
Tracy. "But we just hit the ball in the air too much."</TE>
<TE>   The game ended, the crowded silently filed away, the Giants kept
scoring runs against San Diego, and thoughts turned to what could
have been.</TE>
<TE>   What if Kevin Brown had not bullied the Dodgers into rushing him
back this spring? What if Dan Evans had not traded top prospect
Ricardo Rodriguez for Paul Shuey, allowing Rodriguez to perhaps take
Brown's place in the rotation?</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Omar Daal and Andy Ashby this fall? Did they fade
at the same time as Shawn Green's big swing? Why didn't more hitters
seize the moment like Brian Jordan?</TE>
<TE>   And what will happen now?</TE>
<TE>   Because he was dealt last winter in the middle of a long-term
deal, this off-season Jordan can demand a trade.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a risky move that could tie him to a sorry team for
several years. But, because the Dodgers cannot afford to lose their
new leader, it also could be a profitable move.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming Jordan stays, can the Dodgers afford to pay for another
bat to help him and Green?</TE>
<TE>   Can they survive with a center-field platoon of Dave Roberts and
Wilkin Ruan?</TE>
<TE>   Will Adrian Beltre spend the entire season as an adult? Will Eric
Karros and Mark Grudzielanek, both in the possible final years of
contracts and both difficult to move, somehow become kids again?</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of running Daal out of town, the starting
rotation will not change. Perez, Hideo Nomo and Kazuhisa Ishii are
keepers, while Brown, Ashby and the returning-from-injury Darren
Dreifort have huge contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But doesn't the bullpen have to change? Another arm to get to Eric
Gagne?</TE>
<TE>   One moment it's a hot night. The next moment, it's a hot stove.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers went from 2002 to 2003, during an evening they barely
moved.</TE>

<HD>As Usual, It's Difficult to Figure Out Raiders</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Coliseum's Ridley-Thomas is concerned, but
Moag says judge's ruling won't affect Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the Raiders were awarded a new trial in their
$1.2-billion lawsuit against the NFL over the rights to the Los
Angeles market, representatives of the Coliseum and Rose Bowl had
vastly different reactions.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no denying the fact that this impacts any group's pursuit
of the return of football to the L.A. market," Los Angeles City
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, chairman of a Coliseum Commission task
force aimed at bringing NFL football back to that stadium, said
Tuesday. "We believed that this had been settled. Obviously, it was
not. There remains a substantial open issue."</LD>
<LD>   But John Moag, who is leading the charge to bring pro football to
the Rose Bowl, said he remains "extremely optimistic" about the
chances of that happening and said he doesn't expect the Raider case
to have much bearing on the future of football in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know that the judge's decision has anything to do at all
with the progression of the return of football to L.A.," said Moag,
chairman of a Maryland sports investment-banking firm who cleared the
way for the Cleveland Browns' move to Baltimore. "It has nothing to
do with our moving forward and putting a team in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Thomson, chairman of the Rose Bowl's tenant-recruitment
committee, recently made it clear that stadium officials have no
interest in trying to woo the Raiders, who left L.A. for Oakland
after the 1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Monday about the decision to award a new trial, NFL Vice
President Joe Browne said the league was "disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, league spokesman Greg Aiello declined to make further
comment on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said underestimating the courtroom acumen of Raider
owner Al Davis is risky at best. "Even in Al Davis' advanced years,
he's warming up to pin back Roger Goodell's ears," the councilman
said, referring to the league's chief operating officer who oversees
all stadium-related matters.</TE>
<TE>   "This not good news for the NFL, nor is it good news for the L.A.
market," he continued. "The NFL blew its opportunity to settle all
this when it could have in 1999, when the opportunity for a franchise
was much more clear and you had motivated parties ready to step up."</TE>

<HD>Humbled Rams Wonder if Their Show Has Closed</HD>
<DH>Pro football: 'Baffled' by 0-3 start, they're bucking
history and searching for old swagger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner clenched his teeth and exhaled, his soft whistle piercing
the awkward quiet of the St. Louis locker room. It is the awkward
quiet of the Ram offense, however, that has everyone in the
organization frustrated and confused.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a little bit baffled," Warner said after Monday's 26-14 loss
at Tampa Bay, a game in which four of his passes were intercepted.
"It's the same team that's been here so long. I can't believe that
it's taken this long and we still haven't gotten out of this rut
we're in. It starts with me. I've got to take care of my part first,
quit putting the team in bad positions and not in positions to win."</LD>
<LD>   It was a typical moment of humility for Warner, voted the NFL's
most valuable player twice in the last three seasons. He has never
been reluctant to shoulder blame, even though the Rams can point in
plenty of other directions to explain their 0-3 record, the team's
worst start in a non-strike season since 1963. Since 1970, only five
of 59 teams that started 0-3 have made the playoffs, most recently
the Buffalo Bills in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The onetime "Greatest Show on Turf" is averaging 17 points a game
this season--barely more than half of the 32.6 it averaged last
season. Seven times last season, the Rams started drives inside the
opponent's 50-yard line and came away with zero points. This season,
they had done that seven times in the first two games. Warner has
thrown one touchdown pass and seven interceptions, and the Rams now
have lost their last three against Tampa Bay--all on "Monday Night
Football."</TE>
<TE>   For proof there's enough blame to go around, rewind the Buccaneer
game and check out what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk was crunched into the turf in the second quarter,
leaving the game with a neck strain. Backup running backs Trung
Canidate and Lamar Gordon each broke the wrong way on pass routes,
leading to two interceptions. Isaac Bruce couldn't hold onto a pass
near the goal line after beating his defender by 10 yards. A
beautifully placed punt trickled past Ram players who were trying to
down it at the one and rolled into the end zone for a touchback.</TE>
<TE>   Warner was sacked five times, and clobbered many more, in large
part because St. Louis right tackles John St. Clair and Grant
Williams had pass rushers whistling past them all night.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram defense scarcely resembles the third-ranked unit that
played so well last season, even though it has 10 returning starters.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could put your finger on any one thing, it would be easy
to fix," backup center Frank Garcia said. "It's just, we're not in
sync with each other, and we're not making the plays at the critical
times when we need to make plays. You can look back at that game and
there are three or four instances where you say, 'Hey, that's going
to change the game.' We didn't make those plays."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams have never really recovered from their Super Bowl loss to
the New England Patriots. Gone is the swagger, the unwavering belief
that Warner and Faulk could extricate the team from any tight spot,
the notion that Coach Mike Martz has an answer for any scheme a
defensive mastermind might devise.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to play with a certain attitude," tight end Ernie
Conwell said. "That attitude, in the past few years, has been
portrayed as speed, excitement and fun. That attitude has to get back
in here. We've got to maintain what attitude we have left, and where
we're lacking, we've got to find it somehow."</TE>
<TE>   By most accounts, Martz is far more tightly wound this season. He
has closed practices, something he didn't do before, and has been
especially sensitive to media scrutiny. His decisions to go for it on
fourth down in losses to Denver and the New York Giants were widely
criticized; the Rams failed on both attempts, and the plays turned
out to be pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 13-7, the Rams spent the better part of the third quarter
in Tampa Bay territory but decided to punt on fourth and one and
fourth and two--choices not only influenced by the absence of Faulk
but perhaps by the offense's diminished confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after the Buccaneers began the fourth quarter with a
touchdown drive, the Rams answered with one of their own, scoring on
a 21-yard run by Gordon on fourth and one.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Martz was bracing for the possibility that Faulk's
injury could keep him on the sideline awhile. Tuesday, Faulk's injury
didn't seem as serious as first thought--Martz said Faulk had no
numbness in his neck--but the running back's status was uncertain for
Sunday's game with the Dallas Cowboys. Faulk was scheduled for an
MRI, but results will not be made available until today.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed with Trung, very disappointed," Martz
said, who later declined to elaborate on his second-string running
back. "So I put Lamar Gordon in, and it looks to me like we've found
a starter."</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the only bright spot for the coach, whose team
catches a break Sunday in playing host to the 1-2 Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm upset," Martz said. "I feel bad for these players. We've
played well enough at times to have won these games, and we've had
some mistakes here and there. We're not good enough to overcome those
mistakes. In the past, we were good enough where we could have done
something about it."</TE>

<LD>I figure the next thing we're going to learn is that the water

long.</LD>

<LD>   YOU TAKE into account the handicap parking scandal, a former actor
ending the Heisman Trophy campaign of DeShaun Foster with an SUV
loaner, a starting quarterback spending time in jail, numerous
punches thrown resulting in charges being filed and it's enough to
make a coach drink.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Coach Bob Toledo would probably run into most of
his players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S NOTHING like a game in Dodger Stadium with everything on
the line in late September other than maybe a Cardinal-Bengal
football game deep in December. Former L.A. manager Tom Lasorda has
had more birthdays (75) than the Dodgers had fans in the stands when
Tuesday night's must-game got underway, and the inspired Dodgers went
on to fold, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS, now most likely a wild-card team, sold all available
division series tickets in a matter of hours Saturday. The Dodgers,
35,180 fans shy of hitting the 3-million mark this season, still have
15,000-20,000 playoff tickets available for games that will probably
never be played.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn why Giovanni Carrara was
starting against the Rockies tonight instead of Kevin Beirne.</TE>
<TE>   "He won the coin flip, if I remember right," Colborn said, and
imagine how good the Dodgers might have been had Colborn used a
two-headed coin every time Andy Ashby's name came up to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MIGHTY Ducks' newspaper campaign is topped by this headline:
"A New Decade Begins!" I give the Ducks credit for finally admitting
they're two years behind everyone else.</TE>

<TE>   THE FOUR Heisman trophies won by USC athletes are there, along
with displays honoring Trojan Olympians, Hall of Fame inductees and
other great performers in school history, but they all surround the
centerpiece in the Heritage Hall lobby--a tribute to Lexus'
creativity in selling more cars.</TE>
<TE>   The Lexus Gauntlet Trophy, a big gaudy hunk of metal that goes to
the winner of yearly competition between USC and UCLA, dominates the
room. For recruits, of course, this tells them there is nothing more
important at USC than beating UCLA, and I guess when you can't beat
Kansas State two years running, you go for a dream that might be
attainable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EVERY TUESDAY the media gather to listen to USC Coach Pete Carroll
speak and then grab a few minutes with the players. I know it was
presumptuous on my part to expect wide receiver Kareem Kelly to drop
everything and stop by, but I've seen him play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RODNEY PEETE'S success at age 36 suggests some USC quarterbacks
take a little more time to develop, if you know what I mean.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S NO question Paul Sunderland knows his basketball and has
done his homework as a broadcaster, but here's hoping he lightens up

<TE>   A NEW trial probably means renewed interest in the Raiders here,
and while the team tries to prove its $1.2-billion conspiracy case
against the NFL, I have my own conspiracy questions as they relate to
Channel 2 broadcaster Jim Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, of course, is already the top sports broadcaster in L.A.,
and although I thought nothing of it when he told me a week ago
Channel 2 would be airing 10 Raider games this season as a lead-in to
his Sports Central show, it's kind of odd that out of nowhere the
Raiders get a new trial and Hill gets a bigger audience.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DENVER Post reported Tuesday that Clipper center Michael
Olowokandi had dinner with Nugget General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe in
Denver on Sunday night. On Monday Olowokandi signed a $6.1-million
contract to stay in L.A. Apparently Vandeweghe elected only to get
stuck with the bill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAM BOGHOSIAN, a former UCLA offensive lineman and Raider
assistant coach, captained the winning team in this week's NFL alumni
golf tournament to benefit the Boy Scouts. Boghosian had four good
golfers playing with him, which left our fivesome at a considerable
disadvantage because Tim Brown (Laker reporter), Randy Youngman
(Orange County Register Page 2 columnist), Tom Johnson (newspaper
publisher) and Jim Tunney (former NFL referee) are all terrible
golfers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ST. LOUIS Post-Dispatch sports columnist Bernie Miklasz wrote
after the Rams' latest loss, "If (Kurt) Warner's stunning decline
continues, he'll soon be compared to Jim Everett." If it was
Miklasz's intention to hit Warner hard, it's a phantom sack without
any mention of Chris Evert.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS gave fans a team photo with the following
instructions: "Fold short panel up to meet the 2nd [prefolded] panel.
Now fold the last panel up to meet the 2nd panel. Now turn the photo
upside down and fold on the 2 black dotted lines. Now pop out the
base and insert the 'LA' tabs into the slits in the 3rd panel."</TE>
<TE>   It really is much easier to be an Angel fan these days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Gloria Bando:</TE>
<TE>   "Just because Rex Hudler is an upbeat broadcaster is no reason to
compare him to Richard Simmons. You're just a crotchety old cynic.
Why don't you leave L.A. and make a lot of people very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Just what we need--more happy people in this world like Rex
Hudler.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move intended to "protect the authority of the referee," FIFA,
world soccer's governing body, mandated Tuesday that any player
ejected from a match must immediately serve a minimum one-game
suspension in the same competition and does not have the right of
appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The rule, already in place but inconsistently enforced, will take
effect worldwide once FIFA notifies its 204 member nations.</LD>
<LD>   Players can still appeal longer suspensions, but the one-game ban
imposed for a red card or two yellow cards is automatic. The only way
it can be avoided is if the referee afterward admits a case of
mistaken identity or concedes that he made an incorrect decision.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to protect the authority of the referee, which is the
foundation stone of the game," Sepp Blatter, FIFA's president, said
in Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>

<TE>   FIFA Must Pay</TE>
<TE>   Because FIFA could not properly organize the printing and
distribution of tickets to this year's World Cup in South Korea and
Japan, it will compensate Japanese organizers financially for the
extra $4 million in costs they incurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We have accepted FIFA's offer for an apology payment," Hisao
Shuto, an organizing committee spokesman, said in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Blatter's promise of "transparency" in FIFA financial
dealings, Shuto said FIFA had requested that the compensation amount
not be disclosed.</TE>

<TE>   Sanchez Drops Out</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Sanchez, former Real Madrid and Mexico World Cup striker,
withdrew his bid to become Mexico's next national team coach, saying
the time was not right and that he wanted to concentrate on his
position as coach of UNAM in the Mexican league.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's surprise withdrawal leaves three candidates under
consideration: Argentine coaches Ricardo Volpe and Carlos Bianchi and
Brazil's 2002 World Cup-winning coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari.</TE>

<TE>   Coliseum Games</TE>
<TE>   Four Mexican league clubs will play in a double-header at the
Coliseum tonight as part of pre-qualifying for the 2003 Copa
Libertadores. Cruz Azul will play Morelia at 6 p.m. and Toluca will
play Pachuca at 8.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, which has a 7:30 p.m. Major League Soccer playoff game
against the Kansas City Wizards at the Rose Bowl, did not protest the
double-header because the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns
the Galaxy, reportedly is an investor in the pre-Copa Libertadores
event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Romario Benched</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian striker Romario, a 1994 World Cup winner, was benched
for a game for "ungentlemanly conduct." He slapped Fluminense
teammate Andrei in the face for making a defensive mistake in a 6-0
loss to Sao Paulo in a Brazilian league game.</TE>

<TE>   Tunisia Gets Lemerre</TE>
<TE>   Roger Lemerre, who was fired as France's coach after the defending
world champion was ousted in the first round of the Korea/Japan World
Cup, was named coach of Tunisia's national team.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from Tunis said Lemerre had accepted a salary of $21,700 a
month on a contract that will run through the 2004 African Nations
Cup finals, which Tunisia will host.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italian Clubs Shine</TE>
<TE>   Three goals by Filippo Inzaghi after a solitary strike by Clarence
Seedorf earned AC Milan a comprehensive 4-0 victory on the road over
Deportivo La Coruna of Spain, and Juventus won by an even larger
margin--5-0 at home in Turin over Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine--as the two
Italian clubs continued their strong start in European Champions
League play.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United and Barcelona also remained unbeaten after
impressive road victories. Dutch striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy scored
twice as Manchester United defeated last season's runner-up, Bayer
Leverkusen, 2-1, in Germany, and goals by Patrick Kluivert and Luis
Enrique earned Barcelona a 2-0 win over Galatasaray in Turkey.</TE>

<HD>Sunderland Is Lakers' Voice of Choice</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Play-by-play announcer gets one-year
contract, but he says no one can replace Chick Hearn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 11:15 a.m. Tuesday, Paul Sunderland bent over and signed a
contract on General Manager Mitch Kupchak's desk that made him the
second play-by-play announcer in the history of the Los Angeles
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm honored, thrilled and ecstatic," Sunderland said after
officially replacing the legendary Chick Hearn, who died Aug. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Then, after a pause, Sunderland said, "But the reason we are doing
this is because Chick is no longer with us, so this comes with very
mixed emotion."</LD>
<TE>   The contract is for one year, which Sunderland said initially was
an issue that needed to be examined after he and his agent, Martin
Mandel, were made the offer Friday. But Sunderland added that once it
was explained that one-year contracts for broadcasters, at least
initially, are a custom of the Lakers and owner Jerry Buss, he was
fine with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, who wouldn't want a long-term contract?" Sunderland said.
"But the bottom line is, this is a Buss custom. Chick worked with
one-year contracts for more than 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   In more recent years, Hearn and partner Stu Lantz worked under
two- or three-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers are known for their continuity and loyalty, and what
they have said to me and what I have said to them is, this is the
beginning of a long relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Having grown up in Southern California, this really is a dream
come true. But one thing I want to make clear is, I'm not the new
voice of the Lakers. I'm the next play-by-play announcer. And in the
years to come there will be another play-by-play announcer after me.</TE>
<TE>   "But there will always remain only one voice of the Lakers, and
that voice is Chick Hearn."</TE>

<HD>White Waits for Right Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel White is rarely tackled without inflicting punishment on
defenders. But the status of two teammates will dictate how often the
240-pound sophomore is able to carry the ball.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve fullbacks Pat Norton and J.D. Groves must rebound from
injuries to allow White to move from fullback to tailback more often.</LD>
<LD>   Norton, a sophomore, played for the first time this season against
Colorado after missing two games because of a sprained ankle. He
looked rusty, often leaving his feet too soon on blocking
assignments.</LD>
<TE>   Groves, a freshman, has had significant on-the-job training but is
hampered by a strained neck.</TE>
<TE>   White has rushed for 155 yards, averaging 4.6 yards a carry, the
same as starting tailback Akil Harris, who has gained 208 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot more comfortable at tailback, but it's all about
winning," White said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll play whatever position helps us win."</TE>
<TE>   Harris is the more elusive runner, but Colorado held him to 31
yards in 15 carries Saturday. Lining up White with the 260-pound
Norton would give the Bruins a 500-pound backfield, perhaps the most
effective combination against a physical opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "The elephant backfield," Coach Bob Toledo said. "We're hoping
Norton gets healthier and plays better. J.D. is doing well for a true
freshman, but it's a learning process. The truth is, we've been in a
bind at fullback."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toledo had the starting defense face the second-string offense
rather than the scout team during practice Tuesday to better simulate
San Diego State's high-powered passing attack.... The Bruins have
fumbled five times but have recovered all five.... Cory Paus needs
331 yards passing to move past Tom Ramsey into No. 2 on the UCLA
career list behind Cade McNown. Paus needs 16 completions to pass
Tommy Maddox as No. 4 all-time.... Middle linebacker Dennis Link
sprained an ankle and reserve tackle Alex Potasi suffered a sprained
left knee at practice Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Knee Injury Knocks Out Nunn</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronald Nunn, USC's starting left cornerback, learned Tuesday that he
suffered a season-ending knee injury against Kansas State. He will
undergo surgery and redshirt.</LD>
<LD>   Nunn, a junior transfer from San Francisco City College, was
injured while covering a receiver away from the ball during the
second quarter of the Trojans' 27-20 loss last Saturday at Manhattan,
Kan. Results from an MRI exam revealed a torn anterior cruciate
ligament.</LD>
<LD>   "I just planted my leg and felt my knee shift quite a bit," Nunn
said. "It's disappointing, but at least it happened before the fourth
game so I can redshirt."</LD>
<TE>   Nunn became a starter after senior Kevin Arbet suffered a broken
foot and underwent surgery during training camp. Arbet also is
redshirting.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee while playing at
Mountain View St. Francis High and before his sophomore season in
junior college. He overcame a strained hamstring during training
camp, suffered a hip pointer in the opener against Auburn and broke
his thumb before the game against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman William Buchanon replaced Nunn against Kansas
State and is battling freshman Justin Wyatt and junior Marcell
Allmond to start on Saturday against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, whose father, Willie, played cornerback in the NFL for
11 years, switched from wide receiver to the secondary after Arbet's
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon said he spoke to his father after the Kansas State game.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I did good the first time out," Buchanon said. "He told
me about the mistakes I made. It was like I was in high school on the
car ride home from games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen, who handles kickoffs, was four for four on
field-goal attempts during practice and could supplant David Davis
for field goals and extra points against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I felt I was here to keep him on his toes and make him
perform," Killeen said. "Now, they have said this is a competition."</TE>
<TE>   Davis missed one kick.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy Pola, who coaches running backs and special teams, said
Davis has corrected a problem with his right foot, which he plants
before kicking with his left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Jason Mitchell sat out again because of a back spasms and
will undergo an MRI today.</TE>

<DH>Government: Grand jury accused Rackauckas of intervening in
criminal cases for political reasons. Supervisor questions state's
handling of matter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors on Tuesday chose not to discipline--or even
criticize--Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas over grand jury accusations
that he practiced political favoritism and intervened in cases
involving campaign contributors.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, one supervisor questioned whether the state attorney
general's office--which assisted the grand jury with its
investigation--handled the case properly.</LD>
<LD>   "I have many questions," Supervisor Todd Spitzer said. "Did the
attorney general waste everybody's time? Is this just a witch hunt or
will the allegations have some validity?"</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys hired by the board to examine the accusations against
Rackauckas said Tuesday that the supervisors don't have the authority
to order changes in the district attorney's office because Rackauckas
is an independently elected official who answers to the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors could have censured the district attorney or asked him
to come before them to discuss the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is preventing the board from asking the district attorney
to appear before the supervisors and answer some inconsistencies,"
said Jayne W. Williams, from the Northern California law firm of
Meyers Nave Riback Silver &amp; Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Grand Jury report accused Rackauckas of
intervening in criminal cases at the request of political supporters,
hiring family members of friends over more qualified candidates and
using public resources for personal business.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has defended his record, saying the grand jury was
misled by disgruntled employees who backed his political foes.</TE>
<TE>   In his 153-page response, Rackauckas said the grand jury presented
a "one-sided" view of his office.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the grand jury findings, the Board of Supervisors
commissioned its own report by private attorneys examining what its
response should be. The attorney who wrote that report said they
could not independently judge the accuracy of the grand jury findings
because they did not have access to the panel's interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Examining the allegations was "like having one hand tied behind
your back," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the board voted to forward its report to the attorney
general's office, which does have oversight of the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Not exactly a profile in courage," said Fred Smoller, head of the
Henley Social Science Research Center at Chapman University in
Orange, echoing the view of several political activists and
observers.</TE>
<TE>   Smoller said the Board of Supervisors had little to gain from
going after Rackauckas, who has strong support from Orange County's
Republican establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "On the government level, you have an independently elected and
reelected district attorney. On the political level, you have a very
powerful Republican Party as part of the establishment that [the
supervisors] cannot afford to alienate if they want to remain in
politics," Smoller said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said in a statement that he was "pleased" by the
board's handling of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer expressed frustration at the county's inability to better
respond to the grand jury accusations. He was critical of the outside
attorneys' report, saying he thought there were some grand jury
charges that could have been better examined.</TE>
<TE>   He cited allegations that one top employee from the district
attorney's office spent county funds to buy drinks as part of
lobbying efforts. It's against county policy for employees to buy
alcohol while conducting county business, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams responded that there are times when investigators buy
alcohol for informers or in undercover situations. The comment drew
an outburst from Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the example here. The money was used to buy alcohol
for lobbying purposes," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Williams responded that there are times when investigators buy
alcohol for informers or in undercover situations. The comment drew
an outburst from Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the example here. The money was used to buy alcohol
for lobbying purposes," he said.</TE>

<HD>Boater Drifts 4 Months at Sea</HD>
<DH>Ordeal: Consuming fish, a bird and rainwater, Vietnamese
immigrant travels 2,500 miles before sailors find him--in good
health.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Van Pham drifted and slept, slept and drifted--for nearly
four months and 2,500 miles--from Long Beach to waters off Costa
Rica.</LD>
<LD>   He ate roasted turtle, tuna and a seagull and drank rainwater. And
when he was finally rescued by the U.S. Navy, all he wanted was help
fixing his broken mast and motor so he could sail on again.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Navy sank his boat and dropped him off in Guatemala.</LD>
<TE>   He was able to buy a plane ticket after sailors aboard the frigate
McClusky took up a collection for his fare. On Tuesday, he arrived
back in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pham said Tuesday night that every day as he drifted at sea, he
scanned the horizon for any sign of life, any sign of land.</TE>
<TE>   "I see nothing," he said, describing his ordeal. "Then one day, I
see a plane. I know I'm close to people. They tip their wings to say
hello. Two hours later, a ship comes to my boat. I am very, very
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Terry Bragg, commander of Destroyer Squadron One in San
Diego, which oversees the McClusky, said he had never heard a story
of survival like Pham's.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a three-hour cruise gone bad," Bragg said. "It's like a
cross between Gilligan's Island and Robinson Crusoe."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy came upon Pham 300 miles off Costa Rica on Sept. 17,
nearly four months after the Southern California man had set off from
Long Beach for a short, easy sailing jaunt to Santa Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere on that 22-mile journey, a storm blew in and whipping
winds broke the Sea Breeze's mast. Then the outboard motor failed,
and so did the radio, according to Navy officials.</TE>
<TE>   '"For two months the wind continued nonstop," Pham said. The
breezes augmented the ocean currents that pushed him steadily south.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the 62-year-old Vietnamese immigrant, who told Navy
officials he had no family, had not filed a float plan. No one
reported him missing, so no one went looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   So he drifted, alone in his 26-foot boat. He stayed below deck
during the day to keep out of the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Though barnacles collected on his boat's hull, his solar-powered
generator worked, and sometimes he watched videos on his small
television. He put out a five-gallon bucket to collect rainwater. He
caught fish, eating some and hooking others to his broken mast to
attract seabirds to roast. He tore the wood paneling off his boat and
set up a makeshift grill. He netted a sea turtle that swam near his
boat and salted the meat to store for times when food was scarce.</TE>
<TE>   "If you travel at sea, you take what you find," Pham said. "If you
are scared, you will die."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Parriot, captain of the McClusky, still sounded flabbergasted
Tuesday as he related the tale of the rescue via satellite phone to
his commanding officer in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The McClusky, a 453-foot guided-missile frigate, was finishing up
six months of counter-narcotics patrol off the coast of Central
America last week when a U.S. customs P-3 drug-hunting plane reported
a broken-down sailboat bobbing in the water nearby, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The frigate headed up to the area at maximum speed, and an hour
and half later spotted "a very dilapidated sailboat."</TE>
<TE>   The McClusky blew its whistle, and a skinny man came up on the
deck of the Sea Breeze and began waving his arms frantically, Parriot
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sailors, along with a medic, lowered into a little boat and sped
over to him.</TE>
<TE>   It was early afternoon, and they found Pham in the middle of
fixing a lunch of roasted seabird on his homemade grill. Later, he
told sailors that what he really liked to eat was turtle.</TE>
<TE>   They hailed him in Spanish, but the sunburned mariner said he
couldn't speak that language, though his English was excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Pham was delighted to see the sailors, but he refused medical
treatment, Parriot said. Instead, what he wanted was a new sail and
help fixing his mast, so he could sail on. He thought he was
somewhere near Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the frigate, Parriot said he listened to the radio
transmissions from his crew with growing amazement. "It was coming in
in pieces," he said. "It was unbelievable ... the guy had been lost
at sea for four months."</TE>
<TE>   Engineers on the McClusky told Pham it didn't look good for the
Sea Breeze. The fuel was contaminated with water, the mast was beyond
repair and the vessel was simply not seaworthy.</TE>
<TE>   They persuaded Pham to come aboard the frigate. They thought about
towing his boat but soon concluded that wasn't possible. Reluctantly,
Pham gave permission for the Navy to sink the Sea Breeze. But he went
below deck so he wouldn't have to watch as they loaded it up with
smoke floats and set it aflame.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty distraught," Parriot said. "The sad part is, he
lost his home."</TE>
<TE>   Pham told the sailors that he was retired and had been living on
the Sea Breeze, docking it in Long Beach in between trips. He said he
had come to the United States from Vietnam in 1976 as a refugee.
Among the items he grabbed from the Sea Breeze before it sank was his
green card, Parriot said.</TE>
<TE>   Pham said in an interview that after he came to this country in
1976, he became a successful businessman, owning furniture stores in
North Hollywood, Culver City and Los Angeles and an auto mechanic
shop.</TE>
<TE>   But about 10 years ago, he said, a car accident left him in a coma
for six months. When he regained consciousness, he had suffered
severe memory loss and had to relearn English and simple tasks such
as taking the bus. The injuries left him unable to run his business,
and the hospital bills exhausted his savings, he said. He lost
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach officials said Pham did not have a permanent slip in
their city but had rented space for four days in May. Until January,
Pham apparently lived in an apartment on West 7th Street in the
jewelry district in downtown Los Angeles. He left no forwarding
address when he moved out.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the McClusky, Pham slept in sick bay but took his meals
with the sailors. A medical examination revealed that he had lost
some weight but had no obvious health problems. He did say he had
lost a tooth, but Parriot did not know how.</TE>
<TE>   Pham ate with gusto, coming back for seconds, the captain said,
even though the menu on his first night was fish, a meal Pham had had
quite enough of over the last four months.</TE>
<TE>   Crew members fussed over their new arrival. "They adopted him,"
the captain said.</TE>
<TE>   They were captivated by his tales of adventure. How had he had the
ingenuity to tie fish to the mast to attract birds? To bash sea
turtles? To set aside some of the meat for salting?</TE>
<TE>   "The ship McClusky, they're like my family," Pham said. "They
treated me like a brother. I love them."</TE>
<TE>   The crew members were touched and saddened to learn that the man
was now homeless and did not have enough money to get himself back to
the United States. Before the frigate stopped in Puerto Quetzal,
Guatemala, to drop Pham off, sailors had taken up a collection and
raised $800 for his plane fare.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, Pham was
directed to Traveler's Aid, which provided him with a room for the
night. His future is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Parriot said he was impressed with Pham's survival skills and
would love to have him as a companion if ever he found himself
drifting rudderless and lost in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   But before sailing with him, the captain added, "I think I would
make sure he had more safety devices on board."</TE>

<HD>Retired Amgen Division Chief Dies in Paragliding Accident
Near Mt. Whitney</HD>
<DH>Crash: Biologist Bruce Wallace, one of the first employees
at the giant biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, is found dead
after a two-day search.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Wallace, a distinguished biologist and one of the first
employees of biotech giant Amgen, was killed last week when his
paraglider crashed into a cliff face near Mt. Whitney in the Sierra
Nevada range.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old Ojai resident, known for his dry wit and
adventurous spirit, was flying at 12,000 feet Friday when the
accident occurred, according to the Inyo County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Two men flying with Wallace lost radio contact about 15 minutes
after they all took off from a popular spot known as Walt's Point.
Wallace's body was found two days later after an extensive air
search. His death was ruled accidental.</LD>
<TE>   Wallace began working at Amgen in 1980, when the Thousand Oaks
company was made up of a handful of researchers sharing a building
with a limousine company. The young scientist helped design Amgen's
first lab and locate space for additional facilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't a founder, but he was one of the first employees," said
Amgen spokeswoman Barbara Bronson Gray.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wallace retired in January, he headed up the company's
environmental health and safety division, Gray said. Wallace had a
doctorate in molecular biology from UCLA and worked with Caltech to
develop hands-on science programs for high school students.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace served on a number of foundations and commissions. He was
active with the Thacher School in Ojai and sat on the boards of the
Ojai Shakespeare Festival and the Ventura County Community
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce was extremely bright. He could narrow an issue very
succinctly and to the point," said Marty de los Cobos, vice president
of public affairs and development for the foundation. "This was a
terrible tragedy and a shock to us all. He was a real intellectual,
but also a guy you could talk to."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's passion was paragliding--a sport in which a large
overhead chute is manipulated to catch the wind and sail on thermal
currents. His stories occasionally terrified people.</TE>
<TE>   "He once told me he fell into a tree near Santa Ynez and had to
wait for hikers to come and get him down," Gray said. "He loved
pushing the envelope."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what went wrong Friday is still unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Before crashing, Wallace radioed his friends to say that he was
flying near Whitney Portal, sheriff's officials said. But it's
unclear what happened afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to his buddies who were flying with him, and I've got
various theories," said his brother, Doug Wallace, a San Diego
surgeon. "The gist of it is, he got into a descending spiral. His
chute partially collapsed, he went into a spin and couldn't recover."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue aircraft searched the eastern side of the mountains
Saturday with no luck. Shortly before noon Sunday, a downed
paraglider was spotted near a 12,000-foot ridge between Tuttle and
Diaz creeks, authorities said. Wallace's body was flown to a Lone
Pine hospital and picked up by coroner's officials.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother, Wallace is survived by his wife,
Marilyn, and four children. A private memorial service will be held
Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   "He was always pioneering creative applications for science," she

in life."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace served on a number of foundations and commissions. He was

<TE>   "Bruce was extremely bright. He could narrow an issue very

of public affairs and development for the foundation. "This was a
terrible tragedy and a shock to us all. He was a real intellectual,

<TE>   Longtime friend David Farber said he and Wallace had long talks
about the nature of the universe and the structure of subatomic
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a very dry sense of humor, which came out all the time,"
he said. "When my partner first met him at a party, he was wearing a
blinking bow tie."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's passion was paragliding--a sport in which a large

<TE>   Wallace hit Mt. Langley, a 14,027-foot peak, his brother said.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue aircraft searched the eastern side of the mountains
Saturday with no luck. Shortly before noon Sunday, a downed
paraglider was spotted near a 12,000-foot ridge between Tuttle and
Diaz creeks, authorities said. Wallace's body was flown to a Lone
Pine hospital and picked up by coroner's officials.</TE>
<TE>   "His helmet cracked but it worked in that there were no major
injuries to the head, but he sustained several injuries to his upper
body," said Robert Franke, a deputy coroner in Inyo County.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wallace said his brother was no adrenaline junkie, just
someone fascinated with the mechanics and beauty of flying. He had
flown in Brazil, the Swiss Alps, Ojai and Santa Barbara. Ironically,
he had just completed a safety training class over Lake Powell in
which he had to recover from spins and unexpected dives.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all about freedom for him," Wallace said. "Bruce was the
smartest man I knew. He had a sarcastic wit that occasionally
bordered on being tactless. But he was gracious and humble and never
put anyone down."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace is survived by his wife Marilyn and four children, one
still in high school. A private memorial service will be held
Saturday for family and friends only.</TE>

<LD>A judge on Tuesday extended his order barring the city of South Gate
from paying the criminal defense fees of Treasurer Albert Robles, who
has been charged with making death threats against two state
legislators.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe rejected arguments from city
attorneys who claimed Robles' taxpayer-funded defense was justified
because his alleged crimes arose from his work as city treasurer.</LD>
<LD>   The taxpayer lawsuit filed by two South Gate businessmen alleges
that Robles' defense fees amounted to a gift of public funds. Legal
fees have so far totaled about $300,000, according to Thomas M.
Brown, Robles' attorney.</LD>
<TE>   George B. Newhouse Jr., a city attorney, said an appeal would be
considered.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to increase
business licensing fees in unincorporated areas by 10% to 30%.</LD>
<LD>   County Auditor-Controller J. Tyler McCauley requested the
increase, saying the fees were necessary to allow the county to
recover the costs of processing business license applications and
renewals.</LD>
<LD>   The fees are expected to bring in $1.7 million in annual revenue,
an increase of $300,000. On average, fees for an original license

<HD>Kindergarten's Not Mandatory but It's Crucial</HD>
<DH>Some educators say it should be a full-day class. Yet 10%
of the state's kids don't even take it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maureen Coleman, a veteran first-grade teacher at Forty-Ninth Street
Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles, can spot them, even
on the first day of school.</LD>
<LD>   They might cry when their parents leave. Or they hold their books
upside down. When the teacher tells them to line up, they don't know
what that means. They might look at their pencil quizzically, or
wander away from the reading circle in the middle of a story.</LD>
<LD>   In California, 46,000 youngsters--10% of kindergarten-age
children--skip kindergarten each year because the law doesn't make
education compulsory until age 6.</LD>
<TE>   First-graders who don't go to kindergarten are typically behind
their peers in their academic and social development, and are more
likely to flunk a grade in elementary school, educators say.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say that many of the late-starters are the children of
new immigrant families who are unfamiliar with the U.S. education
system and have trouble navigating school district bureaucracies.
Some parents' work schedules don't mesh with their children's class
times.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, the students don't enroll in kindergarten,
and "they have trouble adjusting, not just academically, but
socially," in first grade, Coleman said. Down the hall from her
class, in Gail Lonseth's kindergarten class, you can see what they
missed. Lonseth starts drilling her students as soon as they settle
into her classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The name is Y and the sound is yak, yak, yak!" the children call
out in unison. "The name is S and the sound is sssss!"</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, making kindergarten mandatory costs money.
Analysts at the state Department of Finance estimated that requiring
all 5-year-olds to go could cost state and local agencies an extra
$460 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say kindergarten is so important that it should be
extended from half a day to a full school day. But that, too, would
be expensive, as districts would have to double their kindergarten
classroom space.</TE>
<TE>   Those financial realities, at a time when the state is staring at
a $27-billion budget shortfall, have led state legislators to temper
their calls for kindergarten reform.</TE>
<TE>   A bill now before Gov. Gray Davis, AB 634, originally was intended
to make kindergarten compulsory for all 5-year-olds. But now the
bill, which was introduced by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City), would require only that children who have already attended for
more than 30 days continue to attend kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   "Compulsory, full-day kindergarten is the lost soul of public
education," said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley.
"It's always been beneath the radar."</TE>
<TE>   But Fuller said that a statewide push for universal preschool
could prompt kindergarten reform. Last month, a Los Angeles County
commission resolved to spend $100 million in tobacco tax money on a
massive preschool program. And in July, the Los Angeles Unified
School District's Board of Education voted to add an $80-million
early childhood education program to a November ballot issue.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of mandatory full-day kindergarten are using many of
the same arguments that preschool advocates have used: For many
single-parent families and families with two working parents,
half-day kindergarten is not an option. And studies show that
children who go to full-day kindergarten do better academically.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids that go to full-day kindergarten are about three months
ahead in their cognitive development than kids who go to half-day,"
Fuller said. "They're doing things like identifying letters and
learning their numbers."</TE>
<TE>   At Cienega Elementary in West Los Angeles, Principal Lynn Brown
said of half-day classes, "I just don't think it's adequate. We need
to be able to give them more than what we give them now."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that many parents don't realize how
important kindergarten is.</TE>
<TE>   At Forty-Ninth Street Elementary, Principal Georgina Munoz said
she can't help but notice that a number of children come to her
school without having gone to preschool or kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a lack of information on the part of the families,"
she said. "Maybe they don't know how important it is for their kids
to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Munoz said that 92% of her students are Latino, and of those, only
20% are fluent in English. The bulk of those students who are still
learning English are in the lower elementary grades; kindergarten is
especially important for those immigrant children.</TE>
<TE>   With the state's new academic standards, kindergarten is far more
rigorous than it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "The pacing is very quick--we don't have a second to spare,"
Lonseth said.</TE>
<TE>   She said although it is challenging to cram in enough information
in three or four hours, she doesn't see how any child could succeed
without such preparation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible for them to do well in first grade without
kindergarten," she said. "They just have to make kindergarten
mandatory."</TE>

<HD>County OKs 25% Cut in Subsidies for Health Clinics</HD>
<DH>Budget: Dozens will be eliminated from 'public-private
partnership' program. Some fear strain on emergency rooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS and DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Departing from a plan touted seven years ago as the cure for Los
Angeles County's ailing health-care system, county officials on
Tuesday approved a 25% cut in the government's $60-million
"public-private partnership" program that subsidizes the county's
private clinics.</LD>
<LD>   For a county that has already substantially reduced services to
address a budget deficit expected to reach $800 million within three
years, the cuts represent a further fraying of a "safety net" health
system that is supposed to serve the poor and uninsured.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, public attention has been focused on the closure
of 11 clinics run directly by the county. Those closures were
described by county officials as sensible, if unpopular, reductions
to a bloated and inefficient health-care delivery system.</LD>
<TE>   But they were only part of a $150-million cost-reduction plan, and
now $12.5 million in cuts to public-private partnerships are taking
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Effectively made in June through budget reductions and formalized
Tuesday, these latest cuts are doubly painful because they appear to
undermine the health-care model adopted by the county in 1996 after
its last health-care crisis. The five-year trial program adopted that
year cut some services but relied heavily on public-private
partnerships to provide quality ambulatory care for the poor and
uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the complaints of a member of the public who
criticized the cuts during Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting,
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky acknowledged the change in approach. But,
Yaroslavsky added: "There's nowhere else for us to turn."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Tuesday's vote, the private clinics were feeling the
domino effect of the broader crisis.</TE>
<TE>   At Clinica Para Las Americas in the Pico-Union section of Los
Angeles, Executive Director Linda Dacon handed out pink slips to
seven employees earlier this week because her agency's county
contract wasn't renewed.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 private clinic sites--a third of which had been
funded--have been eliminated from the program. And of the 98 sites
that will still receive public-private partnership funds, about half
got less than last year, and the other half were awarded the same
level.</TE>
<TE>   The clinics eliminated or cut are scrambling to make up for the
shortfall. Some are trying to apply for foundation grants; others are
debating whether to charge indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   Of the facilities that remain open, some private clinics are
reducing hours, seeing fewer new patients and in some cases laying
off workers.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of services at the private clinics will, some fear,
create a new problem further down the road, such as new stress on
emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Para Las Americas. Last year, the organization
received $525,000 to see about 67,000 indigent patients. The agency
had operated six days a week for a total of 57 hours. With the cuts,
it is contemplating staying open just three days a week for a total
of 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected to get cut but not eliminated," Dacon said. "How do I
pick and choose who gets an appointment? That's what wakes me up at 3
in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   As they look for a more effective master plan to provide health
care to the county's 3 million uninsured, county officials are
negotiating with state and federal health officials for a
$350-million bailout.</TE>
<TE>   If no relief comes, the health services department could close
more county facilities in October. At that point, officials say,
public money for private clinics could disappear altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "These cuts are already making it more difficult for children to
get immunizations, go to school and be productive workers," said
Mandy Johnson, chief executive of Community Clinic Assn. of Los
Angeles, which represents the private clinics.</TE>
<TE>   County health department officials decided which clinics to fund
using criteria that included federal accreditation, diversified
sources of funding, comprehensiveness of services and location.</TE>
<TE>   The clinics that fared better were those designated "strategic
partners." Also funded were "traditional partners"--those that
showed, among other things, stability and met other criteria, such as
providing linguistic services and operating in areas where the county
needs them.</TE>
<TE>   Still, clinics that lost their contracts, such as Para Las
Americas--whose public-private partnership funds made up 61% of its
budget--were not bad operations, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, when we have to leverage every dollar we have, we
needed to get to the agencies that had a more diversified funding
base," said Ingrid Lamirault, acting director of the office of
ambulatory care.</TE>
<TE>   The private clinics are operating in a health-care system
struggling to provide service to many uninsured and poor patients.
Private clinics increasingly have been called on to help as the
county curtails public services.</TE>
<TE>   They are spread out all over the county, but on the Eastside, the
cuts in public-private partnership funds come sandwiched between the
closure of several clinics earlier this year and the looming closure
of a community institution.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the financially troubled Community Health
Foundation closed the last two in a network of 13 clinics that once
took in several hundred thousand patients each year in east and
southeast Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller Plaza Community Center closed its two locations on the
Eastside and in Alhambra even before finding out what kinds of cuts
it would face.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an excruciating decision to close our [clinics], and we
did it because that was the only way to protect our [other]
services," said Patricia Costales, Plaza's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   And in the next round of cuts, the Edward R. Roybal Comprehensive
Health Center is one of the county's facilities recommended for
closure.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working very hard to keep the East L.A. clinic open," said
Terry A. Bonecutter, president of QueensCare Family Clinics, a county
strategic partner whose funds were cut from $7.4 million to $4.7
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some leaders say the cuts in public-private partnership funding
adds to the overall decline in the availability of health care for
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not even what it's doing to our agency; it's what it's doing
to the community," said Barbara Kappos, director of Bienvenidos
Family Services on the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the clinics are hoping for help from foundations, but many
of those institutions structure their grants to favor innovative
programs as opposed to filling in for government cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a role to play, but it isn't to take up the slack
where the public sector has made their cuts in direct services," said
Alicia Lara, vice president of programs for the California Endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Patients affected by the cuts can get information by calling the
county's hotline: (800) 427-8700.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Die-Off Reignites Feud Over Klamath River Water</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Critics claim diversion for agriculture has
killed thousands of salmon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of salmon have died in the Klamath River in Northern
California since last week, raising anew questions of whether the
federal government is diverting too much water to farmers at the
expense of fish.</LD>
<LD>   "There's so many dead fish around and only so many hours in the
day to count them," said David Hillemeier, a fisheries biologist with
the Yurok Indian tribe. "There's some sick ones, some have sunk to
the bottom of the river, and some have washed up. Every few feet
there's a dead salmon, for as long as you can see."</LD>
<LD>   At least 1,500 have been counted so far, with at least a few
thousand to go, according to Paul Wertz, an information officer with
the California Department of Fish and Game.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the dead fish are either wild or hatchery-raised 15- to
20-pound adult chinook salmon that in recent weeks have left the
Pacific Ocean to migrate up the Klamath and reproduce. Last year, the
Department of Fish and Game estimated that 189,214 chinook--also
known as king salmon--entered the Klamath in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Wertz said that biologists have also found some dead steelhead and
federally endangered coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials suspect that the fish are being killed by "gill
rot," an affliction that prevents the salmon from breathing. The rot
is probably caused by several factors, including high water
temperatures and too many fish crowded together, both conditions
caused by low flows.</TE>
<TE>   "The biologists told me that many of these dead fish are very
bright and healthy looking, except for the part about them being
dead," Wertz said. "The condition of the gills was startling to the
biologists."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with both state and federal agencies said the die-off is
the largest in the region in recent years. The kill is also the
latest chapter in a controversy over how much water should be left in
the Klamath River and its tributaries, and how much diverted to
farmers in the Klamath Basin, located on the Oregon-California
border.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, much of the farmers' usual allotment was reduced to
supply more water to salmon, which inhabit the 190 miles of the
Klamath River below Iron Gate Dam.</TE>
<TE>   Following an outcry by basin residents--who accused the government
of favoring fish over people--the opposite occurred this year. The
farmers got their full allotment of water, while flows in the Klamath
were reduced this summer by 20% to 30% of what they were in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Angry commercial fishermen and environmentalists argue that the
lower flows are to blame for the die-off. "It's a disaster that
didn't have to happen; it was created by government policy that for
decades has ignored the lower river and confiscated all the water for
farmers," said Glen Spain, Northwest regional director of the Pacific
Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, which represents the
commercial fishing industry.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCracken, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, said
that the agency is releasing flows according to guidelines spelled
out by the National Marines Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   "No one likes to see anything like this happen," he said. "But
this was a dry year, and people need to recognize that flows out of
Upper Klamath Lake would probably exacerbate the problem because ...
the water in that lake is very warm" and the fish need cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how much flow is needed to support salmon and other fish
in the Klamath has been the subject of intense debate.</TE>
<TE>   Guidelines set by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2001
were criticized as lacking sound scientific basis by the National
Academy of Sciences, which is working on its own report on what flow
levels should be.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every major tributary that runs into the Klamath--most
notably the Trinity River--is depleted by diversions, mostly for
agriculture. Although the Klamath Basin diversions have received most
of the attention, officials suggest the larger problem is that too
little water from throughout the watershed is being allowed to reach
the sea.</TE>

<DH>Agriculture: Sale of development rights in Central Valley
creates a barrier against sprawl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADERA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>His family had worked the fields west of this broiling Central Valley
town for nearly a century. But when Denis Prosperi tried to sell a
small piece of his sprawling ranch to a home builder, angry neighbors
rose against his plan to bust their expanse of wine vineyards and
almond orchards.</LD>
<LD>   "I never dreamed my neighbors wouldn't be ecstatic about the sale,
because [it would] increase their land values," Prosperi, 48, said
recently, sipping a chilled white wine made from his Muscat grapes.
"But they weren't. That's the trouble with farmers, they fall in love
with the dirt."</LD>
<LD>   Four years later, Prosperi has found a different way to pay for
new irrigation and pest-resistant grapevines for his 640-acre ranch.
Instead of selling any of his land, he has joined his critics in a
rare compact to save forever some of the best cropland in the most
productive farm region in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Prosperi and six of his neighbors last week sold development
rights that would have allowed the housing tracts of Madera to extend
onto their dusty farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million deal with the American Farmland Trust is the core
of a four-mile-long "farmland security perimeter" on Madera's western
flank. It is intended to block urban construction on the protected
properties and push another 42,000 acres beyond the reach of city
utilities and a municipal planning boundary. That is an
eight-mile-square expanse of grapes, alfalfa and dairy land in the
heart of the Central Valley protected from development.</TE>
<TE>   The farmland trust, the nation's largest group formed to save
agricultural land, believes such easements--walling off premium
cropland from cities--are the best hope for preserving farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The trust hopes to slow the advance of builders, who are paving
over 50,000 acres of crop and grazing land annually, according to
state reports. About one-fifth of that lost farmland is in the
fertile Central Valley, where explosive growth is expected to triple
the population to 12 million by 2040.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, trust Director John McCaull said, is to use an
unprecedented flow of about $150 million in state and federal money
over six years to shift growth away from the valley's most fertile
land on the alluvial plain west of the Sierra Nevada range.</TE>
<TE>   McCaull figures the money can buy easements on about 50,000 acres
of prime farmland and cut off another 500,000 acres from development
by pushing growth onto hilly, rocky, salty or poorly drained tracts.
That 550,000 acres compares with a total of 6.7 million acres of
cropland in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's done in a strategic manner, I think it could multiply the
effect 10 times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With creation of the Madera preserve, farmers put aside their
traditional distrust of government--and of dislike for limits on
their property rights--to shape their own destiny. They retained
ownership of their farms, but sold away any future right to build
housing tracts, stores or office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The farmland trust describes the Madera deal as the first in the
nation where farmers have initiated a farmland "barrier." Elsewhere,
farmland trusts have purchased parcels, but not all at once and never
at the instigation of farmers acting collectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this is unique," the farmland trust's Greg Kirkpatrick
said. "And it wouldn't have come together if farmers ... hadn't
really driven the process."</TE>
<TE>   The farmland trust sees the support of farmers and local
governments to form the buffers as essential in saving one of the
state's largest industries. Crops are worth $30 billion a year, and
farm-related businesses employ one of every 10 workers in California.
The value of Central Valley crops is greater than those from any
other farm region in the world, federal agriculture officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The threat to that industry is clear in Madera County, where the
population surged by 40% last decade. With a typical household income
of just $31,000 a year, Madera County officials generally have
welcomed new industry and upscale housing tracts.</TE>
<TE>   But, at the urging of Prosperi and his neighbors, Madera officials
pulled back the city's legal growth boundary and rezoned the land
strictly for agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   At stake, the farmers argued, was a way of life. With no
replacement industry in sight to support the region, they worried
their homesteads would become yet another suburban housing tract.
Agricultural analysts also question the wisdom of shrinking the vast
tracts that help assure America's food self-sufficiency.</TE>
<TE>   "Madera is a success story," the trust's McCaull said. "We really
have a lot of interest in easements [by farmers and governments] up
and down the valley, especially in some of the smaller communities
that haven't yet gone down the urban path."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of development rights are especially popular with farmers,
hurt by a steep decline in crop prices. In Madera, payment for
easements ranged from $3,300 an acre to $16,000 for property adjacent
to the city. The payments are large enough to allow farmers to stay
in business or to retire without selling the family farm to
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Madera's new buffer is one of five perimeters the trust hopes to
help set up in farm towns along a 150-mile stretch of the vast valley
floor--at Delhi near Turlock, at Kingsburg near Fresno, and at
Hughson and Riverbank near Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, the Yolo Land Trust is doing much the same on a
three-by-five-mile swath of tomatoes, corn, melons and winter wheat
between Davis and Woodland. It's buying easements on 465 farm acres,
and already owns them on nearly 500 acres nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Without a powerful strategy for preservation, analysts have warned
it's a matter of time before one city stretches virtually
uninterrupted along California 99, from Bakersfield to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Projections literally show a linear city along the Highway 99
corridor," said Eric Vink, who oversees the state Farmland
Conservancy Program. "But the valley is 50 miles wide, so the real
question is how far out will that growth radiate."</TE>
<TE>   California land trusts have been purchasing easements for two
decades, since the Marin Agricultural Trust pioneered the approach in
the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Today, trusts in 19 of the state's 58 counties own farm easements
with 137,000 total acres. But that's only 0.5% of the 27 million
acres of crop and grazing land statewide, said Alvin D. Sokolow, a
public policy specialist at UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Those easements are concentrated in coastal counties, particularly
Marin, Sonoma and Monterey. They mostly protect 111,500 acres of
grazing land. Cropland easements total just 25,500 acres statewide,
Sokolow said.</TE>
<TE>   And in the bountiful Central Valley, where 250 different crops are
grown, only Yolo County has protected more than 1,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Tulare, Fresno, Kern, Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin are among
the most productive farm counties in the U.S., but none has more than
a few hundred crop acres protected by easements. "In California, it's
a struggle to get an effective program up and going," Sokolow said.</TE>
<TE>   Protections also had been lacking in Madera, within easy commuter
reach of Fresno, 12 miles south on California 99. A huge housing
project southeast of the city (population 47,000) had been in the
works for years, until troubling questions on water supply and an
attorney general's lawsuit stopped it.</TE>
<TE>   So in 1998, Prosperi thought it made sense for the city to move
west onto 40 of his acres. A developer had offered $22,500 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   But 18 neighbors signed a petition opposing Prosperi's project, as
did owners at an adjacent industrial park, who worried that new
homeowners would complain about their plants.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime farm owner Dorothy Campbell was deadly serious when she
said Prosperi's plans gave her high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime member of the American Farmland Trust, Campbell called
regional representative Kirkpatrick in Visalia. "When I looked at the
situation with Dorothy, I was pretty disillusioned," Kirkpatrick
said. "If Denis had wanted to move ahead, he had all the rights.
There was no way to stop him."</TE>
<TE>   The city's main sewer line was already at Prosperi's property
line, and growth plans included at least some of his land. So they
spoke with Prosperi too.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised with these people; I knew their
grandfathers," said Prosperi, a stocky, balding 45-year-old. "And
when you're 80 years old, you won't care how much money you have in
the bank. You'll want your neighbors to like you ... to come to your
funeral."</TE>
<TE>   Prosperi bent to his neighbors' wishes, especially when
Kirkpatrick explained that, through cash and tax breaks, the farmer
would receive about $16,000 an acre for his development rights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, all of the neighbors had to agree to sell their development
rights to preserve the belt of farms on Madera's west side.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just a small window of opportunity to do this, because
we still had all the old people alive who valued farmland and their
way of life," Prosperi said. "We crawled through that window."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the farmers of west Madera are planning not only for
tomorrow, but for a future in which their grandchildren will still
have the option of rising at dawn to prune vines, harvest crops and
taking in the musty, sweet smell of ripening grapes.</TE>
<TE>   One recent dawn, as always, 78-year-old Enzo Petrucci rose early
to lead farmhands into his vineyards for harvest. He worked until
early afternoon. After school, his grandson, Michael Angell, 7, did a
little picking.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is something we can make work for a long time,"
Michael's father, Matt Angell, said. "I think we've truly turned a
corner."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill to Aid Utilities</HD>
<DH>Power: The state will hand the task of purchasing
electricity back to Edison, PG&amp;E.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Tuesday to speed the recovery of two
private utilities badly wounded by the electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Of a dozen energy-related bills enacted, AB 57 by Assemblyman
Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles) will most strongly shape California's
electrical system over the coming year. It tries to get Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric back in the business of
buying electricity for their 24 million customers.</LD>
<LD>   The state itself has been buying electricity for utilities for
more than a year. But the emergency law that put the state in that
unprecedented job expires at the end of this year.</LD>
<TE>   With PG&amp;E in bankruptcy and Edison still in debt, neither utility
is well situated to buy power again. Wright's legislation tries to
assure Wall Street lenders that the utilities will be able to pay
their bills and therefore deserve investment grade status. It does so
by automatically triggering rate hikes if the utilities' costs
outstrip revenue by more than 5%. Conversely, should costs fall more
than 5%, so would rates.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins to put confidence back in the financial community that
California will not repeat the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001," said
Robert Foster, president of Southern California Edison. Without the
new law, he said, it would be "virtually impossible" for Edison to
begin buying electricity again.</TE>
<TE>   Wright's bill also tries to correct what in hindsight stands out
as a significant cause of the utilities' trouble in 2000 and 2001--a
lack of long-term power contracts--by requiring the Public Utilities
Commission to review contracts before they are signed.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed AB 58 by Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder
Creek) to encourage use of solar energy by giving homeowners and
businesses credit for surplus electricity pumped from their solar
panels into the electrical grid.</TE>
<TE>   Another bill signed by the governor, SB 772 by Sen. Debra Bowen
(D-Marina del Rey), requires Internet service providers to give
customers 30 days' notice before they cut off service. Thousands of
people abruptly lost service in 2001 when Excite@Home Corp. and
NorthPoint Communications shut down without warning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time you have the right to know well before you're
going to lose your Internet service," Bowen said.</TE>
<TE>   Working his way through the remaining 400 bills sent to him by the
Legislature, the governor also enacted laws aimed at protecting
domestic violence victims.</TE>
<TE>   One of those bills, SB 1320 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
makes it easier to convict stalkers by establishing a pattern with
only two incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, meanwhile, postponed a fund-raiser scheduled for Tuesday in
Palo Alto, to be hosted by the Silicon Valley political group
Technology Network. Campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the
decision to put off the event until October had nothing to do with

<HD>Laborers Underpaid, Suit Says</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Advocates say Santa Paula contractor cheated
guest farm workers from Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farm worker advocates filed suit Tuesday against a Santa Paula labor
contractor, alleging that he failed to fully pay foreign workers
brought to Ventura County earlier this year under a controversial
federal program designed to offset labor shortages.</LD>
<LD>   In what was believed to be the first large-scale use of the guest
worker program in California agriculture, labor broker Ralph De Leon
received permission from the federal government to recruit 38 Mexican
laborers to pick lemons from February to April in the county's citrus
heartland.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 10 of those laborers in Ventura
County Superior Court, accuses De Leon of failing to compensate
workers for the hours spent traveling to and from job sites and for
the time spent waiting at those locations to begin harvesting, as
required by state law.</LD>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that De Leon failed to properly pay
overtime, frequently neglected to provide rest periods and lunch
breaks and failed to reimburse some workers for expenses incurred
traveling to and from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But proponents of the guest worker program suggest that the suit
could be aimed at torpedoing efforts by California growers to bring
in more foreign workers.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks reimbursement for unpaid wages and other
restitution totaling about $250,000, said Oxnard attorney Hector
Martinez, whose poverty law firm, California Rural Legal Assistance,
is spearheading the legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "There are substantial abuses that have taken place," said
Martinez, adding that the lawsuit is not an attack on the guest
worker program but an attempt to ensure that the workers are paid
what they are owed under California law and the terms of their
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically," he said, "we're talking about promises made to these
workers that should have been kept."</TE>
<TE>   De Leon, whose Servicios Agricolas Mexicanos supplies workers to
growers across the United States, could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the 25-year veteran of the labor contracting business said in
a recent interview that he turned to the guest worker program after
being unable to find enough domestic pickers to work Ventura County's
citrus harvest.</TE>
<TE>   The federal program, established under the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986, allows agricultural producers to temporarily tap
foreign workers when domestic laborers are unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   California growers say that legal immigrants are increasingly
leaving the fields for more stable jobs. As a result, the statewide
farm labor force--500,000 workers during peak season--is swelling
with illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   As required by the federal government, De Leon said he first
posted the job openings with state employment offices but found few
takers. He then traveled to Mexico to recruit workers and to bring
them back to Ventura County under what are known as H-2A visas.</TE>
<TE>   Once they arrived, De Leon said, he provided them with housing,
three meals a day and transportation to and from job sites. And while
workers were guaranteed to earn at least $7.56 an hour, De Leon said
most averaged $9 to $10 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the laborers worked the entire length of the contract,
which ended April 19.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon said he lost $3,000 in what he called a pilot project
aimed at determining whether the program could work for California
growers.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was a price he was willing to pay, however, to find a
solution to the state's farm labor shortage and to end the
exploitation and abuse of illegal immigrants seeking work in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to provide an option to those workers who are risking
their lives crossing the border and who come here only to live in
deplorable conditions," De Leon said in May.</TE>
<TE>   While unfamiliar with specifics of the lawsuit, farm industry
attorney Rob Roy said he believes the suit may be motivated, in part,
by a push to undermine growers' efforts to expand the guest worker
program.</TE>
<TE>   Roy, president of the Ventura County Agricultural Assn., said that
California Rural Legal Assistance and other advocacy groups have made
clear their disdain for the employment program.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [De Leon] engaged in this H-2A program in good faith and
in an effort to demonstrate that someone could properly operate this
program and bring these workers out of the shadows," Roy said. "And
his thanks for that is a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   California Rural Legal Assistance attorneys maintain that the
lawsuit was not motivated in any way by the larger issues facing the
future of the federal program. Martinez said the lawsuit focuses
mostly on wage and hour issues on behalf of 10 named plaintiffs and
the 28 other workers recruited by De Leon who might also have been
underpaid.</TE>
<TE>   It also raises other issues, ranging from whether the laborers
were given all the work they were promised to whether they were
unfairly saddled with tough production standards.</TE>
<TE>   Other farm worker advocates, unconnected to the lawsuit, said that
the legal action underscores possible flaws in the employment
program.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems described in the lawsuit are emblematic of the
problems experienced elsewhere under the guest worker program," said
Bruce Goldstein, co-executive director of the Farmworker Justice Fund
in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 foreign farm workers are admitted to the United
States each year through the federal guest worker program, with most
working in sugar cane fields in Florida and tobacco farms in North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Neither federal nor state labor officials keep track of how many
agricultural guest workers come to California each year, but
officials believe it is no more than a few hundred, with most brought
in to tend livestock on sheep ranches.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein said it is unsettling to him that this first major use
of the program in California agriculture has resulted in litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are abuses all over in agricultural employment," Goldstein
said, "but in some ways the guest workers are the most vulnerable."</TE>

<HD>Ban on 'Sniper' Rifles Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanding its citywide ban on assault weapons, the Los Angeles City
Council took a step Tuesday to outlaw the sale and civilian
possession of the .50-caliber rifles used by SWAT units and the
military.</LD>
<LD>   Although council members could not cite any crimes committed in
L.A. involving the so-called "sniper" rifles, they said their
unanimous action Tuesday--ordering legal language to outlaw the
weapons--would prevent attacks on people and the city's
infrastructure.</LD>
<LD>   A state Assembly committee considered a similar statewide ban last
spring but did not approve it.</LD>
<TE>   At Tuesday's council meeting, two gun-rights advocates and the
developer of a .50-caliber model argued that banning the
long-distance rifles restricts the 2nd Amendment rights of
law-abiding target shooters. A dozen speakers and the Los Angeles
Police Department supported the gun ban.</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Agency Outlines Plan to Protect Wetlands</HD>
<DH>Environment: The tardy proposal would shield vernal pools
in California and Oregon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a year after a federal judge ordered them to do it,
officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday proposed a
protection plan for 1.7 million acres across California and southern
Oregon that are dotted with seasonal wetlands inhabited by 15 species
of rare springtime wildflowers and crustaceans.</LD>
<LD>   Targeting 36 California counties stretching from Siskiyou south to
Riverside, the "critical habitat" plan would create protected zones
around tiny vernal pools, shielding them from potentially destructive
commercial or agricultural activity.</LD>
<LD>   Vernal pools are small, shallow bodies of water that appear
annually in rainy seasons, quickly filling with tiny fairy shrimp and
concentric rings of colorful native wildflowers. The main threat to
their existence is loss of habitat, according to federal wildlife
officials.</LD>
<TE>   "They are the most charming little habitats you'd ever want to
see," said Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Jim Nickles. "As soon
as the rainy season begins in California, what would appear to be
lifeless hills and plains suddenly bloom into this incredible array
of color."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed acreage includes a large swath where a new University
of California campus is supposed to be built in the Sierra foothills
east of Merced. But federal and university officials said they did
not think that the proposal would interfere with construction.</TE>
<TE>   Authorized by the federal Endangered Species Act, critical habitat
designations often provoke opposition because they can restrict
development on federal lands--and property where federal funds are
used. Defenders say it is necessary for the recovery of threatened
animals and plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Butte Environmental Council in Chico, which sued the Fish and
Wildlife Service to set aside critical habitat for four species of
endangered fairy shrimp, won a court order in February 2001 forcing
the designation of critical habitat within six months. In July 2001,
the service won a yearlong extension by agreeing to include habitat
for 11 wildflowers as well. The day before the plan was due this
August, federal officials filed another request for an extension
through next year.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental council sought a contempt order Monday against
Fish and Wildlife officials, seeking to have them jailed and fined,
to stop them from approving construction in possible critical habitat
areas. The judge is expected to rule in a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "The agency is thumbing their nose at the court's order," said
Neil Levine, an attorney with Earthjustice, a national nonprofit
group that is providing legal counsel to the small Chico-based
council.</TE>
<TE>   Levine and others said the agency's delays were part of deliberate
stalling tactics by the Bush administration on endangered species
protection. "It's sort of outrageous how this law-and-order
administration chooses to disobey a court order," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife officials acknowledged they had missed deadlines
set by U.S. District Judge William Shubb, but said it had nothing to
do with politics.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento field supervisor Wayne White said the delay was
unavoidable because of a huge backlog of critical habitat work,
limited staffing and the detailed mapping necessary to identify areas
for protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Designating critical habitat for 15 different species throughout
a large area of California is not something you do with a crayon," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   White said he knew he could be held in contempt and jailed, but
that his staff was close to reaching an agreement with the
environmental group that could give them until next summer to
complete required public hearings and economic analysis.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the Fish and Wildlife Service can decide that the economic
burden of critical habitat outweighs environmental benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of farmers and developers said Tuesday that
because they receive federal money for crops, road building and other
projects, the critical habitat designation could apply to private
lands.</TE>
<TE>   The plan could stop badly needed housing development, prevent
farmers from planting new types of crops, and cost millions of
dollars in additional studies and mitigation, according to David
Smith, general counsel for the Building Industry Assn. of Southern
California, and the director of natural resources for the Farm Bureau
Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said the proposed vernal pool designation was
vital. "We've already lost 90% of our wetlands in California, and
what remains is very precious," said Barbara Vlamis, executive
director of the group that brought the suit.</TE>

<LD>A man who kidnapped his former girlfriend in Northridge released her
unharmed, then shot himself to death Tuesday in a Buena Park motel
room surrounded by police, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Henry Floyd Jr., 35, of Fullerton was found dead by officers about
6:30 a.m. after several hours of negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say Floyd, armed with a handgun, forced 27-year-old
Nacole Richardson into his car Monday after an argument and scuffle
outside a medical equipment manufacturer where she worked.</LD>
<TE>   Private security officers who tried to stop the abduction reported
hearing a gunshot coming from inside Floyd's Honda Accord.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd had threatened Richardson before the abduction, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A Buena Park patrol officer spotted Floyd's car about 11:40 p.m.
Monday parked outside the Crescent Motel on Beach Boulevard. Police
surrounded the room, then called Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of negotiations, Richardson was released unharmed,
although Floyd remained barricaded inside, police said.</TE>
<TE>   When SWAT officers entered the room, they found Floyd dead of an
apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident is being
investigated by Buena Park and Los Angeles police.</TE>

<HD>Forget the Saddam Offensive--Focus on Our Defenseless Ports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a clear day, and as my plane approached LAX, I looked out at
the humongous Los Angeles-Long Beach port that handles more than</LD>
<LD>   4 million cargo containers and 500,000 cruise ship passengers a
year.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it was a selfish concern, but given the national drumbeat
for war, a question about my immediate well-being came to mind.</LD>
<TE>   Who should I be more afraid of?</TE>
<TE>   A) A madman thousands of miles away in Iraq, or,</TE>
<TE>   B) One of the world's 70,000 suspected terrorists coming through
the port with some horrible weapon and launching an attack in our own
backyard?</TE>
<TE>   It's not even close.</TE>
<TE>   A Sunday story by my colleague Josh Meyer quoted federal sources
saying that an unknown number of Al Qaeda-trained soldiers have been
trying to infiltrate the United States to launch "spectacular"
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Saddam I'm not losing sleep over. But these guys, wherever they
might be, scare the devil out of me.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after flying over the port, I went sailing in the Long
Beach Harbor. I'm out there on my $800 rust bucket, staring up at the
big tankers anchored offshore, and guess what. There are roughly 6
million different ways for somebody to sneak in and try something.</TE>
<TE>   While wheezing around out there, I saw a Coast Guard boat with a
mounted M-60 rifle. Very nice to see our boys in action, but I was
reminded of the National Guard troops who were sent into airports
after Sept. 11 to make us feel better about flying, even as bags were
being loaded unexamined onto planes.</TE>
<TE>   We're doing a better job than ever of screening cargo shipments
from overseas, but only about 6% or 7% of what's unloaded in American
ports is inspected by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I wake up every morning thinking how lucky we are that nothing
has happened," says Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard commander
who's with the Council on Foreign Relations. Flynn believes the
nation's ports are extremely vulnerable, and that an attack on the
L.A. Harbor could stagger the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   This being the case, a question comes to mind.</TE>
<TE>   Why on Earth are we directing the nation's resources,
conversation, manpower and energy toward Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat to our security in the new world isn't Saddam's
potential to build a nuclear weapon in the next six or seven years.
It's some fanatic slipping into this country in the next six or seven
minutes, while we're all waving flags and singing hymns. If you were
a terrorist who wanted to strike in the U.S., wouldn't you prefer
that we were distracted in Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   It's not a stretch to imagine an American future with dirty bombs
blowing up our harbors. It's not beyond the pale to imagine suicide
bombers at sporting events and nerve gas attacks in subway stations.</TE>
<TE>   And yet there has been precious little discussion about whether an
attack on Iraq lowers or raises those risks.</TE>
<TE>   Republican, Democrat, House, Senate--scarcely a whimper. All but a
few lonely outcasts are standing at attention as President Bush, who
often sounds like a second-stringer on the high school debate team,
keeps repeating the words "regime change" and mispronouncing nuclear.</TE>
<TE>   If we're going to war to prevent a nuclear holocaust, shouldn't we
at least all know how to pronounce it? It ain't nukular, George.
Trust me on this.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is dragging, painful budget cuts looming, and
virtually no one in Congress has batted an eye over an estimated cost
of $50 billion to $150 billion to blow Saddam out of his shoes and
knock his beret into Iran. (We've spent less than $100 million since
Sept. 11 on security at the nation's 361 ports of entry.)</TE>
<TE>   All those billions of dollars for a war that could plunge the
Middle East into further turmoil and spawn hundreds of thousands more
anti-U.S. terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the marching in the streets? The angry letters? Have we
forgotten about the 1st Amendment?</TE>
<TE>   I swear everyone's on medication. It's all $2 flags and patriotic
geegaws at the drugstore checkout counter. There's a national
soundtrack for war--the daily bugle calls from Washington, the vapid
yammering of pundits and five-star choreographers on cable news--and
it's working like a mass narcotic.</TE>
<TE>   I called Washington to talk to the one congressman who, more than
anyone, has refused to drink the Kool-Aid. Rep. Dennis Kucinich
(D-Ohio) told me I've got it wrong, and insisted the public is not on
board.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what the polls say. The people in my district are
saying, 'Look, I can't afford the cost of prescription drugs. What's
my government doing about this?' " Kucinich said. "There's a
disconnect between Washington and the reality people live with every
day. Saddam Hussein is not a threat to this country, but our sagging
market is."</TE>
<TE>   Kucinich thinks politicos are too busy mugging on TV to listen to
the people they represent.</TE>
<TE>   Would it be smarter to seal our transit hubs and cover the rest of
our turf than to send tens of thousands of troops overseas? Of course
it would be. But it would be even smarter, Kucinich says, to figure
out how we got to the point where people want to do us in.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of joining the war cry, he says, our leaders ought to be
asking why we snubbed Kyoto, why we refuse to embrace alternative
energy, why we snub the international criminal court, why we're
inclined to trample the U.N. charter, and why our government is
willing to be "a hired gun for the oil industry."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a scenario to consider, Kucinich said. What if some country
were to ignore international law, insist on a regime change and send
its military to the U.S. to assassinate our leader. Then, to finance
the operation, they started selling off our resources on the
international market.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's really chilling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's chilling is that the entire military and half the Guard
could be bogged down for years in the Middle East. I'll try my best
to cover our flank while they're away, but I don't know how long I
can hold off 70,000 terrorists with a 22-foot sailboat.</TE>

<HD>Former Investment Advisor Agrees to Repay $3 Million in
Deal With SEC</HD>
<DH>Finance: The Camarillo man, whose clients included seniors
and professional ballplayers, is accused of bilking them out of
nearly $18 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former investment advisor accused of bilking professional athletes
and seniors out of nearly $18 million has agreed to pay some of it
back.</LD>
<LD>   Donald D. Lukens, 51, who kept company with NFL and NBA stars
while operating from his high-rise office in Oxnard, will pay back
$3.27 million to investors and more than $1 million in interest and
penalties, said Securities and Exchange Commission officials, who had
filed a civil complaint against him.</LD>
<LD>   "We are dealing with a person that has abused trust and is guilty
of greed," said Cheryl J. Scarboro of the commission's enforcement
division. "He engaged in acts that defrauded at least 100 people of
their money. He misappropriated large amounts of funds and made
misrepresentations about the use of the proceeds and the risk
involved."</LD>
<TE>   In October, Lukens of Camarillo was accused in the complaint of
operating an elaborate investment scheme that entangled friends from
his days growing up in Oxnard, neighbors, a pastor and a long list of
professional athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Former National Football League running back and Hall of Fame
member Eric Dickerson lost more than $1 million in an investment deal
with Lukens, the SEC said. Others who invested with Lukens are Tampa
Bay Buccaneer defensive end Simeon Rice, Denver Broncos receiver
Shannon Sharpe and National Basketball Assn. players Bryon Russell
and Keith Van Horn, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   "Financial planning is the wild, wild west when it comes to the
potential for excess," said NFL player representative Leigh
Steinberg. "Nothing in the collegiate experience prepares
[professional athletes] for the dangers inherent in a $15-million
signing bonus."</TE>
<TE>   But athletes with money to burn were not the only victims,
officials said. Among those who lost money is John Silva, an Oxnard
resident and high school friend of Lukens who entrusted Lukens with
$170,000 of an inherited life insurance policy. He never saw a return
on the investment, which was his life savings, said Brian Osborne,
Silva's Oxnard-based attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm curious about where he is going to get the money from,"
Osborne said when told of the agreement reached between Lukens and
the SEC. "He said he would make a safe investment, and he lost it
all." Under the terms of the agreement, Lukens will be barred from
working as a licensed securities broker or in the investment
industry, Scarboro said. Lukens also will not be allowed to declare
bankruptcy to escape his debt.</TE>
<TE>   Lukens, who operated without an attorney in his most recent
dealings with the SEC, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He filed for protection from creditors in 2001, declaring assets
of $1 million and debts of more than $47 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Lukens case is the second in three months to focus on a
Ventura County resident.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Larry Curtis Waltz of Ventura admitted in federal court
to bilking dozens of California investors out of nearly $6 million.
Like Lukens, Waltz will repay the investors, many of whom were
elderly and had entrusted him with their life savings. Waltz is
expected to begin a 21-month prison sentence in October. He also got
three years probation.</TE>

<HD>Clues Missed, Lawyer's Defense Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorneys for a Newport man accused of murder say
investigators failed to follow leads that could have pointed to
another suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for a Newport Beach lawyer charged with murdering a
client's wife, then faking his own death, accused a district
attorney's investigator Tuesday of missing crucial leads that may
have pointed to another suspect and motives.</LD>
<LD>   Hugh "Randy" McDonald is on trial in the fatal shooting of Janie
Pang in her Villa Park home on May 30, 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Walt Schwarm did not offer a motive for the murder but
pointed out that Pang's husband, Danny, was a client of McDonald's
law firm, which handled the Pangs' investments. The Pangs owed the
firm $20,000; McDonald, whom Schwarm described as having money
trouble, was to have received $4,000 of that.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald traveled to the Bay Area three days after the shooting.
Prosecutors accuse him of then fleeing from state to state and using
the identities of dead people, whose names he found in newspaper
obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony in a Santa Ana courtroom this week, McDonald said
he flew to Northern California for a business trip but was so
depressed over financial woes that he intended to commit suicide by
leaping from the Golden Gate Bridge. He testified that he placed his
watch with his business card attached on a ledge of the bridge but
changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarm countered that that was a ruse designed to make
authorities think McDonald was dead so he could start a new life in
Utah. Police eventually tracked him down and arrested him four years
later in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   The defense spent much of the day building a case for there being
another killer and grilling Orange County sheriff's investigator
Yvonne Shull about a 10-page report belatedly submitted as evidence.
The report was to have been turned over months ago, but Shull said
she had forgotten to do so.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, the report--compiled by the FBI, the
Orange County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department--noted that Danny Pang was suspected of being a member of
the United Bamboo Triad, an Asian organized crime group from Taiwan,
and should not be excluded as a suspect in Janie Pang's murder.</TE>
<TE>   The defense further portrayed Danny Pang as a shady businessman
and million-dollar gambler who abused his wife. Janie Pang had
reported to police that Danny Pang had broken her nose, thrown things
at her and made death threats, defense attorney Kenny Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   In her testimony Tuesday, Shull insisted that Danny Pang was not a
member of the triad and that there was no evidence linking him to his
wife's murder. It was unclear if the FBI report pointed to any other
possible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Shull acknowledged that she did not find physical evidence that
McDonald was at the Pang home, didn't know about Janie Pang's planned
divorce from her husband, failed to interview the last person who
spoke to her and did not check to see if fingerprints found on the
stairs matched other possible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an unidentified print and the only thing we know is that
it's not his," co-defense counsel Michael Molfetta said, pointing at
McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Frank Fasel has issued a gag order in the case, so neither
side could comment outside court on the issues raised by the defense.
They also would not comment on Danny Pang's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, who testified Monday in his own defense, will be
cross-examined by prosecutors today.</TE>

<HD>Voice Teacher Accused in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say the Irvine businessman repeatedly
molested a youth he met through boys chorus. He is free on bail and
has resigned from the group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Irvine businessman and vocal teacher with the Orange County-based
All-American Boys Chorus has been charged with repeatedly molesting a
boy he met in the group.</LD>
<LD>   Roger A. Giese, 27, is accused of molesting a Buena Park teenager
from May 1998--when the boy was 13--to May 2002. Giese was released
on $200,000 bail after his arrest Friday and is scheduled to appear
in court Oct. 18. On Tuesday he resigned from the chorus.</LD>
<LD>   Giese is a senior account executive at Rankin Group Ltd., an
Irvine advertising and public relations firm. He did not return a
phone message left with his secretary. His attorney, Ron Bower, said
his client resigned because "he wants no one to feel uncomfortable in
that organization while he's being cleared of the charges."</LD>
<TE>   Anthony Manrique, executive director of the boys chorus, declined
to discuss the case.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Vocal Teacher Named in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say the Irvine businessman molested a
youth he met through boys chorus.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Irvine businessman and vocal teacher with the Orange County-based
All-American Boys Chorus has been charged with repeatedly molesting a
boy he met in the group.</LD>
<LD>   Roger A. Giese, 27, is accused of molesting a Buena Park teenager
from May 1998--when the boy was 13--to May 2002. Giese was released
on a $200,000 bond after his arrest Friday and is scheduled to appear
in court Oct. 18. On Tuesday he resigned from the chorus.</LD>
<LD>   Giese is a senior account executive at the Rankin Group, Ltd., an
Irvine advertising and public relations firm. He did not return a
phone message left with his secretary. His attorney, Ron Bower, said
his client resigned because "he wants no one to feel uncomfortable in
that organization while he's being cleared of the charges."</LD>
<TE>   Anthony Manrique, executive director of the boys chorus, declined
to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   "To the best of our knowledge at this point, the allegations
against Roger Giese [are] in no way connected to boys chorus'
activities or facilities," Manrique said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities on Tuesday did not say when the alleged victim left

<LD>   SMG, the company that owns The Grove, had received a $6.7-million
purchase offer from Melodyland Christian Center.</LD>

<LD>The heat may have been stifling in some parts of Southern California,
but at least there were those ocean breezes in Van Nuys. Or so I
assumed after reading the Weather Channel's Web site (see
accompanying). But Joshua Rabinowitz of Van Nuys pointed out that the
"tide" might have related to another body of water. Perhaps it "was
referring to a predicted surge in outflow from the Tillman Water
Reclamation Plant."</LD>
<LD>   And was that rain in the Santa Monica Mountains? Sort of. Cliff
Dektar of North Hollywood reports that an artificial downpour fell
for the filming of a scene of TV's "Will &amp; Grace" alongside the
Franklin Canyon Reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   There's no such thing as real rain around here.</LD>
<TE>   Word imperfect: Samuel and Catherine Maksimuk of Agua Dulce found
a typo that made a loaf of split-top bread sound less than appetizing
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Type-cast: The down market for typewriters must be the reason,
theorizes Jon Stanley of Westlake Village, that one hopeful seller
offered to include a Spanish housekeeper in the deal (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   What am I? John Anderson of Santa Maria noticed an air of mystery
about a sweater he bought (see accompanying), leading him to ask: "If
the material is unknown, how do they make more of them?"</TE>
<TE>   Who am I? The media Web site ronfineman.com mentioned a couple of
instances where substitute TV anchors inadvertently identified
themselves on the air as the folks they were replacing.</TE>
<TE>   Such snafus brought back memories for other broadcast folks. As a
writer/producer, Emile Barrios of San Diego wrote a daily script for
a "particularly dimwitted anchor that began, 'Good Evening, I'm ...
.' followed by his name."</TE>
<TE>   Barrios fantasized about writing "Good Evening, I'm Donald Duck,"
but settled on a shortened version: "Good evening, I'm ... "
(omitting the anchor's name from the script). Barrios said that when
the anchor came to that point, "there was an 'uhhhh' followed by
three exquisite seconds before he could figure out who he was."</TE>
<TE>   Identity crises (cont.): Anchors don't always misidentify
themselves accidentally, wrote former radio broadcaster Frank
Catalano of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered when Bob Beran, a fellow anchor at his station, was
having an uncharacteristically bad day, stumbling over copy and
experiencing various technical glitches.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to sign off, Beran declared, "I'm Frank
Catalano, KMPS News."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: A colleague noted that the heightened security in the
wake of 9/11 apparently prompted one of the skycap counters at
Burbank Airport to post a warning that shows a red circle around the
slashed-out word "Jokes."</TE>

<LD>Hagen Place, a nondescript two-story apartment building on a corner
of 3rd Street in Laguna Beach, would seem just what California voters
had in mind when they passed the medical-marijuana initiative in
1996.</LD>
<LD>   Laguna Beach police may beg to differ.</LD>
<LD>   Named after a local doctor and gay activist who died of the
complications of AIDS in 1991, Hagen Place has 24 apartments for
people who are HIV-positive. Many people with HIV have said that
marijuana helps relieve nausea they sometimes get from their
medications.</LD>
<TE>   And, by a 56% to 44% vote, Californians six years ago endorsed the
use of doctor-prescribed marijuana to relieve pain.</TE>
<TE>   That, Ross Embry says, is why he grows and smokes marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   It's also why Embry, 53, now faces a court date next month.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:30 p.m. on Sept. 17, police entered through a patio screen
door in his apartment and arrested him for cultivating marijuana and
possessing it for sale.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise, Embry says he wasn't surprised. Nor, even, all that
angry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not furious [over the arrest], because it's not unexpected,"
Embry says. "Everyone who's media-savvy knows the [medical-marijuana]
law is capriciously enforced and there's great vacillation on the
part of so many communities all over California on how to prosecute
and handle these cases."</TE>
<TE>   Embry says he has been using marijuana for 18 months or so to
counter nausea that resulted after he altered his medication. He says
he gives pot to several other HIV-positive residents in the building
but doesn't sell it.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach police might have other ideas. Sgt. Jason Kravetz
says police confiscated a large-enough number of plants to arouse
suspicion. "It's a quantity we don't come across all too often,"
Kravetz says. He confirmed Embry's assessment of about 2 pounds in
ready-to-use marijuana but says there was an additional 20 pounds in
plant form.</TE>
<TE>   Embry is right about one thing: The medical-marijuana issue is far
from settled in California.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court ruled in July that Californians can't be
prosecuted in state court if they have a doctor's recommendation to
smoke pot for pain. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has said that
nothing in federal law permits its use.</TE>
<TE>   The most extreme example of a city's support of the initiative
came last week when Santa Cruz City Council members drew ailing
residents' names from a hat and symbolically dispensed pot
prescriptions to them.</TE>
<TE>   Embry concedes he has only a doctor's letter that acknowledges his
marijuana use but that doesn't specifically prescribe it. That is but
another flaw in the law, Embry says--the unwillingness of some
doctors to put their name on a pot prescription.</TE>
<TE>   And he's not blind to people trying to circumvent Proposition 215,
the 1996 initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there are people who are using the medical-marijuana
issue as a ploy to market it," Embry says. "That's not out of the
realm of possibility at all."</TE>
<TE>   As for his supply, Embry says, "Yes, I did cultivate it. I didn't
have it for sale. I never sold any of it. Sure, I've got friends in
the building who are in the same boat [with pain]. They have to buy
on the street from people with shady connections. Of course, they'd
rather get it from someone in the building."</TE>
<TE>   Embry says the cops couldn't have been nicer and told him his case
may or may not reach court.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't take any sides with the medical-marijuana issue,"
Kravetz says. "The courts have asked us not to be judge and jury when
we're out in the field."</TE>
<TE>   Embry says he's prepared to fight. "I don't look at myself as
being victimized," he says. "All institutions are flawed. We have the
ability in this country to change flawed institutions."</TE>

<HD>No Contest Plea in Crash That Killed 2 Teenagers</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old Oxnard College student pleaded no contest Tuesday to
charges of vehicular manslaughter involving a car accident that
killed two teenage friends.</LD>
<LD>   Sopheak "Sophie" Riem spoke little during the afternoon hearing,
except to quietly answer yes or no to Ventura County Superior Court
Judge Edward Brodie's questions.</LD>
<LD>   Riem, who was behind the wheel during the June 11, 2001, crash,
faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison. A sentencing hearing
is scheduled for Oct. 22.</LD>
<TE>   Her attorney said she is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence.
"I don't think they're trying to make an example of her," said Deputy
Public Defender Leslie Daniels. "But if they are, it's a quiet
lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Riem and her two passengers were going to a friend's high school
graduation ceremony in Ventura. Prosecutors allege that Riem was
speeding and may have made an unsafe lane change that caused her to
lose control of her Nissan Maxima at the northbound Johnson Drive
overpass on the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Her car slammed into a metal guardrail, skidded off the freeway
and landed upside down on nearby railroad tracks, killing Ana Rosa
Uribe, 17, a student at El Camino High School in Ventura, who was
riding in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   A second passenger, Lea Casillas, 16, a standout softball player
at Buena High School, suffered skull fractures and internal injuries
and died later that day at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Riem was hospitalized with numerous injuries, including a
fractured collarbone, a punctured lung, a lacerated liver and
abrasions that required plastic surgery. All three teens had been
wearing seat belts.</TE>
<TE>   "She nearly died herself," Daniels said of Riem. "Considering her
injuries, she's lucky to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   The parents of Uribe and Casillas have filed a wrongful death
lawsuit against the state, alleging that it failed to maintain the
metal guardrail, which in turn failed to keep the car from plunging
over the side of the overpass.</TE>
<TE>   A jury trial in that case is scheduled for Feb. 24.</TE>

<LD>A Santa Barbara County judge sentenced a 22-year-old man to life in
prison Tuesday for his role in the abduction and murder of a
15-year-old West Hills boy.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse Rugge of Santa Barbara, one of five young men charged in the
crimes, was convicted in May of kidnapping Nicholas Markowitz on Aug.
6, 2000, near his home, but was acquitted in the boy's murder that
occurred two days later outside Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Zonen told the judge that Rugge was
involved in the abduction and murder from start to finish. He drove
the van used to kidnap Markowitz and stayed with the boy throughout
the ordeal, often at the Rugge family home.</LD>
<TE>   "The actual killing would not have happened without Mr. Rugge,"
Zonen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rugge's attorney, Michael A. Carty, argued in court that the
jury did not find his client guilty of aiding and abetting in the
murder and so he should be sentenced to probation instead of state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Carty described Rugge as a misguided youth devastated by his
parents' divorce, "a budding artist" and a well-behaved inmate who is
remorseful for his crime.</TE>
<TE>   He said Rugge also fears for his safety in prison because Ryan
Hoyt, who was convicted of murdering Markowitz, has openly threatened
to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   In denying the motion, Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon said
he took into consideration the seriousness of the offense and the
victim's vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapping for ransom carries a mandatory life sentence. Rugge
will be eligible for parole in five years, although Carty was
skeptical that his client would get a prompt parole hearing and be
released from prison at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said Rugge had several opportunities to help Markowitz
escape but did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "He lured Mr. Markowitz into a sense of security, which he had no
right to feel," the judge said. He added that Rugge also should have
known when Hoyt showed up with an automatic weapon that Markowitz's
life was in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the killing, Gordon said that Rugge still did nothing,
helping his friends to cover up their crimes while authorities were
searching for the missing boy. Hikers found Markowitz's body nearly a
week later.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Rugge and the others kidnapped and killed
Markowitz in retaliation for a debt the boy's older half-brother,
Benjamin, owed their alleged ringleader, Jesse James Hollywood, 22.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Gordon denied a motion to dismiss a murder charge
against Graham Pressley, who was acquitted of kidnapping in July. The
jury deadlocked on the murder charge, voting 8 to 4 in favor of
acquittal. A new trial is set for Oct. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Pressley, now 19, of Goleta helped dig a shallow
grave for Markowitz near a campsite area called Lizard's Mouth and
later that night led the victim and others back to the area, where
the killing occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, William Skidmore, 22, of Simi Valley was
sentenced to nine years in state prison after pleading guilty to
kidnapping and robbing Markowitz.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt, 23, of West Hills is set to be sentenced Nov. 12. A separate
jury decided last November that Hoyt should be executed for shooting
Markowitz nine times.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood, an alleged West Hills drug dealer, meanwhile, also has
been charged in Markowitz's kidnapping and murder, but remains at
large. There is a $50,000 reward for his capture.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's hearings, Susan Markowitz said her life ended on
the day her only child was killed. She watched as Pressley, who
posted bail and is out of custody awaiting trial, was comforted in
the hallway by his family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to see him go home with his mommy and daddy,"
she said. "I miss those hugs."</TE>

<HD>Key Business Group Endorses Valley Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: VICA's support could help offset opposition from
L.A. corporate leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An influential San Fernando Valley business organization on Tuesday
cast its lot with the secession movement, arguing that leaders of a
new Valley city would lower business taxes and spur economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., whose board includes
several of secession's most ardent supporters, made its decision
after a poll of members showed 57% in favor of secession, 11% opposed
and 32% saying VICA should take no stand. The 50-year-old
organization has 285 members, ranging from small merchants to large
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Balloting was secret, but VICA officials speculated that most of
the organization's institutional members, such as schools, hospitals
and public utilities, refrained from voting, or voted against taking
a position.</LD>
<TE>   The decision could provide a counterweight to the strong positions
against secession taken by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce
and other business organizations outside the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The VICA move came as the Los Angeles Police Protective League
began a major radio advertising campaign against secession.</TE>
<TE>   The ads assert that the Valley and Hollywood would get less
policing at a higher cost if voters approve secession Nov. 5. The ads
also contend that independence for the Valley and Hollywood would put
public safety at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "While gangs and illegal weapons threaten our safety, we might
have to do without the officers and details who are expert at
tracking down those kinds of criminals," a woman announcer says on
one of the campaign's two radio spots.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders denounced the radio ads as inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   They noted that the Local Agency Formation Commission, which
approved the secession measures for the ballot, found that the Valley
and Hollywood would be able to provide the same level of police
service as Los Angeles does.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scare tactics," Joel Fox, a secession campaign spokesman,
said of the ads. He said the union's real concern is protecting its
members' contracts, even though the secessionists have pledged to
honor them.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League, which represents rank-and-file
officers, may spend up to $400,000 on its anti-secession campaign. It
will target voters in the Valley and include phone banks, mailings
and outreach to police officers.</TE>
<TE>   The union has paid to run the radio commercials 338 times until
the election. Ads on local broadcast and cable TV stations will begin
running next week, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession supporters said they are not ready to hit the air
with their own ads, but the VICA endorsement could mean that some
pro-cityhood advertising will begin soon.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists have started running ads on cable
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schmidt, VICA's government liaison, said the organization
planned to purchase pro-secession advertisements in the Los Angeles
Business Journal, and would consider contributing financially to the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   VICA Chairman Fred Gaines said he expected secessionists to keep
their promises to cut business taxes, a move that would improve the
business climate in the Valley and force Los Angeles to lower its
taxes as well in order to compete.</TE>
<TE>   "A new Valley city will be good for business on both sides of the
hill," Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secession leaders said the VICA endorsement was expected,
coming after the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando
Valley and a Valley Realtors board backed the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't add anything to their base of support," said Larry
Levine, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One L.A. "To the
extent they have any base of support, it is in the Valley business
community. I'm not sure VICA's endorsement will sway one undecided
voter."</TE>
<TE>   Breakup foes, however, had lobbied hard to keep VICA neutral.
Former Mayor Richard Riordan wrote a letter saying that if the group
stayed neutral, it would "ensure that VICA remains a powerful,
impartial voice on economic issues in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   "We expected them to win this," said Kam Kuwata, an advisor to the
anti-secession campaign. "Our challenge was to make them
[pro-secessionists] sweat, and boy did we make them sweat. We forced
them to work on [getting the VICA endorsement] and kept them from
establishing things in other parts of the city. Basically, they lost
the entire summer working on this."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, co-chairman of the secession campaign, chuckled at
Kuwata's remarks. "This is a huge endorsement," Katz said. "It means
more people reaching out to the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Gaines said his group's endorsement would carry weight throughout
the region, and predicted that business leaders who have opposed
secession will change their positions because of VICA's action.</TE>

<HD>Education Standards Threatened</HD>
<DH>Reform: U.S. law setting proficiency levels may force
California and other states to lower their goals or face the loss of
billions of dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's new education law that promises to "leave no child
behind" may force California and several other states to lower their
academic standards for public schools or risk billions in federal
funds.</LD>
<LD>   The quandary stems from the federal law requiring that 100% of
students in all states be proficient in English and math within 12
years.</LD>
<LD>   Before the law was passed, California set a high bar for
proficiency, demanding that students learn everything from Euclidean
geometry to medieval literature before they graduate from high
school. As it stands, only one-third of the state's students now meet
the proficient level.</LD>
<TE>   Though education officials said they don't want to lower the
standards, sticking to them probably means falling short of federal
goals--and perhaps down the line, losing federal dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government has put us in a bind," said Kerry Mazzoni,
California's secretary of education. "We're never going to be able to
meet the 100% mark."</TE>
<TE>   The federal law leaves the details of testing and accountability
to the 50 states: Each must establish its own academic standards,
define what it means by proficiency on tests and ensure that students
make what it considers adequate academic progress annually.</TE>
<TE>   California began setting its standards four years ago, and through
tests each spring determines whether students are proficient for
their grade level. The state aimed high, requiring that proficient
fourth-graders be able to identify metaphors and similes in literary
works and that eighth-graders master algebra.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, California students who are proficient in English and
math when they graduate from high school are considered ready to
attend a four-year university.</TE>
<TE>   States that aim lower have a better chance of satisfying federal
requirements. And, like California, states that set demanding
standards before the law was enacted--including Michigan, Rhode
Island and Colorado--are scrambling for solutions to satisfy
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Education policymakers in California and elsewhere said lowering
their standards would undermine credibility in their school
accountability systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Every state that is trying to [respond to Washington] in
reasonably good faith is going to say, 'Why do I feel like I've just
been set up?' " said Peter McWalters, commissioner of the Rhode
Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.</TE>
<TE>   Some state officials and education experts said that is the latest
example of how the federal law doesn't take into account the
realities of public education, especially in urban districts. For
example, students in failing schools are supposed to be able to
transfer to other campuses, but often there is no space available.
And all teachers are supposed to be "highly qualified" within four
years, but some districts have trouble filling their worst schools
with anyone other than rookies.</TE>
<TE>   McWalters and several state education chiefs said they applaud
Congress for its ambitious goal of 100% proficiency. Still, as the
Rhode Island education commissioner asks, "Is it doable?"</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has answered yes--with the right effort.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said the "No Child Left Behind" law should
inspire educators to reexamine everything from how they spend money
to what they teach.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the officials said, the law aims to close the
achievement gap that separates higher performing whites and Asians
from their African American and Latino peers. That problem has
persisted despite the federal government's pumping more than $100
billion into schools serving the most disadvantaged children since
the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "The status quo is unacceptable," said Eugene Hickok,
undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education. "We need to
rethink the way we deliver education in this country. That is the
bottom line to this law."</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, schools must make measurable annual progress toward
the 100% goal. States also must show steady improvement for each
major ethnic group, as well as for low-income students.</TE>
<TE>   Educational researchers who have studied the law said the 100%
goal will not be achievable within 12 years, especially in states
that have set a high bar for proficiency and those that serve large
numbers of English learners and special education students.</TE>
<TE>   These experts said most states have shown only modest progress
over the last decade on a separate, rigorous test known as the
National Assessment of Educational Progress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not workable," said Robert Linn, co-director of the National
Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing.
"It's hard to see how we would suddenly increase [scores] three- or
fourfold just because this law has passed."</TE>
<TE>   Schools that fail to improve rapidly enough in the coming years
can face state and federal sanctions. Besides risking the loss of
federal funds, schools can have their teachers and principals removed
and they can be taken over by their states, although such extreme
measures are unlikely on a broad scale.</TE>
<TE>   Linn and other education experts said thousands of schools could
fail to meet expectations, raising serious questions about whether
the states and the federal government have enough resources--and
expertise--to handle so much failure.</TE>
<TE>   But Linn and other leading experts also are worried about states
redefining what it means to be proficient to include students who
fall below that level.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are strong incentives to set the bar lower if
[states] haven't already done it," Linn said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado is proposing such a system. The state wants to have
separate definitions of proficiency--one for its own use and one for
Washington's.</TE>
<TE>   For federal purposes, Colorado wants to define proficiency as
those students who are both "proficient" and "partially proficient"
on state English and math tests. The state would stick with only
"proficient" for use among its own schools.</TE>
<TE>   The state's education commissioner, William J. Moloney, sees no
conflict in the separate definitions, noting that Colorado's high
standards are the ones that count in the eyes of the state's schools.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm delivering good things for kids in Colorado, I'm not the
least worried that a posse from Washington is going to show up,"
Moloney said. "We are quite confident that what we're doing will be
blessed by the federal government. At the end of the day, the bottom
line is results for kids."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the U.S. Department of Education said Colorado's
definition of proficiency does not appear to be workable, although no
formal decision has been made.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all states, including California, are still drafting their
proposals for how they would meet the federal law. These are due in
January and must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   One option being discussed in California is to classify 1.5
million students as proficient who now are deemed to have only a
basic grasp of English and math.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea is unpopular with the state's leading educators,
including Secretary of Education Mazzoni and State Board of Education
members.</TE>
<TE>   "To consign everyone to failure is no way to upgrade the system,"
said Marion Joseph, a member of the state education board. "We in no
way want to lessen the pressure on the system. This doesn't help the
situation. We don't have an answer yet."</TE>
<TE>   Even if officials used this strategy, most of California's 8,000
schools could still fail to meet annual targets for improvement that
the federal law requires, according to a preliminary state analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Just 33% of youngsters statewide were proficient on California's
English-language arts tests last spring, up slightly from 31% the
year before. Some schools had no proficient students.</TE>
<TE>   The results underscore the enormous task of raising achievement
levels, especially in overcrowded schools that are staffed by
inexperienced teachers and serve legions of students who speak
English as a second language.</TE>
<TE>   The challenges are apparent at Los Angeles Academy, a public
middle school in South Los Angeles. Just 4% of the school's
sixth-graders were proficient in English-language arts, according to
results from last spring's state test.</TE>
<TE>   Mistie Barela, who teaches English as a second language, ticks off
her school's obstacles: class sizes of 40 students. Little training
for new teachers. Multiple reforms that are confusing and
uncoordinated. The year-round calendar that chops more than three
weeks off the school year and disrupts classes with stop-and-start
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us the resources, give us the time. Give us the appropriate
pay. Lower my class sizes," Barela said.</TE>
<TE>   "Before jumping to the top of the ladder, let's take the steps to
get there," she said.</TE>

<LD>A father who authorities said was involved in a custody dispute and
armed with a handgun held his 1 1/2-year-old daughter hostage inside
his mother's home in Santa Ana on Tuesday as police negotiated for
the girl's release.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the 25-year-old man, whose name was not released,
fired at least three rounds during the standoff, which began about
2:30 p.m. in the 2000 block of West Wilshire Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect walked out the home's front door several times, once
cradling his daughter in one arm while holding a handgun to her
stomach, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The incident began when the child's mother brought her for a
visit.</TE>
<TE>   "The custody dispute led to an argument, which led to a fight,
which led the suspect to arm himself," Police Sgt. Baltazar De La
Riva said. "He's made statements that he's not going to come out
peaceably."</TE>
<TE>   The mother ran from the bedroom as the suspect fired a shot. He
later fired another shot inside the home and a third round outside.</TE>
<TE>   Police have been to the house before. In one recent incident, the
father refused to let the mother leave with their daughter until
officers arrived and talked him into it, De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   Police, including SWAT officers using an armored vehicle, cordoned
off a six-block area and evacuated neighboring homes while they
negotiated with the man by phone late Tuesday night.</TE>

<HD>Though Cloaked, War Memorial Draws Visitors</HD>
<DH>Monument: Statues built for young Vietnamese Americans to
'remember history.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>QUYNH-GIANG TRAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the two 15-foot statues are still veiled and fenced off in
an unfinished Westminster park, a steady stream of mostly Vietnamese
Americans visited them Tuesday in a moment that for some was deep and
powerful.</LD>
<LD>   Clutching a tattered letter from his father dated April 11, 1988,
Jacobs Hung Le, 35, said he saw the bronze statues--an American and a
South Vietnamese soldier side by side--as a substitute for the
gravesite he can't visit regularly.</LD>
<LD>   His father spent 13 years in a reeducation camp and never made it
to the United States. Le said visiting the statues made him feel that
he had not left his father in Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   Others viewed the statues with disinterest and even concern,
underscoring the divide that lingers in a suburban town that became
home to thousands of immigrants after the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people will we be contending with?" wondered Rosalea
Wilcox, 78, who lives in a senior citizen housing complex across from
the statues. Wilcox said she was kept up until 1 a.m. when the
statues were trucked in and installed.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilcox, a county resident since 1957, said she understands the
purpose of the monument. She has kept a file of newspaper articles on
the statues' progress to share with her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it will bring peace to the Vietnamese people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her neighbor Will Zainfeld, 67, a retired interior designer from
Huntington Beach, expressed concern about the design and its
symbolism. Zainfeld, who served in the Navy in the late 1950s,
thought the two-soldier image evoked violence. "Maybe it should be an
American soldier with a Vietnamese family [instead]," he said.
"Because we freed them and they are here now."</TE>
<TE>   The statues will remain covered until an official unveiling in
November. City officials said they want to keep them covered until
the plaza is complete, although they were briefly uncloaked when
movers shifted them into place Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We built this statue for the young people to remember their
history," said Nguyen Nguyen, 67, of Norwalk. "When we die, this will
be here for our children."</TE>
<TE>   As the centerpiece in Freedom Plaza, a small plaza in the shadow
of a county courthouse and Westminster's City Hall, the statues are
the gift of thousands of Vietnamese Americans who raised nearly $1
million in small donations over three years, despite controversy over
the design and escalating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen and her husband Nu Nguyen, 65, who donated more than $400
to help pay for the statues, arrived Tuesday at 3 p.m. for a two-hour
shift to watch over the soldiers. Volunteers from former South
Vietnamese veteran groups intend to hold an after-hours vigil to
protect the statues from vandalism until the unveiling, when the site
will be lighted and patrolled.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the statues symbolize a new home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our second homeland now," said Sandy Nguyen, 63, of
Westminster, who walked to the statues with her 3-year-old
grandniece. Nearing tears, Sandy Nguyen said she would come every
week to sweep around the statues if the city lacked funds to care for
it.</TE>
<TE>   While many emotions are represented by the statues, Tuan Nguyen,
its designer, had more humble goals. "I designed it to pay respect to
those who died in the war. The people themselves give meaning to it."</TE>
<TE>   The plaza will include a fountain, eternal flame and electronic
kiosks with information about the war.</TE>

<LD>Describing Van Nuys and other general aviation airports as just as
vulnerable to terrorists as larger commercial airports, Los Angeles
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter wants the San Fernando Valley airport
to examine its security--something the airport says it has already
done.</LD>
<LD>   Galanter, whose district includes Van Nuys, heads the council
committee that oversees Los Angeles airports. She introduced a motion
Tuesday ordering a security plan for Van Nuys Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The 730-acre airport averages 1,500 takeoffs and landings a day,
more than any other general aviation airfield in the United States,
according to airport officials.</LD>
<TE>   "We cannot focus solely on security at commercial aviation
airports and forget about general aviation facilities," Galanter said
in a news release. "Locking our front door to terrorists does us no
good if we leave the back window wide open."</TE>
<TE>   It is too easy for terrorists to steal those aircraft and airport
vehicles for use as weapons, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Airport, which is home to nearly 800 aircraft, has
evaluated its security and continues to make improvements, such as
installing a new fence around its perimeter, spokeswoman Stacy Geere
said Tuesday. Los Angeles police have added patrols, augmenting the
airport's police force.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials believe the measures being taken make it one of
the most secure general aviation facilities in the nation, Geere
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very comprehensive program in place, and we welcome the
opportunity to brief the councilwoman," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A major tenant agreed that the airport is far more secure than
most noncommercial airfields.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty diligent," said Rick Voorhis, president of Van Nuys
Flight Center. "People that shouldn't be here stick out like a sore
thumb."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will consider Galanter's motion Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors Tuesday unanimously approved the purchase
of a $12.7-million computer system to issue paychecks, track benefits
and handle other personnel information.</LD>
<LD>   Although the county is weighing a budget cut of $10 million,
supervisors agreed that putting off the purchase would be risky. The
20-year-old system currently in use is vulnerable to breakdowns and
relies on technology so obsolete that employees familiar with it are
hard to find, said Matt Carroll, head of the county's Information
Systems Department.</LD>
<LD>   After researching the issue for five years, county officials chose
PeopleSoft, a company in Pleasanton, Calif., to provide the new
system. The company has done similar work for about 20 of
California's 58 counties, Carroll said.</LD>
<TE>   The system is to be installed in phases and completed in 2004.
County officials said they hope the current system holds together
until then.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hate to see us have to bring in a Brinks truck or go back to
hand-writing checks," said Supervisor Judy Mikels.</TE>

<LD>A former Ventura gang member who was ordered released from jail after
prosecutors decided not to retry him a third time on murder charges
remained behind bars Tuesday on suspicion of being in the country
illegally.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico-born Ramiro Salgado, 23, will be picked up by federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents this morning,
authorities said, and transferred to a holding facility in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities are trying to determine whether Salgado's work
visa has expired and whether he has any prior criminal convictions,
Salgado's defense lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Federal authorities today will decide whether to schedule a
deportation hearing. Pending that hearing, Salgado could be released
on bail or held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, who has been in jail about two years, was charged in the
1999 beating death of a Ventura teen. Two mistrials were declared
after juries were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.</TE>

<HD>2 Air Tanker Crashes Are Blamed on Fatigue Cracks</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Wings snapped off, raising concerns by safety
officials about the use of surplus military aircraft to fight fires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fatigue cracks caused the wings to snap off two aging planes as they
dropped fire retardant on blazes in the High Sierra and the Rocky
Mountains in recent months, federal safety officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The June 17 crash of a 45-year-old C-130A near Walker, Calif.,
captured on a videotape that showed both wings breaking off, killed
the three crewmen aboard. The crash a month later of a 58-year-old
PB4Y-2 near Estes Park, Colo., killed the pilot and co-pilot.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board said the crashes have
raised important questions about old surplus military aircraft now
being flown as air tankers and for other public uses. All C-130s and
PB4Ys in the firefighting fleet were grounded after the crashes, but
more than 30 other large vintage planes are still being used to fight
fires.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery of the wing cracks is prompting the NTSB to restudy
some earlier air tanker accidents, including the 1994 crash of
another C-130 near Pearblossom. That accident was blamed initially on
a fuel explosion, but investigators now say fatigue cracks may have
caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Since the crashes in June and July, much smaller wing cracks have
been found on several other planes being used as air tankers, and the
U.S. Forest Service has reduced the loads being carried on the
tankers still flying.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the fatigue cracks on the planes that crashed
were confined to the wing structures. Yet to be determined, they
said, is what initiated the cracks and what caused them to spread
until the wings broke off under the stress of dropping heavy loads of
liquid fire retardant.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said the cracks were in places not easily accessible for
inspection during the periodic maintenance required by the Federal
Aviation Administration. The FAA is expected to issue a directive
later this week addressing the inspection and maintenance of the
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Both planes were owned by Hawkins and Powers, a firm based in
Greybull, Wyo., that converts former cargo and military aircraft for
use as air tankers and operates the planes under contracts with the
Forest Service. The NTSB said it is taking a close look at the
modification and maintenance history of both planes.</TE>
<TE>   The C-130 was designed for use as a military cargo plane, and the
PB4Y was built as a Navy patrol plane. The NTSB is questioning
whether those designs are appropriate for dive-bombing tankers in the
war against wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   The four-engine, turboprop C-130 Hercules that crashed had taken
off about 2:30 p.m. June 17 from Minden, Nev., for a seemingly
routine series of fire retardant drops on a 10,000-acre wildfire
about 25 miles north of Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Videotape shot by a witness, and later broadcast nationwide, shows
the plane was in a shallow dive, dropping retardant, when the wings
suddenly snapped upward, less than half a second apart. The plane
slammed into the ground near Walker and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   Killed were pilot Steven Wass, 42, of Gardnerville, Nev.; co-pilot
Craig Labare, 36, of Loomis, Ca., and flight engineer Michael Davis,
59, of Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   The C-130 that crashed was built by Lockheed in 1957 and delivered
to the Air Force later that year. It went into use as an air tanker
in 1988. At the time of the crash, the plane had 21,863 flight hours.</TE>
<TE>   The four-engine, World-War-II vintage PB4Y that crashed July 18
was in a banking left turn, preparatory to making a retardant drop on
a 4,100-acre wildfire near Estes Park, Colo., when the left wing
broke off.</TE>
<TE>   The fuselage slammed into the ground, killing pilot Rick Schwartz,
39, of Ulm, Mont., and co-pilot Milt Stollak, 56, of Cathedral City.</TE>
<TE>   Built by Consolidated-Vultee in 1944, the plane was used by the
Navy and Coast Guard before it was acquired by Hawkins and Powers in
1969. Its flight time as an air tanker was 8,200 hours, but officials
have been unable to determine how many hours it flew in military
service.</TE>

<HD>Agency Can Keep Buying Water From Kern County</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that a water agency
in Santa Clarita may continue to purchase large amounts of imported
Kern County water, which will be used by current and future
residential developments in the fast-growing suburb.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit, the environmental group Friends of the Santa Clara
River challenged the Castaic Lake Water Agency's environmental report
supporting its purchase of up to 41,000 acre-feet of water per year
from the Kern County Water Agency.</LD>
<LD>   An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, enough water to supply two
average families for a year.</LD>
<TE>   The environmentalists believe the Santa Clarita Valley relies too
heavily on imported water and is facing overdevelopment. They say
that combination could be dangerous if a drought decreases the
statewide water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 180,000 acre-feet of water available to the water agency
each year, about half is imported from other parts of the state,
including Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   Judge David P. Yaffe ruled that the water agency may continue to
import the Kern County water, though he described the agency's
environmental report as inadequate. The agency must prepare a new
report, he ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Plambeck, a board member of Friends of the Santa Clara
River, considered the decision a defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling could help developers gain government approval for
projects such as the proposed 21,600-home Newhall Ranch subdivision,
said Plambeck.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a society have made some really bad environmental
decisions, because first we built the houses and then we've tried to
find the water--and that is what the Friends of the Santa Clara River
was trying to avoid in this case," Plambeck said. "It's going to hurt
the existing users when all the new users come on line and there
aren't adequate water supplies."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou Cotton, a water agency spokeswoman, said officials might
have imposed strict water conservation measures if the Kern County
purchase had been halted.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling Tuesday, Yaffe said Friends of the Santa Clara River
could ask him to prohibit the water purchases in the future if it
could prove the water was being used "for purposes [the environmental
group] considers improper."</TE>

<HD>Plan for High-Rise Conversions Angers Beverly Hills
Residents</HD>
<DH>Zoning: Officials are considering turning Wilshire offices,
including the Flynt Publications tower, into apartments. Neighbors

<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to convert high-rise office buildings into apartments is
causing jaws to drop in Beverly Hills--where officials have decided
to fight a housing shortage by moving families onto Wilshire
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   City planning commissioners will be asked today to rezone a
12-block stretch of the busy business street to allow the strip's
largest office buildings, including the landmark Flynt Publications
tower, to be turned into homes.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, officials will review the first make-over
proposal: conversion of an 11-story office building at Wilshire and
Stanley Drive into 37 rental units. The roof would be turned into an
outdoor recreation patio for tenants and office windows would be
refitted with balconies.</LD>
<TE>   Beverly Hills leaders say their "adaptive reuse" plan could bring
the first new apartments to their city in decades. All of the recent
townhouse-style construction has been individually owned
condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a shortage of rental development here," Planning Director
Mahdi Aluzri said Tuesday. "We have not had a rental project in 15 or
20 years. I guess the cost of land makes apartments difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment plan has angered residents of single-family home
neighborhoods whose houses sit in the shadow of the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   It has also stunned tenants of office buildings targeted by the
city for possible future conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners on Stanley Drive say they learned only last week that
apartments were planned for the office building at 8601 Wilshire
Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that, virtually overnight, the conversion would double
the population of their sycamore-shaded street.</TE>
<TE>   The residents predict that neighborhood tranquillity will
disappear after tenants begin using the new balconies and rooftop
recreation area--where the city will allow parties until 10 p.m. They
worry that curbside parking on their block will be impossible after
the tenants each get the three street parking permits allowed by city
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "What the city is doing to us is horrendous," said Carol Ward, a
retired surgical nurse who has lived in a 1920s Tudor-style home next
to the high-rise for 30 years. "None of us mind the office building.
It's only occupied 9 to 5, and there's no one there on weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Belis Gormiyanoglu, a 33-year resident of the street,
said she feels betrayed by Beverly Hills officials. "This must have
been in the works for two years. And they give us 10 days' notice.
It's unbelievable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have hired lawyer Robert P. Silverstein to fight the
conversion proposal at today's 1:30 p.m. commission meeting at City
Hall. He said the character of Wilshire Boulevard will change if
three other high-rises pinpointed by the city are converted to
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "Picture the Flynt building with laundry hanging and bikes and
barbecues stored on the balconies," said Silverstein--who grew up
near the corner of Wilshire and La Cienega boulevards, where the
distinctive glass tower stands. "And the city says this will have no
environmental impact."</TE>
<TE>   Tenants of the 10-floor Flynt Publications building were unaware
of the rezoning plan, which the city has named the "Adaptive Reuse
Planned Development Overlay Zone."</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange. We haven't heard a word," said Irvin Atkins, a
partner of entertainer Art Linkletter, who has maintained an office
in the tower at 8484 Wilshire Blvd. for 10 years. Atkins said his
second-floor tenancy is on a yearly lease.</TE>
<TE>   Across La Cienega Boulevard, tenants at 8500 Wilshire also were
surprised that their nine-story building is being considered by the
city as potential apartment space.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding, right? This is a joke, isn't it?" asked Shirin
Asgarian, whose Beverly Hills Acupuncture Center has operated on the
fifth floor for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Osborne, manager of Symbolic Motor Car Co. on the first
floor, was pleased to learn that ground-floor space in all of the
buildings would be reserved for commercial uses under the city
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect. I'd live above my job. I'd commute to work by
elevator," Osborne joked.</TE>
<TE>   At the fourth building included in the zoning "overlay," tenants
at 8383 Wilshire Blvd. also were puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   Their 10-floor, Y-shaped structure near the corner of Wilshire and
San Vicente Boulevard houses a Nibbler's restaurant and a variety of
professional offices.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Verduzco, an executive assistant for the Lee Solters Co.
public relations firm, suggested that the corner might be too busy
for residential use.</TE>
<TE>   There was speculation, meantime, that economics may be more of a
motivation in the conversions than the fulfillment of social needs.</TE>
<TE>   Current office rents at the four buildings average about $2.50 per
square foot. But city officials said new apartment units--which
initially would not be covered by rent control--would probably go for
about $3.50 a square foot.</TE>

<HD>Eight Californians Win MacArthur Fellowships</HD>
<DH>Awards: Local recipients include two artists, two Caltech
scientists and a Pulitzer-winning writer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Caltech researchers, two Los Angeles artists and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer at the Getty Trust are among 24 people who
received this year's so-called genius grants awarded by the MacArthur
Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Three other Californians also received the awards, the state
thereby accounting for a full third of the recipients. Each of the 24
fellows will receive $500,000 over the next five years to use any way
they want--no strings attached.</LD>
<LD>   The awards are meant to nurture young researchers who have already
shown promise by taking intellectual, scientific or cultural risks.</LD>
<TE>   "It just floored me" when the foundation called, said Caltech
atmospheric chemist Paul Wennberg. "I had no advance warning at all.
I took the afternoon off and took the family to the Long Beach
Aquarium."</TE>
<TE>   Wennberg, 40, has devised new ways to measure the concentration of
pollutants and other important chemicals in the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Wennberg's measurements show that chlorofluorocarbons produce more
damage in the lower regions of the atmosphere than previously
believed. They also show that a proposed fleet of supersonic
transports, or SSTs, would do less damage than scientists had earlier
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude of the prize "hasn't really sunk in yet," said
cosmologist Charles Steidel, the other Caltech winner. "Everyone is
asking me what my plans are for it, but I don't really have a good
answer yet."</TE>
<TE>   Steidel, 39, is known for developing new ways to locate and
identify the most distant galaxies in the universe, which are also
the youngest. By studying those young galaxies, researchers hope to
understand how the universe was created and evolved into its present
form.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding how to spend the money will require a lot of creative
thinking, Steidel said. "It would be a shame to use money with no
strings attached in the same way that you use money with lots of
strings attached," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five MacArthur fellows now work at Caltech, an unprecedented
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   At 60, Jack Miles, senior advisor to the president of the J. Paul
Getty Trust, is the oldest of this year's MacArthur fellows, and thus
was perhaps most surprised by the award.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a strong impression that they were prejudiced in favor of
people under 45," he said. "For that reason alone, I thought it was
not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a Jesuit and with a doctorate in Near Eastern languages
and literature, Miles has been an editor and critic all his career,
including a 10-year stint as The Times' book editor.</TE>
<TE>   His Pulitzer Prize-winning book "God: A Biography" examines the
evolution of the character of God as though he were a figure in a
work of literature. His recent book, "Christ: A Crisis in the Life of
God," treats the Jesus of the New Testament in the same fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The second book, he said, "was more daring and more risky than the
first, and one reviewers wrestled with more." In fact, some praised
it highly and others were scathing. "I console myself that the first
book won the Pulitzer, but the second is the one that won the
MacArthur."</TE>
<TE>   Miles said the award will allow him to pursue projects that he had
thought were beyond his time and means, focusing on two major themes:
the role of religion in addressing the current terrorism crisis, and
the world's environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Liza Lou, 33, who lives and works in Ventura County and Topanga
Canyon, said the award "just came out of nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   Lou is best known for her work with thousands of glass beads, such
as two life-size sculptures, "Kitchen" and "Back Yard," that appeared
at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 1998. Because the pieces took so
long to construct, Lou had to take all kinds of jobs, such as waiting
tables, selling prom dresses and taking commissions on other work,
while building them.</TE>
<TE>   The award money, she said, will allow her to pursue her ideas
without having to take commissions. "If I jump into a large work, I
don't have to spend a year raising the money," she said. "It couldn't
have come at a better time."</TE>
<TE>   Lou's work now involves performance art and sculpture based on
wood panels. Her most recent sculptures will make up a show called
"Testimony" at New York's Deitch Projects opening Oct. 12. The pieces
refer obliquely toward her upbringing in a Pentacostal Christian
family. "I was raised seeing visions and miracles and stuff ...
speaking in tongues. I've gotten exhausted talking about beads," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Toba Khedoori, 37, works with oil paints and pencil on
paper that she coats with wax. A native of Australia who comes from
an Iraqi family, Khedoori's work is described as cool, elegant
minimalism. The Village Voice likened her images of windows and
horizons to "the big, empty spaces of Ed Ruscha [without the irony]
... perfect California art."</TE>
<TE>   George Lewis, 50, has had a protean career as a jazz trombonist,
experimental composer, professor and inquirer into the nature and
possibilities of improvisation. He has done pioneering work using
computers as partners in the give-and-take of improvised
music-making.</TE>
<TE>   The UC San Diego professor said the MacArthur award will buy him
the time he needs to complete a project that takes him back to his
creative roots: a book about the Assn. for the Advancement of
Creative Musicians, which he joined as a Chicago teenager in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played with all kinds of groups in all kinds of situations,
but in expanding creative options for myself, the AACM was the key.
It prepared me for everything I did," Lewis said from UC Irvine,
where he is spending the fall semester as one of the coordinators of
a kind of think tank of artists and academics. "This award will give
me the possibility of finishing the book," he said. "My editor will
be very happy to hear that I'll have the time now."</TE>
<TE>   Northern California winners include Brian Tucker of GeoHazards
International in Palo Alto and David B. Goldstein of the Natural
Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker, 56, is a seismologist who works in developing countries to
help make buildings more resistant to earthquakes. "We want them
aware that these buildings that they are building now are not safe,
and that they will fall down," he said. He particularly focuses on
school buildings, where many casualties often occur in a temblor.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein, 51, is a physicist who led the effort to develop and
produce energy-efficient refrigerators, encouraging regulatory
agencies to establish new energy consumption standards. He also has
encouraged the development of mortgage incentives as a way to promote
energy efficiency.</TE>
