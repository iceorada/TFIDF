<HD>WGA puts writers one click closer</HD>
<DH>The guild's new online system lets anyone anywhere in the
world register ideas.</DH>

<LD>Daniel Rice, a 31-year-old graphic designer, is cursed with the
nagging ambition to be a working screenwriter.</LD>
<LD>   Although he must nurse that fantasy far from Hollywood's dream
factory, in Amherst, N.Y., now he can be just as protective of his
ideas as any big-time writer in the 310 area code. Instead of hauling
his scripts down to the Writers Guild of America's L.A. headquarters
for registration or mailing them to the U.S. Copyright Office, Rice
simply pushes the "send" button on his computer.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the WGA's registry, long a fact of life in Hollywood, has
gone global, open to Internet users from the Miracle Mile to Brunei
looking to register their brainstorms before someone else swipes
them.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone is paranoid about their idea. They're absolutely
paranoid about it," says Jerry Katzman, a former head of the William
Morris Agency who now teaches at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and
TV, and oversees industry relations for the school.</TE>
<TE>   Since its June launch at the WGA, the registry has accepted
thousands of projects in dozens of languages in varying stages of
completion.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the system say it introduces a little bit of democracy in
a town ruled by an oligarchy of powerbrokers. It gives peace of mind
to industry outsiders who fear that Hollywood is crawling with
opportunists who wouldn't think twice about appropriating somebody
else's idea. (They may have a point: Lawsuits and arbitrations
alleging idea theft are commonplace in Hollywood.)</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the WGA accepts about 40,000 projects through the U.S.
mail or from writers themselves, who hand-register them at
headquarters. In the past six months, at least 6,000 projects have
been registered online, most of them generated by a scriptwriting
contest for the second installment of the HBO movie-in-progress
series "Project Greenlight."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very clear that significant numbers of people are
going to the online service and away from the walk-in or mail-in
registration," WGA President Victoria Riskin said. "It's a terrific
opportunity for us to make things easier and better for those wanting
to register their material."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some suggest the rush to register ideas is a bit misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "You should have an idea good enough to steal. Because maybe the
next one will be good enough to do," is the standard advice given to
aspiring writers by Tim O'Donnell, executive producer, director and
writer of "Clueless" (1995).</TE>
<TE>   "It's an idea-rich town. It's an execution-poor town," said
O'Donnell, who's also a member of the WGA's board of directors. "You
can take the top 10 movies and top 10 shows, and with remarkable
exception, they aren't great ideas. They're just well-executed."</TE>
<TE>   Rice registered more than just an idea; he went online with a
pilot script for a sitcom he has tentatively titled "Crayons," about
a middle-aged man who discovers he has a 5-year-old son. With the
writer envisioning a laugh track background, the protagonist of
"Crayons" raises his son while juggling the demands of his
advertising executive job. Rice also registered a sample script he
wrote for NBC's long-running hit sitcom "Frasier" that he hopes can
prove his ability to conform to an established show's rhythm and
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I logged off, I was registered, and it was mine. It
didn't even take 10 minutes," Rice said, although after a moment he
added: "I'm sure the ease of the process could clog up the system
with garbage."</TE>
<TE>   Rice is not a member of the WGA and always thought he would have
to continue mailing his projects to the U.S. Copyright Office in
Washington, D.C., a process that costs $30 and can take up to eight
months. But now, he says, the WGA has freed him up with the online
registry.</TE>
<TE>   "What I liked about registering online was that everything was in
my control," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   The process costs guild members $10, while nonmembers, like Rice,
have to pay $20. After taking the author's Social Security number,
address, credit card information and a downloaded version of their
work, the WGA spits out a registration number accompanied by proof of
the date, time and type of content submitted.</TE>
<TE>   The author's work remains confidential throughout the registration
process and is placed under seal, only to be opened during mediation
or trial as proof of the concept's genesis. About once a month, the
WGA hands a court a piece of registered material on behalf of a
writer, according to Caroline Chacon, administrator of the WGA's
Intellectual Property Registry.</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of the items registered online has been pulled into a
dispute, but that may be due to the newness of the system; it usually
takes quite some time for arguments over authorship to reach
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Some writers wonder aloud if the accessibility and ease of the
online registry will legitimize every amateur with an Internet
connection.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who registers an idea at the Writers Guild and tries to
use that as a way to convince someone they're a writer is probably
deluding themselves," said Robert Kosberg, who has produced films
including "Twelve Monkeys" (1995). He is a WGA member who has
registered 100 ideas and pitches the old-fashioned way during the
past few decades. "Registering has nothing to do with being a
professional writer. Being a professional writer means you're selling
your work, you have an agent and a lawyer, and you can make a living
off your writing."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Project Greenlight," a popular scriptwriting
software, Final Draft is pushing the WGA online registry. When users
of Final Draft finish a script, the program automatically urges them
to register.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 75 years, the WGA has accepted material by those who
arrive in person at guild headquarters on West 3rd Street in L.A.
during business hours. Writers also can register by mail. Last year,
registrations in all forms brought $750,000 into the nonprofit WGA,
according to Vicky Gallion, spokeswoman for the guild.</TE>
<TE>   But until last summer's WGA online launch, there was no recourse
for someone outside L.A. who needed to register a script fast. Nor
was there any easy way for a struggling writer-wage slave to quickly
declare authorship of an idea without leaving work in the middle of
the day to get to the WGA's office by closing time.</TE>
<TE>   (There is a drop box in the WGA's lobby for after-hours
registration, and it is watched over by a security guard 24 hours a
day. But there's no certificate of registry given, a drawback for any
writer fearing theft of a masterpiece.)</TE>
<TE>   Richard Walter, professor of screenwriting at UCLA's School of
Theater, Film and TV, encourages his students to go to WGA
headquarters to register their work. Walter, also a longtime expert
witness on intellectual property and plagiarism, wants them to come
face-to-face with the other writers standing in line to register
their scripts.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the bustle of writers who are seeking attention just drives
home the lesson, which is that your script better stand out, as in
outstanding from the very first page."And to those hopeful dreamers
convinced they possess a million-dollar idea, he points out:</TE>
<TE>   "You've still got to invent the characters, the incidents, the
anecdotes. You've got to weave them together. The ideas behind some
of the great movies are pretty lame. Look at 'Citizen Kane.' The guy
has everything, but he's unhappy. Can't buy me love. Look at 'Star
Wars.' The girl gets kidnapped and the guys rescue her in space. It's
not the idea. The devil is in the details."</TE>

<DH>Top architectural photographer Grant Mudford explores
Disney Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Freudenheim</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The best buildings are always disappointing to me in photographs,"
says Grant Mudford, one of the most sought-after architectural
photographers working in this country. "I see buildings that are
accepted as being great works of architecture, and I've always
experienced them through photographs before I've actually experienced
them firsthand. I'm always pleasantly surprised when I see the real
thing.</LD>
<LD>   "But," he adds, "there's a whole bunch of mediocre works of
architecture that look great in photographs, a lot more interesting
than they really are." The best photographs, Mudford believes, are
full of illusion and abstraction. "I don't think photography excels
at what it's used for mostly, which is to document things."</LD>
<LD>   Despite these contrarian opinions, Mudford spends a good deal of
his professional life documenting architecture, and his work has been
published in nearly every major periodical and architectural journal.
He has also provided the images for monographs on Rudolf Schindler
and Louis Kahn and photographed the work of many of the greatest
architects of our time.</LD>
<TE>   "Grant is the best," says editor Gloria Gerace, who commissioned
Mudford to shoot Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall for a book
being published by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in collaboration with
the Getty Research Center. A number of other photographers are
working on the book, but she wanted someone to create a series of
classical images of the building during its construction and at
completion. "The person to give you gorgeous photographs," Gerace
says, "is Grant Mudford."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Mudford has been doing some work of his own on
Disney Hall, a series he sees purely as art and as having nothing to
do with documentation. These images, now on display at the Santa
Monica gallery owned by his longtime dealer and partner, Rosamund
Felsen, do not explore the magnificence of Gehry's statement.
Instead, they focus on the messier side of its creation, in
5-foot-tall light-jet prints. Networks of air ducts and webs of
scaffolding are central images, as are sweeping exterior planes still
surrounded by bare steel armatures and the intersection of soaring
cranes with Gehry's preliminary framework. Although many of these
pictures are instantly identifiable as Disney Hall, their interest
lies not in the building itself so much as in the patterns that
emerge from the rough-and-tumble construction site. The passage of
time is irrelevant, except if you notice that an identical view of
the building is depicted, six months apart, in two images.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a 'decisive moment' photographer," says Mudford,
referring to the art of capturing the essence of a scene in a single
instant so identified with Henri Cartier-Bresson. "My work takes
quite a while to compose."</TE>
<TE>   When Mudford is shooting, he makes every effort to respect the
architecture. "I feel honored that I've been given the
responsibility, and I do what I can to make it look good. That's my
job." The challenge, he says, is not in depicting the forms but in
recognizing the totality of a building. "It's not about pizazz and
what you see from the street," he says. "It's all about light and
space. Those are the two essential qualities of architecture. As
Louis Kahn said, 'Light, the giver of all presences.' "</TE>
<TE>   At 58, Mudford still speaks with the soft, lilting accent of his
native Australia, which he left behind nearly three decades ago. In
an interview at the Felsen gallery, he says that although he was
always interested in photography and it came naturally to him even as
a young boy, he studied architecture in college, at the University of
New South Wales in Sydney. He was looking for a profession, in part
to reassure his family, but he found he wasn't very good at drawing.
As a result, his avocation became his career, and after graduation he
began doing commercial photography to make a living and art to
satisfy his desires.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, Mudford came to the United States on a grant from the
Australia Council for the Arts. The money gave him the means to
travel extensively, living out of a van and shooting black-and-white
images of innocuous buildings. The large-scale prints focus on
details of contrasting flat surfaces, resulting in quasi-abstract
compositions reminiscent of the grid paintings of Mondrian or Ad
Reinhardt. Mudford says these early works were influenced by Walker
Evans, who magically infused power into small incidents. "One of the
beautiful things about photography is that it can turn really dumb
stuff that nobody takes notice of into icons," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Mudford continued on this path until the early '80s and in the
process caught the eye not only of the art world but also of the
architecture world. Architects began to invite Mudford to document
their work, and his reputation grew. After dividing his time between
New York and Los Angeles for years, he settled here and for the past
20 years has shared his life with Felsen. Throughout, he has
continued to make art, including some portraiture and his more
idiosyncratic images of light, space and buildings. His work has been
exhibited extensively in galleries and museums throughout the U.S.
and Australia, as well as in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Mudford's series on Disney Hall shows him moving away from the
flat, planar qualities of the early work. The new pictures are still
very geometric but with much greater depth and complexity in the
subjects. Using the same Swiss Sinar camera that he uses for his
commissioned photos and printing the images with Chip Leavitt at A&amp;I
in Hollywood (the first time he hasn't done his own darkroom work),
he has achieved a clarity and three-dimensionality reminiscent of the
landscapes of Ansel Adams -- but on a much larger scale.</TE>
<TE>   Mudford says he greatly admires Gehry's work, and he would seem to
have no reason to doubt his own ability to capture it. Nevertheless,
he speaks with some trepidation of the competitive challenge he will
face when the concert hall is finished.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a million photographers photographing that
place inside and out, and I'll be doing the same angle as everybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the images on the gallery walls, he muses, "This may be
the best work I'll do about this building."</TE>

<CX>   Architectural photographs -- A story in Tuesday's Calendar about an
exhibition of architectural photographs of Grant Mudford omitted
information on the location and times of the show. Mudford's work is
on view through Jan. 4 at the Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Bergamot
Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., B4, Santa Monica. The gallery is open
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For information

<HD>L.A. OPERA SCRAPS PLANS FOR 'POPPEA'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time this season, Los Angeles Opera has been forced to
cancel a major production.</LD>
<LD>   Italian composer Luciano Berio's new orchestration of Monteverdi's
"The Coronation of Poppea" -- slated for Jan. 11-19 with L.A. Opera
artistic director Placido Domingo and Frederica von Stade performing
-- is off the schedule because the composer is ill and the new
version of the opera has not been completed.</LD>
<LD>   The new "Poppea" was highly anticipated because it would pair
Italy's foremost contemporary composer, Berio, with the seminal
400-year-old Monteverdi work.</LD>
<TE>   It will be replaced with a soon-to-be-announced three-act program
that company spokesman Gary Murphy said will "definitely include some
Berio." In August, the opera company canceled its most ambitious
offering for 2002-03, Kirov Opera's $3-million production of "War and
Peace," because of financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Although originally planned as a fully staged production, L.A.
Opera announced in January that "Coronation" would instead be
presented in concert form. At the time, Domingo said that Berio had
been in an auto accident and was behind on delivering the new
orchestration. No details were available Monday on the nature of
Berio's current health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said that L.A. Opera still plans to present Berio's
"Coronation" at a later date. The opera company had also announced
that Berio is writing a new opera to star Domingo for 2006. As of
now, those plans are unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The opera company canceled its November presentation of "War and
Peace" after high-tech investment mogul Alberto Vilar balked at being
asked to supply $600,000 in extra funds to adapt the massive
production to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage, as well as to move
up the payment of a $1-million pledge. "War and Peace" was replaced
with another Kirov production, Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk," less expensive to present at $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   That production ran into a snag in October when the 10-day
shutdown of West Coast ports prevented the sets, costumes and props
from being unloaded in Los Angeles. The boat carrying the items left
for Tokyo, and the company scurried to build its own sets from
scratch and arrange for the costumes and props to be flown back to
Los Angeles on a cargo plane.</TE>

<LD>Eleven years ago, the owners of Erewhon Natural Foods Market built
the Taj Mahal of health food stores. Since 1968, the store had
occupied the corner of Edinburgh and Beverly, and when it moved, the
iconic weathered-redwood building left behind remained a hangout for
granola heads -- first as the Nowhere Cafe, now as VP Discount
Vitamins and Natural Foods.</LD>
<LD>   But the new Erewhon, a few blocks west, was something else again.
Tall and spacious, it defied the previous quasi-Maoist theory of
health-food store merchandising -- there is chaos on the shelves and
the situation is excellent -- by having an actual interior design.</LD>
<LD>   There were carts and aisles wide enough to accommodate them. There
were wine and crackers that didn't taste like cardboard, coffee and a
huge frozen food section. There were cases of prepared food, several
kinds of freshly made soup, sushi and racks of those wheat-free,
sugar-free cookies and muffins that still manage to weigh in at 200
calories.</LD>
<TE>   People, especially diet- and/or image-conscious celebrities, came
from all over Southern California to stock up on vegan and organic
fare. Even as rice cakes found their way onto the shelves at Ralphs
and Trader Joe's hawked organic fruit, it was Erewhon that symbolized
not only the upscaling of vegans and organics-only, but also a
sleeker new image of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Because in the imagination of this country, California, and
especially Southern California, remains a dim and ill-organized
health food store, full of odd people who do odd things like grill
tofu and eschew eggs. Erewhon offered a veneer of sophistication to
this image -- it was the health-food nuts' gourmet store. Let New
York wallow in Dean &amp; DeLuca; BlissBars cost just as much as Belgian
chocolate, and they're better for you.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, everyone's a big fan of soy something; rice milk
comes in six flavors; and a Whole Foods Market, the most successful
of the latest version of high-end health, has opened within sunflower
seed-spitting distance of Erewhon and VP, making a six block-radius
of Fairfax and Beverly an evolutionary chart of the post-millennial
image of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the glinting workaday windows and pale blocks of storefronts,
VP is a footprint from another age, preserved not in amber or shale
but in redwood board and batting -- Marin County, circa 1968, ground
zero for the vegan community in L.A. One step in the door and you are
surrounded by that dark yellow funk of unbagged carrots and sacks of

Health Food Store.</TE>
<TE>   Here carts would be too bourgeoise and they wouldn't take the
corners anyway. No single product occupies more than a foot of shelf
space, except vitamins and tinctures, which fill an entire room.
Freshly prepared food, juices and smoothies come from a tiny counter
in the back and the few tables set out front are occupied by people
you expect to see at a health food store -- girls with pierced
tongues, men with ZZ Topp beards. It is the kind of place where many
of us saw our first organic apple, tasted our first hummus. At VP
there may be only nine kinds of granola, but you can find a glazed
spelt doughnut if you've got a hankering.</TE>
<TE>   Up the street, Erewhon still has the smell, and the spelt,
although the clientele are leaning a bit more toward Gucci, or at
least Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Assistant store manager Alan Kawahara
rolls his eyes a bit when asked how business is apres Whole Foods,
which opened this spring. "We had a slow June," he said. "We always
have a slow June, but this was slower. Things are better now. It
always picks up in September."</TE>
<TE>   Kawahara has worked at Erewhon off and on since the mid-'70s. He
doesn't want to talk about Whole Foods; he's never been in the nearby
one on 3rd Street, doesn't plan to go anytime soon. "We serve the
macrobiotic community," he says pointedly. "We have customers who go
there too, but the vegetarians really don't need to; they stay here."</TE>
<TE>   Whole Foods smells nothing like a health food store. According to
a card on the suggestions board, it recently stopped burning incense
when customers complained of sinus trouble. It smells like lemons,
cheese, seafood, cappuccino and marinara, depending on which aisle
you're in.</TE>
<TE>   If Erewhon has more stuff than VP (17 types of granola), Whole
Foods has more than God. More granola (19 kinds), more coated
pretzels (peanut butter, chocolate, yogurt, raspberry yogurt), and
more macaroni and cheese (22 types, most organic, none of them
Kraft.)</TE>
<TE>   As one customer of both markets put it, after perusing the Whole
Foods hot and cold food bar -- Sonoma chicken salad, gaucho marinated
flank steak -- the stuff at Erewhon looks like something Mother
Teresa dished out in Calcutta.</TE>
<TE>   The store anchors what used to be an inarguably scuzzy strip mall.
But now the homeless can barely navigate their shopping carts through
the parking lot so jammed is it with Jags and SUVs. Now, celebrities
buy persimmons here; laptop-wielding hipsters balance their coffee
and fruit-sweetened muffins while vying with well-coiffed retirees
for space at the outside tables; infants in $40 caps from Fred
Segal's dangle from Baby Bjorns while Mom scrutinizes the organic
strained squash.</TE>
<TE>   Whole Foods is not trying to kid anyone -- its whole point is to
wed the gourmet with the natural, and if the vegan can't hack it,
well, they can grab some mangoes on the way out. Because fruit and
nuts have gone national and granola is so mainstream, you gotta add
hemp just to stay current.</TE>
<TE>   Which is exactly what's happened to California, now the fifth
largest economy in the world. As its largest urban center, Los
Angeles can no longer be considered odd or fey or quirky or any of
the pejorative endearments reserved for the habits of those outside
the mainstream. More and more, the world is running on Pacific time,
and like it or not, L.A. is the mainstream. What we wear, the world
wears; what we watch, the world watches; what we eat, the world eats.</TE>
<TE>   So let them eat Sonoma chicken salad, but also let them eat spelt.</TE>

<HD>LACMA finds itself in two funding worlds</HD>
<DH>The museum welcomes a $10-million Annenberg endowment but
its construction project may be delayed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has good news and bad news.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that the Annenberg Foundation has given the
museum $10 million to establish a special endowment fund to support
exhibitions, art acquisitions and educational programs at the
discretion of the museum's director, Andrea L. Rich.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news is that fund-raising for the museum's massive
building project has been stalled by the gloomy economy. Although the
Annenberg gift goes toward efforts to raise $100 million -- on top of
LACMA's current $77-million endowment -- it does not further the
cause of the new building, designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas
and estimated to cost $200 million to $300 million.</LD>
<TE>   That fund-raising campaign, still in its "quiet phase," suffered a
setback in last month's general election when a $250-million bond
measure for improvements at county museums failed to pass. The bond
would have given $98 million to LACMA, provided that the museum
raised $112.5 million on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Rich acknowledged that the next stage of the project -- more
detailed drawings by the architect -- may be postponed. "We are
looking deeply at the feasibility of pressing forward on the building
at this time because of the economic conditions," she said.
Fund-raising will continue, but the emphasis may shift temporarily to
programs and endowment, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Annenberg donation is an important part of the total
package, Rich said. "Building the endowment has always been part of
our campaign because it's the future of this institution. I had an
opportunity to direct this gift and this is what I chose.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like gold," she said. "It gives us new flexibility and
allows us to act quickly to take advantage of opportunities we would
otherwise miss." No money from the new endowment has been allotted,
but it might be used when the museum can't find a sponsor for a
special exhibition or a fund-raising effort for an art acquisition
falls short of the purchase price, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new endowment was established at the behest of Wallis
Annenberg, vice president of the 13-year-old Annenberg Foundation,
which supports communication through education, the arts and
community projects. The daughter of publisher and philanthropist
Walter H. Annenberg, who died Oct. 1, she joined the museum's board
of trustees earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of the gift, LACMA has named its top job the Wallis
Annenberg directorship. Although naming positions for donors is
relatively new in the art world, it is common practice at
universities, said Rich, who hopes this is the beginning of a trend
at LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   "This sets a standard for the naming of positions that can be
extremely helpful to us as we move ahead in a fund-raising campaign,"
she said. "I would like to see all of our chief curatorships named
with substantial endowments."</TE>
<TE>   The museum has received other gifts from the Annenbergs. In 1991
the foundation contributed $10 million to LACMA's endowment and in
1999 it donated $100,000 to provide arts education training for Los
Angeles elementary school teachers. Last year, Wallis Annenberg
endowed a curatorial fellowship program with a $1-million gift.</TE>

<HD>Faithfull wanders, then returns home</HD>
<DH>The singer tries upbeat, but it's moody intensity that
transforms her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marianne Faithfull began her Royce Hall concert Sunday with an
uncharacteristically sunny declaration, exhuming Carole King and
Gerry Goffin's 1964 Herman's Hermits hit "I'm Into Something Good."</LD>
<LD>   She kept some of the song's British Invasion buoyancy, but if
anyone thought that the veteran English singer was about to seriously
scrap the strains of trouble and torment that have defined her music,
she quickly set them straight by moving right into the more downbeat
mood of her early-'80s song "Falling From Grace."</LD>
<LD>   Faithfull does try to broaden things on her new CD, "Kissing
Time," a sort of art-rock counterpart to Santana's "Supernatural" in
which esteemed elder teams with young moderns -- in her case, Beck,
Billy Corgan, Blur, Pulp, et al.</LD>
<TE>   It's a good way to loosen the shackles of the image that's clung
to her since she crawled from the wreckage of her personal life in
the late '70s with "Broken English" -- damaged innocent turned proud
if shaken survivor, the ingenue voice of "As Tears Go By" replaced by
a fearsome croak suitable for the scornful social screed of John
Lennon's "Working Class Hero" and the betrayed lover's cathartic rant
"Why'd Ya Do It?"</TE>
<TE>   But the new collaborations are more bland than breakthrough, and
they dominated the perfunctory and uninvolving first half of Sunday's
concert. Faithfull, backed by a four-piece band, was straightforward
and casual, but she doesn't have the vocal technique to create
character and point of view purely by singing.</TE>
<TE>   Her strength is as a singing actress in the cabaret tradition, and
when the set hit its home stretch of signature songs from her
comeback period -- "Broken English," "Working Class Hero," "Why'd Ya
Do It?" -- Faithfull was transformed, extending her vocal range to
accommodate the stories, delivering the lyrics with a startling
vehemence.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been more practiced, but it was also gripping. The
fact that she followed that fusillade with the one new song that
might match its emotion and intensity, the Pulp-powered "Sliding
Through Life on Charm," was one indication that Faithfull could still
have a notable future to go with one of pop music's most colorful
pasts.</TE>

<HD>Reliving the madness</HD>
<DH>Cast members of a comedy classic gather for a special
screening and to recall the film's unlikely beginnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was meant to be the movie comedy to end all movie comedies. And
clocking in at four hours (plus an intermission) when it opened the
Cinerama Dome in 1963, "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" certainly
was the longest comedy ever made.</LD>
<LD>   Produced and directed by the late Stanley Kramer, best known for
such socially conscious dramas as "The Defiant Ones," "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner" and "Judgment at Nuremberg," the frenetic comedy
starred Spencer Tracy along with some of the greatest comic actors of
the time, including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Edie Adams, Buddy
Hackett, Ethel Merman, Jonathan Winters, Phil Silvers, Dick Shawn,
Terry-Thomas, Mickey Rooney, Stan Freberg, Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny
and Buster Keaton. Filled with slapstick stunts, spectacular car
chases and crashes, the comedy revolved around a group of average,
upstanding Americans who turn into a greedy horde after they are
given the key to locating $350,000 in stolen bank loot from a dying
mobster (Jimmy Durante).</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the American Cinematheque is presenting a new
35-millimeter print of a two-hour, 41-minute version of the film and
a cast and crew reunion hosted by Karen Sharpe Kramer, the widow of
the director. Among those scheduled to appear are Winters, Caesar,
Rooney, Adams, Peter Falk, Don Knotts, Madlyn Rhue, editor Robert
Jones, stuntman Loren Janes and casting director Lynn Stalmaster. The
cast and crew also will give a posthumous award to Stanley Kramer for
making the movie. MGM/UA and Turner Classic Movies are sponsoring the
event.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer, Stalmaster, Adams and Winters recently reminisced about
the making of the film and its enduring appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Beginnings</TE>
<TE>   Karen Sharpe Kramer: Some critic wrote about Stanley that he was
probably the greatest serious filmmaker of the 20th century and the
conscience of Hollywood, but he felt Stanley Kramer could never,
never make a comedy. That is all you had to say to Stanley. He loved
a challenge of proving you wrong, and he loved the element of
surprise, so he set out to make the comedy of all comedies. It was
the precursor to many other films -- "The Great Race," "Those
Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" and "Bullitt."</TE>
<TE>   The Credits</TE>
<TE>   Kramer: Saul Bass did the cartoons, and it was the first time the
credits had been in cartoon form. The picture was five hours
originally and then cut down to almost four hours with an
intermission. During the intermission -- this is the first time this
was ever done -- he had an interactive intermission. The police calls
were over the loudspeakers to keep the continuity of the story line.
The calls were in the bathrooms talking about the characters, outside
the theater and in the lobby. The stunts had never been done before
either. "Bullitt" copied the car chases, and who can forget the
airplane flying through the roadside. That had never been done before
either.</TE>
<TE>   Casting</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Stalmaster: It was obviously a very complex picture to cast,
and Stanley had a lot of people in mind that he wanted as the script
was being written. The biggest task in this was orchestrating of
schedules. Can you imagine? You couldn't just say, "Come and do a
couple of days." Most of my efforts were, as always, before the film
started. But then my office and I continually had to be checking
schedule changes and weather because there was so much exterior
[filming]. It was a continual process to keep track of where this
enormous ensemble was and what they were doing. It was really a
one-of-a-kind experience for me.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Winters: I hadn't done any pictures before. Stanley
called and said, "This is Stanley Kramer and I am calling from
Hollywood and I would like to talk to you about appearing in 'It's a
Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.' " Spencer Tracy is in it; Dick Shawn, and
he went on and on. I said, "Oh, my God." He said you would have one
of the leads and you'd be on it for six months. You can talk to your
agent to see if you'd like to do it. I said, "Think I would like to
do it? I already have my bathrobe off and I am ready to come
tomorrow." I turned to my wife and said this is going to be the
biggest break of my career.</TE>
<TE>   I look back over 50 years, and there is no doubt in my mind of all
the things I have done, "Mad World" got more response than anything
else. The great thing about it was not only was the picture a classic
comedy, but I really got to know and become a dear friend of
Stanley's.</TE>
<TE>   Edie Adams: I adore comics. I think they are the salt of the
earth. Everybody had to be in this picture. Jack Benny said, "I'll do
anything." So did Jerry Lewis. Every day we would look in the paper
to see who would be in it. The first job that I had [after the death
of her husband, Ernie Kovacs] was with every comic in the history of
the world that I had ever dreamed about or had known.</TE>
<TE>   The Experience</TE>
<TE>   Kramer: He [Stanley Kramer] had probably the best time he has ever
had on any of his films. I know this was a real challenge. People
thought he could never make a comedy, but if you look at any of
Stanley's films there is humor in all of them anyway. He had that
ability to write comedy, and he had his dear friend Spencer Tracy
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Winters: Sid Caesar became such a good friend. I think we were in
awe of each other. Each guy was a giant without getting in each
other's way. We were just a bunch of giants thrown together, and it
was one of the few times I couldn't wait to get to work because we
had so many laughs off camera. But there was very little ad-libbing.
Stanley was very tough about the script, and I think only one time I
ad-libbed. Dick Shawn and I are in the pit trying to get the treasure
out and he kept calling me "baby" and I turned to him for some reason
and I said, "Stop calling me baby."</TE>
<TE>   It was a difficult shoot. It was 125 degrees with the Klieg lights
and the sun. They used Palm Springs [as the main location] because in
the summertime nobody was there to speak of, so we shot all over that
area and Santa Monica and Twentynine Palms. I was in pretty good
shape but I must have lost 25 pounds with the heat</TE>
<TE>   Adams: Everybody was so congenial. Everyone knew what they were
doing, and that's why it worked. Spencer Tracy was such a good
friend. Katharine Hepburn used to come with this beautiful basket of
lunch and spread this lovely tablecloth and sit on the grass. I
thought, look how lovely they are.</TE>

<HD>From the Disney vault</HD>
<DH>Four new DVD sets unearth choice cartoons and other
archival material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To celebrate Walt Disney's 100th birthday last December, Walt Disney
Home Entertainment released four two-disc DVD sets called "Walt
Disney Treasures." The discs featured episodes from Disney's two
prime-time TV series, Technicolor Mickey Mouse cartoons from the
1930s, Silly Symphonies animated shorts from that decade and all five
episodes of the '50s miniseries "Davy Crockett."</LD>
<LD>   The sets were gold to Disney buffs and baby boomers, and sold like
hot cakes. In fact, they sold out. "They have done outstanding," says
Robert Chapek, president of Buena Vista Home Entertainment. "We
originally thought it would appeal to fans and collectors, but it
also hit the mass market with families and adults 30-plus
appreciating them as pure entertainment."</LD>
<LD>   The success of the first edition of "Treasures" has spawned a
follow-up package of sets, released under the expanded title of "Walt
Disney Treasures: Wave 2" ($33 each) and arriving in stores today.
"Mickey Mouse in Black and White" includes all of Mickey's early
black-and-white cartoons; "The Complete Goofy" showcases all of the
beloved goofball's cartoons; and "Behind the Scenes at the Walt
Disney Studios" features many of Disney's early shorts about his
studio and episodes from his '50s TV series revolving around
animation.</LD>
<TE>   All discs are introduced by film historian Leonard Maltin, author
of the book "The Disney Films," and feature such supplemental
material as rare or unseen archival material, story sketch sequences,
production art galleries, publicity and memorabilia galleries and
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Maltin actually came up with the idea of "Treasures" a few years
back. "I had met with Dick Cook, who is the chairman of the Disney
Co.," Maltin says. "He knows Disney and understands Disney. We had a
breakfast meeting and I said you have all of this wonderful material
in your vault. Some of it has never been on video and some that has
hasn't been presented in the best way. And now with DVD there are so
many opportunities created, things that can be done to showcase this
wonderful stuff. And he said, 'Let's do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Mouse made his debut in 1928's "Steamboat Willie," the
short that also marked the first use of synchronized sound in
animation.</TE>
<TE>   These shorts, which end with 1935's "Mickey's Service Station,"
also marked the big-screen debuts of Minnie Mouse, Pluto and Goofy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing to actually watch the character evolve film by film
and year by year," Maltin says. "In a sense you are watching
animation evolve film by film and year by year. When you go back and
look at anything written about Walt from that period, he was
constantly exhorting his staff -- 'we have got to do better.' So it
is not accidental that it has a forward thrust."</TE>
<TE>   In his introductions, Maltin also puts into historical context
some politically incorrect scenes -- a few sequences, for example,
satirize Al Jolson's blackface routines -- in the early Mickey Mouse
cartoons. Maltin was glad that Disney included those cartoons
unedited.</TE>
<TE>   "They understood that it made sense to do it this way, especially
in a set that is so clearly aimed at collectors and Disney buffs as
well as kids," Maltin says. "I think this is the right way to do it,
not to censor, not to chop, but set it in the proper context and let
people judge for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to put them out just naked without some type of
explanation," Chapek notes.</TE>
<TE>   Maltin also explains in the introductions that the characters in
the Mickey Mouse cartoons often smoke, drank and even spit tobacco,
and that the humor was often crude by today's standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The people making these were not sophisticated people," Maltin
says. "Walt was not a sophisticated person. I think he became one,
but he wasn't [early in his career] and neither were his colleagues.
A lot of them came from simple backgrounds. I call it barnyard humor
and that was their stock in trade. Showing someone's long johns and
pantaloons was funny stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Disney character that went through the greatest change
has been Goofy.</TE>
<TE>   "First there was this guy with the hyena laugh, and then they
found the endearing qualities in him and made him a lovable hick. In
the 1940s, they came up with this wonderfully off-the-wall idea of
having him demonstrate sports, and it worked so well. Those are some
of my all-time favorite cartoons. And then the final evolution of
Goofy is as a suburban dad and father."</TE>
<TE>   Maltin says that Disney has committed to a "Wave 3."</TE>

<LD>Many more families bought a DVD or VHS copy of "Ice Age" than tickets
to any of the top movies last weekend, including two new animated
films.</LD>
<LD>   Video sales of the computer-animated hit reached about $120
million Tuesday through Sunday, 20th Century Fox home entertainment
reported.</LD>
<LD>   That figure was nearly equivalent to the combined theatrical take
of the top four films for Wednesday through Sunday, and almost four
times as much as the two new animated films, Disney's "Treasure
Planet" and Sony's "Eight Crazy Nights," combined.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's total was based on sales of 7 million units out of 15
million shipped to stores. Of units sold, 60% were DVDs.</TE>

<LD>A record 54 countries have submitted entries for Oscar consideration
in the foreign-language film category, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences said Monday. Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Chad
submitted films for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Some films, such as Mexico's "El Crimen del Padre Amaro" and
France's "8 Women," have already been released in the United States.
But most of the films have not been seen by U.S. audiences, and it is
not necessary that they receive U.S. distribution for academy
consideration.</LD>
<LD>   The academy's foreign-language film committee will begin screening
the films Wednesday. Nominations will be announced Feb. 11. The
Academy Awards will be held March 23 at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood and broadcast live on ABC.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox, hoping to trump the ABC reality-based hit "The Bachelor,"
announced that seven episodes of a show called "Joe Millionaire" will
begin airing Jan. 6 and run Mondays at 9 p.m. The hook of the show
involves a bachelor and 20 hopeful single women. Only this time, the
women fly to France to meet the man who, unbeknownst to them, is not
a millionaire but an average Joe given a make-over.</LD>
<LD>   "Joe Millionaire" is being produced by Rocket Sciences
Laboratories, the same production company behind Fox's "Temptation
Island." Overseeing "Joe Millionaire" is Mike Darnell, Fox's
executive vice president of alternative programming and specials --
and a longtime compatriot in the reality-TV wars of Mike Fleiss, who
is enjoying success as executive producer of "The Bachelor."</LD>

<HD>Vietnamese give green light to show 'Quiet American'</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HANOI</DL>
<LD>"The Quiet American," a movie that was almost not released in the
United States, is being warmly welcomed by communist Vietnam, which
praises it as an accurate portrayal of early American involvement in
Indochina.</LD>
<LD>   The Southeast Asian country has not been as happy about other
Hollywood flicks, condemning the portrayal of the Vietnam War in Mel
Gibson's "We Were Soldiers" and particularly the role played by
Vietnamese actor Don Duong, who has been branded a traitor.</LD>
<LD>   But the Phillip Noyce adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 book that
was partly shot in Vietnam and stars Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser
has been given the green light.</LD>
<TE>   "Senior leaders of the Culture and Information Ministry have
watched the film and agreed for it to be shown widely in Vietnam,"
Nguyen Van Tinh, deputy director of the International Relations
Department of the culture and information office was quoted as saying
in Monday's Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Noyce, whose credits include "The Bone Collector," "Patriot Games"
and "The Saint," is scheduled to arrive in Vietnam on Dec. 16 for the
local premiere, according to the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The film is set in the early 1950s and depicts a country wracked
by war as collapsing French colonial rule gives way to increasing
U.S. involvement on what was seen as a front line against communism.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier movie adaptation in 1958 fudged the ending to make it
acceptable to U.S. audiences, while the remake is more faithful to
the book.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, who died in 1991, had been closely watched by the FBI, who
tagged him as anti-American for his meetings with people such as
Cuba's Fidel Castro.</TE>

<HD>Reissue of Barris' book raises troubling issues anew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no business like show business for recycling ideas and
presenting them anew every generation or so. Whether the initial idea
had merit doesn't seem to matter. Following in this hallowed
tradition, Chuck Barris of 1970s-era "The Gong Show" fame has
reissued his "unauthorized autobiography" (wink-wink, nudge-nudge) 20
years after its first appearance to coincide with the release of a
Miramax film based on the book.</LD>
<LD>   If anything's changed since the initial 1982 release of
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," it's the crystalline realization
of how tasteless, vulgar and misogynistic this book is. Filled with
an overwhelming number of words I can't reproduce here, many of which
are derogatory terms for women and their anatomy, Barris' burlesque
telling of his life story tries to straddle the worlds of parody and
memoir -- and fails in that effort.</LD>
<LD>   At least, that's what I think the book does; it's very hard to
tell amid Barris' indulgence in teen-boy bathroom humor and puzzling
storytelling. In addition to describing his masterminding and hosting
of "The Gong Show," the creation and producing of "The Dating Game,"
"The Newlywed Game" and other push-the-limits-of-good-taste game
shows, Barris claims he was also a CIA operative and high-level
assassin, murdering some 30 people throughout his illustrious career.</LD>
<TE>   A joke, right? He devotes large portions of the narrative to his
CIA years, how he balanced assassination assignments with his game
show work. When he scouted for date locations on behalf of "The
Dating Game," or served as a chaperon for dates, such was only a
cover so that he could murder more people. Not satisfied with being a
top-dog bad-taste cultural celebrity, Barris was also "a CIA agent
worthy of Soviet surveillance: a celebrity status among international
hit men."</TE>
<TE>   It's a prank played too long, detailing executions and spy
maneuvers without providing sufficient background to make us even
pretend to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Telling of an early crisis in his television career, for example,
Barris writes of flying to Paris in the hopes there'd be someone
there to assassinate in order to drown out his occupational angst.
"If I can't entertain my countrymen," he whines, "at least I can
assassinate their enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the same time, he's completely earnest in telling details
of his more mundane persona as an impresario: itemizing the myriad
women he slept with, the times he hid out in hotel rooms too dejected
over his career to do much other than order room service, how he took
to wearing disguises so that his fans would give him a moment's
peace, and the emotional devastation he suffered when social
commentators took issue with his television productions.</TE>
<TE>   Which they did. At the height of his fame, many had harsh words
for Barris' work. He recounts, for example, catching a televised
debate on public television from Princeton University in which (by
Barris' own characterization), "an extremely intelligent critic of
the arts" took issue with the broadcasting executives of the day for
giving viewers "Chuck Barris and his trash." He quotes another
commentator calling his game shows "unremittingly witless, tasteless,
illiterate and stupid ... display[ing] what seems to be [Barris']
almost psychotic hatred of women."</TE>
<TE>   From his writing, it's clear that Barris is smart enough to know
that what he's selling is trash and to realize that if he manipulates
us just so, we'll keep lining up for more.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, his narrative falls prey to the same divergent
impulses that doomed his 1980 big-screen effort, "The Gong Show
Movie." As he tells the story, the film began well enough. "It was
zany and wild. If at that point the movie didn't appeal to the
intelligentsia, it certainly would entertain the 'Gong Show' faithful
.... But unfortunately, just about a third of the way through, I
couldn't resist trying to make a serious motion picture. A film that
said something. It was a disastrous mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Like that film, Barris' book sets out to be as offensive and
gag-filled as possible and fails to meet that objective when he takes
himself seriously. It's a plus for the reader, though, because the
discussion on why his ribald shows flourished is fascinating and
readers might have appreciated a genuine look into that moment in
time when his transgressive tactics worked, when he crossed
previously untested boundaries of taste and societal standards and
pushed the limits of acceptable TV.</TE>
<TE>   That moment, however, has passed. Now his shtick is neither new
nor reckless. In the case of this book, it's not even re-warmed for
our consumption, just reprinted with all its tiresome and banal
qualities intact.</TE>
<TE>   The book's reappearance on the cultural scene, though, raises many
questions beyond the credibility of Barris' CIA claims: Why is it
that people who are willing to make fools of themselves will always
get an audience? Why are we happy to let smart people act stupid and
pander to our lowest selves, paying them a mint for doing so? And the
$64,000 question: Why are we, as a culture, continuing to do it 20
years later?</TE>

<HD>Puzzling filmgoers, with serious intent</HD>
<DH>The coolly received drama 'Solaris' aims to challenge
audiences with tough questions, say its star and director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A meditation on cosmic questions concerning God and existence is not
what mainstream moviegoers have come to expect from a science-fiction
film, but that's exactly what "Solaris" delivers. Critics are divided
and audiences appear to have given it thumbs down, but Steven
Soderbergh and George Clooney say their intention was to summon the
cinematic spirit of the late '60s and '70s, when moviegoing was more
challenging, provocative and adventurous -- at least in nostalgic
hindsight.</LD>
<LD>   The film, which took in less than $10 million in its opening
weekend, was meant to be enigmatic, to stir debate, according to
writer-director Soderbergh, who not only freely adapted the 1961
novel by Stanislaw Lem and the 1972 Russian film by Andrei Tarkovsky,
but giddily riffed on another mind-blower, Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A
Space Odyssey."</LD>
<LD>   Audiences accustomed to Clooney's lighter touch also may be
disconcerted to see him in a prolonged state of grief over the death
of his wife (played by Natascha McElhone), who reappears as a
mysterious visitor aboard a space station orbiting the eponymous
planet that is having inexplicable effects on the occupants of the
station.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it would be fun to make a movie where you remembered
where you were when you saw it -- that it was not a casual
experience," Soderbergh says. " 'Oh, yeah, when I saw "Solaris," I
was at the such-and-such on the Saturday after it opened, and
afterward we went for coffee.' " He would like to think "it had an
imprint."</TE>
<TE>   "People keep asking if this is a commercial movie, if this is an
audience movie. And my attitude is, 'Dude, it's the ultimate audience
movie because it's about what you bring to it, because you have to
watch the movie and declare for yourself where you stand on all these
issues." Is McElhone real? Is she a hallucination? Is she created by
Solaris? Is Solaris an evolving organism that feeds off humanity? Is
there life after death?</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about this is that, as they say in the movie,
there are no answers, only choices," Clooney adds. "Each one of you
gets to go home and make a decision, and each of those decisions is
right -- you're not wrong with any of them. Your belief system, your
question of God, whatever." The actor believes there's a relevant
moral lesson to be drawn from "Solaris," given our terror-stricken
post-Sept. 11 environment. "What's interesting is that it's a
metaphor that allows for different beliefs in a time when people are
killing each other more and more based on their own religious belief
system."</TE>
<TE>   Still, what happens in "Solaris" is clear to Soderbergh, even
though he maintains that's beside the point. "I've made it so that it
withstands religious and secular interpretations. My point of view is
that there isn't an answer to the big questions, and we have to
resign ourselves to that."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly for the eclectic director, who years ago saw the original
(just released on DVD by Criterion) and later read the novel (just
republished by Harcourt), revisiting "Solaris" was too enticing an
opportunity to pass up.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the premise: A second chance at love ... the issue of
memory is something that recurs in some of the things I've made, and
this seemed to be the ultimate memory film because you're dealing
with a guy who has to interact with the physical manifestation of his
memory. And that manifestation is aware of the fact that it's a
manifestation, and isn't entirely happy about it, so for me it was
the perfect memory movie, and maybe I've gotten it out of my system
now."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, watching "Solaris" will stir memories of "2001" (the
somber and claustrophobic station, the metaphysical sense of awe),
"Last Tango in Paris" and various films by Michelangelo Antonioni and
Ingmar Bergman. Through it all, Soderbergh and Clooney give us a
taste of an era when American cinema had a European flavor and was
hip to existential angst.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody called it a dormitory movie," Soderbergh says.
"Everybody's hanging out in doorways, there's always rock music on.
It's true, it really is. But I've been pretending that we're in the
late '60s and early '70s for my whole career, actually. What happened
was they lost control of themselves and then they lost control of
their films. That's the lesson I drew from that era.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to adopt the idea of infusing American material with a
European film aesthetic. I mean, that was their great contribution.
What's been running the industry in this country since the beginning
of cinema is the studio versus the auteur. Who is in control of the
movie? And it goes back and forth."</TE>
<TE>   But then that's why Soderbergh and Clooney started their own
company, Section Eight, in the first place -- to make riskier, more
personal films within the Hollywood system at a lower price. The
results this year include "Welcome to Collinwood" and "Far From
Heaven," and next month will see the release of Clooney's directorial
debut, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what we're trying to do is say, 'Why can't we do the
aesthetic that came from [that era]?' " Clooney says. "And the way we
do it is, we throw our money out, we don't do it for cash. We just
try to push an indie sensibility within the Hollywood mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   While "Solaris" was an ambitious stretch for the director, it was
even more so for the easygoing actor, who was working out of his
usual element. "There isn't comedy, there isn't a considerable amount
of other actors [to interact with], there's not action, there's
nothing you can hide behind. There was a lot of stuff that came out
about my being naked" -- which initially resulted in an R rating but
was successfully appealed to a PG-13. "Believe me, that's the least
naked I am in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult as an actor to go through the experience of
dread and deep-down-to-the-bone fear. There's nothing harder than
stillness. And I thought the only way I was going to try it was
because I trusted Steven as a filmmaker and as a friend."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the lone opportunity Clooney had to lighten up --
during an extensive flashback sequence when he first meets McElhone
in a bar -- was obliterated by a personal tragedy. "It was a night
shoot on a Saturday, and that afternoon I was with my Aunt Rosemary"
Clooney, the singer and actress.</TE>
<TE>   "I left, she died two hours later, and the one time I get a little
light on this shoot, I couldn't get alone quick enough. Sometimes
what's reality and what seems like triviality come together when you
least expect it."</TE>

<HD>It's still a 'wunnerful' life on the Welk family farm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Boldt</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STRASBURG, N.D</DL>
<LD>STRASBURG, N.D. -- It has been decades since anyone has lived on the
small farmstead that made this small North Dakota farming community
famous.</LD>
<LD>   But listen carefully. As visitors drive up from the gravel road,
they can hear the "champagne music" flowing freely from the barn
where Lawrence Welk used to play his accordion.</LD>
<LD>   "His sisters would get so sick of him playing that thing that they
would send him out to the barn," said Welk's niece, Edna Schwab.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years after Welk's death at age 89, people still visit his
family farm, tune into reruns of "The Lawrence Welk Show" on public
television, and join fan clubs celebrating the "wunnerful, wunnerful"
orchestra leader.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab is one of several local people who gives tours of the Welk
farmstead two miles outside Strasburg, a town of about 550 people. A
life-size cutout of the King of Champagne Music greets visitors as
they walk into the sod house in which he, his parents and seven
siblings lived. The homestead, which includes a summer kitchen,
granary, buggy house, blacksmith shop, outhouse and barn, was
restored and opened for tours in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   This year about 3,000 people visited the site, about 100 miles
south of Bismarck and two miles off the "Lawrence Welk" highway.</TE>
<TE>   Welk left his family farm on his 21st birthday. He didn't hit the
big time for more than 20 years, with a 1951 TV appearance. ABC
picked up his show in 1955 and it ran for 16 years.</TE>

<HD>Do Sandler's goofy lyrics fuel Jewish pride or
anti-Semitism?</HD>
<DH>In its third edition, the 'Eight Crazy Nights' theme outs
celebrity Jews and reignites the debate over its message.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Farhi</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started as a throwaway bit on "Saturday Night Live." Cast member
Adam Sandler, confronted with a stable of Christmas songs, decided to
give equal time to Hanukkah. Dispensing with the usual trappings of
the holiday -- the dreidels and latkes -- he outed celebrities who
are Jewish.</LD>
<LD>   "David Lee Roth lights the menorah," Sandler first sang in 1994.
"So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas and the late Dinah Shore-ah."</LD>
<LD>   The ditty quickly disappeared, only to resurface on Sandler's 1996
comedy album, "What the Hell Happened to Me?" Soon, a video version
of the song began airing on MTV, and radio stations started putting
it on their playlists. The album sold 3 million copies. And a
Hanukkah classic -- or at least the first Hanukkah pop song widely
embraced by non-Jews -- was born.</LD>
<TE>   After releasing an updated version in 1999 ("So many Jews are in
show biz / Bruce Springsteen isn't but my mother thinks he is"),
Sandler has leveraged his two-minute shtick into a full-fledged
entertainment franchise. The latest version, "The Chanukah Song, Part
3," is the theme music for a new Sandler-produced and -voiced
animated musical movie, "Eight Crazy Nights," a title that refers
both to the duration of the holiday that started Friday night at
sunset and a line from the original song.</TE>
<TE>   The third iteration is just as musically primitive and lyrically
challenged as the original (Sandler rhymes "Hanukkah" with "high
colonic-ah" this time out), but it retains the same goofy charm and
subject matter. "Houdini and David Blaine escape straitjackets with
such precision," Sandler sings. "But one thing they could not get out
of: their painful circumcision."</TE>
<TE>   Question is, what's so funny about identifying who's a Jew? Why is
Sandler's song so entertaining to so many people, particularly Jewish
people?</TE>
<TE>   To some Jews, the songs are a source of pride, even a cultural
milestone. It's not that anyone needs reminding that "so many Jews
are in show biz"; Jews have been behind popular movies and TV shows
for decades. But they've often buried their heritage by changing
their names (Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch, and Winona
Ryder was Winona Horowitz, for instance). Or, like Woody Allen and
Mel Brooks, they use it as a source of comic self-deprecation. Some,
like Jerry Seinfeld, rarely raise the subject at all.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Jews appreciate that Sandler has had the chutzpah to
proclaim his Jewishness (and that of others) loudly and proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "The historical memory for Jews of Sandler's parents and
grandparents' generation was to hide out, to not go public," says
Rabbi Irwin Kula, president of the National Jewish Center for
Learning and Leadership in New York. "What's amazing about that song,
what makes it important, is that Jews are being outed, and it's no
big deal. It's funny, and it's normal. This is a remarkable moment in
Jewish history and American history. There's no way that song could
have been performed 40 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Jewish people say it's gratifying to learn that
so many disparate people are Jewish. If they say anything at all, the
Sandler songs may say that it's hard to construct an anti-Semitic
stereotype.</TE>
<TE>   What connecting thread is there, after all, among the names
Sandler mentions in his trilogy, including William Shatner, Ann
Landers, the Beastie Boys, Courtney Love (one of her grandparents was
Jewish), Yasmine Bleeth (half Jewish) or "all Three Stooges"? A
separate list of Tribesmen would also include such surprises as
Robert De Niro (his mother was Jewish, making him a Jew under
religious law), Leslie Howard (the personification of Southern
aristocracy in "Gone With the Wind"), Rosanna Arquette and Ellen
Barkin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it could serve some educational value," said Simon Amiel,
executive director of the Hillel Jewish student organization at
George Washington University. "It's kind of a tool for lessening
ignorance of what a Jew is, does or looks like."</TE>
<TE>   The dark side of all this is that some people don't want to be
outed, and such labeling can be perverted to justify racism and
anti-Semitism. Asked by the Los Angeles Times two years ago, former
neo-Nazi skinhead Tom Leyden said that Sandler's songs helped fuel
his racial hatred. "I found it to be a funny song, and it enabled me
to say, 'The Jews control everything,' " Leyden said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, "if you don't ever talk about who's Jewish, then you bury the
Jewish cultural achievement," says Nate Bloom, the editor of
Jewhoo.com, an encyclopedic Web site of Jewish celebrities. "If it's
always a little impolite to say it, then you're downgrading it."</TE>
<TE>   (For the record, Bloom points out that Sandler's songs contain
several mistakes: Harrison Ford, for example, isn't "a quarter
Jewish," but fully so, given his mother's heritage, and baseball
great Rod Carew never converted to Judaism, although he did marry a
Jewish woman.)</TE>
<TE>   Not all Jews are enamored of Sandler's songs, or their putative
message. Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin, the author of "Searching for My Jewish
Brothers: Jewish Men in a Gentile World" (Putnam, 1999), says the
song ultimately bespeaks a vapid, superficial Jewishness, even
irreligiousness.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these celebrities are Jewish, but you ultimately have to
ask, So what?" he says. "Having reached acceptance in American
society, the next question is, What have you done for your people
lately? Have any of them spoken out for Israel at a time of its
greatest emergency? For the most part, these [Jewish] celebrities are
a vast wasteland. I'm waiting for one of them to stand up and be
counted and speak out for Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Sandler, who declined to be interviewed, certainly seems to have
taken his Jewishness seriously. Though he was born 36 years ago in
very Jewish Brooklyn, his family (mom Judy, dad Stanley, four
children) moved to not-Jewish Manchester, N.H., when Sandler was in
first grade. He was one of only two Jews in his class at Webster
Elementary. When he was an adolescent, he said in an interview with
the New York Post last June, he got into a fight with a kid who made
fun of him for going to Hebrew school.</TE>
<TE>   His fiancee, model-actress Jacqueline Titone, recently converted
to Judaism. Sandler also ensured that the beneficiary of a special
New York screening of "Eight Crazy Nights" was Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, says Jewhoo's Bloom, it's hard to separate this
messenger from his message.</TE>
<TE>   "If many other comedians did this song," he says, "it would be
seen in a very different light. But Sandler, the clown, makes it a
boisterous celebration, and he lets you, no matter who you are, join
in the joke and the 'discoveries.' ... Because Sandler's such a
regular guy, he can be very ethnic and still seem universal."</TE>

<LD>This is what winter looks like in many parts of the world: icy, gray
and snowy.</LD>
<LD>   The artist who painted this snowy scene, Alfred Sisley, worked in
France in the 19th century. He belonged to a group of artists who
were known as Impressionists. They enjoyed painting outdoors and
using rapid brush strokes to capture "impressions" of what they saw.
Because of their "quick and thick" painting style, Impressionist
scenes can look somewhat blurry.</LD>
<LD>   In this painting, Sisley explores different shades of white and
gray to suggest the steely gray sky and the snow-covered farm. The
painting also tells a story about nature and its coldest season.</LD>
<TE>   Sisley paints a few shadowy figures in the field. What are they
doing? Are they at play? What would you want to do in a snowy field
like this one? Try to imagine what this landscape might look like in
spring, summer and fall.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Southern California, you have to go to the mountains to
see a winter landscape like this one.</TE>
<TE>   If you aren't able to get there, you can see Sisley's
"Louveciennes in the Snow" and many other wintry scenes like it at
the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's next Family Day, "Winter Tales," is from 2 to 3 p.m.
Dec. 21. For more information call (626) 844-6980 or visit

<HD>Enthusiasm can't be curbed</HD>
<DH>Consumers have been clamoring for Nat Nast shirts after
they were featured on Larry David's HBO series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NAT Nast has, in the last few weeks, appeared on "Friends," "CSI,"
"West Wing" and "The Sopranos." On a recent "Curb Your Enthusiasm,"
Larry David and guest star Ted Danson played tug of war with Nast's
sleeves -- yes, like two crazed pit bulls, snarling and rolling on
the floor, testosterone at full tilt.</LD>
<LD>   And get this, Nast has been sighted with J. Lo -- and photographed
all over Ben Affleck, People magazine's sexiest man alive. And we do
mean all over, because Nat Nast, you see, is a shirt, actually a
men's clothing label, that is riding a wave of popularity on the big
screen, in splashy magazine spreads and on the tube.</LD>
<LD>   When Wendy Range-Rao, the costumer for "Curb Your Enthusiasm," was
scouting for a shirt for a subplot of an episode of the HBO show -- a
series centered on the absurd situations that David, cast regulars
and Hollywood stars who play themselves get into -- she was sold on a
$125 long-sleeved, color-blocked Nast silk creation she found at Sy
Devore, a men's shop in Studio City.</LD>
<TE>   "She wanted a great shirt that had presence and was recognizable
without being too much of a costume piece, so I showed her a few of
the Nast shirts," says Danny Marsh, a Devore partner who works with
several costumers and stylists.</TE>
<TE>   Now, says store owner Marti Devore, "we get calls every day for
the 'Larry David shirt.' " Off screen, the Nast shirts have been a
hit with her customers since she saw them in a New York trade show
three years ago and started carrying them. Devore's father, Al, and
her uncle, Sy, were founding partners in the shop that dressed the
style-setting Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy
Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   And now, the balding and bespectacled Larry David as fashion's
newest trendsetter?</TE>
<TE>   "In our culture, television is the only common denominator, so the
appearance of an interesting product as a plot device becomes
targeted niche marketing. So, yes, Larry David is the fashion icon of
the nanosecond," says David Wolfe of the Doneger Group, a New
York-based firm that analyzes fashion trends. "In my imagination, the
average man is standing there stark naked figuring out what to wear.
If his wife doesn't tell him, then his favorite television show or
television star can."</TE>
<TE>   That's fine by sisters Patty Nast Canton and Barbara Nast Saletan,
the duo behind the label that was founded in 1946 in Kansas City,
Mo., by their father, Nat Nast -- known as the King of the Bowling
Shirts. Nast, a World War II Navy veteran, targeted fans of the
popular postwar pastime with shirts that featured inverted pleats on
the back that allowed for comfort and movement when hurling a ball.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Nast sold his business, which was renamed Swingster and
later sold again and is now known as American Identity. Nast died in
1986 of heart failure at age 69. Earlier this year, he was recognized
by the trade journal Daily News Record as one of the 12 legends of
men's wear along with Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Nast's daughters decided to relaunch their dad's
label and introduced their signature silk embroidered and
color-blocked shirts, which sell from $95 to $160.</TE>
<TE>   In the "Curb" episode, David obsesses over one of those shirts in
cream and black after seeing it in a photograph of a friend's
deceased husband. Where did the dead guy buy the shirt, David
repeatedly asks. He has to know because he's gotta have it. He pushes
the widow into recalling the name of the shop and soon buys the shirt
for himself, another as a gift for Danson and a third as a
replacement should he rip or stain his own.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, as the plot develops, the shirts come to a
catastrophic end: One is stained with blood after David gets whacked
with a bat intended for use on a pinata; another is smeared with
makeup, leaving a Tammy Faye-like imprint on the garment from the
widow who tearfully collapses into it; and the third, meant for
Danson but taken back by David, is pulled apart by the two men.</TE>
<TE>   From Cary Grant's closet</TE>
<TE>   After the episode in October, the Nast sisters logged more than
100 calls to their Connecticut-based firm from retailers who had
customers wanting the shirt; they still get at least 10 to 20 calls a
day about it. Specialty shops ranging from Gary's Island to Fred
Segal, as well as department stores such as Nordstrom and Saks Fifth
Avenue, carry the label.</TE>
<TE>   The Nast collection is growing, and the spring 2003 line includes
more vintage-inspired shirts, trousers, waist jackets and sport coats
-- and even a snazzy white dinner jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think we are creating a closet for Cary Grant with
our clothes," says Canton, president and head designer for Nast, who
will be at Devore's with her sister Dec. 12 to show the line.</TE>
<TE>   Some shirts are whimsical: One features a winding Route 66
pattern, another is adorned with embroidered cocktail glasses. The
one that pops with musical notes is a favorite of Michael Meadows,
vice president of television production at New Wave Entertainment in
Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows is a Nast collector. "I have nine of them," he says, the
first purchased more than two years ago at Devore. These days he gets
a courtesy call when a shipment arrives at the shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I always look for shirts that are interesting and that have a
sense of style and that not everyone else has," he says, adding that
he likes Nast shirts because of the back embroideries and limited
editions of each style. "The musical notes shirt is a limited
edition, No. 38," he says. "Every time I wear that one people ask,
'Who makes that? Where did you get it? I gotta have it.'</TE>
<TE>   "It almost sounds like that Larry David episode."</TE>

<HD>Michelangelo more a prince than a pauper</HD>
<DH>Although he liked to portray himself as a starving artist,
new evidence paints a far different picture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Estelle Shirbon</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Michelangelo, who painted the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel
and designed the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, passed himself off as
poor but was actually too miserly to show his huge wealth, a U.S. art
historian says.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a funny sort of man, somewhat paranoid and somewhat
dishonest, who didn't want it to be known he was fabulously rich,"
Rab Hatfield, a professor at the Florence branch of Syracuse
University, said in an interview Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Michelangelo complained in his old age that he was living in
poverty, but Hatfield says he had amassed a massive fortune from
creating masterworks such as his gleaming white marble David, now in
Florence's Accademia Gallery.</LD>
<TE>   Hatfield has unearthed two of Michelangelo's bank accounts and
numerous deeds of purchase that show the prolific painter, sculptor
and architect was worth about 50,000 gold ducats when he died in
1564, more than many princes and dukes of his time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an enormous, truly enormous amount of money," said
Hatfield, who has published his findings in a book titled "The Wealth
of Michelangelo."</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, he pointed out that the Pitti Palace, a
grandiose construction in central Florence that is now a vast art
gallery, was sold to a duchess during Michelangelo's lifetime for
9,000 gold ducats.</TE>
<TE>   "He liked to keep large amounts of money in a wooden box by his
bed. When he died, 8,400 ducats were found in the box," Hatfield
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the fortune, however, was tied up in real estate,
including a farm near Rome that produced a handsome income, as well
as houses in central Rome and Florence.</TE>
<TE>   "Michelangelo tried to give the impression that his patrons,
especially the popes, had treated him unfairly, when the reverse was
true," Hatfield said. "They paid him extremely good money, but he bit
off more than he could chew and sometimes didn't deliver."</TE>
<TE>   The artist's bank account in Rome showed that Pope Julius II
shelled out colossal advance payments on 40 life-size statues
Michelangelo was supposed to create for the pope's tomb. Busy with
other commissions, Michelangelo completed only three of the statues
-- although one of them, a seated Moses, is among his masterworks.</TE>
<TE>   "If that Moses were on the market today, I can hardly imagine the
sums it would be worth, so in a way you could say the payment was
fair," Hatfield said. "But by the standards of the time, he was way
overpaid."</TE>
<TE>   Hatfield said the legend of a cash-strapped Michelangelo had
endured because the bank accounts hadn't yet come to light and
because it was a more pleasing story than the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "We like our artists to be poor and suffering; we don't like them
to be filthy rich," he said.</TE>

<HD>'David Dreidel's Hanukkah Adventure'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E.G. Walker</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am David Dreidel, dancing across the kitchen floor, whirling around
and around like a ballet dancer. I fall on my hey side right at the
mother's feet.</LD>
<LD>   "Please take that outside," she says. "I'm still making the
Hanukkah cookies and grinding the potatoes for our latkes."</LD>
<LD>   I remember latkes from last year. Of course, I can't eat them, but
they looked so special -- potato pancakes with lace edges. The mother
had to fry many to keep up with everyone's appetites.</LD>
<TE>   "I can hardly wait. Those cookies smell so good." Joey reaches for
one of the cookies. The mother slaps at his hand playfully. "Go on,
get out of here. We'll be lighting the first candle in about a
half-hour, as soon as the sun sets."</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to get some Hanukkah gelt this year?" Simon asks.</TE>
<TE>   I know what that is. It's those chocolate coins covered with gold
and silver foil. Sometimes the dad gives them real coins.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll just have to wait and see," she answers as she shoos them
both out the door.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeee! Here I go. Simon spins me good. Watch me go 'round and
'round. Finally, when I'm exhausted, I fall on my side.</TE>
<TE>   "My turn," Joey yells. Around I go and I dance, going like the
wind.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, come back!" Simon hollers. I skip on down the sidewalk, past
houses with bright lights on the porches, past windows with lighted
Christmas trees inside. I hear children's voices singing "Jingle
Bells." I wonder why they aren't singing my dreidel song. Then I fall
off the curb and land on my nun side. Nobody wins. Especially me.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: What will happen to David Dreidel?</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: A dreidel is a four-sided top used in a game played
during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Each side has a different
Hebrew letter. A shin means give or put in a token. A hey means take
half the tokens. A gimel stands for take all the tokens. A nun means
take nothing. Before each spin of the dreidel, players put a
designated number of tokens in the middle. The first player spins the
dreidel. When the dreidel stops, the letter facing up determines what
the player puts in or takes out.</TE>

<LD>Crikey, mates, look who's chasing crocs! No, not Steve Irwin, that
Aussie bloke who hosts "The Crocodile Hunter." It's Jeff Corwin, that
American dude who hosts "The Jeff Corwin Experience" on Animal
Planet.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from the differences in accents and outfits (Irwin wears a
dark khaki ensemble; Corwin gallivants around in an impossibly clean
blue shirt and light khaki shorts), you could be forgiven for
confusing the two. Especially on tonight's installment of "The Jeff
Corwin Experience," part of Animal Planet's "It's a Wonderful Jeff
Week" featuring new episodes at 8 every night this week.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's premiere finds the charismatic Corwin in Uganda, on the
banks of Lake Victoria and the Nile River. "It's a place where
conflicts between human beings and crocodiles have reached its
zenith, and unfortunately, we're getting casualties on both sides,"
he says, stating that his goal is to work with other naturalists to
catch the creatures and assess whether the crocs should be relocated.</LD>
<TE>   It's a classic tale of necessity forcing humans to encroach into
the habitats of wild animals, which naturally want to defend their
turf and food supplies. And with Uganda's population expected to
double in the next 20 years, Corwin says, the problem will only get
worse.</TE>
<TE>   The locals' solution is to kill the crocodiles, but Corwin wants
to find another way to resolve the conflict. In the process, he
interviews Ugandans who have lost limbs and loved ones in attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Corwin can seem very much an outsider, sometimes almost
patronizing. Yet he retains his likability throughout, exuding boyish
charm especially as he is distracted by other animals, including a
couple of snakes and the playful inhabitants of a chimp sanctuary.
The chimps, it must be said, have weaker bladders than those of the
dogs on "The Osbournes"; but in stark contrast with that show, the
worst thing Corwin exclaims during the hairiest of moments is
"Shoot!"</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Corwin doesn't reach much of a conclusion in this
adventure, other than that crocodiles clearly deserve respect. But
the beautiful shots of scenery and wildlife, and Corwin's engaging
presentation, make the journey worthwhile.</TE>

<HD>OK Rapid HIV Testing Out of Labs</HD>
<DH>FDA should let it be done in vans and poverty areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arleen Leibowitz, Stephanie Taylor and Jonathan Fielding</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a major victory in the battle against HIV/AIDS recently
when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first easy-to-use
"rapid" test for HIV, called OraQuick. This test provides results in
about 20 minutes instead of the two days to two weeks required with
standard HIV tests.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the FDA approved the test for use only in
facilities with certified laboratories. This requirement excludes
OraQuick testing in mobile vans and at other sites that serve
low-income and uninsured populations.</LD>
<LD>   Can the rapid test be safely conducted in sites without a
certified laboratory, such as mobile vans? The rapid test, available
in more than 90 countries, is no more difficult to use than at-home
glucose tests for diabetes.</LD>
<TE>   To conduct the OraQuick HIV test, a person pricks his or her
finger and places a drop of blood in a vial, mixing it with a
solution. The test kit is then inserted into the vial. In 20 minutes
or less, two reddish-purple lines in the test's window will indicate
whether the blood is infected with the HIV virus.</TE>
<TE>   The test is remarkably reliable, with very small percentages of
false negative or false positive results. Nonetheless, any positive
test is confirmed with the standard tests that are currently in use.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County provides free and convenient HIV testing in
mobile vans for those who are at significant risk. But under the
current system, clients served by these vans must return at a later
date to receive their HIV test results.</TE>
<TE>   Results of a 1999 county survey found that 25% of those who
obtained their HIV test in a mobile medical van did not return for
their results. In contrast, 9% of those who were tested in their
doctor's office and 11% of those who were tested in family planning
or community clinics failed to learn the results of their HIV test.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of clients receiving results would be greatly
increased if it were possible to use the OraQuick test to provide
results on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of rapid testing extend to other nontraditional sites
for health-care delivery, such as county jails. The transient nature
of the jail population makes it imperative to provide results as
quickly as possible to the tested inmates.</TE>
<TE>   It is essential that people with HIV learn their status early so
they can receive drugs to delay the onset of AIDS. Further, it is
important that testing be accompanied by counseling to assist clients
in reducing risky behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the importance of counseling and testing, the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established testing to
promote early diagnosis as one of the three elements in a strategic
plan to reduce annual HIV infections by half within five years. The
rapid test will probably be less costly, further enhancing the CDC's
efforts to increase testing.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA should approve the manufacturer's application to waive
restrictions limiting use of the OraQuick rapid test to laboratories.
That federal agency's approval last month of three at-home glucose
tests for diabetes provides a relevant and timely precedent for
granting such a waiver.</TE>
<TE>   The many positive benefits of early identification of people who
are HIV-positive argue for dissemination of the rapid-test technology
to mobile vans and other sites without a certified laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Informing those who are HIV-positive of their status not only
allows them to begin early treatment with effective antiretroviral
medications, it can result in reduction of behavior that carries risk
of transmitting HIV.</TE>

<HD>Add One to Perils of Flying</HD>
<DH>Missiles are only the latest unmet threat to airliners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So why hasn't a shoulder-fired missile attack against a civilian
passenger plane like Thursday's attempt on the Israeli plane in
Mombasa, Kenya, happened sooner? Actually, it has; we just weren't
paying attention.</LD>
<LD>   And that's been the story of American homeland security: It takes
awhile for us to figure out that we're in a new phase in the war on
terrorism -- or, more precisely, terrorism's war on us.</LD>
<LD>   The downing of a plane carrying the president of Rwanda in 1994
was most likely the result of what the Pentagon calls a man-portable
air defense system. The shooting down of a domestic flight in Sri
Lanka in 1998 was certainly the result of such a weapon. Last week,
the Israelis got lucky; both missiles missed their target, a
passenger jet.</LD>
<TE>   Or was it luck? Some speculate that the Israeli plane might have
had counter-measures on board. If that's true, all the more reason to
get on the stick, security-wise, because if terrorists figure they
can't hit an Israeli plane, they might aim for an American one.</TE>
<TE>   So now comes the test for U.S. homeland security. The politicians
agree that an attack is coming sooner or later, probably sooner. But
what will the federal government do about it?</TE>
<TE>   One obvious answer is to order the installation of defensive
antimissile systems -- such as decoy flares to fool heat-seeking
missiles -- on every American plane. But the airlines, mostly broke,
will blanch at the cost. Indeed, isn't this an appropriate task for
the federal government? The estimated cost for installing defensive
systems is $2 million to $3 million per plane.</TE>
<TE>   Multiplied by the 7,000 or so planes in the U.S. commercial
aviation fleet, that works out to a dollar total in the low 11
digits, about what Uncle Sugar doles out to farmers in crop subsidies
every year.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, one never knows what's coming next. A vital asset in
any kind of war is the element of surprise, and the terrorists have
it.</TE>
<TE>   John McDannel, who just retired after nearly four decades as a
pilot for the Air Force and then for United Airlines, recalls that
the pilots aboard the four jets hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, were
following long-established rules. "The standard operating procedure
was to not resist the hijackers," he notes. "Nobody had imagined that
they would turn the planes into bombs."</TE>
<TE>   McDannel is right, to be sure, on how the government thought about
the danger. But such by-the-book thinking was, in itself, a failure
of imagination. The idea of using airplanes as suicide bombs is as
old as the Japanese kamikazes of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Paul Rancatore, an Air Force veteran who had the
experience of being shot at by shoulder-fired missiles when he flew
over Mogadishu, Somalia, in the early 1990s, notes that whatever
countermeasure we install on planes could be trumped by the next
generation of missiles. So what to do?</TE>
<TE>   Rancatore, who now flies for American Airlines, rattles off a long
list of unmet security needs that represent, he believes, even higher
priorities for the future. Like the need to start screening cargo and
food catering, to better guard the perimeters of airports and to
establish minimal background checks for airport service workers and
on-site construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   Rancatore notes that some progress has been made in recent months.
Many cockpit doors are now intruder-proofed, and plans are afoot,
over the objection of the Bush administration, to arm pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots have a morbid name for those safety systems put in place
after an aviation disaster: "tombstone technology." Of course, in
fairness, that's how most people learn, by getting burned once. But
now the question is whether the U.S., having been burned many times
on airline safety, will finally get serious about doing what it takes
to make flying safer--or whether the skies will rain down more
tombstones.</TE>

<HD>Want a Cover-Up Expert? Kissinger's Your Man</HD>
<DH>History puts his credibility at zero in the 9/11 probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president clearly does not want to know the truth about Sept. 11.
Otherwise he would not have appointed Henry Kissinger to head an
inquiry into the origins of arguably the most successful terrorist
attack in history. Long an unabashed advocate of concealing and
distorting the truth in the name of national security, he is the last
guy who has the right to ask someone in government, "What did you
know and when did you know it?"</LD>
<LD>   Kissinger, after all, was the member of the Nixon White House most
bent on destroying Daniel Ellsberg for giving a copy of the Pentagon
Papers, the government's secret history of the Vietnam War, to the
New York Times. His obsession with preventing all government leaks,
except those of his creation, is well documented in the Nixon tapes.
And this is the man who publicly lied about everything from the
bombing of Cambodia to the cover-up of the Watergate break-in of
Democratic Party headquarters to the overthrow and death of the
democratically elected leader of Chile.</LD>
<LD>   But even if truth serum could be slipped into his morning
espresso, Kissinger still would be an appalling choice to lead what
should be the fearless, unbiased fact-finding investigation necessary
to prevent future tragedies like the destruction of the World Trade
Center towers.</LD>
<TE>   He has been much too personally embroiled in the gamesmanship,
greed and opportunism underlying politics in the Mideast; neither is
he willing to disclose his long list of lucrative government and
business contracts that pose potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Kissinger Associates, the former secretary of State's
ultra-connected consulting firm, has had dealings in the past with
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- the two nations most closely linked with
the 9/11 hijackers -- and was the subject of a congressional
investigation for its role in the $4-billion bankrolling of Saddam
Hussein in the late 1980s by the Atlanta office of Italy's BNL bank.
Kissinger Associates then included Brent Scowcroft, who became
national security advisor for President George H.W. Bush, and
Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of State in that administration.</TE>
<TE>   That those ties crisscross with other suspicious activities of
close Bush family advisors -- including Poppy Bush's consulting role
with the Carlyle Group that took him to Saudi Arabia to drum up
business -- makes Kissinger's selection as understandable as it is
dishonest.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, the administration doesn't want a commission looking
into what went wrong on Sept. 11 because its focus might turn too
close to home. The incoming Bush administration in 2001 ignored dire
warnings from Clinton National Security Advisor Sandy Berger that Al
Qaeda was the major security threat facing the U.S. Instead, the new
administration focused on the war on drugs and even funneled
"humanitarian" aid to Taliban-run Afghanistan as a reward for the
fundamentalists' eradication of an opium crop.</TE>
<TE>   The truth about Sept. 11 might dampen Bush's exploitation of
tragedy to draw attention from a sagging economy, a down stock market
and stunning financial scandals that began with the downfall of
Bush's close buddies at Enron. How convenient to divert the public's
attention from other problems with the notion that the whole world
must be turned upside down to combat terrorism, when marginal and
avoidable mistakes by our government allowed the dreams of madmen to
be fulfilled in blood.</TE>
<TE>   Would the monstrous new homeland security bureaucracy really have
protected us from a few box-cutter-wielding nuts? How difficult,
after all, is it to prevent people already on a terrorist wanted list
from entering the country to attend U.S. flight schools? How hard is
it for the president of the United States to get the FBI and the CIA
to talk to each other? And why are we apparently going to war with
Iraq, which had nothing to do with Sept. 11, instead of with Saudi
Arabia, which did?</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration was floundering before Sept. 11, and it
still seems to have difficulty dealing with the nation's domestic
problems. Instead of facing that harsh reality, Bush wants us to
welcome the shredding of constitutional protections, allegedly for
our own protection, and be excited at the prospect of a sideshow war
with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Best to not look too hard at any of this. The Bush administration
resisted convening a 9/11 commission for more than a year and, when
forced by overwhelming public pressure to do so, picked an infamous
man with the legendary chops to quash any search for truth.</TE>

<HD>Rattling 'Doors of Hell' in Mideast</HD>
<DH>U.S. courts disaster by plotting a war. Instead, a strategy
of rights and respect is needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bouthaina Shaaban</AU>

<DL>DAMASCUS, Syria</DL>
<LD>Every morning, people here read their newspapers to find out the
latest image that Westerners have carved of them to fit the West's
own objectives and agendas. For the last two years, Arabs in the
Middle East have never stopped being surprised at what is made of
them, their religion, their intentions and their national character.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes the possibility that the United States, with or without
the United Nations, will go to war with Iraq. Because of the
suppressed anger, frustration and humiliation of Arab people, such a
war could open "doors of hell" for the region and for West-East
relations.</LD>
<LD>   Those in the West who speak about war from their comfortable
offices seem to have no idea of how strongly the people in the Middle
East feel. The entire world has sympathized with the victims of the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and felt great solidarity with the U.S. and
its people. Yet since that time, major decisions about the Middle
East are made on the basis of "it is said" and "it is believed."
People are targeted and killed on the suspicion that they had
intended to do something.</LD>
<TE>   For most of us in the Middle East who have suffered from foreign
occupations, war and terrorism, Muslim extremism is a reflection of
foreign influence during the Cold War. Religious extremism is alien
to societies like Syria that are multi-religious and multiethnic.</TE>
<TE>   When Muslim extremists used to blow up our innocent citizens and
children in our cities, they were condemned and fought by our secular
society but were excused as human rights activists by the West. Only
after Sept. 11 did the West start to brand them as terrorists, and
then it extended that label to the entire Arab and Muslim culture.</TE>
<TE>   Evil is part of human nature. All good Jews, Christians and
Muslims always have stood against evil. To act on the premise that
one race or one religion or one nation is more prone to violence or
extremism or terrorism is racist.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has decided to spend millions of dollars to improve its
image among Arabs and Muslims, but it is acting in the dark. The
campaign it has launched through Arab media, showing Arabs and
Muslims some examples of their kinspeople who have made it in the
U.S., is preaching to the converted. Arabs know that the American
system is extremely accommodating for all nationalities, that
Americans are nice people and that thousands of Arabs have made it in
the U.S. The core issue that stands in the way of real communication
and understanding between Arabs and Muslims on the one hand and
Americans on the other is the American stand on the Arab-Israeli
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has occupied Arab territories since 1967, and Arabs have
expressed time and again their desire to live in peace with Israel.
Yet after Ariel Sharon became prime minister in Israel, he abrogated
existing peace agreements with the Palestinians and annihilated all
horizons for peace with Syria and Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs expected the U.S. to stand firmly in support of the
peace process rather than to provide Sharon with money and armaments
to continue the policy that he started as defense minister in 1982.
Sharon is credited with masterminding the invasion of Lebanon and
blamed for the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee
camps there.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and members of his government have announced many times
that they will beat the Palestinians into capitulation. This policy
is not going to lead anyone anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   What is truly needed now is for the U.S. to show great moral
authority and reverse this bloody course by returning to the course
of peace -- true peace that ends occupation and achieves for all
peoples of the region their rights.</TE>
<TE>   Any peace that is not fair is not going to endure. People in the
Middle East believe that only the U.S. can stop the violence. It is
useless to keep condemning the Palestinians whenever an Israeli is
killed or to show solidarity with Israel every time it commits
another massacre against Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The first step to break this logjam is to end the Israeli
occupation of Arab territories and to design a peaceful and just
settlement under which both people feel security and dignity. The
humiliation that the Palestinian people have been subjected to for
the last two years will fuel their struggle for generations to come.</TE>
<TE>   Arab people never have reconciled themselves to occupation and
colonization, no matter how long it may take them to achieve their
independence. At this particular time, Iraq is only a diversion that
may allow Sharon to flex his muscles and use his hundreds of tanks
and missiles on unarmed Palestinians. This will cost both sides more
lives but will not make the issue go away.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. needs to think of a new strategy that focuses on the
rights of all peoples in the region to live in peace and prosperity.
It should not be based on arming and supporting one side in order to
kill and humiliate the other. Its starting point should be that
people are equal in humanity; there is no superior and inferior
simply because of military might or lack of it.</TE>

<HD>Pastor's Misguided View of Dance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "To the Church, It Was a Case of 'Dirty Dancing,' " Nov. 26:
Pastor Edgar Chacon states, "I told myself, 'Well, the parents will
be happy that somebody is taking care of the children.' " I wonder if
this is how he assuaged his conscience for firing a long-standing
member of his congregation, a man who had been raised in the church,
who had devoted his time and his resources to the children of the
community, who taught at the church school for years and whose family
was involved in the business of the church.</LD>
<LD>   Chacon was a newcomer, and in his arrogance of knowing what was
right, he did no less than a deed of evil and malice because of
[director of the dance program] Bill C. Rugh's homosexuality. He did
not bother to query the parents of the children; he assumed that they
weren't looking after their own children, so he would. How is this
any different than the religious intolerance we see worldwide today
-- intolerance that leads to violence? Did Christ specify anywhere in
the Bible a specific form of dance to be associated with his
teaching? No, the closure of this program was completely based on
homophobia and religious intolerance, with no thought given to the
children.</LD>

<TE>   With three years of dedication to Glen A. Wilson High School's
dance team, I have always looked highly on the opportunities my peers
and I were given to explore the beauty of fine arts and culture. I
was flabbergasted to find that the art of dance could ever be viewed
as a "pagan practice" or categorized as "taboo." Although Pastor
Chacon states, "I am protecting the children," he is only protecting
the youth from unleashing their talents and emotions in an art that
celebrates the body's movements.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, my high school's dance team watched Herbert Ross' 1984
musical film, "Footloose," which discusses the struggle of a
generation of adolescents who yearned for a community free from laws
against dance. The closing of the film displays Kevin Bacon, starring
as Ren MacCormack, before a panel of adults, where he explains the
art of dance and its role in the Bible. Dance is not only a great
addition to fine arts but also an act used to praise and honor God.</TE>

<TE>   I'm so glad that Chacon doesn't know my child, but I feel deeply
sorry for the children he does know and is "protecting." Chacon and
his church board really need to read more, and they would do well to
start with their Bibles. There, they would learn that King David
"danced before the Lord with all his might" (2 Samuel 6:14) and that
there is, as written in Ecclesiastes (3:4), "a time to mourn and a
time to dance." The next book they should pick up is a good
German-English dictionary, especially while attending a German opera.
They would have seen that the German word "lust" translates to the
English word "enjoyment."</TE>

<HD>Parties' Futures Depend on Their Grass Roots</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "GOP Can Revive the State," Opinion, Dec. 1: Bill Simon Jr. and
Richard Riordan have illustrated again why each of their last
campaigns in California have been failing ones: They are out of touch
with grass-roots Republicans and like-minded independent voters in
the state. They chant the mantra of diversity but clearly do not look
at the polling data from recent elections. The vast majority of
minorities do not now and will not ever vote Republican. They tout
Arnold Schwarzenegger as a possible gubernatorial candidate not
because of his principles but instead for his supposed vote-getting
potential. Interestingly, Schwarzenegger backed a "big government"
bond measure, hardly a Republican value.</LD>
<LD>   Worst of all, they urge Republicans to stop focusing on
"hot-button social issues." Clearly, this is code for illegal
immigration, a subject neither man has had the political courage to
address. Illegal immigration is the root cause of many of
California's problems, ranging from education to criminal justice to
health care. Had Simon spoken out on this issue he might now be the
governor-elect. If Simon and Riordan represent the current leadership
of California's Republican Party, then the GOP has no future in this
state.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon's article by the numbers: (1) References to
serious problems facing Californians under Democratic leadership: 19;
(2) references to Republicans' innovative ideas, deep understanding
of complex issues and positive vision for the future: 20; (3)
references to specific Republican alternatives and solutions for
California's problems: zero. If you want to win an election, give the
people a reason to vote for you!</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon's powerful, democratizing two-party system has
gotten us to exactly where we are today. With the parties resembling
each other more, it's no wonder people go on strike come election
day. Neither party has a mandate from the people to do anything, so
they continue to do what they do: pretend to be visionaries during
campaigns, then abandon their constituencies for special interests.
They are incapable of effecting real change in a system that works
for the top 1%, who own 30% to 40% of this country's wealth, and
continues to exploit the rest of us, who produce it.</TE>

<TE>   Redlands</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In "Greed Putting Party in Peril" (Opinion, Dec. 1), Kevin
Phillips misses a point of fact: Minorities who happen to be part of
the middle class are also part of the Democratic core base. That
said, the "soak the rich" strategy of the Democrats will finally fail
when people from the middle class realize that only the middle class
gets soaked with tax increases. That the poor, obviously, pay little
to no tax but use most services. The rich, with their political
patrons from the Democratic and Republican parties, can afford to
hire the best accountants to pay as little as possible. Is it any
surprise that the middle class will go Republican when it gets tax
cuts? What have the Democrats got to offer? All empty promises and
nothing else?</TE>
<TE>   Virgilio Mendoza</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phillips is absolutely correct when he states that the Democrats
are selling out their principles and soul for campaign money. They
are barely distinguishable from Republicans. Their rush to the center
has disenchanted minorities and low-incomers, probably because they
have been ignored and taken for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Another turned-off segment of the voters, which Phillips did not
mention, is progressives, generally an articulate and active group.
There has been a slow but steady stream of progressives going to the
Green Party or to independent status. That could be very dangerous to
the Democrats unless the party takes a surge leftward and nominates a
real Democrat for president.</TE>

<HD>Pacheco Conflict With Molina Goes Both Ways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "L.A. Latinos' Political Feud Marks Generational Divide" (Nov. 27)
you write, of my relationship with Supervisor Gloria Molina, that
"those close to Molina call the situation a 'one-way feud.' " This
cannot be further from the truth. Molina did not support my bid for
City Council. After I joined the City Council, she opposed my effort
to legalize the vendors at El Mercado and end that 20-year dispute in
the community. Today, the vendors enjoy permanent puestos [stalls]
with all proper permits.</LD>
<LD>   Molina did not support my effort to include a pedestrian bridge at
the new county hospital or to include local hiring during its
construction in Boyle Heights. She also tried to raid the MTA housing
funds for Boyle Heights and spend those funds in unincorporated East
Los Angeles. Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and I protected those funds
in committee and the council kept the promise made to Boyle Heights.
In the end, the strained relationship between Molina and me has more
to do with my representation of my constituents than with personal
histories.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Pacheco</LD>
<TE>   L.A. City Councilman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I thought Pacheco ran against the Alatorre machine with a promise
to open up politics in the Latino community. Instead it appears he
wants to create his own machine and settle some old scores. Public
service is not an entitlement. The Latino community deserves to have
leaders who are open to competition and able to debate issues on the
merits. The politics of the machine stifle debate and turn people
off. Hopefully, Pacheco and Antonio Villaraigosa [who is seeking
Pacheco's seat] can get past the personality contest and immature
feelings of resentment and focus on who will best serve L.A.'s 14th
District.</TE>

it be easy to plant a package on a child or elderly relative if one
were really motivated?</LD>

<HD>Ramirez Distorts French Views Past and Present</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I regret to take strong exception to a cartoon by Michael Ramirez,
published on Oct. 31. This outrageous cartoon shows a highly
improbable Gen. Charles de Gaulle during a wartime conference with
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill stating in distorted
English, supposed to imitate our French accent, that Hitler was not
"zat bad" (if he had had oil).</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez has gone too far. Besides being historically unwarranted
and insulting to Gen. De Gaulle's memory and to my country, this
drawing unfortunately shows that your newspaper does not seem to care
much about the reality of our position regarding Iraq. On Nov. 8,
after intense but fruitful debates, France, which has long advocated
a resumption of free and unfettered inspections aimed at disarming
Iraq, adopted, along with the U.S. and the other 13 members of the
U.N. Security Council, Resolution 1441, which sends a strong message
to the Iraqi regime.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to make one additional remark: In 2001, according to
United Nations and International Monetary Fund statistics, France was
only the fourth-largest buyer of Iraqi crude oil. It could be useful
for Ramirez to know, given his interest in oil, that the U.S. then
ranked first.</LD>

<LD>"Strategic bankruptcy." That's what former asbestos manufacturers
declared when seeking shelter in the 1980s from a flood of lawsuits
by ill and dying workers who had inhaled their product. It is
sometimes used, or threatened, by companies seeking union
concessions. But no U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese has ever declared
bankruptcy, strategic or otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   To start now, as the lawsuit-plagued Archdiocese of Boston has
hinted it might, and as California dioceses reportedly might soon be
considering, would set a terrible example for an institution based
not on profit but on morality.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for alleged victims of sexual abuse by priests in the
Boston area scoff at the idea that the archdiocese is near insolvency
-- a Boston Globe analysis set the assessed value of the
archdiocese's real estate holdings at more than $1.3 billion. The
lawyers accuse church officials, including Cardinal Bernard Law, of
trying to intimidate plaintiffs into accepting smaller settlements.</LD>
<TE>   In California, dioceses expect a new wave of sexual abuse lawsuits
after Jan. 1, when a law extending the statute of limitations on such
abuse goes into effect. As The Times' William Lobdell reports today,
California's bishops have prepared a letter to parishioners across
the state saying the church has been falsely portrayed as having deep
pockets and declaring that "the vast majority of Catholic assets
belong to the people of our parishes, schools, charities, and other
institutions." That wording seems aimed at leaving all options open,
including bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Just the threat of bankruptcy worked once before for the church,
in Dallas after a jury in 1998 awarded almost $120 million to 11
victims of sexual abuse by a single priest. The archdiocese dropped
the bankruptcy threat after the alleged victims settled for $31
million.</TE>
<TE>   An archdiocese spokeswoman in Boston declined to rule out
bankruptcy after the story broke in the Globe. Carrying out the
threat would have benefits: All action in the civil lawsuits there
would cease, no new lawsuits could be filed, the court would set a
deadline for filing new claims and a settlement with all known
claimants could be reached faster and at less cost.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, to hint at bankruptcy even before insurance companies have
said what they will pay in the Boston cases is, at best, premature
and ethically murky. That would be doubly so in California, where
dioceses haven't yet seen the size of the problem, much less tried to
settle it.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church is a 2000-year-old institution, an important
world force that survived by taking the long view rather than looking
for quick fixes. It should not further damage its moral reputation in
the name of getting rid of lawsuits and protecting assets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's assault on environmental protection reaches
an appalling new high -- or low -- with the U.S. Forest Service's
proposal to essentially gut 20-year-old management planning rules for
deciding the most appropriate uses of the nation's 192 million acres
of national forest.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, to become effective in 90 days, will "better
harmonize the environmental, social and economic benefits" of the
forests, the Forest Service said in a press release.</LD>
<LD>   That's bureaucratic gibberish for eroding safeguards under the
National Environmental Policy Act that protect fish and wildlife.
This will be done by reducing the public's participation in the
planning process and its ability to appeal bad decisions to the
courts.</LD>
<TE>   The Forest Service even has the gall to claim that the new rule
will emphasize modern scientific knowledge, but environmental
scientists say it actually will reduce the role of scientists in the
planning process.</TE>
<TE>   The plan offers more "flexibility" to forest managers, the Forest
Service says. That means forest managers can designate areas for
future logging without studying the impact on wildlife, watersheds
and public recreation throughout the forest. The loggers, who
consider the present system slow and cumbersome, support the change.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service says there's no need to do an environmental
study during the forestwide planning process. The study can be done
when individual projects, such as a timber sale, are undertaken. But
that change sidesteps the major purpose of the National Forest
Management Act of 1976, which directs the Forest Service to develop a
management plan for each of the 175 forests and grasslands.</TE>
<TE>   The plans are the means of determining the most appropriate uses
of various parts of the forests over a 15-year period and studying
the relative impact of those uses on the rest of the forest. In
California, population pressures have brought about a greater
recognition of the need for recreational uses of the forests,
including hiking, backpacking, hunting, fishing and backcountry
skiing, and for reduced logging.</TE>
<TE>   The current rules require the Forest Service to conduct a formal
environmental impact study whenever the management plans are revised
or significantly amended. The planners must consider alternatives.
Through a hearing and comment process, the public has a chance to
balance one against the other and offer support or opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule allows forest managers to exempt forest plans from
such environmental studies. There would be only one choice, that of
the forest manager. No longer would the plans have to give first
priority to protection of the forest environment or maintain legal
protection for wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service says it's not changing national goals for
protecting the forests. If that's so, there's no point in junking the
present rules. They are complex, but they work.</TE>

<LD>Imagine Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden obtaining a
nuclear weapon partly because Congress refused to act. Impossible?
The frightening reality, as The Times' Sonni Efron reported Monday,
is that a handful of House conservatives and Pentagon hawks are tying
up vital programs that fund the destruction of Russian nuclear and
chemical arms stockpiles left over from the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   Congress and the first Bush administration quickly realized that
with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 everything possible had to
be done to stop terrorists and rogue regimes from plundering the
former Soviet Union's nuclear materials. The poverty of many Russian
scientists and lack of adequate safeguards at research institutes and
nuclear sites made this nightmare a real possibility.</LD>
<LD>   In 1991, the joint U.S.-Russian Cooperative Threat Reduction
program began the destruction of nuclear warheads, elimination of
weapons-grade uranium and retraining of former Soviet nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons scientists for peaceful purposes. To
date, 6,000 warheads, 400 missile silos and 1,400 missiles have been
decommissioned.</LD>
<TE>   According to Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), Reps. Duncan Hunter
(R-Alpine) and Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) are spearheading a movement to
impede the funding of nonproliferation programs. Hunter and Weldon
still have a Cold War mentality; they apparently see the Russian
military, which has been unable to subdue Chechnya, as a potent
threat to the United States. Their argument: Money for such programs
allows the Russians to dispose of obsolete weapons and spend more on
new weaponry. As a result, Hunter and others have, among other
things, foolishly crippled a program to construct a plant in southern
Russia that would liquidate about 45,000 tons of nerve gas stored in
decaying canisters.</TE>
<TE>   There is no fantasy James Bond to avert a potential tragedy once
terrorists have acquired weapons of mass destruction by bribing an
impoverished Russian scientist or guard. The United States, which has
already spent $7 billion on ridding the world of these ferocious
weapons, must continue to fund nonproliferation programs.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush should clip the wings of the hawks on Capitol Hill
and make it clear that he wants the money to start flowing again.
This would require him to move against otherwise friendly
conservatives, something he is always reluctant to do. But the stakes
could not be higher. The danger is not that the U.S. will spend too
much on destroying obsolete Russian weaponry but that it won't spend
enough.</TE>

<HD>Russian Back in U.S. for Digital Book Case</HD>
<DH>Dmitry Sklyarov will tell a jury that his employer, which
sold code-breaking software, did not commit a crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pham-Duy Nguyen</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Dmitry Sklyarov, the Moscow software programmer who wrote the code
that cracked Adobe Systems Inc.'s eBook, is back in the United States
more than a year after he was arrested on software piracy charges.</LD>
<LD>   Sklyarov, who spent weeks in jail in 2001 on charges that he
violated a 1998 digital copyright law, will tell a jury that his
employer, ElcomSoft Co., didn't commit a crime when it sold software
on the Internet that could disable restrictions on Adobe's eBook
software. This week in a San Jose courtroom, the case against the
firm will test whether the law turns legitimate programmers into
criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Some in the software industry, which loses $11 billion a year to
piracy, say the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is a deterrent.
Lawyers say a potential prison sentence should make people uneasy
about the DMCA, which prohibits software that allows users to open
digital works protected by copyright.</LD>
<TE>   "It's easy to violate the DMCA," said Jonathan Band, an
intellectual property lawyer not involved in the case. "It covers
circumvention activities even when there's no intent to infringe."</TE>
<TE>   "Without strong copyright protections, there's no incentive for
anyone to develop software," said Jeri Clausing of the Business
Software Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Adobe told federal authorities last year that
Moscow-based ElcomSoft was selling a program that "picks the lock" to
its electronic book reader, software that allows users to buy books
off the Internet to read on their computers.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, Sklyarov, who wrote the program for his doctoral
dissertation, was arrested at a conference in Las Vegas where he was
scheduled to present a paper on Internet security. ElcomSoft was
indicted the following month. Sklyarov and ElcomSoft pleaded not
guilty, claiming that the software allows users to copy text from
eBook to use in other forms.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Harris, a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawyer, says
criminal penalties under the DMCA may discourage companies that
create circumvention tools as a part of their software development
from pursuing that business model.</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger issue is whether this is conduct that needs to be
criminalized," said Harris, who represents Lindows.com, a company
trying to make software that allows Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
products to work on a Linux operating system.</TE>
<TE>   In an agreement with the government, Sklyarov was released and
charges against him were dropped under the condition that he would
testify as a prosecution witness if needed.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest sparked protests from some within the software industry
and from organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
that say computer code is language that deserves free-speech
protection. They say the DMCA is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Adobe withdrew its support for the criminal prosecution of
Sklyarov a week after the arrest. The firm still is cooperating with
the government in its case against ElcomSoft, according to its Web
site.</TE>

<HD>AOL to Integrate Affiliate's Magazine Content</HD>
<DH>The plan is a significant partnership between the
entertainment and Internet units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After trying for two years to integrate AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
disparate parts into a synergistic company, executives may have
finally found a successful recipe: Stop trying so hard.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based media giant will announce a deal today to put
the content of its most popular magazines, including People and
Entertainment Weekly, exclusively behind the walled garden of its
online service, America Online.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, the plan -- one of the most significant partnerships
yet between AOL Time Warner's entertainment and Internet units --
comes after top officials, including Chief Executive Richard Parsons,
told division heads to stop worrying so much about synergy and
instead focus on being the best in their respective sectors. Around
the same time, former co-Chief Operating Officer Robert Pittman, who
led the charge for synergy, was pushed out.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm surprised that this didn't happen earlier since this kind of
thing was the impetus behind the merger," said Denise Garcia, analyst
at GartnerG2. "But it's still a great move."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials and analysts attribute the newfound cooperation
to the surprising stumble of America Online, which has been rocked
over the last year by slowing growth and accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   America Online's troubles, which have dragged down the parent
company's stock price more than 50% this year, have unified
employees, many of whom now understand that it's vital to help the
Internet unit turn itself around.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective is clearer: We need to deliver more value for the
AOL service," said one official at the Internet division. "There's a
shared understanding across the company that in order for AOL Time
Warner to succeed, it's important that the AOL service be better.
We're all on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   Also helping to build bridges inside AOL Time Warner is the fact
that several of the most aggressive and high-profile executives from
the Internet side of the business, including Pittman and former AOL
deal maker David Colburn, are gone.</TE>
<TE>   Many Time Warner executives had complained that America Online
executives were arrogant and cocky. They have been replaced by
outsiders, such as new America Online Chief Executive Jonathan
Miller, and officials from Time Warner, such as Don Logan, former
Time Inc. chairman who now heads AOL Time Warner's media and
communications units.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better with some of those guys being gone," said Michael
Gallant, analyst at CIBC World Markets. "It's also easier to get
cooperation from employees now that the stock price is going up
again."</TE>
<TE>   But Gallant cautioned that investors remain wary of cross-company
transactions, noting that AOL Time Warner has yet to prove the
sibling rivalry is over. "The animosity inside the company is still
there," Gallant said.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine-content deal will give America Online exclusive use
of People, Entertainment Weekly, In Style, Southern Living, Real
Simple, Sunset and other Time Warner properties. The current free Web
sites for those magazines will be discontinued, dramatically scaled
down or will begin charging for access. In some cases, subscribers of
the magazines may be given Web access at no charge, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the months ahead, AOL is expected to capitalize on other
entertainment products of its affiliated companies, those familiar
with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to reshape America Online more along the lines of a
premium cable channel, such as sister company HBO. That means putting
together a package of features and services that will attract and
retain customers, even if they eventually migrate to another Internet
service provider.</TE>
<TE>   One of AOL's biggest problems is that it is losing thousands of
customers to high-speed Internet providers, chiefly cable operators
that have been reluctant to allow AOL to offer its service across
their wires. This year, AOL cut a deal to sell high-speed service on
AT&amp;T Comcast systems, but AOL officials were disappointed by the
terms, which reportedly force AOL to give up a sizable chunk of its
monthly fee.</TE>
<TE>   In response, AOL will announce today that it is shifting gears and
plans to step up marketing for its so-called Bring-Your-Own-Access
plan, in which subscribers buy Internet access from another cable
operator or ISP, but continue to pay AOL $14.95 a month to retain
access to the online service and their e-mail accounts. A standard
AOL subscription, including Internet access, goes for $23.90 monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Though AOL has never aggressively marketed the scaled-down BYOA
plan, analysts estimate as many as 3 million subscribers pay the
$14.95 fee to retain the AOL service, a sign of strong customer
loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials are expected to tell Wall Street analysts that it
makes more sense to focus on improving content than on cutting
high-speed access deals with cable operators and grappling with the
technical issues of directly providing access.</TE>

<HD>EU Backs Partial Tobacco Ad Ban</HD>
<DH>Advertising on radio, in magazines, newspapers and on the

<SE></SE>

<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>European Union governments Monday endorsed rules stopping British
American Tobacco, Philip Morris Cos. and rivals from placing magazine
ads and sponsoring sports such as Formula One racing starting in
August 2005.</LD>
<LD>   EU health ministers also agreed to outlaw newspaper, radio and
Internet tobacco advertising. The proposed ban was trimmed to exclude
cinema and poster advertising after Europe's high court found an
earlier total ban went too far.</LD>
<LD>   "This is another nail in the coffin of the tobacco industry," EU
Health Commissioner David Byrne said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "Big Tobacco needs to recruit 500,000 new smokers each year to
replace the ones who die prematurely due to smoking-related illnesses
-- the measures we agreed today will make it more difficult for them
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco ads account for 3% of EU advertising, according to the
European Commission. All EU countries already ban television ads and
most forbid or restrict other forms.</TE>
<TE>   In backing measures approved by the European Parliament last
month, the ministers overrode objections from Germany, which said it
was defending freedom of expression, and from Britain, which said the
rules needed to be clearer.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, BAT, Gallaher Group, Imperial Tobacco and
Rothmans Inc. won an appeal in the European Court of Justice against
an earlier ban.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that cigarette advertising is a health issue rather
than a free-trade issue and should be determined by individual
states, not the EU's executive arm.</TE>
<TE>   A British tobacco-ad ban takes effect next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are obviously prepared to operate in a blackout in[Britain],
where restrictions have been passed," said Tim Robinson, a spokesman
for Gallaher. "We operate in a blackout in France. We know how to
operate in that framework."</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette companies agreed to a limit on advertising in the U.S.
four years ago when they reached a $206-billion settlement with 46
states over health-care claims. The pact includes restrictions on
outdoor advertising, brand-name sponsorships and distribution of free
samples and apparel that display cigarette brand names.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris spokesman Marc Fritsch declined to comment on the
EU's vote.</TE>
<TE>   The commission intends before the end of 2004 to propose rules on
a common list of ingredients allowed in cigarettes, requiring tobacco
companies to say what additives they use.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of Europeans smoke. About 60% start at or before the age
of 13, according to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Governments also pledged to put in place measures restricting the
access of children and adolescents to tobacco vending machines and to
tobacco sales over the Internet, removing tobacco products from
self-service displays, and obliging retailers to check the ages of
youths who buy tobacco.</TE>

<HD>Reports Suggest Recovery Is Slowing</HD>
<DH>Construction spending rises modestly in October on school
and home building. Manufacturing shrinks again, index says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Crutsinger</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Construction spending edged up modestly in October, led by a surge in
school construction and single-family homes, but a principal
indicator of health at U.S. factories showed that manufacturing
shrank for a third straight month.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said Monday's reports, which followed a surprisingly
strong start to the holiday shopping season, depicted an economic
recovery that appears to be slowing but not stalling.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched index
of manufacturing activity remained below the 50 mark, which separates
expansion from contraction. The index was 49.2 in November, up from
48.5 in October.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. factories have suffered the most from last year's recession,
as more than 2 million factory jobs have been lost over the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   A new wave of layoffs was announced this fall as companies trying
to keep their stock prices from further deterioration pared their
payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   But the Commerce Department reported that construction spending
rose 0.3% in October, the gain reflecting strength in building
schools and single-family houses. Home sales have been red-hot all
year, spurred by the lowest mortgage rates since the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the contrast between a struggling manufacturing
sector and strength in consumer spending and construction showed the
crosscurrents buffeting the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again the consumer is doing his job, but it is still the
business sector having problems," said David Wyss, chief economist at
Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "All is yet to be right in the manufacturing heartland," said Joel
Naroff, head of a Holland, Pa., forecasting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Cohen, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said
he believed consumer demand, which accounts for two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, would hold up enough to allow the economy
to grow at a 1.5% rate in the final three months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   That would be far below the third-quarter growth rate of 4% but
would not constitute the double-dip recession some have feared.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department's report on construction activity showed a
rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $834.6 billion in
October, compared with $832.5 billion in September.</TE>
<TE>   Increases in September and October followed a 1% decline in
August.</TE>
<TE>   October's gain in construction was led by a 1% increase in
spending for nonresidential buildings, which rose to an annual rate
of $158.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   This increase came after five consecutive monthly declines, as
uncertain prospects have kept businesses from making new capital
investments.</TE>
<TE>   Sectors that cover factories and office buildings remained down in
October, but this was offset by increases in other areas, including a
10% jump in spending on educational buildings and a 2.2% rise in
spending on hospital construction.</TE>
<TE>   Spending for construction of homes and apartments was up slightly
to $412.3 billion in October, a 0.05% rise from September's level of
$412.1 billion. However, spending for single-family homes posted a 1%
advance, offsetting weakness in apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Residential construction has been among the leading bright spots
in the uncertain economic recovery as the lowest mortgage rates in a
generation spurred record home sales.</TE>
<TE>   Government spending dropped 0.3% in October to an annual rate of
$205.4 billion after a 1.6% surge in September.</TE>
<TE>   The weakness was led by a 3.8% decline in highway construction,
one of the biggest categories in the government sector.</TE>

<HD>Corona's Electricity Plan a Bad Idea, Edison Says</HD>
<DH>Though city says taking over service could save residents
15%, utility contends it could increase rates by 18%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison Co. on Monday continued its campaign
against the city of Corona's plan to take over electricity service,
saying it would be a bad deal for power users and could cause rates
to rise more than 18%.</LD>
<LD>   The Riverside County city announced in October that it was
considering a plan to seize the Rosemead-based utility's power poles,
wires and electricity substations in the city. Corona, a city of
about 132,000 residents, is projecting savings of 15% or more
compared with current Edison rates because the city would have lower
overhead than the utility as well as cost-saving tax-exempt status.</LD>
<LD>   But Edison, in an analysis of Corona's feasibility study, projects
that rates would rise to about 14.2 to 14.3 cents per kilowatt-hour
under the Corona plan, compared with current Edison rates of about 12
cents per kilowatt-hour, Edison spokesman Charley Wilson said.</LD>
<TE>   Corona has underestimated the cost of taking Edison's distribution
system, including the replacement value of Edison's assets and the
price of construction and wiring necessary to remove Corona from the
Edison system in a way that leaves Edison unscathed, Wilson said.
Corona's consultant never contacted the utility for basic financial
and engineering data about the distribution system in the
38-square-mile city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to have made a number of omissions and assumptions that
need to be evaluated," Wilson said. "They have not demonstrated that
taking Edison's system is in the public interest."</TE>
<TE>   Corona officials could not be reached for comment. But Craig A.
Moyer, a lawyer with Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips, which is advising the
city, said a thorough analysis has been made that considers all
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have analyzed it well," Moyer said. "We do have some very good
people working on it, including former Edison employees."</TE>
<TE>   Edison officials were scheduled to appear before the Corona City
Council on Monday night to outline the utility's reservations. Edison
has said its distribution system is not for sale, and vowed to fight
any plan to seize it.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Faces Foes in FERC Showdown</HD>
<DH>The pipeline operator fights allegations of market
manipulation during California's energy crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A pivotal market manipulation case in the California energy crisis
moved toward a final decision after five hours of closing arguments
Monday that delved into charges of collusion and profiteering by El
Paso Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The "Texas showdown" before the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission was sought by El Paso after an administrative law judge in
September found that the company illegally limited natural gas
shipments to California in a scheme to drive up energy prices. El
Paso and its adversaries -- California regulators and utilities
executives -- presented oral arguments to the commission, which is
expected to either uphold or overturn the judge's ruling early next
year.</LD>
<LD>   "Market manipulation by El Paso was one of the key contributors to
the California energy crisis," said Kevin Lipson, a lawyer for
Southern California Edison Co. of Rosemead, one of the main
plaintiffs in the case. "They have tried to hide the forest of market
manipulation in the trees of technical and engineering jargon."</LD>
<TE>   Houston-based El Paso adamantly denies the allegations. Chief
Executive William A. Wise told reporters after the hearing that his
company was being used as a scapegoat. He vowed to appeal in federal
court if the commission rules against El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   "If the law prevails, we will win at FERC," Wise said. "And if
politics prevails, we will win in the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the case have hinted that they may seek a
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso already is reeling, in part from the preliminary finding
in September that its pipeline unit withheld capacity when California
was desperate for natural gas to fuel its electricity generating
plants. The company's share price has fallen more than 80% from its
52-week high of $49.95, closing Monday at $8.26, down 26 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange. Its bond rating has been downgraded to
"junk" status.</TE>
<TE>   If FERC finds that El Paso manipulated the California market, it
could impose fines and order the return of tens of millions of
dollars in profit.</TE>
<TE>   The case arose from a gas-shipping deal between two El Paso
subsidiaries in 2000. The arrangement put about 17% of California's
daily gas consumption in the hands of one corporate entity.</TE>
<TE>   Early Monday, a procedural ruling went against El Paso when the
FERC commissioners voted unanimously to release corporate documents
from February 2000, when the deal was signed. El Paso argued that the
papers contained sensitive corporate information.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal rules, the pipeline unit, El Paso Natural Gas Co.,
and the marketing unit, El Paso Merchant Energy, were supposed to
operate at arm's length. But the documents showed that Wise, as head
of the corporate parent, was privy to information from both
subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   A Feb. 9 presentation for top El Paso management listed "more
control of total physical market" as one of the "strategic
advantages" of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Another document, previously disclosed by the administrative law
judge, stated that one of the ways El Paso would make money was to
widen the price spread between the producing regions in Texas and New
Mexico and the delivery points in California.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Morris, lead attorney for the California Public Utilities
Commission, said the memos were evidence that the company intended to
manipulate the market. "The sky was the limit, and they reached for
the sky," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   But El Paso lawyer William Scherman derided what he called "a
grand conspiracy theory that really does rest on a grand total of two
or three documents." Scherman said the memos contained nothing
remarkable, only the kind of routine information that Wise would have
needed to evaluate the pending contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Those documents are part of the day-to-day business planning of a
large company," Wise told reporters. "I have a fiduciary
responsibility to have an understanding of what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   However, El Paso fought release of the documents for more than a
year. And a company witness in a previous round of hearings before
the administrative law judge last year sought to downplay Wise's role
in the deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy.</TE>
<TE>   FERC commissioners asked mainly factual questions of the lawyers
representing both sides. The case is complex and the evidence largely
circumstantial. But the standard of proof -- a preponderance of the
evidence -- is significantly lower than in criminal matters, where
guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of numbers being bandied about," observed FERC
Chairman Patrick H. Wood III.</TE>
<TE>   The interpretation of the numbers could decide the outcome of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The El Paso pipeline had a contractual obligation to deliver 3.29
billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to California. Instead, the
evidence shows that only 2.594 billion cubic feet a day flowed on
average during the 15-month term of the El Paso contract in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   The shortfall of 696 million cubic feet a day is damning evidence
of withholding by the pipeline unit, the plaintiffs asserted Monday.
The marketing unit also was withholding natural gas, they alleged, by
not using all the capacity it acquired through its contract with the
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that El Paso Natural Gas
operated the pipeline at less than its maximum allowable pressure,
failed to help customers find ways around shipping bottlenecks to
California and scheduled unneeded maintenance that shut down
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But company lawyers had a different explanation for the gas
shortfall. They said about 39% was due to a federal safety order
after a rupture that killed 12 people in New Mexico; 32% was caused
by high demand from customers east of California; 16% was due to
shippers who failed to schedule all the capacity available; and the
remaining 13% was attributed to maintenance that had to be performed.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Collins, an attorney for the pipeline unit, said the
plaintiffs had mounted an "extreme and unprecedented" challenge to
prudent operational decisions by the company's management.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC board will have to sort out the competing explanations.
The agency's staff, however, has sided with the California
plaintiffs, concluding that the pipeline did not make available all
of its capacity.</TE>

<TE>   The allegations</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against El Paso Corp., the nation's largest
natural gas pipeline company, by California regulators and the
responses from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Allegation: Two units of El Paso--a pipeline company and a gas
marketing firm--colluded on a big contract to ship gas to Southern
California. The gas marketing firm used information not available to
competitors in submitting the winning bid.</TE>
<TE>   Response: The contract was a standard transaction. The pipeline
company and the marketing firm did not share detailed operational
information and business strategy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allegation: The gas marketing firm did not use all of the capacity
it had acquired, thereby squelching supply to create scarcity and
drive up prices.</TE>
<TE>   Response: Although not all the capacity was used, it wasn't due to
withholding, but because of complexities in the way the shipping
contract was structured.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allegation: The pipeline operated at less than full capacity, also
creating artificial shortages and helping the gas marketing firm
drive up prices.</TE>
<TE>   Response: The pipeline was unable to operate at full capacity
because of safety issues.</TE>

<HD>J&amp;J Asks Europeans to Add Warning to Drug</HD>
<DH>Cautionary label on anemia medication Eprex could help
Amgen's rival product.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday that it asked European regulators to
add a warning to the label of its biotech anemia drug, a move that
could benefit a rival product from Amgen Inc.</LD>
<LD>   J&amp;J said that the label should warn kidney disease patients not to
take Eprex by injection into the skin but by intravenous infusion.
About 160 European patients who used the drug developed a rare
condition called pure red cell aplasia, in which the body loses its
ability to make red blood cells. Patients depend on blood
transfusions to survive.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all patients who developed the condition received Eprex by
injection.</LD>
<TE>   J&amp;J said it reached the decision about the label change after
consulting with French authorities. European Union regulators have 24
hours to comment on the label change, which could drive a portion of
Eprex's $1 billion in sales to Amgen or Swiss drug maker Roche Group.</TE>
<TE>   Eprex is a synthetic version of erythropoietin, or EPO, the
protein that spurs red blood cell production. J&amp;J sells it in Europe
under an exclusive license from Thousand Oaks-based Amgen, which
markets its own version of EPO to dialysis patients in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Amgen's drug Aranesp, a modified version of EPO,
could get a lift from J&amp;J's woes. Aranesp, launched a year ago, is
more costly than Eprex. But less medication is needed when the drugs
are taken by injection. So injectable Aranesp compares favorably with
intravenous Eprex, Amgen says.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns in Europe are linked to formulation changes in J&amp;J's
Eprex, and that formula is not marketed in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J closed at $55.70, down $1.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Amgen closed at $48.57, up $1.37 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Amgen said that it could provide Enbrel to all
patients on a waiting list for the rheumatoid arthritis drug, which
has been in short supply since last December.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it was too soon to know how many of the 40,000
patients on the list still want Enbrel, the crown jewel of Amgen's
$9.6-billion purchase of Immunex Corp. Many patients switched to
competing prescription medications during the firms' production
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said the announcement is not related to the completion of a
Rhode Island factory that should double Enbrel supplies. Amgen
expects regulatory approval of the facility by early next year, just
as a rival drug from Abbott Laboratories is expected to reach the
market.</TE>

<HD>Arson Suspected at Energy Exec's House</HD>
<DH>Investigators believe mansion once owned by ex-Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow was set on fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A blaze that did slight damage to a mansion once owned by former
Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow was set, fire
investigators said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-story house -- recently sold to another energy company
executive for $3.9 million -- caught fire early Sunday, but damage
was limited to the front door and the area immediately around it.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, we have no idea why this fire was started," Houston
Fire Department spokesman Jay Evans said. "No suspect has been
arrested, and the case is under investigation."</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors accuse Fastow of building the home with
laundered money. Enron collapsed in bankruptcy a year ago after
revelations about years of inflated profit and hidden debt.</TE>
<TE>   The home was sold in October to Thomas Hook, CFO of Hilcorp
Energy, and his wife, Laura.</TE>
<TE>   Hook did not return a telephone message left Sunday by the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   About $300,000 of work remained on the house when the couple
purchased it, and it was not immediately clear whether they had moved
into the home.</TE>
<TE>   The house is one of five properties included as equity for a bond
that let Fastow go free after he was charged with fraud in early
October. Prosecutors also froze $14 million in Fastow family bank
accounts. He has pleaded not guilty.</TE>

<HD>Do-It-Yourself Checkout Coming to Home Depot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Harry R. Weber</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc.'s do-it-yourself clientele can do it themselves at
the checkout counter as part of a technology upgrade the company
announced Monday that it says will make for faster service.</LD>
<LD>   The touch-screen checkout counters have been used in supermarkets
since 1995, but they'll be a first for a home-improvement store
chain.</LD>
<LD>   "It should add a lot of value to the company because it will
reduce the need for additional personnel and increase their ability
to service their customers faster," said Nathan Lewis, an analyst
with Jackson Securities Inc. in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Self-service checkout terminals are being set up in about 800
locations to replace two or three employee-operated stations. Among
the locations are Cypress, San Jose and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is buying performance software to assess
cashiers' skills.</TE>
<TE>   But company spokesman Don Harrison said the move is not an attempt
to cut staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is losing a job or being displaced as a result of this,"
he said. "Will it mean a shift toward more part-time work? I don't
know." About 60% of Home Depot staff are full-time.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest home improvement store chain has partnered
with NCR Corp. for the equipment and Microsoft Corp. for its Windows
software. The technology is called FAST, Front-end Accuracy and
Service Transformation.</TE>
<TE>   The self-checkout terminals feature computerized voices that talk
to customers in either English or Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   At one Atlanta Home Depot store Monday, restaurant manager Mike
Clark, 35, used the self-checkout to buy a snow shovel and a rake in
less than three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it like you are getting four machines for the price of
one employee," Clark said. "It's very efficient."</TE>

<HD>Toyota, Honda Deliver 1st U.S. Fuel-Cell Vehicles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first low-pollution, hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicles in the
U.S. hit the road in Southern California on Monday as Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co. handed the car keys to their partners in a
pair of long-term research projects.</LD>
<LD>   The automakers, which have launched similar programs in their home
market of Japan, are hoping that their respective technologies become
the industry standard as fuel-cell development progresses.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of both companies called the deliveries historic,
but they cautioned that it will be decades before motorists can walk
into a dealer's showroom and drive away in one of the vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota will lease six of its so-called fuel-cell hybrid vehicles,
based on the Highlander sport utility vehicle, to UC Irvine and UC
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The automaker is leasing each vehicle for $10,000 a month for 30
months but is supplying most of the lease money through grants. As
part of the program, four hydrogen fueling stations have been opened
and two more are planned by summer to link drivers of fuel-cell cars
in the northern and southern parts of the state, said James Press,
chief operating officer for Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA.</TE>
<TE>   Honda is leasing five of its four-passenger FCX fuel-cell vehicles
to Los Angeles for daily use in the city fleet and on Monday
presented Mayor James K. Hahn with keys to the first one. The city
will pay a nominal $500 a month for each vehicle, and Honda will
provide fueling services.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the two programs should go a long way toward
generating performance data that can help industry, government and
the public better understand and perfect fuel-cell technology.</TE>
<TE>   There still are "a million factors" to be addressed be- fore
automotive fuel cells become commonplace, said David Schoenwald,
president of New Alternatives Fund Inc., a New York mutual fund that
invests in environmentally friendly technologies. "But it's not going
to happen" until automakers get such prototype cars on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel cells, long used in spacecraft, generate electricity by
combining hydrogen and oxygen. Although the production of electrical
energy used to make fuel-grade hydrogen creates some pollution,
fuel-cell vehicles generally are emission-free, with steam as the
only byproduct.</TE>
<TE>   The California Air Resources Board has certified both automakers'
fuel-cell cars as zero-emission vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Honda said, it will lease 30 fuel-cell vehicles in Japan
and California during the next three years; Toyota will lease 20.</TE>
<TE>   Press of Toyota said challenges remain before fuel-cell vehicles
will be ready for retail -- among them improving fuel- cell
efficiency and developing a nationwide system for hydrogen processing
and delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota says its five-passenger FCHV gets 180 miles on a hydrogen
fill-up, equivalent to 63 miles per gallon of gasoline; top speed is
96 mph. Honda's four-seat FCX has a range of 170 miles and a top
speed of 90 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit-area Big Three of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and DaimlerChrysler are among other automakers planning to introduce
fuel-cell vehicles in the U.S. for research.</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays Ruling in File-Swapping Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday weighed arguments, but postponed ruling in
a contentious hearing over the fate of the popular Morpheus and
Grokster file-swapping networks.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides in the copyright infringement lawsuit -- filed against
the networks by Hollywood studios, major record labels and music
publishers -- asked U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson to rule in the
case that has emerged as a key legal fight in the post-Napster world.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for movie studios and record labels asked that the
companies behind Grokster and Morpheus be found guilty of massive
copyright infringement. Representatives for Grokster Ltd. and
Streamcast Networks Inc., which distributes the Morpheus
file-swapping software, asked that the case be dismissed so they can
grow their businesses.</LD>
<TE>   The networks let users find and copy music and movies stored on
each other's computers, often in violation of copyright laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to go and rethink" the case, Wilson told a packed
courtroom, after listening to more than two hours of arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson proposed submitting a "speaking order" and requesting
comments from both sides about specific questions within the order.
The judge did not say when, or even if, he would issue such a
document.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the judge is weighing the matter is very
encouraging for us," Streamcast Chief Executive Steve Griffin said.
"It's clearly a complicated case."</TE>
<TE>   It's also complicated by another question before Wilson -- whether
Sharman Networks Ltd., operator of the popular online file-sharing
network Kazaa, should be included in the case.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001 the entertainment industry sued the Dutch software
company that was distributing the Kazaa software and licensing the
technology to Streamcast and Grokster. The company later said it was
broke and licensed the technology to Vanuatu-based Sharman, which
also took over the Kazaa Web site and brand name.</TE>
<TE>   The labels, studios and music publishers moved in July to add
Sharman and LEF Interactive, an Australian management company led by
Sharman Chief Executive Nicola Hemming, to the lawsuit. But Sharman
and LEF asked Wilson to dismiss on the grounds that U.S. courts lack
jurisdiction.</TE>

<HD>Oscar Enters the Picture in Film vs. Digital Debate</HD>
<DH>Like other major technological changes, this one is causing
havoc</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When director George Lucas made "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones," he recorded the action as a massive string of ones and
zeroes, captured on digital cameras and augmented with special
effects created on computer terminals. In some cases, it was shown in
theaters with a digital projector.</LD>
<LD>   "Star Wars" is undeniably a movie. But should the absence of
actual film stock disqualify it from competing for a golden statue on
Oscar night?</LD>
<LD>   This distinction in language may seem insignificant, but these two
little words -- "film" and "digital" -- stand at the center of a
battle in Hollywood. The vocabulary shift is affecting everything
from worker paychecks and union contracts to job definitions and
distribution deals.</LD>
<TE>   "It may be the most profound change that the entertainment
industry has ever seen," said Jonathan Kuntz, an visiting associate
professor in American movie history at UCLA's department of film,
television and digital media.</TE>
<TE>   The wordplay has been important enough to compel the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' board of governors to vote on the
so-called digital issue.</TE>
<TE>   The summons went out last summer to the elite of the established
film world, including actor Tom Hanks, director Michael Mann and
cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. The governors gathered at the
academy's plush offices in Beverly Hills and, when they reached the
proper point on the agenda, began refining the technical definition
of "digital" cinema.</TE>
<TE>   What does it mean to be digital? Can an all-digital production be
considered a film? What if the movie never touches celluloid, which
is Lucas' goal for "Star Wars Episode III"?</TE>
<TE>   The discussion, though engrossing, was brief. Raising his voice,
Academy President Frank Pierson simply asked, "Who's going to call
George Lucas and tell him his movie can't be nominated for an Oscar?"</TE>
<TE>   From the introduction of sound to the advent of color, each
significant technological shift in the film industry has wrought
havoc on some level.</TE>
<TE>   When silent movies adopted synchronized sound, the new technology
wiped out the careers of those who wrote intertitles, the screens
that displayed the dialogue spoken by the actors or described what
was happening in a scene.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of musicians also lost their jobs, as theaters no longer
needed to employ live orchestras to accompany silent movies, and a
generation of actors failed to make the transition.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the widespread introduction of color film in the 1930s
forced costume designers to create new wardrobes that worked in a
multihued world. Lighting designers and cinematographers had to
adjust their techniques to light sets for color film.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what makes the advent of digital far more revolutionary is
that it touches all levels of Hollywood. Said Kuntz: "This is hitting
everyone" -- often in unexpected ways.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious impacts are on Hollywood employment contracts,
the agreements that unions ink with movie producers, and the pacts
that workers sign when they take on specific jobs.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to repeat the costly mistakes that the guilds made
when they failed to realize the power of new technologies such as
cable TV. Writers gave up lucrative residual payments for shows
written for channels such as HBO -- a bad move, given that these
networks now generate millions of dollars in revenues from original
programming.</TE>
<TE>   This year, when actors began to question who had jurisdiction over
their pay scales on digital TV productions, it sparked a nasty fight
between the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television &amp; Radio Artists.</TE>
<TE>   The two actors' unions entered into an agreement in 1981 that
carved out each guild's area of coverage, particularly in realms such
as television where both of them represent workers. The accord was
crucial because each union negotiates contracts differently -- and at
different rates -- for its shared 40,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA, which dominates video-based productions, claimed that the
more than 40 TV shows filmed this fall using digital cameras fall
under its bailiwick. SAG, which tends to control higher-paying
film-based shows, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   After months of negotiation, the two unions agreed to divide the
existing digital shows on a case-by-case basis. They continued to
discuss the issue last month during informal talks in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, both sides concede that their contracts don't fully
address new technologies such as digital cameras, which usually rely
on videotape for data storage. That's significant because actors
often receive smaller checks for work done on videotape.</TE>
<TE>   How much smaller depends on the show, as the budgeting process and
residual parameters can change from program to program.</TE>
<TE>   "The question we're trying to confront is whether actors will get
paid the same amount regardless of what kind of camera is being
used," said AFTRA President John Connolly.</TE>
<TE>   Actors aren't alone on the vocabulary confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild of America has wrestled with various concerns
on high-tech shoots.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: variations in pay for film and digital television
crews, and the replacement of certain workers when film cameras are
exchanged for electronic gear. Earlier this year, the guild
established an internal committee and began hashing out the matter
with Hollywood producers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a period of time when people will be using a lot of
different media," said Bryan Unger, Western executive director of the
DGA. "We need to iron out these differences, so someone can shoot a
program and the [pay] rates will all stay the same."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of job titles. Some guild-covered
positions require that the same duties be performed no matter what
kind of camera is used, but the names of these occupations can vary.
And that means they can come with different minimum pay requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the parallel roles of first stage manager and
first assistant director. Both must communicate the director's notes
to the actors. Both arrange the shoot time and the crew's work
schedule. But the assistant director works on a show that's shot on
film -- and earns 27% more a week than a stage manager, who only
works on shows shot digitally or with videotape.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, that made some people upset," Unger said.</TE>
<TE>   An interim settlement agreement was struck in February. It allowed
workers to migrate between the two formats and leveled the pay scale,
finding a middle ground between the two rates.</TE>
<TE>   Pay aside, there is the even more powerful -- and subtle -- matter
of shifting job responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Because many people in the production and post-production process
use similar computer tools, it is very easy for a worker to be hired
for one job and then ultimately handle a totally different one when
the movie begins rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Unionized workers in Hollywood typically are paid based on their
job title, which contractually outlines what duties are expected. If
these duties change midway through a show, the worker's paycheck
won't reflect that unless the employee is rehired under a new
contract -- a switch that rarely happens.</TE>
<TE>   Without a new contract, a worker's pay can be far more -- or far
less -- than what the union says the job calls for.</TE>
<TE>   Movie producers say this ambiguity is cropping up increasingly
frequently in many areas -- including the intersection of art, art
direction and set design -- where technology is allowing workers to
take on expanded roles.</TE>
<TE>   These days, traditional set designers say they use
three-dimensional software tools to create virtual props -- a job
typically handled by a model maker. Art directors say they rely on
photo editing software to adjust the lighting of a set in
pre-production -- a task normally controlled by the visual effects
team.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitions are changing on everything, even what the word
'digital' means," said John Manulis, chief executive of the digital
movie production firm, Visionbox Media Group. "There are so many
technologies that are encompassed in that one word....The one thing
everyone agrees on is that 'digital' equals change. This is an
industry that operates largely out of fear, and not unreasonably so
because change is threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Manulis knows this firsthand. When producers were trying to nail
down sales for the rights to show his film "Tortilla Soup" abroad,
few people knew it was shot on digital cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Samuel Goldwyn Films, the company that co-produced and
handled domestic distribution for "Tortilla Soup," didn't talk about
it. Executives say they intentionally skirted that fact when cutting
distribution deals because they feared the word "digital" would taint
the movie, making it difficult to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "The public thinks of digital as filming off the cuff," said
director Penelope Spheeris, who has used high-definition cameras on
several recent television and documentary projects. "They think of
videotape, and they think of a movie that looks terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Digital camera makers "have been running around town telling
everyone 'This is cheap!' " added Meyer Gottlieb, associate producer
on "Tortilla Soup" and president of Samuel Goldwyn Films. "Cheap is a
bad, bad word for us because buyers will refuse to pay a lot of money
for something they hear is cheap....It doesn't take a marketing
genius to figure that out."</TE>
<TE>   When Samuel Goldwyn Films started to shop "Tortilla Soup" around,
it recorded the digital movie onto a 35mm print and played it on a
traditional film projector. After foreign and domestic distribution
deals with various outlets were signed, word trickled out about the
movie's digital roots. Organizers of digital film festivals began
peppering Samuel Goldwyn with requests to include the movie in their
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Goldwyn Films repeatedly declined the requests. No amount
of free publicity, officials say, was worth the risk of undermining
future deals.</TE>
<TE>   "For us," Gotlieb said, "there is no value in embracing the word
'digital.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the word couldn't be ignored at the academy. Back in its
Beverly Hills offices last June, the governors ceased their
discussion over the definition of digital in a "Star Wars" world,
raised their hands and voted unanimously.</TE>
<TE>   The rules are clear: In the eyes of Oscar, "film" is not required
to make a motion picture.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Sales Don't Cheer Investors</HD>
<DH>A disappointing report on manufacturing erases Wall
Street's early gains. Tech shares inch up on rating upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An early rally on Wall Street faded Monday after a report showed U.S.
manufacturing shrank for a third straight month in November.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks had shot higher after the opening bell, with the Dow
industrials gaining almost 150 points on evidence of strong holiday
sales at retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores and an investment upgrade
on chip maker Intel.</LD>
<LD>   But the upswing hit a bump when a manufacturing report from the
Institute for Supply Management was weaker than economists had
forecast and signaled output was still contracting.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought the economy had turned the corner and
this brings us back to reality," said John Cassady, senior portfolio
manager at Fifth/Third Investment Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturing is mired in this no-growth area and I think that's
going to be the case for a while," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 33.52 points, or
0.4%, at 8,862.57. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 1.78
points, or 0.2%, to 934.53. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite
index gained 6 points, or 0.4%, at 1,484.78.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
They were about even on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Intel gained 17 cents to $21.05 and Advanced Micro Devices rose 43
cents to $8.93 after Lehman Bros. upgraded both companies, citing
growing demand for computers that use their microchips.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some belief in the market that we're slowly wending our
way to improved demand," said Marian Kessler, fund manager for
Rutherford Investment Management in Portland, Ore. "Tech is the
flavor of the day."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing stocks also weighed on the Dow average after the
disappointing ISM figures.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar shed 68 cents to $49.22, while
conglomerate 3M sagged $1.50 to $128.35.</TE>
<TE>   The ISM said its index of manufacturing business conditions read
49.2 in November, below forecasts for 51.3. A reading below 50
indicates the sector is contracting.</TE>
<TE>   Losses in the Dow were kept in check by Wal-Mart, which rose 22
cents to $54.38 after the world's biggest retailer on Saturday posted
record one-day sales for the day after Thanksgiving, and an
independent poll by ShopperTrak found sales at all retailers are up
more than 12% over last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields, which have been climbing in recent weeks, soared
early in the day on the retail-sales reports, but fell back after the
ISM report.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which closed
Friday at 4.21%, jumped to 4.35% before retreating to 4.23% at the
close.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Wireless stocks helped underpin the technology sector after
Morgan Stanley upgraded the U.S. wireless telecom industry, saying it
expected 2003 to be a much better year. AT&amp;T Wireless Services
rallied 50 cents to $8.05. Sprint PCS Group tacked on 43 cents to
$6.19.</TE>
<TE>   * Nortel Networks was the most active stock on the NYSE after the
company said it will supply $65 million in gear to expand the
wireless phone networks operated by China's No. 2 carrier, China
Unicom. Nortel shares jumped 36 cents, or 19%, to $2.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Nextel Partners added $1.45 to $8.05 after saying Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates increased his stake in the wireless telephone
company to more than 5%. Microsoft shares edged up 1 cent to $57.69.</TE>
<TE>   * Johnson &amp; Johnson sagged $1.32 to $55.70 amid worries French
regulators may ban the use of the firm's anemia drug for people with
chronic kidney failure because of worrisome side effects seen in some
patients.</TE>
<TE>   * Schering-Plough dropped $1.16 to $21.50. The drug maker may face
competition for treating hepatitis C as Roche Holding is expected to
win U.S. regulatory approval to market its therapy for the disease.
Analysts said Roche may sell its treatment at a discount to capture
half of the $2-billion market.</TE>

<HD>Groups Ask Court to Block U.S. From Opening Roads to
Mexican Truckers</HD>
<DH>Coalition claims that the move, part of NAFTA compliance,
would worsen air quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental, labor and trucking groups filed Monday for an
emergency injunction to stop the Bush administration from opening
U.S. roadways to Mexican truckers, claiming that the move would
substantially increase diesel emissions in areas already suffering
from poor air quality, such as Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The federal appeals court in San Francisco gave the government
until Wednesday to respond.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, legislators and a trucking association in Mexico
bristled at regulations they said were tougher on Mexican truckers
than on those from Canada and urged their government to limit the
entry of U.S. trucks in retaliation.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush directed transportation officials last week to
begin processing permit applications from Mexico-based trucking
firms, signaling an end to a 1982 regulation that restricted such
trucks to commercial zones within 20 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.
Trucks could start rolling north as early as the middle of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government had been under pressure to allow the flow of
trucks in order to comply with the North American Free Trade
Agreement, and the subject may have been raised at a meeting last
month between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Mexican
President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration has consistently expressed its support for
full compliance with NAFTA," White House spokeswoman Clare Buchan
said Monday. "This has been in the works for some time."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the rule change said the timing, coming just
before the four-day Thanksgiving holiday, was intended to mute
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be trucking people hurt on both sides of the
border," said Armando Freire of San Diego-based Dimex Trucking. With
his fleet of 20 trucks, Freire primarily picks up loads from Mexican
firms at the border and delivers them to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They do their part, I do mine and everybody's happy," he said.
"Now all of the sudden we lose control of the freight because a
carrier can take that to L.A. for one-third the cost."</TE>
<TE>   Small operators in Mexico also had argued against the rule change,
fearing that U.S.-based corporations would consolidate the trucking
industry, turning them from independent operators to employees.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., opposition to the rule change came from many
quarters, leading to the unlikely coalition behind Monday's court
filing.</TE>
<TE>   That group includes the Environmental Law Foundation, the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the California Trucking
Assn. Both the Teamsters and the trucking group face competition from
Mexico for jobs and trucking contracts if the rule change is not
blocked.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the same group filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco to stop the rule change, arguing that the Bush
administration skirted the environmental review process and demanding
a full assessment of the effect of Mexican trucks operating
throughout the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Oral arguments were heard in early October and a ruling is
expected soon. Al Meyerhoff, an attorney for the coalition, said he
was stunned when he heard of the administration's announcement
Wednesday, given that the suit is unresolved. The brief filed Monday
argued that no change should proceed until the court decides whether
a more detailed assessment of environmental effects is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of conducting the environmental reviews is to
allow the government to take environmental effects into account
before making the operative decision and putting it into effect," the
filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs argue that Mexican trucks pollute more than do U.S.
rigs because of less stringent air-quality standards in Mexico and
because the trucks tend to be older.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the change counter that Mexican trucks are subject
to the same environmental and safety regulations as U.S. trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uproar, the American Trucking Assn., which has favored
the rule change, contends that there will be little immediate
consequence. "It's going to be an evolutionary rather than a
revolutionary process," said Martin Rojas, director for cross-border
operations for the Virginia-based group. He noted that only 130
Mexican firms have applied for permits to operate in the U.S. Of
those, 60 have been approved pending audits.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mexico, a very large company has 150 trucks," Rojas said.
"There are about 2.6 million Class A trucks in the United States.
We're talking about a speck in the trucking universe of the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican truckers agreed that few would immediately take advantage
of the opening, largely because of safety restrictions imposed by
Congress last summer. According to CANACAR, the largest Mexican
trucking association, only about 30,000 of the 140,000 trucks it
represents meet U.S. safety and environmental standards for hauling
cargo north of the border.</TE>

succeeds in lifting a rule that keeps Mexican trucks within 20 miles

<HD>West Virginia to Join Microsoft Appeal</HD>
<DH>Massachusetts is other state faulting the federal judge's
order that failed to force software firm to disassemble Windows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state of West Virginia said Monday that it would join
Massachusetts in an appeal of a federal judge's order imposing modest
restrictions on the business conduct of Microsoft Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As Massachusetts officials did last week, West Virginia Atty. Gen.
Darrell McGraw Jr. said U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's
Nov. 1 order failed to force the software giant to disassemble the
pieces of its Windows operating system.</LD>
<LD>   "The court failed to impose sanctions that will remedy the
unlawful commingling of computer software code that the federal court
of appeals specifically agreed was an antitrust violation," McGraw
said. He said the state shouldn't plead poverty "and allow an
adjudicated lawbreaker to retain their ill-gotten gains."</LD>
<TE>   Seven other states and the District of Columbia have declined to
appeal and said they will focus their efforts on the enforcement of
Kollar-Kotelly's decree. Under her ruling, Microsoft must disclose
more about how Windows works with Web browsers, media players and
other devices and refrain from retaliating against computer makers
that install non-Microsoft programs.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft gave no indication of alarm. "We're going to continue on
and do what we do best," spokesman Jim Desler said. "We will respond
to anything we have to respond to."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts and analysts said an uphill battle lies ahead for
the two states. Originally 19 states filed suit alongside the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly wrote more than 300 pages, exhaustively tying a
proposed settlement by the Justice Department back to instructions
from the appeals court, which had overturned an earlier order to
break the company in two.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly modified that settlement slightly, as
Massachusetts, West Virginia and seven other states had asked. But
she rejected those states' requests for more sweeping remedies,
including forcing Microsoft to release the code for Internet
Explorer, to license a version of the Office productivity suite for
other operating systems, and to sell a cheaper, bare-bones version of
Windows without the Explorer browser and other additions.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Houck, who had been a leader of the states' case before
the settlement, said Massachusetts and West Virginia have a chance to
convince the appeals court that some of its guidance wasn't followed.</TE>
<TE>   In its previous ruling, the appeals court found that Microsoft
intertwined the browser and operating system to shore up its Windows
monopoly from a threat by Netscape and the Java programming language.</TE>
<TE>   Yet little in the lower court's remedy order addressed that
problem, and no code was ordered removed. Instead, the judge followed
the Justice Department's lead in settling for provisions such as one
allowing computer makers to hide the desktop icons for Microsoft
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Commingling is one of the most significant issues," Houck said.
"It's something that the court of appeals spent a lot of time on and
concluded was illegal."</TE>
<TE>   If the court agrees with the appealing states, it could order a
modular Windows or open-source Internet Explorer or refer the case
back to Kollar-Kotelly for more sanctions.</TE>

<HD>Music Labels Urged to Revise Royalties</HD>
<DH>A state Senate panel criticizes record firms' accounting
and threatens to take action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Senate Select Committee on the Entertainment Industry
issued a report Monday calling on record labels to reform accounting
practices or face legislative penalties in the future.</LD>
<LD>   The report was released by Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City), the
chairman of the committee. It follows a trio of hearings in
Sacramento attended by more than a dozen music stars, including
Courtney Love and Don Henley, who complained about being cheated by
their record labels.</LD>
<LD>   "I urge the record companies to consider ... changes on their own
to avoid ... legislative action," Murray says in the report.</LD>
<TE>   During the hearings, representatives from the nation's five
largest record corporations -- Vivendi Universal's Universal Music
Group, Bertelsmann's Bertelsmann Music Group, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music
Entertainment, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music Group and EMI
Group -- denied to legislators that they gouge artists of earnings.
Last month, however, BMG and Universal announced plans to revise
their royalty accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, Murray chastises labels for forcing artists to
reimburse them for the cost of recording albums and videos. He also
criticizes record companies for compelling artists to pay back costs
associated with marketing and independent radio promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, though, the report focuses on the problems surrounding
accounting for artist royalties. Murray says that artists believe
they are forced to sign agreements that favor the record company, and
that acts are not even paid the royalties due under these contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "In our legislative hearings, it was clear that artists feel they
are being systematically cheated out of their royalties," Murray says
in the report. "The hearing showed that at the very least there is
purposeful neglect on the part of the record company accounting
departments."</TE>
<TE>   During the hearings, auditors said firms often capitalize on
contracts that are loaded with royalty policies designed to override
provisions benefiting artists. And because few artists can afford to
audit their labels, the report says, these practices often result in
windfalls for the record companies.</TE>
<TE>   Murray also chides the labels for lacing contracts with clauses
that essentially preclude any penalty for the underpayment of
royalties -- even if caught.</TE>
<TE>   "Each recording contract contains a clause that the record
company, no matter how egregious their behavior, will never be liable
for more than the amount of royalties due," the report says. Such
clauses protect companies and entice labels to hide money from
artists.</TE>
<TE>   The report suggests two potential solutions. One is to introduce
legislation defining the practice of paying royalties to an artist as
a fiduciary duty. The second is to write a law designating severe
penalties to those companies that engage in a pattern of
underpayment.</TE>
<TE>   "Government is usually loath to actually dictate the terms of
contracts between private parties," the report says, "but when the
relative leverage of the parties significantly favors one party,
government often steps in to protect the party with the least
leverage."</TE>

<LD>United Airlines led U.S. carriers in on-time performance in October
as the percentage of late-arriving flights rose industrywide for the
first time in 19 months.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of flights of the 10 largest U.S. carriers that
arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled time fell to 84.2% from
84.8% in October 2001, according to a monthly report from the
Department of Transportation.</LD>
<LD>   UAL Corp.'s United completed 88% of its flights on time, ahead of
US Airways Group Inc. at 87.9% and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines at
87.5%.</LD>
<TE>   Continental Airlines Inc. had the fewest on-time flights in
October at 78.4%, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   October's drop in the on-time rate came as nearly 20% more paying
passengers flew in the month compared with the previous year, when
traffic fell after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to the
Air Transport Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The association is the industry trade group for the major
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Year-over-year comparisons rose for 18 straight months, reaching a
peak of 88% in September, the best showing since the department began
collecting comparable data in 1995.</TE>

<LD>General Electric Co.'s medical-device unit must pay a $75-million
jury award for failing to get regulatory clearance for a
fetal-monitoring device after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear
the company's appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Biomedical Systems Corp., which invented the monitor, won the
award after accusing GE of bungling the Food and Drug Administration
approval process. A 1997 agreement put GE in charge of securing FDA
clearance, making and marketing the product.</LD>
<LD>   GE argued unsuccessfully that it could have secured quicker
approval only if it misled the FDA by saying that the monitor was
intended for use at the end of a pregnancy.</LD>

<LD>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney resigned from Ullico Inc.'s board
of directors, saying the union-owned insurer has not committed itself
to releasing the findings of an internal audit into stock sales by
board members.</LD>
<LD>   Ullico, which offers insurance and financial services to union
members, is under a Labor Department investigation into whether union
leaders on the company's board of directors inappropriately inflated
and then sold stock.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington-based insurance company had asked Jim Thompson, the
former Illinois governor, to conduct an independent inquiry into the
stock sales, and the results of that probe were recently released to
the board.</LD>

Board ruled that agents can't form a union.</LD>
<LD>   The board made its ruling following a petition by the Office and

rule that Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate's agents weren't
independent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is a victory for Allstate chief Edward Liddy, who led
an effort to switch agents from employees to independent contractors
to reduce costs and boost productivity.</LD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission has approved IBM Corp.'s $2.05-billion
sale of most of its hard-disk drive assets to Japan's Hitachi Ltd.,
the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The deal still needs approval from Mexican regulators, an IBM
spokesman said, adding that IBM expects the deal to close by the end
of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The companies plan to combine their hard drive assets into a joint
venture in which Hitachi initially will have a 70% stake.</LD>
<TE>   Hitachi plans to take full ownership of the venture after three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Hard disk drives, similar to other components for computers, have
been hurt by slack demand and sharply reduced pricing in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Hitachi and IBM previously received antitrust approval from
regulators of the European Commission, Japan, Brazil and Taiwan, the
companies said.</TE>
<TE>   IBM stock rose 38 cents to $87.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Medicare overpaid specialty hospitals by $800 million in 2000 because
the U.S. government wasn't adequately screening payment claims,
according to a report.</LD>
<LD>   Medical centers specializing in psychiatric, rehabilitation and
long-term care are paid differently than other hospitals that treat
Medicare patients and weren't scrutinized closely, the inspector
general for the Department of Health and Human Services said.</LD>
<LD>   About 9.2% of the $8.7 billion in specialty hospital payments made
by Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly and
disabled, were erroneous because the services weren't needed or
"reasonable," the report said.</LD>
<TE>   The agency that runs Medicare has told contractors they may review
payments to specialty hospitals, the report said.</TE>

<HD>Analyst Cuts Tenet Earnings Estimate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White and don lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s financial presentation on Wall
Street, another analyst has slashed his earnings estimate for the
hospital company, citing a marked drop-off in payments from health
insurers and Medicare and Medi-Cal.</LD>
<LD>   In a report issued Monday, Darren Lehrich of SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey cut Tenet's earnings growth estimate by 17% in the current
fiscal year and by 43% the next year. Lehrich revised his estimates
for Tenet, the nation's second-largest for-profit hospital chain,
based on the expected elimination of a huge chunk of special Medicare
reimbursements and a lower rate of payment increases from
managed-care companies.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, is being audited by federal
inspectors for aggressively raising its retail hospital charges -- a
move that led to excessive Medicare reimbursements known as "outlier
payments" for unusually costly cases.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet is scheduled to outline a new pricing policy in New York
today in an attempt to quell criticism from investors, regulators and
consumer groups. The company also is expected to give future earnings
guidance in the wake of the Medicare audit and a separate
investigation by federal officials into whether two cardiac doctors
at a Tenet hospital in Redding allegedly performed unnecessary heart
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   In his revised estimate, Lehrich expects Tenet to turn a profit of
$2.50 a share in its fiscal year that ends in May 2003, down from his
earlier estimate of $3. But for the year after that, he projected
that Tenet's earnings would be $2 a share, down from $3.48 in his
previous forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrich also projected that Tenet would lose about $50 million
annually in certain payments from Medi-Cal, the state and federally
funded program for the poor and disabled. Lehrich said that Tenet's
aggressive hospital price increases -- which the company has
acknowledged -- most likely "distorted bad debt levels," and that may
have inflated its payments for providing large amounts of indigent
care, which are known as Medicare Disproportionate Share, or DSH,
payments. Tenet has denied that its price increases led to inflated
DSH payments.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said the DSH receipts
had not grown significantly in recent years and those payments were
the result of having a number of hospitals serving poor, urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Tenet and Health Net Inc., the big California HMO,
announced a new contract that reflects Tenet's expected shift in
pricing strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years Tenet has derived more revenue from health
insurers in the form of "stop-loss payments," which are based on a
percentage of hospital retail charges and are typically higher than
the usual fixed reimbursements. A Health Net spokesman said Monday
that more than half of its payments to Tenet hospitals last year came
from stop-loss, compared with the "mid-teens" for other hospitals
overall.</TE>
<TE>   In the new contract, which covers 27 Tenet hospitals in Los
Angeles and Orange counties, Health Net will not make any stop-loss
payments to Tenet for in-patient care. Originally, stop-loss payments
were intended to help hospitals deal with unusually complicated
cases, such as premature babies.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would say how much more Health Net agreed to pay
Tenet in fixed daily rates under the new contract.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Tenet's stock fell 69 cents to close at $17.76 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>High Court Rejects Smokers' Bid for Share of Settlement</HD>
<DH>The justices refuse to revive Medicaid patient lawsuits
seeking part of the $246 billion being paid to the states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Stohr</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that it would not hear arguments
from onetime smokers who sought a share of the $246 billion in
payments that tobacco companies must make under their 1998
settlements with the states.</LD>
<LD>   The justices refused to revive three lawsuits filed in West
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The suits were among at
least eight around the country claiming that the federal Medicaid
statute entitles sick smokers to some of the settlement money.</LD>
<LD>   Every court to consider the issue, including the U.S. 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals in the latest case, has rejected the smoker claims.
The Supreme Court has refused four times this year to intervene on
behalf of the Medicaid patients.</LD>
<TE>   Medicaid, the joint federal-state health-care program for the
poor, lets states sue third parties to get reimbursement for
health-care expenses.</TE>
<TE>   At the Supreme Court, in the case of Strawser vs. Atkins, smokers
led by West Virginian Lois Strawser argued that patients are entitled
to any tobacco company payments that exceed the amount spent on
health care by the states and the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The justices made no comment in rejecting the appeal. West
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina all urged the high court
not to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 settlements let Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc. and other cigarette makers resolve state government
claims for the costs of treating sick smokers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying $246 billion over 25 years, the companies
agreed to reduce marketing and work to reduce youth smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Individual smokers still may file their own suits against tobacco
companies. In the biggest defeat for the industry so far, cigarette
makers are appealing a $145-billion jury award to a class of Florida
smokers.</TE>

<HD>United Reaches Deal With Union</HD>
<DH>Revised proposal calls for a 7% cut in wages for mechanics
as airline pushes for cost-cutting concessions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Marek</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines reached a tentative agreement with union
leaders on a revised contract for the airline's mechanics, the only
employee group that hasn't accepted concessions intended to help
avoid a filing for Bankruptcy Court protection.</LD>
<LD>   The 13,000 mechanics and cleaners will vote again Thursday after
rejecting a previous proposal last week. The revised proposal
includes a 7% wage cut.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the world's second-biggest airline said it will use
grace periods allowed for repayment of some $920 million of debt
originally due Monday or earlier, as it awaits a decision on federal
aid that could help it avert a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<TE>   With the grace period, Oak Grove Park, Ill.-based UAL now has
until Dec. 12 to repay $375 million in debt securities owed to a
German bank.</TE>
<TE>   The company is seeking $2 billion in financing, of which $1.8
billion would need to be guaranteed by the Air Transportation
Stabilization Board. A decision from the board could come any day.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its application for the ATSB loan guarantee, and to
avoid filing for bankruptcy, UAL sought $5.2 billion in wage and
other concessions from its unions. Rejection of wage cuts by the
mechanics may unravel the savings plan because concessions by other
unions are contingent on all employees participating.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have had this loan wrapped up months ago," said
Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George
Washington University. "It shows just how badly they messed up the
process."</TE>
<TE>   The airline and union leaders agreed over the weekend to let
mechanics choose which of their vacation days will be unpaid, a
sticking point for many of the workers, the union said. Leaders of
the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers urged the
mechanics to accept the new proposal, including a 7% wage cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the final opportunity to avoid bankruptcy and protect
against the elimination of our entire collective bargaining
agreement," Scotty Ford, president of the United mechanics district
wrote in a letter to union members posted on the union Web site
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   UAL shares rose 83 cents, or 34%, to close at $3.28 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 76% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's $200 million of 9.125% notes maturing in 2012 rose 5
cents to about 15 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on Friday,
traders said. The notes were as high as 65 cents on the dollar at the
start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   UAL Chief Executive Glenn Tilton said last month that the company
currently has more than $1 billion in cash.</TE>
<TE>   United's pilots and flight attendants, as well as the baggage
handlers, customer service agents and reservations agents represented
by the machinists union, have all approved concessions that are
contingent on participation from all United workers and approval of
the federal loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The loan guarantee request was made in June and UAL has been
making presentations in recent weeks to answer ATSB questions. The
board has said it will favor applications that include concessions
from workers, suppliers and creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "The mechanics are a sideshow here. The main show is the ATSB,"
said UBS Warburg analyst Sam Buttrick, who has a "sell" rating on the
company and doesn't own shares. "It's pretty much bankruptcy watch at
this juncture."</TE>

<HD>Disclosure Pressure Put on Fidelity</HD>
<DH>An investor group wants the fund company to end its
opposition to an SEC proposal to make proxy votes public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Activists are stepping up the pressure on Fidelity Investments to
drop opposition to a proposed rule that would require disclosure of
votes cast on behalf of mutual fund shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   An investor group said Monday that it had filed a shareholder
resolution urging Fidelity Magellan, the nation's second-largest
stock fund, to disclose its so-called proxy votes on such issues as
reelecting directors and setting executive pay at companies in which
the fund owns shares.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholder resolutions, which are nonbinding, have become
increasingly common at U.S. companies in the wake of Enron Corp. and
other corporate governance scandals, but they rarely have been
targeted at mutual fund managements.</LD>
<TE>   Boston financial planner Charles Sandmel and Responsible Wealth, a
network of activist investors, are coordinating the resolution
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity and other fund companies oppose disclosing proxy votes,
saying that investors are not interested and that quiet diplomacy
could be undermined if disagreements with management become public.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed
requiring fund companies to reveal how votes are cast, setting a
two-month public comment period that ends Friday. Commissioners are
expected to make a final ruling within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has gotten about 3,000 letters and e-mails, the vast
majority backing the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO has been urging fund companies to disclose their votes
for the last two years. Since September, it and other activists have
called on individuals to write or e-mail the SEC in support of the
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO said it would be on hand today to pass out
leaflets at Fidelity's office at 10100 Santa Monica Blvd. in Century
City. The labor organization is asking Fidelity to change its stance
and support proxy disclosure. Similar events at Fidelity's Boston
headquarters and at its offices in 19 other cities will be held
Wednesday, the group said.</TE>

<HD>Lucent Sets Vote on Reverse Stock Split</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucent Technologies Inc. will ask shareholders for the option to
approve a reverse stock split at any one of four ratios, a move
needed because of the lingering slump in Lucent's stock price.</LD>
<LD>   Lucent, which announced plans for the reverse split in October,
will seek shareholder approval of the proposal during its next annual
meeting, set for Feb. 19 in Dallas, according to a preliminary proxy
statement filed late Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   In a reverse stock split, a set number of shares is combined into
one share worth more money. The ratios the board is considering are
one for 10, one for 20, one for 30 and one for 40.</LD>
<TE>   The proxy also disclosed that Lucent paid Patricia Russo, who
became president and chief executive in January, $1.2 million in
salary. Lucent, which has about 3.5 billion shares of common stock
outstanding, has been badly hurt by the prolonged slump in the
telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   It recently was warned by the New York Stock Exchange that it
could be delisted because its share price stayed below the
$1-per-share required minimum. The warning came in October, when
Lucent's average closing price had been below $1 for 30 straight
trading days.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent closed up 14 cents Monday at $1.89.</TE>

<HD>Bill Greene, 72; Served in the State Legislature for 25
Years</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Retired state Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), a
freedom rider during the civil rights struggle in the South who never
lost his passion for social justice, died Monday at age 72.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Yvonne LaFargue Greene, said he died at Kaiser South
Sacramento Medical Center of complications from several long
illnesses, including heart attacks, strokes and pneumonia, which
hastened his retirement from the Legislature in 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, an imposing man of 6 feet 2 and almost 200 pounds, had
represented South-Central in the Assembly and Senate for 25 years.</LD>
<TE>   He had fought recurring bouts of alcoholism and voluntarily
underwent treatment for the disease. Since his retirement, his wife
said, Greene had been a patient at hospitals and nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   "He suffered so much for so long," she said. "A lot of people's
lives are a lot better because of Bill Greene."</TE>
<TE>   She said a celebration of Greene's life will be held in Sacramento
soon, and that, in lieu of flowers, friends will be asked to
contribute to a memorial scholarship fund.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kansas City, Mo., Greene attended the University of
Michigan. He became immersed in the struggle of African Americans in
the South for equality during the violent early 1960s. Yvonne Greene
said his colleagues included such civil rights leaders as Julian Bond
and Stokley Carmichael as well as James Farmer, leader of the
Congress of Racial Equality.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was arrested at least twice for his part in civil rights
demonstrations, his wife said. He served a prison sentence in
Mississippi. He also was arrested and jailed in Louisiana, but
escaped. When they were engaged, she said, "I couldn't take him to
meet my mother and family because he was a fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   But they married, and he continued his protests.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent most of our honeymoon sewing up his ragged clothes. He
was one of the larger guys, and the police force always went for him
first," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he was hired as the first African American desk clerk in
the Assembly by Speaker Jesse M. Unruh. Greene was elected to the
Assembly in 1967, succeeding his longtime friend and mentor Mervyn
Dymally, who moved to the state Senate and later became lieutenant
governor and a congressman.</TE>
<TE>   "In 42 years of friendship, we only had one argument," Dymally
said. He called Greene "as loyal as the day is long."</TE>
<TE>   Their only argument occurred when Dymally asked Greene to make
telephone fund-raising calls for other candidates. " 'I don't make
calls for anybody,' " Dymally recalled Greene told him.</TE>
<TE>   Greene succeeded Dymally in the Senate in 1975. An expert in labor
law and workers' compensation insurance issues, Greene headed the
Industrial Relations Committee for years.</TE>
<TE>   Dymally recalled Greene as "very pro-labor and pro-business. He
was able to mix the two without antagonizing either group. His
position was you have to have jobs for people in oppressed areas, and
if you're anti-business, you're not going to have jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Among his many careers, Greene served as a lobbyist for the
Building Service Employees International Union, a field
representative for the Los Angeles City Employees Assn., and a staff
member of the Voice of America and member of the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   One of his proudest achievements, his wife said, was being named
citizen of the year in 1984 by the Catholic Labor Institute of
Southern California, which saluted him for his "sincere and undying
commitment to social justice."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Greene is survived by two daughters,
Alisa Rochelle and Jan Andrea.</TE>

<HD>Dave McNally, 60; Pitcher's Fight Led to Free Agency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitcher Dave McNally, whose many victories on the field paled in
comparison with his victory in a precedent-setting arbitration case,
died Sunday of cancer in Billings, Mont. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   McNally and fellow pitcher Andy Messersmith tested baseball's
reserve clause in 1975 and received a landmark ruling from arbitrator
Peter Seitz that created the era of free agency and raised the
average major-league salary from five figures to seven.</LD>
<LD>   Messersmith, then pitching for the Dodgers, was first into the
uncharted waters. When the Dodgers refused to put a no-trade clause
in his 1975 contract, Messersmith refused to sign, playing instead
under a renewed contract. The Major League Baseball Players Assn.
filed a grievance.</LD>
<TE>   Union head Marvin Miller then approached McNally, who was pitching
for the Montreal Expos without a contract and who sat out more than
half the season because of a sore arm.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really bright guy," Miller recalled Monday. "He said,
'You want insurance and I'll be glad to give it to you.' So he joined
the grievance. He didn't hesitate for a second. His contribution was
a great one."</TE>
<TE>   Until that time, a team could hold the rights to a player for his
entire career. Messersmith and McNally argued that a player should be
allowed to become a free agent one year after his contract expired.</TE>
<TE>   While Messersmith was fighting for his future, McNally knew he was
already through with baseball, knew his aching left arm had thrown
its last competitive pitch, knew he was challenging the baseball
establishment for the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   "What I was seeking was fairness to young players," he later told
United Press International. "My whole objection to the reserve clause
was that it wasn't giving young players a chance.... . I saw so much
of this during my time in the big leagues. Good, young players, real
dynamite talent, was just sitting on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Truthfully, when the arbitrator rendered his decision in my
favor, I wasn't really surprised. In my own mind, I didn't see any
other decision he could make."</TE>
<TE>   When Seitz announced Dec. 23, 1975, that the reserve clause was
illegal, baseball was forever changed.</TE>
<TE>   While McNally's name will forever be linked with that ruling, his
name can also be found in baseball's record book.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Billings on Oct. 31, 1942, David Arthur McNally attended
Billings Central Catholic High School, which did not field a baseball
team. So he turned to American Legion ball to demonstrate his
pitching potential. And demonstrate it he did. In 1960, McNally was
18-1 with five no-hitters for his American Legion squad.</TE>
<TE>   That impressed the Baltimore Orioles enough to sign McNally for
$80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he made his major-league debut at 19, pitching a
two-hit shutout to beat the Kansas City Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-11, 190-pound McNally went on to pitch 14 seasons in
the big leagues, 13 of those with the Orioles. He finished with a
184-119 record, a 3.24 earned run average, 1,512 strikeouts and 33
shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   His most impressive run came from 1968 to 1971, four seasons in
which he won 20 games each year.</TE>
<TE>   McNally was an All-Star in 1969, '70 and '72, and was a member of
pennant-winning teams in Baltimore in 1966, '69, '70 and '71. The
1966 and '70 Oriole teams went on to win the World Series. The 1966
victory against the Dodgers was clinched by McNally with a 1-0
shutout in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   McNally wasn't only effective with a ball in his hand. He could
produce with a bat as well, hitting 11 home runs in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   He is the only pitcher ever to hit a grand slam in the World
Series, doing so in Game 3 in 1970 against the Cincinnati Reds' Wayne
Granger.</TE>
<TE>   Traded to the Montreal Expos on Dec. 4, 1974, McNally quit
baseball the following June after starting the season 3-6.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to run a car dealership in Billings, but his greatest
effect on baseball was yet to come. The average salary in 1975, the
last year before the arbitration ruling, was $44,000. At the start of
this past season, it was $2.38 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between winning and losing," Dick Moss, the lawyer
who argued the case for the players' association, told the Associated
Press, "was billions and billions of dollars, maybe tens of billions
of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   McNally, who was diagnosed with lung cancer nearly five years ago,
leaves a wife, Jean, and five adult children.</TE>

<HD>Ellen Straus, 75; Pioneer in Farmland Preservation Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ellen Straus, the Marin County dairy farmer shunned fifty years ago
by the local agricultural community who went on to become the face of
the farmland preservation movement in the Bay Area and a pioneer of
organic dairy farming, died Saturday. She was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Straus died of brain cancer at the family farm bordering Tomales
Bay north of San Francisco, said her daughter Vivien.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the Bay Area, Straus was better known as the pioneer of
the burgeoning California farmstead cheese movement and gourmet trade
in high-end butters, yogurts and cream products.</LD>
<TE>   Within her family, she was known as someone with the sublimely
tactful ability to lead people without their knowing she was doing
it, a quality her son Michael called "the gestalt of Mom."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, her beginnings could scarcely have been less
agricultural. Straus was born Ellen Tirza Lotte Prins to a Jewish
family in Amsterdam. She was 13 when her family fled the Nazi
invasion of Holland for New York City.</TE>
<TE>   She had completed a science degree at Bard College when a
German-born family acquaintance, Bill Straus, came to call.
"Actually, he came twice," she liked to boast. "The first time I
wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   He was a rare suitor: a Jewish dairy farmer. European Jews were
traditionally restricted to towns, but Straus' family had come to the
U.S. from Hamburg to study agriculture at UC Berkeley and UC Davis,
then stayed when World War II broke out. When Straus came courting in
1949, he was already the owner of a small farm on the shores of
Tomales Bay, replete with 23 cows named after family and friends.
After 16 days, he proposed, adding, "Hurry up. I have to get back to
my cows."</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, they were married. "It was like moving to
paradise," she recalled in a speech before the American Farmland
Trust in 1998. But, while the Dutch New Yorker loved California, not
all Northern Californians loved her.</TE>
<TE>   "The Strauses really tried to be part of the community, but the
ranching community froze them out," said Phyllis Faber, a local
wetland biologist. "They were Jewish and they were newcomers, so the
Strauses turned to east Marin, the Democratic Party and Marin
Conservation League."</TE>
<TE>   Straus served on the Democratic Central Committee from 1959 to
1970 before her attention turned to conservation. John Alden,
chairman of the Marin Democratic party, said Straus led the way in
alerting dairy farmers to the impact of manure runoff on Tomales Bay,
and the local oyster fisheries. "Ellen Straus' dairy was the most
aggressive in starting to spray the fields to wash manure into
retaining ponds," Alden said.</TE>
<TE>   But as milk prices fluctuated and dairy farmers increased their
herd sizes (and manure loads) in an attempt to avert bankruptcy,
another threat loomed for the Marin ranchers: suburban development.
For many farmers, it became easier to grow housing developments than
food.</TE>
<TE>   "Zoning just didn't stop it," said Faber. In the mid-1970s, Faber
and Straus went to the Trust for Public Land and proposed an
agricultural land trust, the first of its kind, in which a trust
purchased the right to develop land from farmers. In 1980, the Marin
Agricultural Land Trust was born. "At the time, ranchers felt that it
was just for ranchers who were failing," said Faber. But today 47
ranches covering nearly 32,000 acres and 30% of Marin farmland have
the easements.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, with farm conservation in full swing, the Straus family
led the next revolution in Northern California dairying. While most
of the state's farmers were steadily increasing herd sizes from 300
to 400 to 500 head of cattle just to stay in business, Bill and Ellen
Straus' son Albert found a way for farmers in the ecologically
sensitive strip along Tomales Bay to reduce herd sizes. They left the
swollen wet milk market of co-ops and processors and formed the
Straus Family Creamery, which would produce only specialty
"value-added" dairy products: bottles of unhomogenized milk,
old-fashioned cream, yogurt and European-style butter. In 1994, it
became the first fully organic dairy in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Straus was so proud of her son and the family creamery that she
wasted no opportunity to promote it. Earlier this year, when taken to
an oncologist after suffering piercing headaches, she inquired if her
doctor liked dairy products. "Oh, yes, Mrs. Straus," he replied. "I
love yogurt. But your yogurt is too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   On the next trip to the same doctor, after being told that she had
an inoperable brain tumor, she whispered something to her daughter
Miriam, who said to the doctor, "My mother's dying wish is that you
try her yogurt."</TE>
<TE>   That yogurt, now sold throughout California, was so successful in
chains such as Trader Joe's and Whole Foods that it alerted rival
farmers to an alternative to the liquid milk market, whose low
returns were driving so many from the land. If the farmers kept their
milk rather than selling it to processors, then made a farmstead
yogurt, cheese or butter, they could not only make a better product
and more money, but do it with fewer cows.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, this led the largest dairy bordering the bay, owned
by Robert Giacomini, a longtime critic of Straus, to halve his
enormous herd and go into cheese production. The California Milk
Advisory Board picked up on the movement with the "It's the Cheese"
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Conley, founder of the Cowgirl Creamery in Pt. Reyes, started
what is now one of the country's leading specialist cheese shops in
the mid-1990s with the Straus Family Creamery as her leading
supplier. "The thing about Ellen," she said, "if you read a
conventional obituary, you would think she's the most serious, stern
person because she was incredibly ethical about her causes. But what
that wouldn't show are the incredibly witty and whimsical sculptures
she did of cows. She was funny and fun and light, and she wouldn't
have done any of it unless it was fun."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Berner, executive director of the Marin Agricultural Land
Trust, thinks it is not so strange that a Jewish girl from the
Netherlands who had no farming background saved Marin's dairy
industry from property developers and helped start the organic dairy
movement in the West. Straus was an incorrigible optimist. "Not very
many people really believe that they can change the world. Ellen was
one of those few people who not only believed it, but tried."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband and four children, Straus is survived
by a sister, Anneke Prins Simons; and four grandsons.</TE>

<HD>'Arabization' Forces Iraqi Kurds to Flee From Homes</HD>
<DH>Families are harassed or starved out. A decree 'allows'
minorities to change their ethnicity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BURDA QARAMAN, Iraq</DL>
<LD>As a cold mountain wind heralds the coming winter in northern Iraq,
Hassan Kiram has taken up residence in a small triangular tent of
bright green plastic without a door. So have his wife and six
children.</LD>
<LD>   The Kirams are recent arrivals at this squalid settlement of tents
and crude clay-brick huts with roofs crafted out of cardboard and
plastic sheeting that are held down by stones. The family squeezes
together to sleep on mats atop an earthen floor. Otherwise, there is
no furniture.</LD>
<LD>   The diminutive Kurdish laborer, 38, and his family are among the
latest victims of a sweeping campaign of "ethnic cleansing" that has
forcibly displaced more than 1 million Iraqis since President Saddam
Hussein took power in the 1970s, according to a report by the
Brookings Institution in Washington. All are members of ethnic
minorities.</LD>
<TE>   The goal is to "subdue recalcitrant populations, take over
oil-rich and fertile land, and stamp out political opposition," adds
the think tank report, which says that as many as 800,000 people have
been displaced in northern Iraq and at least 300,000 in the center
and south of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Having lost virtually everything but the few personal items they
can carry, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis still live in destitute
conditions without jobs, access to basic health facilities or
prospects of a better future, charges the report, which was released
in October. It also faults the United Nations and international aid
groups for not devoting enough attention or resources to a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most profound human tragedies in modern Iraq,"
said Nasreen Mustafa Sadiq, the Harvard-educated minister of
reconstruction and human development in the western half of
Kurdistan, the Kurds' self-ruled area in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A new survey by Human Rights Watch -- based on a recent tour of
Kurdistan, where most of the internally displaced end up -- charges
that the campaign ranks as a crime against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   The chief targets today are the ethnic Kurds. In one of the
world's biggest ongoing human upheavals, the Iraqi government is
trying to expand its hold on the oil-rich north by transforming its
identity. The "Arabization" campaign has forced thousands of Kurds
and other minorities to flee and replaced them with Arabs, according
to international human rights groups, U.N. relief agencies and
Kurdish officials.</TE>
<TE>   Even cemeteries are affected, with non-Arab names on tombstones
rubbed out and Arab names engraved in their place. Since April, the
government has offered Arab families extra incentive in the form of
land if they bring the remains of their dead relatives with them to
rebury in local graveyards, say relief groups and deported Kurds. The
goal is to create evidence that the Arab claim to the region goes
back generations.</TE>
<TE>   The new twist stems from "nationality correction" decrees by the
Revolutionary Command Council, the highest governing body under the
Iraqi president. Decree 199, issued in September 2001, "allows"
non-Arab Iraqis over 18 to change their official ethnic identity,
according to Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the regime forces minorities applying for anything
official -- from school enrollment to marriage licenses to car
registration -- to sign a form changing their national identity and
declaring that they are Arabs, according to rights groups and Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole change in demographics goes beyond pushing people out.
Newborns, even Christians, are not allowed to be registered with
non-Arab names. People can't buy a home until they change their
identity to Arab," said Fawzi Hariri of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, or KDP, one of two parties that run the north.</TE>
<TE>   The decrees reflect a subtle and evolving change in tactics. For
years, Baghdad merely ordered minorities to be deported. But after an
international outcry and growing pressure in the 1990s, Hussein's
government devised an approach that doesn't tie it to the evictions.
It is harassing Kurds and other minorities into voluntarily leaving
for a simple reason: They can't survive if they stay.</TE>
<TE>   According to relief agencies, rights groups and Kurdish officials,
Iraq is confiscating the U.N. food ration cards of non-Arabs. It's
pressuring employers to fire them. It's locking up non-Arabs,
including elderly women, until they agree to change their names and
family histories. Those who balk are gradually squeezed out.</TE>
<TE>   "The government doesn't issue deportation orders so people can't
prove they're thrown out. There's no longer a paper trail," said Sami
Abdul Rahman, the KDP deputy prime minister in western Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   Without papers, Kurds have trouble qualifying for aid from either
Kurdish groups or the United Nations. And without a ration card, the
internally exiled minorities have no access to food baskets provided
by the World Food Program to Iraqi families.</TE>
<TE>   "It can take months to verify their circumstances and get them
back on the list for rations. In the meantime, these people are also
unemployed and have no source of income," said Salah Rashid, the
minister of human rights for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the
political movement running eastern Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   Without deportation evidence, tracking the flow is also more
difficult. The monthly influx has varied widely in recent years, from
a few dozen families to up to 3,000 people, Kurds and relief groups
say. Some families are merely dumped at one of the checkpoints into
Kurdistan. Others make their own way across the no man's land
frontier. And many move in with extended family members already
forced into the north.</TE>
<TE>   Before he reluctantly opted to leave the city of Kirkuk on Oct.
30, Kiram had been increasingly harassed. He said he was ordered to
abandon his Kurdish family name or face unemployment -- and then
jail. The family of eight was told to leave its rented home so the
government could build a road, with no alternative provided.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the hardest parts was taking my kids out of school. Now
they don't have a home -- or a future. But what else could I do?" he
said, as the children, ages 4 to 18, meandered among the debris of
the makeshift camp.</TE>
<TE>   The family spends much of its day searching for large stones to
begin building a one-room shanty, like others in Burda Qaraman, a
dusty settlement without proper sanitation in the foothills of rugged
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout northern Iraq, the United Nations has set up a series
of more-regulated camps with larger tents and access to running
water, communal toilets and limited electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the road from the Kirams, Gola and her two sons have
lived in tent No. 53 at Takia Camp since an Iraqi truck dumped them
and a few belongings at the edge of Kurdistan on Sept. 2. Takia is
home to dozens of Kurdish families who live in dusty
12-foot-by-12-foot tents. Some claim to have been stuck here since
1998 in the long wait for alternative shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Gola is a prematurely aged Kurd with weathered hands who asked
that her last name not be used because two other sons are still
hiding in their hometown. She said she had long been harassed by
Iraqi secret police. Her husband was imprisoned in 1981 and then
disappeared in 1984, although she still holds out hope that he wasn't
executed.</TE>
<TE>   The last straw was in August, Gola said, when Iraqi agents came to
the home where her family had lived for three generations and
demanded their food ration cards. Then she was taken to police
headquarters, where she was held until two sons arrived and offered
to take her place so she could go home. They were then told that if
the family didn't leave the area, the sons would be held indefinitely
in another jail.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't need to think very long. I'd lost my husband, I wasn't
going to lose my sons," she explained, tears trickling down her
cheeks. The family home was immediately occupied by Arabs, she added.</TE>
<TE>   New arrivals to the camps typically spend at least a year and
often two enduring bitter winters and searing summers before they are
moved out of tents, said Sadiq, who works for the KDP government. And
only 10% to 15% find new jobs. Many aren't allowed to bring
documentation that proves they were trained or had job experience.</TE>
<TE>   The Brookings report charges that the outside world has not helped
in part because it views the problem as temporary -- decades after
the internal expulsions started.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 400,000 displaced persons in the north are reported to
live in 'collective centers,' many in an advanced state of decay with
insufficient infrastructure," it says. "A further 57,000 live in
barracks, including more than 6,000 still in tents."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's displaced are a major and growing drain on the north's
limited resources. Kurdish leaders and relief groups fear they may be
inundated with a new influx if the U.S. opens a military campaign
against the Iraqi regime. Tens of thousands could flee to the
northern enclave, which is already in effect liberated from Baghdad's
control and watched over by U.S. and British warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   What to do with the refugees will be one of the biggest challenges
faced by any post-Hussein government, international groups warn.</TE>
<TE>   "Any new government will have to address these issues as a high
priority if it is to secure the unity and stability of Iraq. And this
will not be easy," warns the Brookings report, written by John
Fawcett and Victor Tanner.</TE>
<TE>   Sorting out ownership could even become the source of new
tensions, the report warns.</TE>
<TE>   "It will require the return or resettlement of hundreds of
thousands of displaced people, in many cases to areas already
occupied by others."</TE>

<HD>Iraq Falling Short, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Remarks seem intended to pressure Hussein on weapons
declaration. In Baghdad today, U.N. teams inspect two presidential
palace sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush disparaged Iraq's efforts to comply with new U.N.
disarmament demands as "not encouraging," suggesting Monday that
Saddam Hussein will fail to meet terms for a key report due this
weekend -- which would move the United States closer to war.</LD>
<LD>   Early today, U.N. weapons investigators made unannounced
inspections of two of Hussein's presidential palace sites for the
first time.  During the last six days, the Iraqi leader has allowed
the inspectors access to suspicious facilities.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush sought to draw attention away from the inspections,
saying that disarmament rather than the inspections is the goal of
the U.N. resolution passed last month.</LD>
<TE>   "The inspectors are not in Iraq to play hide and seek with Mr.
Saddam Hussein," Bush said in remarks at the Pentagon. "Inspectors do
not have the duty or the ability to uncover terrible weapons hidden
in a vast country. The responsibility of inspectors is simply to
confirm the evidence of voluntary and total disarmament."</TE>
<TE>   Under the U.N. resolution, Iraq has until Sunday to provide a full
account of any programs to manufacture nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's remarks appeared intended to intensify pressure on the
Iraqis to comply with the resolution by the deadline. The president
also laid out strict parameters for compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "In the inspections process, the United States will be making one
judgment: Has Saddam Hussein changed his behavior of the last 11
years? Has he decided to cooperate willingly and comply completely,
or has he not?" Bush said. "So far, the signs are not encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   To press his point, Bush spoke for the first time of recent Iraqi
actions he considered provocative: continued firing at U.S. and
British planes in Iraq's "no-fly" zones and a bombastic,
anti-American letter Iraq sent to the United Nations in which it
accepted the terms of the world body's resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "A regime that fires upon American and British pilots is not
taking the path of compliance. A regime that sends letters filled
with protests and falsehoods is not taking the path of compliance,"
the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush added: "Any act of delay, deception or defiance will prove
that Saddam Hussein has not adopted the path of compliance and has
rejected the path of peace."</TE>
<TE>   The president did not spell out what actions he intends to take if
Iraq fails to meet terms of the declaration due Sunday. But he
reiterated in strong language that at some point, the United States
is prepared to respond with force.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. Security Council, the NATO alliance and the United
States are united: Saddam Hussein will fully disarm himself of
weapons of mass destruction," Bush said. "And if he does not, the
United States will lead a coalition to disarm him."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made his comments before he signed a law authorizing a
$393-billion defense budget in the biggest increase in military
spending since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In the Baghdad area today, several U.N. vehicles entered Al Sojoud
palace, one of many large presidential complexes that include
residential, office and warehouse buildings. A second group went to
the main palace, Karadah, in central Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential sites were among those to which Iraq had
restricted access during the previous round of inspections, after the
1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons inspectors spent six hours Monday at the Karama
ballistics design plant in Baghdad, a rocket factory previously
bombed by the United States. A U.N. report issued later Monday said
some equipment appeared to have been moved out of the compound.</TE>
<TE>   The plant director, Brig. Mohammed Saleh Mohammed, told reporters
in Baghdad that the missing equipment had been either destroyed in
the bombing or transferred to another site, whose location has been
provided to the inspectors. He said the factory is involved only in
the manufacture of missiles with a range of 90 miles or less,
permitted under U.N. resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors "saw almost all documents, inspected all buildings
on the site and interviewed some of the employees. There was no
problem, and the whole inspection process went on smoothly," the
Reuters news agency quoted the plant director as saying.</TE>
<TE>   A phalanx of top Bush administration officials also was working to
intensify pressure on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice met with
chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix to discuss how to assess and
respond to the Iraqi weapons declaration expected Sunday. Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz was in London, beginning a trip
to encourage allies to supply bases and other support to possible
military action against Iraq. U.S. officials said Wolfowitz would
outline a program of diplomatic, economic and military aid to Turkey
to gain its support.</TE>
<TE>   And in Denver, Vice President Dick Cheney delivered a speech
emphasizing in stronger words than the president's that the United
States is prepared to respond militarily to Iraqi non-compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "The president knows that wars are never won on the defensive. In
the fight against global terror, we must take the battle to the enemy
and, where necessary, preempt serious threats before they materialize
against our country," Cheney told leaders of the Air National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   "The only path to safety is the path of action. And the United
States of America will act. We will confront every threat from every
source that could possibly bring harm to our country."</TE>
<TE>   Both Bush and Cheney asserted that Iraq is a legitimate target of
the administration's declared war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein's regime has a long history of aggression against
his neighbors and hostility toward America. It has a long history of
ties to terrorists," Bush said. "Now the world has told him the game
is over."</TE>
<TE>   Answering critics who accuse the administration of losing its
focus on Al Qaeda, Cheney insisted that Iraq could make such
terrorists more dangerous by supplying them with chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why confronting the threat posed by Iraq is not a
distraction from the war on terror. It is absolutely crucial to
winning the war on terror," Cheney said. "Saddam Hussein is harboring
terrorists and the instruments of terror."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the administration's focus on the Sunday deadline, it is
likely to take days -- if not weeks -- to evaluate whatever
information Iraq provides.</TE>

take for Blix and his staff to analyze what Iraq discloses, diplomats
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said no quick response is likely
unless Iraq defies expectations and either fails to issue a
declaration or submits one that is blatantly false. More likely, it
will take the U.N. and the administration weeks to peruse the
declaration.</TE>

<HD>Way Cleared for Runnion Murder Trial</HD>
<DH>Losing its bid for a delay, the defense waives its right to
a preliminary hearing on evidence in the child-abduction case watched
nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake Elsinore man agreed Monday to give up his right to a court
hearing that would have established whether there is enough evidence
to bring him to trial in the abduction and slaying of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro "Alex" Avila, 27, waived his preliminary hearing after
his defense team failed to convince Orange County Superior Court
Judge Francisco P. Briseno that they needed more time to review DNA
evidence that allegedly links him to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to skip the proceeding, which the defense did not
explain in court or afterward, sets the stage for the trial to begin.</LD>
<TE>   Avila has pleaded not guilty to one count of kidnapping, two
counts of lewd acts on a child under 14 and one count of murder. A
special-circumstances filing along with those charges can bring the
death penalty, which prosecutors have said they will seek.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton home. Her body was found the next day along a mountain
road near Lake Elsinore, in Riverside County. The case was one of at
least four child abductions this year to draw nationwide notice.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say DNA evidence, credit card and cell phone records,
tire tracks and footprints point to Avila.</TE>
<TE>   They have provided the defense with more than 11,000 pages of
documents and other records to review.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, assistant public defender Phil Zalewski said he
was not comfortable going forward with the information that he and
DNA experts had gathered so far because even though the scientific
analysis was complete, further interpretations were necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Those interpretations are crucial," Zalewski argued. "This is not
a typical, run-of-the-mill DNA case."</TE>
<TE>   But Briseno said there was insufficient evidence to delay the
preliminary hearing. He noted that he had previously granted the
defense more time to prepare for the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant public defender Denise Gragg, who is leading the defense
team, would not elaborate on its decision after Monday's proceeding,
saying only that "under the circumstances, we felt it was appropriate
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said afterward that he would press for
the earliest possible trial date but that he expects the defense to
continue what he called a pattern of delays.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Robert Blake could go on trial as early as June in the civil
wrongful death lawsuit filed against him by his deceased wife's
children, a Los Angeles County judge said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bonny Lee Bakley's four children sued Blake for his alleged role
in the May 4, 2001, fatal shooting of their mother in Studio City.</LD>
<LD>   Blake has been held without bail at Men's Central Jail in downtown
Los Angeles since he was arrested April 18 and charged with murder in
connection with Bakley's death.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter set a June 30 trial date in
the civil case but noted that Blake's attorneys may choose to delay
the civil proceedings until the criminal case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Burbank, seeks unspecified monetary damages.</TE>

<HD>Bishops to Warn of More Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Letter to parishioners foresees 'serious consequences' of
new law on molestation suits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic priests across California plan to warn parishioners
Sunday that the church faces a wave of sexual-abuse lawsuits and
potential financial woes because of a new state law.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Los Angeles Archdiocese officials on Monday said
they plan to challenge the law, which suspends the statute of
limitations in many molestation cases for one year beginning Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The law allows suits against institutions--not just the Catholic
Church--that continued to employ a known molester who went on to
abuse another victim. So long as they are filed in 2003, the suits
may be based on incidents for which the ordinary statute of
limitations has long since run out.</LD>
<TE>   Under current state law, victims of childhood sexual abuse may sue
only up to their 26th birthday or within three years of discovering
that their emotional problems are linked to a molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials and plaintiffs' attorneys estimate the new law
will unleash hundreds of lawsuits statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "We did this to prepare people for this legislation," said Bishop
Tod D. Brown of the Diocese of Orange. "It will potentially have very
serious consequences. Most people don't even know about it."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the financial burden on the church will come not only
from any settlements and judgments, but from attorney fees incurred
handling the expected avalanche of cases. He said bishops worry they
won't have the money to continue key educational and social services.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare parishioners, clerics around California will read from
a letter written by the Catholic bishops who head the state's 12
dioceses. The statement highlights the risks of removing the statute
of limitations on molestation cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the lawsuits may involve the revival of already settled
cases and some may involve alleged perpetrators and witnesses long
since dead," the bishops wrote. "Under those circumstances, it will
be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The letter also contends that the Catholic Church has been falsely
portrayed as a large corporation with deep pockets and goes on to
list church reforms made over the last year to protect children from
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But victims rights advocates and plaintiff attorneys call the
warning to parishioners a calculated move to gain public support for
the church at the expense of those abused by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond P. Boucher, a Los Angeles attorney who said he has 100
clients in Los Angeles and Orange counties who plan to sue under the
new law, contends the bishops' letter "ultimately is going to
backfire."</TE>
<TE>   "What [the church] is trying to do is a shameless public-relations
spin designed to bring sympathy to the church," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans
Monday to fight the new law in court. The move -- which officials
said is supported by other California dioceses -- is a change for the
church, which took a neutral stance as legislators approved the law
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've evaluated this legislation ... and we intend to challenge
it" on constitutional grounds, said archdiocese spokesman Tod
Tamberg. "We believe that the legislation is massively unfair, and
it's targeted specifically at the Catholic Church."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said that though the church remains committed to helping
victims of sexual abuse, the law improperly forces the church to
defend itself against allegations that go back decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the best situations, these are activities that are
difficult to evaluate," he said. "It's difficult if not impossible to
find the truth [in many old cases].... It's not good legislation."</TE>
<TE>   If upheld in the courts, the law will have major effects not only
on the church, but on victims of decades-old sexual abuse. Victims
rights advocates say the new law will help -- among others -- victims
who went to the church for help and were strung along in counseling
paid for by the church until the statute of limitations ran out.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been part of their strategy," said John Manly, a Costa
Mesa attorney who said he has 15 cases ready to file in January.
"They use the people's faith and get them on the counseling track."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Drivon, a Stockton plaintiff's attorney who helped craft the
legislation, said a consortium of attorneys across California already
has 175 to 200 lawsuits it intends to file early next year, including
Boucher's. Katherine K. Freeberg, an attorney in Irvine specializing
in sexual-abuse cases who does not belong to the consortium, said she
has 76 cases she plans to pursue under the new law.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Hoard, a Petaluma resident whose son was one of eight
victims awarded $830,000 by the church in 1995 for sexual abuse by a
priest, said the new law is important, even if it causes a financial
crisis within the church, because it will force reform on the
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "They do nothing until they were faced with civil lawsuits," Hoard
said. "This will force them to do what they should have been doing."</TE>

<HD>Lengthy Talks to Preserve Hearst Ranch Collapse</HD>
<DH>The landowner says it has entered negotiations with a
different environmental partner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a year's worth of talks aimed at preserving the vast Hearst
Ranch along California's scenic Central Coast have broken down, even
as negotiators were finalizing the details of what would have been a
landmark settlement.</LD>
<LD>   But Hearst Corp. officials said Monday that they have entered
talks with another environmental partner and fully expect the new
negotiations to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   "I remain confident that we will be able to preserve the beauty of
the ranch forever," said Stephen T. Hearst, vice president and
general manager of the firm's land and livestock division. "This is
not a failure from where I sit. I think this is going to come
together rather quickly."</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, Hearst revealed details of a proposed final
settlement. If completed, the deal would ban golf course and resort
construction at famed San Simeon Point, restrict new development in
Old San Simeon Village, and create 18 miles of trails running the
length of the 82,000-acre ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the breakdown in negotiations with the Nature Conservancy
and the Conservation Fund, some officials in nearby San Luis Obispo
said they remain hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited" about the chances for success, said San Luis
Obispo County Supervisor Shirley Bianchi.</TE>
<TE>   The group that the corporation has brought in is the American Land
Conservancy, which has worked on a number of properties in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The public commitment by Hearst not to proceed with plans to
develop San Simeon Point, directly on the coast, was greeted
enthusiastically by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, "the devil is in the details," said Susan Jordan
of the California Coastal Protection Network.</TE>
<TE>   At stake is one of the largest remaining undeveloped swaths of
California coastal property. For decades, Hearst officials planned to
build resorts and homes on the property, which is still a working
cattle ranch. For almost as long, those plans were stalled by
environmental concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, Hearst officials announced that they had entered
into negotiations with the two conservation groups to find a way to
preserve the land in exchange for either money or the rights to
develop a portion of it.</TE>
<TE>   It was estimated that a deal to preserve the entire ranch could
involve one of the largest financial settlements of its kind in
history, possibly more than $300 million. It was expected that the
conservation groups would raise the money from public and private
sources.</TE>
<TE>   However, no one suggested Monday that money had been the stumbling
block.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations were at times difficult. Several times deadlines
were missed and negotiations had to be restarted, according to
insiders. What caused the final breach is uncertain. All the parties
involved had previously agreed that the negotiations were
confidential, but a spokeswoman for the Nature Conservancy said it
was Hearst that called off the talks. The group issued a short
statement late Monday that said the breakdown had occurred "despite
good-faith efforts among all parties."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst officials refused to discuss the failure, but some local
officials familiar with the talks said that most of the major issues
had been settled. Two sources, noting that the Nature Conservancy had
gone through a period of staff turnover, speculated that that could
have made the organization hesitate to sign such a huge deal.</TE>
<TE>   Several environmentalists said that the American Land Conservancy,
the new negotiating group, is not a pushover and that the selection
did not seem to indicate that Hearst was shopping for an easier
partner.</TE>
<TE>   But one environmentalist said the Hearst Ranch deal would be such
a feather in the cap of whichever group seals it that there could be
a temptation to rush to completion simply to get it done.</TE>
<TE>   Kat McConnell, an environmentalist who has watched the talks, said
her understanding is that Hearst is still demanding the right to
develop 27 lots. Key to a final deal is where those lots will be and
what will be done with them.</TE>
<TE>   But she was delighted at the commitment to put San Simeon Point
off limits. "If they are saying they are willing to abandon all those
resort sites, that is definitely good news," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst said it is also forgoing an equestrian center hotel at Pico
Creek, permanently ending planning on new visitor facilities in Old
San Simeon Village and preserving the working nature of the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hearst Ranch is one of this country's rare jewels," said
Harriett Burgess, president of the American Land Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to protect the beauty of the ranch for all
generations to enjoy," she said.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Face Budget Crisis as Session Begins</HD>
<DH>Wesson, reelected Assembly leader, warns of tough decisions
ahead with projected deficit of up to $30 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram and Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The pomp of swearing-in ceremonies fizzled fast Monday as a new
Legislature peered into a budget hole deep enough to consume all of
their spending plans and pet projects.</LD>
<LD>   "If we fired every state employee -- I mean every Highway Patrol
officer, every UC professor, every parks patrol officer -- we would
still be more than $6 billion short," Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City) said of a budget deficit that is estimated at $21
billion to $30 billion over the next year and a half. "Yet somehow,
we must find a way to get this job done."</LD>
<LD>   The 80 members of the Assembly and 40 members of the Senate,
including 39 rookies elected last month, arrived in Sacramento on
Monday for the opening of the 2003-04 session.</LD>
<TE>   The weight of the enormous projected budget shortfall occasionally
stifled celebrations, which drew hundreds of family members, friends,
fund-raisers and campaign workers to the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill has estimated the gap at $21
billion, but Gov. Gray Davis has warned that it could reach or exceed
$30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "They walk in here and the first thing we tell them is, remember
to turn on your [voting] key and the second thing is to balance a
$21-billion deficit," said Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).
With four years in the Assembly, in an era of six-year term limits,
she has become a senior member.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a daunting task," Jackson said, "even for people who are
seasoned, who have been through a number of budgets, good and bad."</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, even the honorary chaplain, Simone Campbell of the
Sisters of Social Services, recognized the difficult fiscal task
ahead. In a prayer, Campbell advised senators to "take a deep breath"
and commit themselves to finding a bipartisan solution that was free
of the usual "stifling and predictable rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly unanimously reelected Wesson speaker, and he was
sworn in by former Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., now mayor of San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson warned that even eliminating the budgets for state colleges
and universities, state prisons, the Department of Mental Health and
the California Youth Authority wouldn't be enough to eliminate the
budget shortage.</TE>
<TE>   But he promised that the budget would not be balanced at the
expense of needy Californians, and he urged the public to defend
their favorite programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no time for silence, for apathy," Wesson said. "We need
to hear from you, because everything that you care about is on the
line.... You've got to strategize, you've got to organize, you've got
to mobilize, or you risk being marginalized."</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) welcomed
seven new members to the Senate, but warned of a bumpy road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say we are going to have fun in the next two years,"
he said. "As much as I try, I don't know how we are going to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   He got a round of applause from Senate members, particularly
Democrats who sported John Burton bobblehead lapel pins, complete
with his trademark pink shirt and white collar. A staff member said
the pins, paid for in part by retired prison guard lobbyist Don
Novey, were intended to celebrate Burton's reelection as the Senate
leader.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 20 senators were elected or reelected to the Senate,
including freshman Republican Jeff Denham, who narrowly defeated
Democrat Rusty Areias, a former assemblyman, for a San Joaquin Valley
seat.</TE>
<TE>   Denham's election increased the GOP roster in the upper house from
14 to 15, and reduced the Democratic majority from 26 to 25. The
Republican gain means it will be even tougher for Democrats to pass
the state budget or enact new taxes, which require a two-thirds
majority vote, without help from at least two Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 80 members of the Assembly are 32 first-timers. Some
were old hands at politics, including former Berkeley Mayor Loni
Hancock and Democrat Mervyn Dymally, the former lieutenant governor
and congressman from Compton who was first elected to the Assembly in
1962.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson has said repeatedly that solving the projected budget gap
will require a mix of cuts and tax hikes. Republicans said they will
vote against higher taxes. To pass the budget with the necessary
two-thirds vote, Wesson must win the support of at least six of the
32 Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Assemblyman Greg Aghazarian, a Stockton Republican, said
he won't be one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do is cut excess spending," Aghazarian said
before being sworn in. "Raising taxes in an environment like this,
with a bad economy, would make matters worse.... I have a short-term,
medium-term and long-term solution: Create jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Garcia, a new Republican assemblywoman from Cathedral City,
saw in the budget crisis an opportunity to "return to common-sense
decision-making" about government spending.</TE>
<TE>   "No more bells and whistles," she said. Asked if she would support
tax increases, Garcia said she would wait and take a hard look at the
budget the governor proposes next month.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the two houses would remain in session
until the start of the special session next Monday or even if there
would be daily floor meetings then.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003-04 regular session will start Jan. 6. The two sessions
will run concurrently.</TE>

<HD>Newhall Says It Has Enough Water</HD>
<DH>The developer is criticized for relying on a private
company for some of the supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi and Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The developer of the massive Newhall Ranch project released the
findings of a new environmental report Monday that declares it has
access to enough water to supply the 22,000-home suburb planned near
the Ventura County line.</LD>
<LD>   Newhall Land and Farming maintains in the report that 17,000
acre-feet of water would come from the State Water Project, ground
water supplies, reclaimed water from the development site and
purchases from a private water company in Kern County. Additional
water would be stored in an underground aquifer for dry years.</LD>
<LD>   "We have more than enough water to serve Newhall Ranch," said
Newhall spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer.</LD>
<TE>   But Lynne Plambeck, president of the Santa Clarita Organization
for the Preservation of the Environment, criticized Newhall for
relying on a private company -- the Nickel Family LLC -- for 1,600
acre-feet of its water supplies. An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons,
enough water to supply two average families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Plambeck said she fears the deal could usher in an era of water
privatization in which the richest developers would reap the
benefits. "The highest bidder can destroy whatever watershed to
create urban sprawl," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The supplemental environmental impact report will be presented to
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Jan. 28. If the board
approves the report, a Kern County judge will then decide whether the
project can move forward.</TE>
<TE>   The new report was ordered by Kern County Superior Court Judge
Roger D. Randall in 2000 following a legal battle between Los Angeles
and Ventura counties. The case was moved to Kern County to avoid
potential legal conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sued to block the project, arguing that the initial
environmental study was flawed because the developer had failed to
prove it could acquire enough water from the State Water Project and
an underground storage aquifer during multiple drought years.</TE>
<TE>   The development site is just across the line from eastern Ventura
County, near Six Flags Magic Mountain. Its 12,000 acres straddle the
Santa Clara River, the region's last free-flowing river.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County officials worried that the project, which would be
built out over the next 25 years and ultimately serve nearly 70,000
people, posed a significant threat to ground water supplies and
sensitive wildlife habitat. They urged Randall to overturn approval
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County officials said Monday that they had yet to read
Newhall's new environmental study and therefore declined to comment
on its findings.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the new environmental report states that 7,000
acre-feet of drinking water for the housing development would come
from the State Water Project; 9,000 acre-feet of nonpotable water
would come from reclaimed water on the Newhall Ranch property and
from a local water district and the remainder from the Kern County
purveyor. The developer also plans to store about 5,000 acre-feet of
water in an underground storage bank for drought years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Newhall Ranch developer acknowledges in its new
report that tens of thousands of endangered San Fernando Valley
spineflowers were found on its property slated for development.</TE>
<TE>   The developer had earlier reported finding a single stand of the
flowers on a 50- to 75-acre stretch of dirt road.</TE>
<TE>   Those flowers were eventually plowed over during the course of
Newhall's agricultural operations, which legally allows for such
actions.</TE>
<TE>   In the new environmental report, Newhall said that it had
previously found several other locations of possible spineflowers,
but did not submit those specimens to labs for confirmation and
eventually stopped looking for the plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating
Newhall's handling of the spineflowers and has filed a single
misdemeanor charge of unlawfully altering a streambed against the
developer.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall argues that the law allows it to move ahead with
construction as long as it maintains a preserve for the spineflower.
But critics said they want to know more about the extent of
spineflower growth on the development site and what can be done to
protect the rare plant.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to do the surveys and mitigation now, before the whole
project is approved," said John Buse, an attorney with the
Environmental Defense Center.</TE>
<TE>   Lauffer argued that Newhall has provided enough detail about its
plans to protect the spineflowers and will continue to work with the
state Department of Fish and Game on the issue. She said the
developer will lay out the precise boundaries for its spineflower
preserves when it applies for building rights.</TE>

<CX>   Newhall Ranch--A story in Tuesday's California section inaccurately
stated that the developer of the Newhall Ranch project would purchase
1,600 acre-feet of nonpotable water from the Nickel Family LLC, a
private purveyor in Kern County, for residents of the proposed
development. In fact, the water would be potable, supplementing the
7,000 acre-feet of drinking water the developer now draws from its
own ground-water wells.</CX>

<HD>Smallpox Readiness Plan Detailed</HD>
<DH>L.A. County initially will request 20,000 doses of vaccine,
mostly for emergency health-care workers. Critics say far more is
needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Richardson and Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County is requesting up to 20,000 doses of smallpox
vaccine to inoculate emergency health-care workers, as well as some
police officers and firefighters, in the first phase of a national
effort against possible bioterrorism, health officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The county is finalizing a plan that must be submitted to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by Monday. Every state
must prepare a similar proposal, along with Los Angeles County, New
York City and Chicago (because of their size).</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Health Services is requesting 40,000
to 50,000 doses for areas outside of Los Angeles County, spokesman
Ken August said.</LD>
<TE>   While the county did not give a firm timetable for vaccinations to
begin, the speed with which the CDC has demanded a plan indicates
impending action, said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of public
health for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. The
idea is to make sure that the disease does not infect health-care
providers or emergency response teams who may aid a smallpox victim.</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate goal is to have a significant number of people
available in the hospital to treat somebody if they had the problem,"
Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox virus, which is highly contagious, was eradicated
worldwide in the 1970s, but officials are worried that vials of the
virus kept in storage in the former Soviet Union may have fallen into
the hands of Iraq or North Korea. The concern took on new urgency
after the terrorist attacks and anthrax scares last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding said he had no information about any new threat or risk
of a smallpox attack.</TE>
<TE>   Before vaccinations can begin, President Bush must sign off on a
nationwide immunization plan. The president is expected to give the
go-ahead as soon as this week to vaccinate military forces and
front-line health workers, administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   National health officials have estimated that about 500,000 health
workers would be vaccinated in the first round of inoculations. The
Pentagon has requested another 500,000 doses for its troops.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20,000 smallpox doses requested by Los Angeles County,
15,000 would be used to inoculate emergency room personnel in
hospitals and public health workers.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder would go to those who respond to 911 calls and a
small number of police officers and firefighters who are part of
early warning terrorism teams.</TE>
<TE>   The county's request to immunize these so-called first responders
differs from national recommendations that would delay immunizing
this group until a second round.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of people transported to hospitals in L.A. County
through the 911 system -- about 300,000 a year -- make police and
firefighters a logical addition, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   Widespread inoculation of police and fire officials would follow
in a second phase as would the immunization of the remaining hospital
personnel, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the vaccine should be offered to all of the nation's 7
million health care workers and 3 million police, fire and other
emergency workers, national health officials have recommended.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round, the 80 public and private hospitals in the
county with emergency rooms would be allocated the vaccine -- stored
in 100-dose vials -- based on their size, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccinations would be voluntary, and county officials estimate
that about 30% of those eligible would be unable to take it because
of pregnancy and medical conditions such as HIV and eczema that would
make them more susceptible to complications.</TE>
<TE>   Death as a reaction to the vaccine occurs in one to three people
per million.</TE>
<TE>   The county's plan was criticized by the Hospital Assn. of Southern
California because officials worry that hospitals could be held
liable for not offering the vaccination to all personnel or for side
effects after the vaccine is administered.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are asking employees to work where we know now that there
is a hazard, and we're only inoculating certain employees and not
others," said Jim Lott, the group's executive vice president. "Who is
going to play God here?"</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William Bicknell, former director of the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, said all hospital personnel should be
offered the vaccine, along with other workers who keep society
running. These could include employees of the telephone company,
power grid and water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' proposal is "not making it worse, but it's a day late
and a dollar short," said Bicknell, a Boston University professor.</TE>
<TE>   Bicknell estimated that Los Angeles County would need 80,000 to
200,000 doses to adequately inoculate all those people whose services
would be needed in the event of an outbreak of smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding called the plan to vaccinate some hospital workers but
not others a good first step but emphasized that the county has
little choice in how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand their concerns, but this is not our choice," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC and Bush administration officials say there is an
important distinction between plans needed to vaccinate a population
after a smallpox outbreak has been detected and planning efforts
aimed at preparing for a possible outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   After confirming a case of smallpox, the government will implement
an emergency response plan to vaccinate as many people as possible as
quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush
administration began building a stockpile of vaccine and developing
plans to get it anywhere in the country within 12 hours.</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Is Seeking Words to Slow Down By</HD>
<DH>Officials may launch a campaign to fight speeding. But the
record on slogans is mixed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles County, drunk drivers are responsible for about 200
deaths each year.</LD>
<LD>   An additional 230 pedestrians are killed annually in the county,
just crossing the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Speeding is rampant on residential roads and road rage is out of
control.</LD>
<TE>   What to do?</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles transportation officials are considering a countywide
advertising campaign, following in the path of other campaigns with
catchy phrases such as "Friends don't let friends drive drunk" and
"Buckle up."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign, targeting speeding and other reckless driving
habits, is tentatively scheduled to start in the spring. It will
likely be patterned after a traffic safety campaign launched last
month in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic safety is a favorite subject of public safety campaigns,
and every campaign, it seems, must adopt a catch phrase.</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma, the motto for the state's seat-belt campaign is,
"What's holding you back, Oklahoma?"</TE>
<TE>   "Take it easy" is the slogan for a campaign aimed at putting the
brakes on aggressive driving in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, state officials, worried about the low rate of
seat-belt use among African American males, recently launched a
campaign with the slogan, "Brother, keep it together: Don't risk it."</TE>
<TE>   Snappy phrases. But do such campaigns work?</TE>
<TE>   The record has been mixed. Studies show that advertising campaigns
alone can increase public awareness about a problem, such as
seat-belt use or drunk driving. But studies also show that such
campaigns work better when paired with a tough law enforcement
crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this: Eight southeastern states (Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and South
Carolina) launched the "Click it or ticket" campaign last year to
increase seat-belt use. A study by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration found that, after an advertising campaign
kicked off, seat-belt use among motorists increased only slightly
above the starting level of 65%. But seat-belt use shot up to 74% a
couple of weeks later, when police launched a crackdown, according to
the study.</TE>
<TE>   Another study by the same agency found that those theoretically
catchy phrases are not always memorable.</TE>
<TE>   The agency hired a firm in 1997 to survey 6,000 adult drivers.
Although 35% of the drivers said they had seen or heard a public
service announcement about speeding, nearly 70% could not recall the
slogan or anything else about the announcement, according to the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Given such drawbacks, why do we still see so many public safety
campaigns urging us to drive safely?</TE>
<TE>   One reason could be that a lot of people, including advertising
companies and public relations firms, have a vested interest in the
launching of big-budget advertising campaigns, said Sandra J.
Ball-Rokeach, a USC professor at the Annenberg School for
Communication. Another reason, she said, is that few public safety
campaigns are evaluated to see how effective they have been.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Gardner, president of Liquid Agency, the brand marketing
agency that helped develop San Jose's "Street Smarts" campaign,
stands by such campaigns, saying they are effective in building
public awareness over time -- usually several years -- and can lead
to changes in behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, the alternative -- posting a police officer on
every street -- is too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't speed-bump the entire city, so you have to increase
education," Gardner said.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's "Street Smarts" relies on signs, newspaper ads, radio
spots and television ads to spread such messages as "Red-light
running has to stop" and "Want to meet cops? Drive fast."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the idea for the new public safety campaign has
been promoted by Wayne Tanda, the newly appointed general manager for
the city's Department of Transportation. (He formerly worked in San
Jose.)</TE>
<TE>   Tanda said he would like to team up with county officials to
launch the campaign throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested the campaign could reduce traffic congestion. He said
nearly half of all traffic delays are the result of automobile
accidents. If a public safety campaign can improve drivers' behavior,
Tanda said, auto accidents will drop and traffic flow will improve.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like adding many lanes to our streets or like adding
another freeway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he could be so sure a campaign can change driver
behavior, Tanda pointed to the "Got milk" campaign. For years, milk
sales in the U.S. declined by about 2% or 3% per year. Since the
campaign was launched in 1994, milk sales have remained steady.</TE>
<TE>   Tanda's campaign has yet to adopt a catch phrase but perhaps he
can borrow from San Jose's slogan: "Got smarts?"</TE>

<TE>   Traffic Safety Catch Phrases</TE>
<TE>   Traffic safety campaigns rely heavily on catch phrases -- mottos
designed to educate drivers about certain bad driving behaviors. The
following are examples of catch phrases used in safety campaigns the
United States in recent years.</TE>
<TE>*--*
* Arizona: "Operation Chill" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Colorado: "Chill" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Colorado: "Brother, keep it together. Don't risk it" (low seat-belt
use among black males)</TE>
<TE>* Delaware: "Take it easy" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Illinois: "Operation Cool" (high accident rates among teen drivers)</TE>
<TE>* Hawaii: "Drive Akamai [smart]" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Kansas: "Share the road" (high accident rates involving motorcycles)</TE>
<TE>* Maryland: "Smooth operator" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Michigan: "Click it. Don't risk it" (low seat-belt use)</TE>
<TE>* New Jersey: "Drive friendly" (aggressive driving)</TE>
<TE>* Oklahoma: "What's holding you back, Oklahoma?" (low seat-belt use)</TE>

threatened by oil from a tanker that sank last month off the nation's
northwest coast.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving by helicopter, the king met with residents and the local
fishermen's association. He cast an occasional glance at the soles of
his shoes as he walked in the muck of an oil-stained beach.</LD>
<LD>   "We know that the king can only bring us his solidarity, not a

<HD>Views Differ on Strike Turnout in a Split Venezuela</HD>
<DH>Both supporters and foes of president wage public relations
war to prove the majority on their side in protest against his
leadership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A strike closed businesses, health clinics and schools throughout
Venezuela on Monday, but participation was not as widespread as in
previous such protests.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition figures claimed they had shut down 80% of the country,
from banks to bus lines to bakeries. They said they would continue
the strike today in order to force President Hugo Chavez to hold a
vote on his rule.</LD>
<LD>   The promise immediately raised fears that the protest would turn
violent. The last prolonged strike, in April, resulted in a coup
against Chavez, who was restored to power two days later.</LD>
<TE>   "The strike has been a total success," said Manuel Cova,
secretary-general of the country's largest union, the Confederation
of Venezuelan Workers. "The people have roundly rejected the
government of Hugo Chavez and have asked for an electoral solution to
this crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Officials loyal to Chavez claimed just the opposite, saying that
80% of the nation continued to function. They condemned the protest
as a thinly veiled attempt to spark a second coup against Chavez. The
government said the petroleum sector -- which accounts for half the
nation's revenue and is the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.
-- was functioning "basically normally."</TE>
<TE>   "The strike has been a complete failure," said Luis Alfonso
Davila, a director in Chavez's political party, the Fifth Republic
Movement.</TE>
<TE>   The truth seemed to lie somewhere in between. A tour of Caracas,
the capital, clearly showed that many stores were closed and that the
streets had far less traffic than normal. But just as clear was the
difference from a one-day stoppage in October, during which the
opposition claimed 90% participation. On Monday, more businesses
opened, more shoppers hit the streets, and more cars cruised the
highways.</TE>
<TE>   At least part of the reason was timing. These protests come in
December, when workers with Christmas bonuses do their holiday
shopping and merchants enjoy their strongest sales.</TE>
<TE>   During the last strike, Jose Birouti shut down his tiny hardware
store on one of Caracas' main boulevards. But he was open Monday,
although he said he opposes Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to pay the rent," Birouti said as trucks roared past.
"I'd be closed, if not for the expenses that I have to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Another reason was the nature of the strike. Opposition figures
have refused to say how long it would last, leading some people to do
emergency shopping in case the closures are prolonged.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the biggest reason for the lower participation was
fatigue. After more than a year of nearly continuous conflict between
Chavez and a scattered opposition that includes businesses, unions,
the Roman Catholic church and the media, Venezuelans have little to
show but a deeply riven nation.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have pledged to continue negotiations mediated by Cesar
Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organization of American States.
The talks, which have produced few concrete results so far, remained
suspended Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The government has said it will not negotiate during the strike.
Opponents say the goal of the work stoppage is to persuade the
government to return to the table to discuss a proposed referendum on
Chavez's rule to be held in February. Chavez has said a referendum is
prohibited until August.</TE>
<TE>   The government and opposition figures spent the entire day in a
surreal battle on the nation's airwaves. Private media outlets showed
images of abandoned streets and closed shops. The state-run
television ran a continuous tape of a street in downtown Caracas
packed with thousands of shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   The army and Chavez allies in local government sponsored a daylong
street market on one of the city's major thoroughfares, which filled
with tens of thousands of shoppers who ignored the call to strike.
Doctors and dentists attended lines of patients that snaked for
blocks. Government-backed banks in street tents handed out
micro-credit loans. Veterinarians provided free rabies shots.
Commercial vendors sold food subsidized by the government at prices
up to 60% below normal: Four pounds of melon for 75 cents. Two pounds
of tomatoes for 70 cents. Soldiers even distributed free ingredients
for hayaca, a tamale-like Christmas treat.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials insisted that it was simply coincidence that the
public relations bonanza occurred the same day as the anti-government
strike, saying the market was a previously planned part of Chavez's
commitment to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here because we got orders to be here. It has nothing to do
with politics," said Sgt. Javier Guevara, who was overseeing a
battalion providing free haircuts to passersby.</TE>
<TE>   A few hundred yards away, Hiliberto Rodriguez was selling posters
of Chavez and Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary. Chavez, he said,
was outselling Che.</TE>

<HD>Bush Names Envoy for 'Free Iraqis'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling President Bush's goal of replacing Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein, the White House on Monday announced the appointment of a
special envoy and ambassador at large for "free Iraqis."</LD>
<LD>   Named to the post was Zalmay Khalilzad, who already serves as the
president's special envoy to Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   A White House statement said Khalilzad will be the
administration's liaison to the Iraqi opposition and "preparations
for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   Creation of the post reflects the administration's attempt to
mobilize the Iraqi opposition, which consists of widely disparate
groups with different religious and ethnic backgrounds. Most of the
groups are based outside Iraq and have had trouble working together.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's focus recently, as he stressed Monday, has been on
enforcement of a new U.N. resolution requiring Iraq to disarm itself
of suspected weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But Khalilzad's appointment, according to a White House spokesman,
"demonstrates the president's determination not only to see Saddam's
regime disarmed, but to stand with the Iraqi people as they chart a
peaceful, democratic course for the future."</TE>

<HD>Kenya Bombing Probe Is Stalling</HD>
<DH>Critics decry lack of action by local police. U.S. says
evidence of Al Qaeda link is growing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOMBASA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Six Pakistani seamen have yet to be interrogated nearly a week after
police detained them following a suicide bombing attack on an
Israeli-owned resort north of here. The main reason for the delay?
Investigators say they have been unable to find a translator, despite
a significant number of Pakistanis here.</LD>
<LD>   Four Somalis, who were seized with the Pakistanis from a wooden
boat named the Mogadishu, also have yet to be questioned even though
police have Somali-speaking officers in their ranks. A senior police
official assured reporters Monday that investigators would
interrogate the Somali men soon.</LD>
<LD>   But critics say the probe into Thursday's bombing of the Paradise
hotel -- which killed at least three Israelis, 10 Kenyans and three
suicide bombers -- and a near-simultaneous missile attack on an
Israeli airliner over Mombasa represents a classic case of how not to
conduct an investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes remain high, investigators say, because the probe could
determine whether militant Palestinians and Al Qaeda are working
together against Israeli targets. Terrorism experts and the Israeli
government, which has sent its Mossad spy agency to try to track down
the perpetrators and retaliate, say the attacks bore the trademarks
of the Al Qaeda terror network.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances from Kenyan Internal Security Minister Julius
Sunkuli, many people have questioned whether local police are able to
lead the probe. Israeli investigators have ridiculed their Kenyan
counterparts, saying that "they're no use except to smile at you."</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan Deputy Police Commissioner William Langat, one of the lead
investigators, surprised foreign reporters Monday when he disclosed
that the 10 seamen from the Mogadishu fishing vessel had not been
interrogated. Police say the men, who have not been charged, did not
have appropriate travel documents when their craft docked here for
repairs. Langat said investigators have found no link between the men
and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether evidence found at the scene of the hotel
bombing was consistent with that found during previous attacks by Al
Qaeda, including the deadly 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Langat replied: "Your
guess is as good as mine."</TE>
<TE>   Langat said language differences were among the main reasons the
10 men have not yet been interrogated.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence officials said Monday that evidence
was mounting that the attacks on the hotel and the Israeli airliner
were carried out by Al Qaeda. A U.S. official said that an Al Qaeda
claim of responsibility on the Internet was "being viewed as
credible," but that American intelligence could not vouch for its
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   The official also said serial numbers on missile launchers
recovered at the site near Mombasa are close to the number found on a
launcher that is believed to have been smuggled by Al Qaeda
operatives in May into a Saudi military base used by U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   "The serial numbers are fairly close sequentially," the official
said, citing the similarity as one of the "growing indications of an
Al Qaeda role" in the Kenya attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya does not have an exceptional record on tracking down
terrorists. The country allowed the FBI and CIA to do the bulk of the
investigation into the embassy bombing in Nairobi. Several people,
some with links in Mombasa, have been convicted in the U.S. for the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, Kenyan police announced that they had arrested
Sheik Ahmed Salim Swedan, who was on the FBI's most-wanted terrorist
list because of his alleged involvement in the Nairobi bombing.
Police later acknowledged they had arrested the wrong man.</TE>

<HD>4 Palestinians Killed in Clashes</HD>
<DH>As shoppers prepare for festivities that follow Ramadan, a
youth is slain in West Bank. Three other people die in separate
incidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>On this much the two sides agree: The downtown market in the West
Bank town of Jenin was crowded Monday morning with Palestinians
shopping for one of the Muslim year's most festive holidays.
Merchants had lain their wares on the cracked sidewalks. Veiled women
and children running errands for their mothers were opening their
coin purses for the ingredients of a holiday meal.</LD>
<LD>   By midday, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy lay dead and more than a
dozen other people, all but one Palestinian, had been injured in a
wild, running battle. The Israelis said the incident was sparked by
curfew-breakers hurling stones and gunmen firing on army troops, but
Palestinians said it was an unprovoked outburst of Israeli firepower
in a crowded urban setting.</LD>
<LD>   It was a day of violence that also saw three other Palestinian
deaths. One of those who died was a heavily armed man who tried to
slip into a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip before dawn; another
was an apparent bystander caught in cross-fire as Israeli troops
hunted wanted militants in the northern West Bank town of Tulkarm;
and the third was a worker killed in a border industrial zone when
Palestinian militants fired a mortar toward an Israeli military
checkpoint in Gaza and missed.</LD>
<TE>   Events in Jenin, a Palestinian town of about 50,000 people in the
northern West Bank that Israeli authorities say has been the source
of dozens of suicide attacks against Israelis, were a fresh reminder
of how volatile a mix is created when ordinary Palestinians, weary of
military curfews that keep them pinned inside their homes for days or
weeks at a time, come into close contact with wary Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   The army says troops near Jenin's old city, attempting to enforce
a widely violated military curfew, came under fire at mid-morning and
that one Israeli soldier was slightly wounded.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the military spokesman's office said, a Palestinian
teenager tried to clamber atop an Israeli armored vehicle. In such a
scenario, Israeli soldiers are instructed to respond with whatever
force is necessary because troops can be trapped and incinerated if
someone manages to hurl a firebomb into the vehicle's tight confines.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian witnesses, however, said the boy, identified by
hospital officials as Motez Odeh, was either trying to escape the
oncoming Israeli armor, or was trying to keep an eye on his family's
sidewalk cigarette stand.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not climb on top of anything!" said Ghareid Raja, 54, a
witness. "He was trying to run away."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's death provoked an outpouring of fury among the many
Palestinians still out on the town's streets, witnesses said. People
hurled whatever was at hand -- stones, cans of paint, metal railings,
garbage and garbage cans -- at patrolling Israeli vehicles, which
continued on their way, festooned with debris.</TE>
<TE>   Islam's holy month of Ramadan, a time of prayer and daytime
fasting, is to end Thursday night, ushering in the Eid al-Fitr, one
of the most festive holidays of the Muslim year.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin has been under intermittent curfew for months. The town and
its refugee camp, scene of one of the fiercest battles during
Israel's wide-ranging April offensive throughout the West Bank, have
been the focus of an intense Israeli manhunt for militants who have
planned and carried out suicide attacks against Israeli cities and
towns.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, in Tulkarm, witnesses described another gun battle
that left a Palestinian bystander dead as Israeli troops were
conducting a sweep for wanted militants. One of the 14 Palestinians
that witnesses said were wounded was believed to be a man being
pursued by the troops.</TE>
<TE>   Another Palestinian, a worker in the Erez industrial zone
sandwiched between the Gaza Strip and Israel proper, was killed when
Palestinians fired a mortar, apparently aimed at an Israeli military
checkpoint. It hit a crowd of workers instead.</TE>
<TE>   At least nine Palestinians were reported hurt in the explosion.
The militant group Islamic Jihad, for which Gaza is a stronghold,
claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the Palestinian man shot dead as he tried to
infiltrate the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, in the Gaza Strip, was
armed with an assault rifle and several ammunition clips, and was
wearing a bulletproof vest. They said the gunman was dressed in an
Israeli army uniform when he stumbled onto an Israeli patrol. An
Israeli soldier was wounded in the clash, the army said.</TE>

<HD>Report on Iraqi Abuses Is Met With Skepticism</HD>
<DH>Human rights advocates question the timing of its release
by Britain, just days before the deadline for Hussein to detail any
weapons programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella and Janet Stobart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In a report whose timing was questioned by human rights advocates,
the British government on Monday accused Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's regime of systematic executions, torture, rape and other
abuses of its own people.</LD>
<LD>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the dossier was intended
"to remind the world that the abuses of the Iraqi regime extend far
beyond its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction."</LD>
<LD>   Although nongovernmental watchdog groups had no quarrel with the
content of the 23-page report, they were skeptical about the motives
behind its release. The report, essentially a review of
well-documented human rights horrors in Iraq, was based on research
by human rights advocates and information gathered by intelligence
agencies.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to be used as an excuse to go to war," said Kamal
Samari of Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   With Hussein facing a Sunday deadline to detail any weapons
programs or risk a U.S.-led attack, the Foreign Office appeared
intent on making the case for military intervention, said Hania
Mufti, London director of the Middle East division of Human Rights
Watch.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks strategic, coming a few days before Iraq's deadline,"
Mufti said. "Plus the fact that the dossier doesn't contain any new
information."</TE>
<TE>   British diplomats argued that there is a direct link between the
campaign to disarm Iraq and the regime's bloody history. They pointed
out that Hussein has the ignoble distinction of having used poison
gas to kill 5,000 of his people during the Halabja massacre in
Kurdistan in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The dimensions of the brutality reinforce the need to rid Iraq of
any weapons of mass destruction, a British official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The historical record showed the regime had used such weapons
against its own people," said one official. "If they were still in
existence, Saddam Hussein would likely use them again."</TE>
<TE>   At a Foreign Office briefing, Hussein Shahristani, former chief
scientist of the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization, detailed his
torments during more than a decade in solitary confinement. The
Foreign Office said Shahristani was arrested in 1979 for refusing to
put chemical and biological laboratories to military use and was held
until he escaped Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate," Shahristani said. "They only tortured me for 23
days and nights, continuously, by hanging me from my hands tied at
the back and using high voltage on sensitive parts of my body."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his denunciation of the Iraqi regime, the scientist said
he had misgivings about the British policy toward Iraq, especially
the prospect of an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly, I'm concerned that weapons of mass destruction, the
chemical weapons in particular, could be used again by the regime
against the people if they show any opposition or uprising," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be hard to dismantle Hussein's chemical and biological
weapons programs because they have been deployed in small mobile
units and are continuously on the move, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Office's report, which Shahristani called "better late
than never," is a catalog of suffering. It describes a relatively
recent addition to the arsenal of repression: Starting in 2000, the
Hussein regime has cut off tongues of some Iraqis suspected of making
insulting remarks about the president and his family, according to
the dossier.</TE>
<TE>   Other flagrant cases described in the document: the arbitrary
executions of about 2,500 prisoners in a "prison cleansing campaign";
public beheadings of women suspected of prostitution or
anti-government activity; and the torture of a husband and wife
suspected of contacting opposition groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi TV has broadcast pictures of these punishments as a warning
to others," the dossier says.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed in a British television interview about the timing of the
report's release, a senior diplomat said the Foreign Office writes
yearly reports about countries accused of human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got a particular problem in relation to Iraq because, of
course, there is a link between weapons of mass destruction and Iraq
and human rights abuses there," said Mike O'Brien, Foreign Office
minister on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the inspectors in; we've got a unanimous U.N.
resolution. It must be backed by the threat of force if Saddam
breaches international law, but our objective at the moment is to
remove the weapons of mass destruction without having to use military
force if we can do that."</TE>

<CX>   Report on Iraq -- A headline Tuesday in Section A ("Report on Iraqi
Abuses Is Met With Skepticism") implied that a British report
accusing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime of systematic
executions, torture and other abuses was called into question. As was
stated in the subhead, human rights advocates questioned the timing
of the report, not the accusations themselves.</CX>

<HD>Saudis to Monitor Islamic Charities</HD>
<DH>In response to U.S. criticism, officials plan to release a
report detailing the measures the government has taken against
terrorism.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia says it is cracking down on Islamic charitable
organizations that have been linked to terrorist groups and is
requiring Saudi charities to report all international donations and
activities to the government.</LD>
<LD>   In a public relations offensive responding to U.S. criticism of
the desert kingdom, the Saudi Embassy in Washington said it planned
to issue a report today listing dozens of actions the Saudi
government has taken against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Saudi Arabia has been wrongly accused of being uncooperative in
combating terrorism," said Adel Jubeir, foreign policy advisor to the
kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah. "These charges have
gotten out of control."</LD>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia has come under widespread criticism because Osama bin
Laden, leader of the Al Qaeda terrorist network, comes from a
prominent Saudi family; because 15 of the 19 hijackers in the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks were Saudi citizens; and because investigators
believe that millions of dollars have flowed from Saudi donors to
Islamic extremist groups around the world.</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official said Monday that the Saudi
actions were "moving in the right direction" but still fell short of
what the Bush administration hopes to see.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they doing everything we'd like? No," he said. "Are they
doing a lot? Yes.... What you've got here is Saudi Arabia playing
catch-up."</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir said the most significant new action Saudi Arabia is taking
is to tighten controls on charitable donations to Islamic
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we may have been a little bit naive.... We did not
have adequate controls in place," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have taxes in Saudi Arabia, so nobody files any returns
and nobody audits the charities," he said. "We found that even the
charities sometimes didn't really know where their money was going."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Saudi government has established the Higher Commission
for Oversight of Charities and is requiring charitable groups to
submit audits of their operations and coordinate their activities
abroad with the Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of overseas charities is particularly sensitive, because
some international Islamic groups have been accused of acting as
conduits for terrorist funding.</TE>
<TE>   Three big international charities -- Al Haramain Islamic
Foundation, the World Muslim League and the International Islamic
Relief Organization -- have come under special scrutiny, U.S. and
Saudi officials said. Last March, the U.S. and Saudi governments
blocked the bank accounts of Al Haramain branches in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia because of suspected links to Al Qaeda
and other terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir said controls on those charities are still being put in
place.</TE>
<TE>   The senior State Department official said this was one area where
the United States is still pressing Saudi Arabia for more action.
"Religious giving is a gray area," he said. "This is a start, but it
doesn't choke it off."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government has told U.S. officials that it was
considering a new law to prohibit charitable transfers outside the
kingdom unless they go through government channels</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir said the report was prepared even before Princess Haifa al
Faisal, the wife of Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington, came
under scrutiny because some of her charitable donations appeared to
have landed in the hands of two of the Sept. 11 hijackers. The
princess has said she did not intend to send funds to the hijackers
and did not know how they got them.</TE>
<TE>   The report lists many steps Saudi Arabia has already revealed
about its investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks, Jubeir said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it includes a previous estimate that Saudi Arabia has
questioned more than 2,000 people about the attacks, but it does not
include an estimate of the number who have been detained, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir said his government does not want to reveal the details of
its internal law enforcement actions. He noted that the U.S. has not
revealed the number of people it has detained in connection with the
attacks.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Courts New Turkish Leaders for Access to Bases and
Airspace</HD>
<DH>Official will offer aid and protection in exchange for
support in any Iraq attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- The Bush administration, seeking to gain support for a
potential attack on Iraq, is courting a new Turkish government with
talk of diplomatic, economic and military aid -- and the promise that
a strong military coalition is the surest means of averting war.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, in London on Monday on
the first in a series of visits to potential allies, will court
European nations as well as Turkey, whose military bases offered
enormous advantages to the U.S.-led coalition in the Persian Gulf War
of 1991.</LD>
<LD>   With Baghdad facing a Sunday deadline to declare any weapons of
mass destruction, the No. 2 Pentagon official told a British audience
that the best hope of averting war in Iraq lies in amassing a
formidable military force including Turkey that would force President
Saddam Hussein to abide by United Nations demands.</LD>
<TE>   Pentagon planners are weighing alternative invasion strategies,
with and without the use of Turkish bases and overflight rights now
used to patrol the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A war would be quicker and less painful for Turkey if U.S. and
allied forces could attack Iraq from the north as well as from
southern bases in Qatar, Kuwait and possibly Saudi Arabia, military
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a senior administration official said, Wolfowitz will begin
a conversation with Turkey's new government -- an administration with
Islamic roots that took office Thursday -- by outlining an alluring
message: The United States will oppose an independent Kurdistan in
northern Iraq; it could protect Turkey from Iraq with Patriot
antimissile batteries as it did in 1991; and it might consider making
smallpox vaccine available in the event of a biological attack.</TE>
<TE>   The administration would offer as yet unspecified economic aid to
help Turkey turn around its depressed economy through new access to
Iraq, which would probably be free of sanctions if Hussein fell.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Turkey's democratic government as a potential "model
for the Muslim world," Wolfowitz made the case for Turkey's most
cherished immediate goal by aggressively backing the nation's bid to
join the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   The United States seeks basing and overfly rights, as well as help
in transporting military materiel, another senior administration
official said, but is not seeking troops or other direct military
support from Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the Turks must choose quickly, but the first senior
administration official said Wolfowitz will not insist on immediate
support from Ankara.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be realistic," the official said. "On the other hand,
our message to them is: 'You need to be realistic about us. We're
developing military plans which have a certain momentum of their own.
It's not possible to keep all your options open down to the last
minute.' We really do need to get some decisions from Turkey --
sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   The answer is likely to be affirmative, diplomatic officials say.
The United States has been a staunch ally of Turkey's for years, and
has pleaded Ankara's case before the European Union since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   When Turkey jailed opposition leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 1999
on charges of inciting religious hatred, U.S. officials argued that
he was inappropriately imprisoned for exercising free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan is now the leader of the governing Justice and Development
Party, although the conviction has left him barred from becoming
prime minister. The United States also successfully lobbied the
International Monetary Fund to give Turkey $31.5 billion in aid.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Opponents File Suit Over Approval of Environmental
Study</HD>
<DH>Foes of the giant housing development allege Ventura County
Planning Commission violated the state's open-meeting law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the controversial Ahmanson Ranch development filed a
lawsuit Monday, seeking to overturn approval of a new environmental
study of the 3,050-home project on the Ventura County border near
Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, accuses
county planning commissioners of violating the state's open-meeting
law by visiting the site at separate times before their vote last
month to approve the project.</LD>
<LD>   Those visits, which were not open to the public, amounted to a
"serial meeting" conducted in violation of the law known as the Brown
Act, the lawsuit contends.</LD>
<TE>   "What the Brown Act says is do the public's business in public and
let them know you are going to do it," Calabasas Mayor Lesley Devine
said.</TE>
<TE>   That city, along with residents of Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, filed the suit against the county of Ventura, its Planning
Commission and developer Ahmanson Land Co.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous," Devine said. "I'm a public official; I know
better. They are public officials, and they know better."</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the Ventura County counsel's office said
attorneys there had not seen the lawsuit and would not comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Ahmanson's parent company, Washington Mutual Bank,
said he believes the suit is baseless.</TE>
<TE>   "The Planning Commission held two days of public testimony and
then deliberated and made their decision at a public meeting,"
spokesman Tim McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our view that there is no legal basis for Calabasas to
claim a Brown Act violation."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual wants to build a $2-billion golf course
community on the 2,800-acre ranch of oak savanna and grassy plains.</TE>
<TE>   However, those plans have been delayed by years of litigation and
the discovery in 1999 of the endangered red-legged frog and
spineflower on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the County Planning Commission voted 3 to 2 to endorse
a new environmental study of the project, clearing the way for the
Board of Supervisors to consider the study on Dec. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents want a court order temporarily preventing the project
from moving through the approval process, including postponement of
the supervisors' meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the order has been set for Wednesday morning before
Superior Court Judge Henry Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also seeks to compel the Planning Commission to
rescind its approval of the project and schedule a publicly noticed
visit to the site, providing parties on all sides the opportunity to
tour the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unconscionable that these commissioners were out
there in the first place," said Thousand Oaks attorney Ed Masry, who
is representing individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just big-business Washington Mutual trying to bully its way
into making millions off of a project that shouldn't be built in the
first place," said Masry.</TE>
<TE>   A delay in approval could allow Supervisor-elect Linda Parks, an
Ahmanson Ranch critic, to join the board before a final vote. Parks
is to replace Thousand Oaks-based Supervisor Frank Schillo in
January.</TE>

<HD>Woman Sought UC Berkeley's Help Before Accusing Dean</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan, Stuart Silverstein and Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Seven months before the dean of UC Berkeley's law school resigned in
the face of sexual harassment charges, a distraught student walked
into professor Linda Hamilton Krieger's office in one of Boalt Hall's
tree-shaded brick buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Krieger, a specialist in discrimination law, knew the woman well
and considered her one of the brightest students at the prestigious
school.</LD>
<LD>   Once in her office, Krieger said Monday, the woman confided that
she had been sexually assaulted 16 months earlier -- by the dean of
the school. "It was horrible," the professor said of her anguish over
the incident.</LD>
<TE>   Krieger's account, along with one issued Monday by university
officials, corroborates much of the former student's description of
the handling of her complaint, which led to the resignation last week
of Dean John P. Dwyer.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer's announcement -- and subsequent allegations by the alleged
victim's attorney that he had "grossly mischaracterized" the incident
as consensual -- sent a jolt through the law school, which has been
roiled for years by dissension over affirmative action. The
university held a meeting Monday to discuss the issue with upset
students and faculty members.</TE>
<TE>   "My God," said Eleanor Swift, a professor at the law school. "If
this isn't a kind of signal that this issue needs to be on our
agenda, nothing will be."</TE>
<TE>   The student, through her lawyer, maintains that the encounter was
not consensual. While acknowledging there was no intercourse, she
said it was an overtly sexual act involving fondling that began while
she was passed out after a night of drinking. In either case, the
central issue is the same: Did the university respond properly to the
woman's complaint, and did it have guidelines dictating the course of
that response?</TE>
<TE>   Krieger said she found that training and guidelines regarding
sexual harassment at the university were inadequate. Even she, an
expert in the field, wondered what her obligations were if the
student did not make a formal complaint, she said. Would she be held
liable if someone else were harmed? The student eventually did make
such a complaint in October, as Krieger advised.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger said the woman, now 27 and working for a public interest
law firm, was credible. She had done research work for Krieger, and
the professor had been her thesis advisor. "She was one of our star
students. She had an excellent academic record. She is no flake,"
Krieger said.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with an onslaught of media attention, Berkeley officials
said Monday that they will review the university's sexual harassment
policies and training for students, staff, faculty and
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, Laura Stevens, a Berkeley attorney representing
the former student, alleged that Boalt Hall is not complying with
state and federal anti-discrimination laws.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, reached by telephone while vacationing in Amsterdam,
specifically cited a failure to provide training to prevent sexual
harassment and other sexual offenses.</TE>
<TE>   She said the law requires that university employees and students
"be given training and education on a regular basis about the subject
of sexual harassment, assault, molestation and acquaintance rape."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of such training, Stevens said, "There's still a
law school full of people who are at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Statements issued by the university Monday agree in some key
details with accounts by Stevens and others, but differ in other
important ways.</TE>
<TE>   The university said the student approached three faculty members
during the semester following the December 2000 encounter, but did
not approach the school's Title IX official, who is charged with
handling sex discrimination matters, until last May, two days before
graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger, however, said the student had contacted a previous Title
IX official shortly after the incident, to no avail. When the student
came to her last April, Krieger said in an e-mail account, "She
related to me her unsatisfactory experience with the Title IX officer
shortly after the event occurred, but I knew from my work on a campus
committee that the Title IX officer had been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the student this, and also told her that I held the new
Title IX officer in high regard."</TE>
<TE>   Krieger agreed to call the official, paving the way for the
student to meet with her in May. The professor said she did not
disclose the student's identity or the dean's, leaving that to the
young woman to decide.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger said the student did not pursue the matter over the summer
because she was busy studying for the bar exam. In the meantime,
Krieger said, she realized that "if I kept the information to myself,
and the alleged perpetrator harmed someone else, that it would have
very, very negative consequences, not only for the subsequent victim,
but also for the organization and possibly even for me personally."</TE>
<TE>   When she tried to find guidance about what to do, "there was none
to be had."</TE>
<TE>   Not even the university's general counsel could help her, she
said. She said she eventually decided to notify the university
chancellor, but before she could, the student filed a formal
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The university, in its statement Monday, said the student in May
had declined to give the Title IX officer her full name, simply
explaining what had occurred and saying it involved a dean.</TE>
<TE>   She also expressed concerns about retaliation, but was assured
that the campus had strong policies against retaliation, according to
university officials.</TE>
<TE>   The student declined to name the individual involved and chose not
to file a complaint, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to claims the university tried to keep the matter
quiet, the administration's written statement on Monday said that
under campus policy the university tries to reach a resolution that
is "agreeable to both sides, is consistent with the faculty code of
conduct, and that protects the privacy of all involved."</TE>
<TE>   The statement also said that Dwyer had sought a confidential
resolution of the issue. The university statement said that request
was under discussion with the students' attorney when Dwyer resigned
last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stevens' account, the alleged sexual assault occurred
after her client, a group of other students and a professor went out
for dinner and drinks. They later were joined at the restaurant by
Dwyer. After that gathering broke up, her client, four other students
and Dwyer went to a bar for more drinking.</TE>
<TE>   As the second gathering broke up, Stevens said her client was
separated from the group. She said Dwyer offered the student a ride
to her nearby Oakland apartment, and she accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Once at the apartment, Stevens said, her client lay down and she
believes that she passed out in her bed around 2 a.m. When her client
awoke later -- she remembered that it was 4:37 a.m. on her clock --
she found Dwyer, fully dressed, in her bed, fondling her genitals
with his hand and lying with his head near her breasts, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   When her client awoke with a startle, Stevens said, Dwyer got up
and left.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens characterized the contact as a sexual assault. "She was
drunk and passed out," Stevens said. "There's no consent when a
person has passed out."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said her client passed out again, and then woke up about 8
a.m. At that time, she found a bruise on her left breast. She called
her mother, told her about the incident, and then her mother came
over to take a picture of the bruise.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer had a reputation for socializing with students, although
that isn't unusual at the school. Although some female students
interviewed Monday expressed disgust with the dean, others defended
him and said they couldn't believe the allegations against him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good professor," said third-year student Monique
Morales, 31. "He invited us all to his house for a party. He was
quiet, kind of shy. It's hard for me to believe it wasn't consensual,
because a lot of girls made it obvious that they were flirting with
him. Even the girls who flirted with him, he didn't respond."</TE>
<TE>   Some Boalt professors said they were surprised by the complaint
and Dwyer's resignation, which was announced Wednesday but will take
effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I know utterly nothing," said Herma Hill Kay, a former dean and
current professor at Boalt. "It was a total shock to me."</TE>

<HD>Death of Deputy's Killer Is Called a Suicide</HD>
<DH>Authorities say the gang member shot himself, but coroner
has not yet ruled on cause of death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gang member who killed a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy Saturday shot
himself in the head after he was struck by shotgun pellets from
another deputy returning fire, sheriff's officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The county coroner, however, said a ruling on the cause of death
will not be made until further tests are completed.</LD>
<LD>   Alfredo Reyes, 21, fatally shot Deputy David Powell through the
door of an Artesia home Saturday morning and then was wounded by
another deputy, sheriff investigators said. About nine hours after
deputies first tried to entered the home, a SWAT team entered the
home and found Reyes' body.</LD>
<TE>   "The wound [Reyes] sustained from the shotgun would have been
fatal, but he shot himself in the head before he bled to death," said
Sheriff's Capt Frank Merriman, head of the sheriff's Homicide Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman said Powell, an 18-year veteran, was hit by one of four
shots that Reyes fired through the front door of the home. The single
fatal shot, he said, pierced Powell's right shoulder and went into
his chest after passing through an armhole in his protective vest.
Powell, 42, was hit as he and other deputies were withdrawing from
the house after failing to kick in the front door.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies, he said, were pursuing Reyes in connection with an
earlier gang-related shooting nearby and had been told that he might
be holding a woman hostage inside the home. Contrary to initial
sheriff's accounts that a woman ran from the home before the exchange
of shots, Merriman said Monday that the two women who lived there had
escaped before the deputies arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman said the pursuit began shortly before 11 a.m. after
deputies in Norwalk received reports of gunfire on 165th Street. A
short time later, a couple of rounds were fired near the border
between Lakewood and Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   Several patrol cars and a helicopter responded, and two suspects
were seen running through the streets of Artesia's. Reyes ran toward
a home in the rear of a lot in the 12000 block of 167th Street,
Merriman said.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman said Reyes barged inside the residence, a converted
garage. There were two women inside, he said. Moments later, a
relative came to the door to warn the women about the police pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   "During that conversation the girls managed to indicate to the
relative the man was inside their house, so the male relative grabbed
both of them and they ran," Merriman said.</TE>
<TE>   When deputies arrived at the front home on the lot, they were told
that a woman was still in the rear home with the suspect, whom they
were able to see through a window.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that Reyes was holding a hostage, they tried to kick in
the door. Powell died at a Lynwood hospital 90 minutes after he was
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes' body and a handgun were found inside the home after a SWAT
team entered about 8:30 p.m. Reyes, of Irvine, was a member of an
Artesia area street gang, sheriff's investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   An alleged accomplice, Robert Hernandez, 22, of Buena Park, who
was found by deputies hiding outside a nearby home, will not be
charged in Powell's death, Merriman said. Hernandez was taken into
custody for a probation violation and transferred to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements for Powell were pending Monday. A Torrance
resident, he is survived by his wife, Emma, their 7-year-old
daughter, and three adult stepdaughters.</TE>
<TE>   At his swearing-in ceremony for his second term Monday, a somber
Sheriff Lee Baca honored Powell and three other deputies who have
died in the line of duty during the last 22 months.</TE>
<TE>   "These four deputy sheriffs gave their all for the county of Los
Angeles, the state of California and America," Baca said. "As I
accept my second term in office, I accept it in their memory."</TE>
<TE>   At the direction of Gov. Gray Davis, state Capitol flags were
lowered to half-staff Monday.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Tutors Prepare Disadvantaged Students for School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Student Alma Linda Chapa thought she would have to spend the summer
working behind the counter of a mini-mart near her Long Beach home,
as she had the year before.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Chapa found a job doing what she loves and hopes to do
for a long time: teaching.</LD>
<LD>   A sophomore at Pitzer College in Claremont, Chapa joined a summer
tutoring program at an Ontario preschool that was made possible by a
$15,000 grant from the Times Holiday Campaign.</LD>
<TE>   The tutoring program, sponsored by a national group called
Jumpstart, sends college students to preschools year-round so they
can help disadvantaged children improve their social and literacy
skills to prepare them for grade school and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Allison Couch, the program coordinator, said the summer session
allowed more college students to try their hand at tutoring, thus
increasing interest for fall participation.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, Chapa is a Jumpstart team leader at another preschool
in Ontario called Para Los Ninos. She is among 50 students from the
Claremont Colleges who visit Para Los Ninos and other preschools
twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   Chapa joked that, as a child, she had wanted to be a teacher "to
get other kids in trouble." Now, she said, "it's really about helping
people, wanting to be a positive influence."</TE>
<TE>   The draw for the college students is acquiring experience with
issues they hope to tackle in careers such as teaching or psychology.
Plus, some said, it's fun and satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor Mark Gannon, a Pitzer freshman from Boston, said the
commitment of 300 hours a year "makes me feel like I'm giving a lot
back, rather than just being in classes."</TE>
<TE>   Tutors and coordinators say they see the effect they have when,
for example, the children show interest in reading on their own. One
preschooler, for instance, offered to "read" a picture book to his
tutor, "and that was a huge development," Chapa said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Jumpstart workers asked the teachers at Para Los Ninos
to assess their students -- those in the program and not -- in
categories such as beginning reading and relating to adults. The
children who had participated in Jumpstart, the workers said, showed
dramatically sharper improvement than the other children.</TE>
<TE>   This season, The Times is featuring Southern California charities
that have benefited from its annual Holiday Campaign. Last year's
appeal raised $653,000, which was given to more than 50 organizations
in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund,
a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation. The foundation matches
the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>Santa Ana Unified School District and the city of Tustin agreed
Monday to postpone their latest court showdown over the closed Tustin
Marine base to allow the district time to study a new compromise
offered by the city, district attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin agreed in May to pay Santa Ana Unified $60 million for the
latter's claim to land at the base.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is how Tustin will guarantee payment. The school district
wants a letter of credit; Tustin is seeking a less costly
alternative. Both parties are due back in court Dec. 17.</LD>

<HD>New Coastal Drilling Blocked</HD>
<DH>The White House is dealt a setback when a federal appeals
court upholds a decision that a state panel must review environmental
hazards.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Monday effectively blocked new oil
drilling off the California coast in the near future by upholding a
lower court decision that state officials must first scrutinize
drilling plans for environmental hazards.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals does not
prevent new ocean drilling. But it continues to freeze all drilling
plans on undeveloped tracts in federal waters off the state's
coastline until the California Coastal Commission reviews their
impact on the ocean, the shoreline and marine life.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling unanimously, a three-judge panel rejected arguments by the
Bush administration that state officials lack authority to review oil
leases in areas of the ocean that are under federal jurisdiction.</LD>
<TE>   The 33-page ruling graphically described the dying seabirds and 30
miles of blackened beaches that resulted from a 1969 oil platform
blowout off Santa Barbara which, the judges wrote, "might have been
avoided but for a failure of federal oversight."</TE>
<TE>   The state's ability to review and influence federal decisions on
offshore oil development in federal waters was designed to prevent
these failures, the judges wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis called the decision a victory for states' rights
and compared it to "a big stop sign" to leaders in Washington. "They
should take the hint and halt further attempts to exploit
California's spectacular coastal resources."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Interior said its lawyers were reviewing
the ruling and had not yet decided if it will ask a larger
nine-member panel of the court to re-examine the case or appeal it to
the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "This litigation is very narrow, focusing on process," said
Interior spokesman Hugh Vickery. "This case, per se, does not deal
with putting up platforms or putting a drill into the seabed."</TE>
<TE>   At issue in the case is the fate of 36 undeveloped oil and gas
tracts in federal waters off the coast of Ventura, Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   Oil companies paid nearly $1.25 billion to lease these tracts
between 1968 and 1984. They drilled 38 exploratory wells, made 17 oil
and gas discoveries, but never began producing oil from the tracts.</TE>
<TE>   All of the leases were set to expire more than a dozen years ago.
But the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service extended
the leases repeatedly over the objections of state officials.</TE>
<TE>   So the state of California sued, arguing that the federal Coastal
Zone Management Act gives the Coastal Commission the authority to
review the latest round of lease extensions to ensure that they are
consistent with state coastal protection laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has argued that the state has no right to
review these decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland sided
with state officials, ruling that the Coastal Commission can weigh
the potential impact of developing each lease on water quality,
marine life, air quality and even scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit Court upheld Wilken's ruling Monday, saying that
the state's ability to review and influence these extensions, or
"suspensions" as they are known, are important ecologically and a
matter of law.</TE>
<TE>   "These lease suspensions represent a significant decision to
extend the life of oil exploration and production off of California's
coast, with all of the far-reaching effects and perils that go with
it," the appeals court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The opinion was written by Judge Dorothy W. Nelson and joined by
the 9th Circuit Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder and Judge Stephen
Reinhart. All three were appointed by President Jimmy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the Interior Department decides to comply with the
decision instead of prolonging the agony," said California Resources
Secretary Mary Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that the position of the governor and the Coastal
Commission is to oppose further offshore drilling because of the risk
to the environment. But we have to review these leases on a
case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   She said it is possible that some of the leases extensions -- and
future drilling -- will be approved if oil companies and federal
officials present a compelling case that oil can be extracted in an
environmentally safe manner.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Eshelman of the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America
declined to comment Monday on the court ruling, saying he had not had
time to review it.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 billion barrels of crude oil lie untapped beneath
undeveloped tracts along the California coast. Much of it is oil that
is often used to produce asphalt and does not command the same prices
as the lighter oil used to make gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the major oil companies have abandoned oil development off
California because of environmental hurdles and anti-oil sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Large companies sold their interests to smaller ones, which, in
turn, have sued the federal government to recoup hundreds of millions
of dollars invested in undersea fields that have not produced a drop
of oil. The breach-of-contract lawsuit charges that ever-changing
rules and delays have thwarted their ability to produce oil on these
tracts.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have urged the Bush administration to pay these
oil companies, essentially buying back the leases the way it did
earlier this year for undeveloped oil tracts off Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "We are certainly willing to sit down and talk," said Vickery, of
the Interior Department. "So far, the state has rejected our request
to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the negotiations, Nichols said, is that the Bush
administration only wants to buy back some of the leases. California
officials wants all of the leases to be purchased.</TE>
<TE>   In another plan, Democratic U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein joined with members of Congress in Louisiana to try to swap
California's tracts with equivalent tracts off the coast of
Louisiana. The Bush administration, so far, has not supported the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over offshore oil drilling isn't new in California. But
it has been limited to these 36 tracts because the rest of the
state's coastline is protected by a moratorium on offshore oil
drilling imposed by Congress and presidential order.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 43 offshore tracts remain in active oil production
in federal waters and a few more in state waters. The platforms of
these working wells dot the coastline off Huntington Beach, Long
Beach, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. State waters are within
three miles of shore. Federal waters begin three miles out and extend
seaward from there.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is pushing to increase domestic oil and
gas production. It wants to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska and in new areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Rocky
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling puts Bush administration officials in a awkward
position because they usually champion states' rights over federal
authority, said Drew Caputo, an attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys over and over again talk about respecting state
authority for drilling in the arctic and increasing timber cutting in
some states," he said. "Here's a state that is adamantly opposed to
drilling. I don't understand how they can respect state authority
only when the state agrees with the oil industry."</TE>

<LD>After the good ship Ecstasy leaves the port of L.A. and reaches three
miles off shore, the passengers will get the signal: They can start
taking off their clothes. All of their clothes. The 2,000 or so sun
worshippers will be making what is billed as the largest nude cruise
ever, a 10-day jaunt down the coast of Mexico in March.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the partyers would still be well advised to pack
suitcases, says Amanda Poston of Bare Necessities Tour &amp; Travel of
Austin, Texas, organizer of the event. She pointed out that Carnival
Cruise Lines, owner of the Ecstasy, requires passengers to wear
clothes in the dining room.</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal: While I'm on the subject, a colleague passed along an

pleased with her eye surgery, which was performed by Dr. Arthur Hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: "At an outdoor restaurant in Trujillo, Spain, we
found a menu listing garlic soup with an 'embezzled egg,' " wrote
Richard Seibel of Glendale. "It turns out that the Spanish word for
'embezzle' is only one letter different from the word for 'poach.' "</TE>
<TE>   Added Seibel, "We couldn't find a reason for another item on the
menu that was 'attacked with ham.' " I think I'd rather have
something attacked with ham than with garlic.</TE>

<LD>Slap the cuffs on me. I'm an outlaw. A tax dodger. My face is
probably going up on a wanted poster in City Hall at this very
minute.</LD>
<LD>   Mine and 151,000 other Angelenos'.</LD>
<LD>   The official letter that arrived in last week's mail didn't have
quite the chilling salutation of a draft notice ("Greetings") but ran
a photo-finish second. It began, "Re: City of Los Angeles business
tax."</LD>
<TE>   The city let me know it has information that "indicates you may be
engaged in business within the City" and "our records indicate that
you do not have a valid City of Los Angeles Tax Registration
Certificate. You may owe business taxes...."</TE>
<TE>   Two "mays" and two "indicates" -- sounds pretty soft to me. What
business? What tax? I'm not operating a psychic pals' network out of
the bathroom; if I were, don't you think I would have been able to
predict that the sewer line would back up?</TE>
<TE>   So I called the phone number printed on the letter. The other
151,000 people who got the letter must have, too. We all got a busy
signal.</TE>
<TE>   Antoinette Christovale, who signed the letter, is director of the
city finance office, and once I'd bribed someone to give me her
direct number, she told me that her office "wasn't expecting as many
people to call in."</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't have been a surprise. It would be a surprise if the
151,000 people who got a letter saying they might be prosecuted if
they don't respond didn't all pick up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Bill 63, Christovale says, the "business tax enforcement
program," gives the city a hand in enforcing its business-tax code.
Any California city can ask the state franchise tax board to hand
over tax information about its residents. Anybody who files a 1099
form -- payment for "independent contract" work -- is on that list.
If you earned $100 a week baby-sitting for college money, if your
church paid you $6,000 to refinish the pews, shazam! You could be a
small business.</TE>
<TE>   If you earned less than $5,000, you might be off the hook. But
since the tax board only hands over names, addresses and types of
business -- no income information -- the burden is on you and me to
prove a negative: to fill out the city's form, showing we're exempt
(and putting tax data in their hands), or pay taxes all the way back
to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   So, do I run a "hot business"? I made a little money doing
commentaries for National Public Radio, telling the rest of the world
what it doesn't know about L.A. and should, but I look upon that as
God's work, not business. I probably cleared $500 this year from my
book -- so much for best-sellers making writers rich. I think the
city made more in sales tax on the book than I got from writing it.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that enough? What do they want, blood? Oh, I see -- there's
a place on the form for that, too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't entirely blame the city. A lot of substantial businesses
do dodge taxes. But can someone explain to me why the city expects to
track down tax dodgers by going after people who have filed taxes?</TE>
<TE>   In Jackie Jones' case, the city already gets her tax money. She's
owned Jones Coffee Co. in Northridge for 24 years, selling coffee,
tea and gifts. The 1994 quake put her out of business for three
months, and did she get a tax break from the city? One guess.</TE>
<TE>   She was furious when she opened the letter. "This catches
law-abiding citizens, people who pay attention to something like
this.... And to spend our money mailing those things out? It's
ridiculous, totally ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   VICA is the Valley Industry &amp; Commerce Assn. Its chairman, Fred
Gaines, says VICA has been swamped with calls from people who "have
no idea why they'd be in a position to pay tax and thought the tone
of the letter was very bizarre and threatening. I think [the city]
has handled it very poorly." VICA never jokes about taxes, so Gaines
may not be entirely kidding when he mutters something about a Chai
Tea Party in Lake Balboa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Writers Guild of America is hearing from members who've
received this letter -- some of them retirees who haven't written for
a long time but are still getting residuals for years-old work. The
guild is talking with the city about sorting out the intricacies and
differences in writing at home versus, say, doing auto-welding at
home.</TE>
<TE>   But how indeed do you tax writing? If I get an idea for a column
while I'm passing through Garden Grove, do I have to pay a Garden
Grove business tax? Think of some civic taxman hammering on Emily
Dickinson's front door and hollering in to the Belle of Amherst,
"Open up, lady! We know you got poems in there!"</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, L.A. proposed making writers and artists register
for a business permit and pay a $25 annual fee. This didn't happen,
in part because of the Writers Guild, and for good reason: How do you
license creativity?</TE>
<TE>   I do admit, it's tempting, a certificate proving I'm a writer,
especially when some choleric editor demands, "You call yourself a
writer?" and I can say modestly, "Well, I don't ... but the city of
Los Angeles does."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's primary water supplier announced plans Monday to
begin building a 30-mile pipeline that will carry salty water away
from underground basins to improve water quality in the region.</LD>
<LD>   When completed, the 54-inch-diameter line will connect to an
existing ocean outfall in Oxnard and allow for the discharge of water
with high saline levels and treated municipal waste water.</LD>
<LD>   "The concept is rather simple: We are removing salt from our
freshwater supplies and transporting it to the ocean, where it does
no harm," said Calleguas Municipal Water District General Manager
Donald Kendall.</LD>
<TE>   The pipeline will be built over 10 years as needs arise throughout
Calleguas' service area, officials said. Construction of the first
phase, which will cost $10.8 million, is set to begin next month in
southern Oxnard along Hueneme Road.</TE>

<HD>Priests Lose in Bid to Seal Church Files</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court Monday rejected efforts of three Catholic
priests who are suspected of molesting children to stop Los Angeles
County prosecutors from seeing their church personnel records.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the ruling is blocked in additional appeals, hearings would
be held by a court-appointed special master to determine which
records are protected by privacy rights similar to doctor-patient
privileges, said Donald Steier, who represents the priests.</LD>
<LD>   Steier said he had not decided whether to appeal the decision
further.</LD>
<TE>   In its ruling, the 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld the power
of a grand jury to subpoena records for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley called the decision a "landmark" that
will help prosecutors gain evidence and "investigative leads" in
their probe of Catholic priests suspected of abusing children.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, head of the office's sex
crimes unit, said the ruling is significant because California law
has not previously provided "explicit direction" on whether a grand
jury's authority included demanding documents from the targets of its
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge, huge step for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steier said he was not surprised by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we prevailed, it would mean the grand jury had been acting
without authority for the past 60 years," he said. "We understood
that the Court of Appeals would not be inclined to reach that
conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   The records at issue include psychological evaluations and other
personnel documents. Steier has contended that state and federal
privacy laws, including attorney-client privilege, protect the
documents from disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   "In the big picture, the D.A. is trying to obtain the files to
locate more victims," Steier said. "Those victims themselves have the
right of privacy. They are adults now.... They can come forward if
they want to. We object to the D.A. trying to ferret them out."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has already turned over the records to the grand
jury in response to its subpoenas. But the records were immediately
locked in a vault at the order of a Superior Court judge when Steier
moved to quash the subpoenas pending a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Dan T. Oki had ruled that the records could
be viewed by the grand jury and prosecutors, but Steier immediately
appealed.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal was filed on behalf of Father Michael Stephen Baker and
Father Michael Wempe, both retired, and Father David Granadino. Baker
has since been charged with multiple allegations of child
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Steier has argued before the appellate court that state law gives
grand juries the power to subpoena witnesses, but says nothing about
obtaining documents. He also argued that even if grand juries had
such powers, the Los Angeles subpoenas were illegal because they
failed to include an affidavit explaining why the information was
sought and how it related to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The three-member appellate panel disagreed. It cited a section in
the state penal code going back to the 1930s that instructed grand
juries to specifically require a witness to bring to the grand jury
documents or other papers that the jurors believe necessary to carry
out their duties.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also said a grand jury is not required to explain why it
wants a subpoena in any detail because that would defeat the purpose
of an investigation.</TE>

<HD>Woman Killed in Van Nuys Shooting</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 28-year-old man fatally shot his wife at a Van Nuys apartment
complex Monday afternoon before he shot and critically injured
himself, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting was witnessed by the couple's 9-year-old daughter who
ran to a neighbor's apartment for help, crying, "Daddy shot Mommy and
then shot himself," police said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting was reported about 3:15 p.m. in the 6800 of North
Sepulveda Boulevard near Vanowen Street, a neighborhood lined with
motels and apartment buildings.</LD>
<TE>   The 26-year-old woman, whose name was withheld pending
notification of relatives, was pronounced dead in a ground-floor unit
of the Bonita Apartments complex.</TE>
<TE>   "The wife was shot by the husband with a .22-caliber rifle before
he turned the gun on himself," Los Angeles police Officer Jason Lee
said.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor said that the couple were separated and the woman had
been staying with her uncles in the apartment for about three months.</TE>
<TE>   The man, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to
Northridge Hospital Medical Center where he was listed in critical
condition late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He and the woman appeared to be in their mid-20s, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-year-old and a 4-year-old daughter, were placed in the
custody of Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors arriving home a few hours after the shooting found
police patrol cars and a coroner's car in the parking lot and yellow
crime-scene tape strung across the entrance to the building.</TE>
<TE>   "I just came home from work and I was really surprised to see all
the police cars," said Isai Garrido, 21.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pretty quiet place. We don't get a lot of disturbances
here."</TE>

<HD>Holidays Off to a Ringing Start at the Cash Registers</HD>
<DH>Malls in Ventura County enjoy double-digit sales increases
over the Thanksgiving weekend. Lines form before dawn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanded store hours and early-bird discounts helped fuel
double-digit sales increases at malls from Ventura to Thousand Oaks
over the Thanksgiving weekend -- the traditional start of the holiday
shopping season.</LD>
<LD>   "All the department stores we talked to said they had fabulous
weekends," said Alice Love, marketing manager of Pacific View Mall in
Ventura. She said the anchor stores -- JC Penney, Macy's,
Robinsons-May and Sears -- had sales increases "in the high single
digits to the double digits," and that the Penney store enjoyed the
highest one-day sales total in its history Friday.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, all four of the department stores opened at 6
a.m. Friday to lure dedicated shoppers. Most gift items were popular,
according to Love, with apparel making a comeback from previous
lackluster years.</LD>
<TE>   Across the county at The Oaks in Thousand Oaks, department stores
mirrored the national trend and recorded double-digit sales gains
compared with last year's post-Thanksgiving weekend, according to
marketing manager Cristina Bremner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was much better than expected," Bremner said of the mall,
which has more than 130 retailers. "Friday was excellent, Saturday
was soft -- I think because it was a dark and rainy day -- but we
bounced back Sunday for another excellent day to finish out the
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   The heavy turnout was attributed in part to consumer confidence
and to fewer shopping days than usual between Thanksgiving and
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   The action was nonstop at the KB Toys store at The Oaks, where all
four cash registers were busy throughout the weekend, said Lisa Fay,
senior assistant manager. Nearly 100 people were lined up by the time
the store opened at 5 a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The day after Thanksgiving was just outstanding for us, and it's
still flowing," said Fay, whose store sales were up as much as 80%
Friday and about 60% throughout the weekend. Any item based on the
"Spider-Man" movie and comic books has been a big seller, she said,
as have Rapunzel Barbie and accessories, remote-control toys and this
season's hot FurReal Friends, battery-operated animals that resemble
actual felines.</TE>
<TE>   Early store hours also attracted thousands of shoppers to
Camarillo Premium Outlets' 120 stores before dawn Friday. Designer
stores including Tommy Hilfiger, Polo Ralph Lauren and Coach
attracted lines before they opened, said Maura Eggan, director of
marketing for Chelsea Property Group, the New Jersey-based developer
of the outlet center.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people who had been waiting since the wee small hours
of the morning, and they were at the cash registers within five
minutes" after opening time, Eggan said. "They were well-organized,
focused shoppers who knew exactly what they wanted and had obviously
done their homework."</TE>
<TE>   Because brand names are even more popular during the holidays, the
outlet mall -- with tenants including Ann Taylor, Hugo Boss, Barneys
New York, Donna Karan, Nike and Adidas -- does very well, Eggan said.
Among the better-selling gifts, she said, were accessories such as
scarves and costume jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   Eggan said visitors from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties
contributed to heavy traffic all three days, but coordination with
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department helped keep snarls and
backups to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Records couldn't help but be broken at Oxnard's Esplanade shopping
center, which was undergoing a rebuilding last year and had only half
its stores open by late November.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Sandy Dellibovi said sales have been picking up
since October and that the number of shoppers was "strong and steady"
all weekend, especially at the new Circuit City store, which had its
grand opening Nov. 21 after moving from Pacific View Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Although the crowds were constant at Pacific View Mall, the
Salvation Army was not seeing any donation records broken. Capt.
Keith Solts said that the organization, which has four bell-ringers
and a gift-wrapping booth at the mall, found that giving was slow
Friday but picked up Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Regional economist Mark Schniepp said most local consumers are
employed and confident about their personal finances. He predicts
another record fourth quarter this year, with overall taxable sales
adding 4% to the $2.6 billion tallied in the last three months of
2001.</TE>

<HD>Boston's Big Dig Faces Big Convention Deadline</HD>
<DH>Billions over budget and a year behind schedule, the city
promises project will be ready when Democrats meet in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>It is the most expensive highway construction project in the nation's
history -- and possibly the most miserable marriage of residents and
redevelopment.</LD>
<LD>   Replacing an antiquated, elevated highway with a 10-lane
interstate running below Boston was so ambitious that some likened it
to building the Panama Canal. But while that fabled engineering
effort took place in a sparsely populated jungle, the Big Dig -- as
the $14.6-billion Central Artery Project is known -- has rerouted
more than a decade of daily life in a big, bustling city.</LD>
<LD>   When Boston was selected late last month to host the 2004
Democratic National Convention, a cautious ripple of anticipation
clutched a Big Dig-weary populace. Could there finally be light at
the end of the 7.5-mile tunnel that will carry cars, trucks and buses
under the city's busy surface?</LD>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," said Sol Sidell, owner of a small restaurant in
the heart of Big Dig country. "What you're looking at are the final
finishing touches of the future."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, what Sidell's gaze and outstretched arms encompassed was
a sidewalk too narrow for more than one pedestrian. Outside his South
Street Diner, an excavator chomped huge holes in the asphalt, and
jackhammers pummeled pavement. Nearby, a section of a bridge dangled
from an immense yellow crane.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the Big Dig a year or more behind schedule, but it
also is coming in at more than twice the original $6.4-billion budget
approved by Congress in 1987. As the cost grew, federal support
shrank -- from 86% at the outset to the current 55%. Lawsuits and
contract disputes mushroomed. Engineering obstacles such as
unforeseen deposits of bedrock also slowed a project intended to
reclaim a human-focused environment by submerging a rickety eyesore
built in 1959, the heart-swoon phase of America's love affair with
the automobile.</TE>
<TE>   By sinking a raised artery that slashed past the Boston harbor,
the Big Dig would connect downtown Boston to its own waterfront. At
one end of the underground interstate, the endeavor entailed
constructing the world's widest cable-stayed bridge. At the other, a
four-lane tunnel named for baseball hero Ted Williams provided a
long-needed link between the Massachusetts Turnpike and Logan
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Project officials promised traffic capacity would double, to
225,000 cars a day. And above it all would be a glorious park, since
named for Rose Kennedy, late matriarch of the Massachusetts
Democratic dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   Eager for the payoff, many in Boston nonetheless wondered how wise
it was to invite 34,000 visitors when the Big Dig remains unfinished.
Some here expressed skepticism, as if the vast traffic nightmare
might continue forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll believe it when I see it," said Glenn Monroe, 38, a computer
science student. "Many days it feels like the whole of Boston is
under construction."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials acknowledge they are racing against the
July 26, 2004, kickoff date of the Democratic National Convention.
But Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman Matthew J. Amorello, head of the
Big Dig, vowed last week that the project will be "98% completed" by
the time the convention begins.</TE>
<TE>   "The end is here," Amorello declared. "Will there be trees and all
the plantings? No. But we will be well on our way. I think we will be
able to showcase to the city and the world the only transportation
system of its kind."</TE>
<TE>   Big Dig delays killed Boston's dreams of hosting a 2000
presidential convention. This time, Mayor Thomas M. Menino took no
chances. He hauled the site selection committee to Boston, outfitted
its members with hard hats and drove them into the tunnel he says
will teem with eight to 10 traffic lanes when the Democrats arrive.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor showed his guests a ventilation system that proposes to
circulate clean air at 120 feet below surface roadways. He pointed to
breakdown lanes, emergency alert systems and tile walls topped with
stainless steel grating. Menino also noted that, as the first of its
kind, the Big Dig is a kind of living laboratory -- and now that it
is starting to look so good, officials from other cities and states
might want to go home and build one of their very own.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'Look, you're right in the middle of history,' "
Menino's press secretary Carole Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic worked, winning the city that helped launch the
American Revolution its first major-party national political
convention. But even the most ardent Big Dig boosters admit they are
cutting it close.</TE>
<TE>   Project officials say that at best, a maximum of six lanes will be
open in the underground portion in the summer of 2004. Old highway
off-ramps will be closing that summer, with impressive new traffic
jams expected to ensue. Vehicles traveling downtown -- where the
convention will be held -- will likely be diverted onto the narrow
streets of Boston's Chinatown, causing more logjams.</TE>
<TE>   And while the whole point of the Big Dig was to tear down the
Central Artery, this homely steel creature will remain standing right
outside the Fleet Center, where the Democrats will gather.</TE>
<TE>   Piloting a golf cart through the tunnel, Amorello conceded that
many in his home state were frustrated by the Big Dig's logistical
headaches and by the staggering price of a road that will cost nearly
$2 billion per mile. Amorello, who took over as chairman early this
year, blames previous management for failing to disclose actual costs
"when they knew full well what they were looking at."</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts taxpayers and toll-road drivers are bearing the
brunt of Big Dig cost increases. These financial overruns became a
major issue in the state's November gubernatorial election, as
Republican Mitt Romney hammered at Democratic state Treasurer Shannon
O'Brien for failing to rein in Big Dig expenses. Romney won.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the inflated price tag, the time frame stretched,
testing the patience of a populace weary of the never-ending presence
of the project. Big Dig officials recently removed a billboard
intended to assuage drivers at the south entrance. After a decade or
so, the message that "Rome Wasn't Built in a Day -- If It Was, We'd
Have Hired Their Contractors" didn't seem so funny.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really remember life before the Big Dig," said market
researcher Josh Mendelsohn, whose office overlooks the splendid
misery of the project-in-progress. Mendelsohn, 26, raised his voice
to be heard, as not 25 feet from him men with jackhammers attacked
the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days," Mendelsohn ventured, not very convincingly, "I hardly
even notice it."</TE>
<TE>   Gazing down from the cab of his excavator, Big Dig operating
engineer Walter Feugill said he has grown numb to citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "They want it both ways," said Feugill, one of 5,000 Big Dig
workers. "They want us to do the job, yet they don't want to be
inconvenienced."</TE>
<TE>   As if Big Dig workers didn't have gripes of their own. "These work
spaces are a pain," Feugill said. "They get smaller and smaller. I
can't even turn my excavator around! Here, you try it."</TE>
<TE>   But the real drama is the contrast between a post-World War II era
when Americans fell in love with automobiles, and a moment in history
when citizens are rediscovering cities they formerly fled. Cars
ruled, and people came second when the Central Artery rose within

<LD>New York City enacted the biggest increase in property taxes in its
history -- an immediate 18.5% rise -- to deal with its worst fiscal
crisis since it nearly went bankrupt in the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the higher taxes are necessary to bridge a
$1.1-billion budget gap in the current fiscal year, and to reduce a
projected $6.4-billion deficit for the next fiscal year, which starts
July 1. The city also has made $3.5 billion in budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The crisis is attributed to the recession, a downturn on Wall
Street and the World Trade Center attack, among other things.</LD>

<HD>Justices to Rule on Past Sex Crimes, Tribal Raids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court took up a pair of California cases Monday, one to
decide whether sex abuse charges can be brought for incidents that
happened decades earlier and another to resolve whether state police
can carry out raids on tribal reservations.</LD>
<LD>   Marion Stogner was 70 years old in 1998 when he was charged with
committing lewd acts with his children from 1955 to 1973. The alleged
incidents took place in Contra Costa County.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, California had a three-year statute of limitations
for such crimes.</LD>
<TE>   However, the Legislature created a one-year period during which
people who were sexually abused when they were young can report the
incidents to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Stogner was charged when relatives reported his crimes.
Prosecutors say he did not deny the allegations, but said the
criminal charges were improper so long after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer contended the repeal of the statute of limitations
violates the Constitution's ban on ex post facto laws. Generally,
this ban has been interpreted as barring the government from imposing
new laws on past crimes or increasing the punishment for past
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   State prosecutors said they had done neither in Stogner's case,
and the state Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices granted his appeal in Stogner vs. California to
decide whether lifting the time period for filing charges has the
effect of raising the punishment for past crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the court agreed to take up an Inyo County case that
California prosecutors say threatens their ability to enforce the
law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, investigators were checking on evidence of welfare fraud
by three employees of a tribal casino run by the Paiute-Shosone
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   They obtained a search warrant to check the casino's payroll
records.</TE>
<TE>   But tribal officials barred the search and declared the
reservation was a sovereign territory, off-limits to searches.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and upheld
the tribe's claim of sovereign immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Inyo prosecutors appealed, saying the ruling makes the hundreds of
reservations in the West into "sanctuaries for off-reservation
criminal enterprises."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County District Atty. Steve Cooley said the 9th
Circuit ruling, if allowed to stand, could allow for criminal
"enclaves" to operate freely just a 25-minute drive from downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The court will hear the case of Inyo County vs. Paiute-Shoshone
Indians in March and issue a ruling by July.</TE>

<HD>More Cruise Ship Passengers Take Ill</HD>
<DH>Third Florida liner is hit. Health officials say such
outbreaks are not new, likely on decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Passengers on a third Florida-based cruise ship, Carnival Corp.'s
Fascination, have come down with a virulent intestinal ailment, but
public health officials said Monday that such outbreaks are not new
and might actually be on the decline.</LD>
<LD>   "To have three ships out at once in the same period of time is a
little bit unusual, but we've heard of it before," said Bill Toth, an
epidemiologist with the Orange County, Fla., Health Department. Asked
whether he would take a cruise himself, Toth replied, "Sure."</LD>
<LD>   After a three-day cruise to the Bahamas, the Fascination docked in
Miami early Monday morning with 190 passengers and four crew members
complaining of symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, Carnival said in
a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't wait to get my family off," Valerie Cone told a Miami
TV station as she left the port with her stricken son. Passengers
reported suffering from vomiting and diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   It was not confirmed that the ailment was the Norwalk-like virus,
which recently affected more than 1,000 passengers on ships belonging
to Holland America Line and Disney Cruise Line, and led those
companies to cancel cruises to clean and sterilize the vessels. But
Carnival said it was treating the latest outbreak as another instance
of the virus, the most common cause of nonbacterial gastrointestinal
illness.</TE>
<TE>   The 855-foot Fascination was supposed to set sail Monday afternoon
on a four-day cruise to Key West and Cozumel, Mexico, but was delayed
as special cleaning crews continued what the line called
"comprehensive sanitizing efforts," Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de
la Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Forney, chief of the vessel sanitation program at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there was "nothing
new" about a number of passengers on cruises becoming sick. In May to
August, he said, probably as many people contracted the sickness
while on cruises in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "Norwalk is not a mystery disease; it's not a new bug," Forney
said. "It's a very common bug that causes problems in the United
States all the time."</TE>
<TE>   He said his CDC co-workers are trying to get historical records on
outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases on the 140 cruise ships that
call at U.S. ports, and said he suspects the number of people falling
ill has likely decreased over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep wondering here at CDC why this has generated so much
interest for such a long period of time," Forney said of media
coverage of the episodes.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwalk-like ailment has been reported in other confined
places frequented by the public, from hotels to a Boy Scout camp. But
Dr. Frederick Southwick, chief of infectious diseases at the
University of Florida's College of Medicine, said buffet food lines
and swimming pools on cruise vessels might give the virus very
effective transmission routes.</TE>
<TE>   "The virus is hardy, it can withstand heat, concentrations of
chlorine and some drying," he said. "The good thing is that this is
not a dangerous virus, and doesn't cause serious morbidity or
mortality."</TE>
<TE>   De la Cruz, the Carnival spokeswoman, said the recent occurrences
of the virus hadn't had a discernable impact on reservations for the
Miami-based line, which operates 18 ships. Passengers scheduled to
board the Fascination on Monday afternoon were given a two-page
letter explaining what had happened and offering such options as
rescheduling their holiday or canceling with a full refund, she said.
After a cleaning, the ship departed in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of 1,026 cabins, only 45 canceled," De la Cruz said. "I think
if there was a lot of fear now as regards the cruise industry, we
would have had a whole lot of people take us up on that option."</TE>
<TE>   However, the repeated instances of the virus may be spreading
concern in the general public. One South Florida TV station found in
a poll that 59% of people responding were now worried they might get
sick if they took a cruise.</TE>

<HD>Study Criticizes Lawyers in Texas Death Row Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys appointed to represent Texas death row inmates for the
critical post-conviction review of their trials have frequently
mishandled the cases to the detriment of their clients, a study to be
released today has found.</LD>
<LD>   The study focuses on the phase of a death penalty case known as
habeas corpus, where an inmate is able to challenge the
constitutionality of his conviction or sentence by raising claims not
dealt with during a trial, such as a prosecutor withholding
exonerating evidence.</LD>
<LD>   In more than one-quarter of the cases studied between 1995 and
2000 (71 of 251), the appointed attorneys raised claims that could
not even be considered because they did not go beyond the trial
record, according to the report. It was prepared by the Texas
Defender Service, a nonprofit organization that represents death row
inmates and has staved off death sentences for several prisoners.</LD>
<TE>   The study, titled "Lethal Indifference," also found that in 97 of
the 251 cases reviewed -- 39% -- the appointed lawyers presented no
evidence to support the claims they raised.</TE>
<TE>   All told, a third of the habeas corpus petitions were doomed to
fail because of fundamental defects in how they were prepared, the
study said.</TE>
<TE>   "In many cases, the appointed lawyer filed an appeal that is the
functional equivalent of a blank piece of paper," said Jim Marcus,
executive director of the defender service.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these lawyers are the equivalent of a potted plant
because they fail to undertake the basic investigation that is
required by the Texas statute" governing the appointment of lawyers
in such cases, said Andrea Keilen, the principal author of the study.
She said that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which approves
lawyers to handle such cases, has "turned a blind eye" to incompetent
representation.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Wetzel, general counsel for the Court of Criminal Appeals,
defended Texas' procedures and said the authors of the report "are
not concerned with competent representation. They are concerned with
abolishing the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the study is likely to raise new questions about the way
the death penalty is administered in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has executed 287 people since the U.S. Supreme Court
permitted states to reinstate capital punishment in 1976, the highest
total by far. Texas has executed 31 inmates so far this year, more
than any other state.</TE>
<TE>   The report notes that since the death penalty was reinstated in
Texas, seven individuals have been exonerated and freed from death
row.</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Criminal Appeals reverses a smaller percentage of
death sentences than the highest-level court in any other state.
Critics say the Texas court rubber-stamps the convictions, while
supporters maintain that it shows that capital trials there are
handled properly.</TE>
<TE>   But even members of the Texas court have said they were troubled
by the performance of some lawyers whom they had approved for habeas
corpus appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Tom Price said, in a dissenting opinion earlier this year,
that the Texas law requiring appointment of "competent counsel" for
habeas corpus "ought to require more than a human being with a law
license and a pulse."</TE>
<TE>   State habeas corpus is critical, legal experts emphasize, because
if a claim is not raised at this stage, a federal court will not
review it at the next phase.</TE>
<TE>   The report presents several examples of individuals who could not
get a federal court to review a claim because it had not been raised
during the state process.</TE>
<TE>   One case featured in the study is that of Leonard Rojas, who is
scheduled to be executed Wednesday. The appeals court appointed an
attorney to represent Rojas who had never represented an inmate in a
habeas proceeding, and had been suspended twice by the State Bar of
Texas at the time of his appointment, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Rojas' lawyer failed to properly investigate the case and filed
claims that the court declined to review because they did not go
beyond the trial record, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also provides numerous examples of attorneys who filed
bare-bones habeas petitions, which were rejected, yet who continued
to be appointed to handle such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Among others who received appointments were attorneys who had been
reprimanded by the State Bar and three prosecutors. Keilen also said
the current list includes a lawyer who has been dead for months.</TE>
<TE>   The report also says the Texas court's unwillingness to properly
fund lawyers appointed to do these cases is "at the root of the
abundance of incompetent, unqualified attorneys" on the list. Wetzel
said he thought the Texas Defender Service was assessing the
appointed lawyers by unrealistic "gold standards -- what a Wall
Street law firm with unlimited funds would do to prevail in a
particular case. That is not what these cases are."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Wetzel said, "most of these are open-and-shut cases.
That is why [prosecutors] are going against these people for the
death penalty."</TE>

<HD>Lawyers for Detainees Argue Case to Appeals Court</HD>
<DH>Judges question whether they have authority to intervene on
behalf of prisoners held in Cuba.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Declaring that foreigners captured during the U.S. war on terrorism
have rights, attorneys for detainees held without charges at
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba pleaded for help Monday from a
skeptical federal appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen people from Australia, Britain and Kuwait, some held more
than a year, are seeking "the most modest of rights ... we want
access to an impartial tribunal," attorney Thomas Wilner said.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel questioned whether it has authority to
intervene and whether the prisoners held by the U.S. military are
entitled to some form of due process. Two of the three judges ruled
three years ago that a foreign entity without property or presence in
the United States has no constitutional rights.</LD>
<TE>   A. Raymond Randolph, appointed to the appeals court by former
President Bush, is one of the judges hearing the Guantanamo Bay case,
as is Stephen Williams, who was appointed during the Reagan
administration. Both were part of the panel in the case three years
ago. The third judge hearing the detainees' case is Merrick Garland,
appointed by President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been involved in many wars in its history, "but this
is the first time we have sacrificed the rule of law," said Wilner,
who represents 12 Kuwaitis.</TE>
<TE>   "The government says no court in the world may hear from my
clients," said Joe Margulies, hired by the families to represent the
other detainees in the case. "Guantanamo is unique. It is utterly
outside the law."</TE>
<TE>   The detainees' families have gone to the appeals court because
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled four months ago that
the Guantanamo Bay prisoners are not in the U.S. and thus do not fall
under federal court jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Seized by the U.S. in the Spanish-American War and leased from
Cuba for the last century, Guantanamo Bay is a 45-square-mile area on
the southeastern tip of Cuba now holding nearly 600 detainees from
more than 40 countries, including about 60 Pakistanis and about 100
Saudi Arabians. None of the detainees have been allowed to see their
families or to have access to attorneys. A handful of Afghan and
Pakistani detainees have been sent home after being cleared of
terrorist suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the court case were picked up in Afghanistan and Pakistan
after last year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees' situation is "identical" to that of German
nationals held in a German prison who were denied access to U.S.
courts in a 1950 Supreme Court ruling, Deputy Solicitor General Paul
Clement said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the detainees in Cuba, the Germans were charged and
convicted before a military commission in China after Germany
surrendered in World War II, the lawyers for the Guantanamo Bay
detainees pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees are being held at Guantanamo Bay for two reasons: to
get them away from the battlefield and to facilitate intelligence
gathering, Clement said. He added that investigators go back to the
detainees for additional questions as the U.S. gathers more
information from captured Al Qaeda suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In arguments that lasted an hour and a half -- three times the
scheduled 30 minutes -- the appeals judges pointed to one of their
own rulings in 1999 that related to terrorism. In it, the appeals
court ruled that it was not for the judges to decide whether
organizations hostile to the governments of Iran and Sri Lanka
committed terrorist acts. The groups were seeking to be removed from
the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.</TE>

<HD>Court to Weigh Texas' Ban on Gay Sodomy</HD>
<DH>Justices to decide whether states may use laws to punish
only same-sex couples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court took up a potential landmark case for
the gay-rights movement Monday, agreeing to decide whether the
Constitution permits states to enforce anti-sodomy laws exclusively
against same-sex couples.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the high court has been wary of saying that
discrimination against gays and lesbians violates the 14th
Amendment's guarantee of "equal protection of the laws."</LD>
<LD>   If such discrimination is forbidden, it could affect state laws on
adoptions, foster care, marriage and employment.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the justices said they would hear an "equal protection"
challenge to a Texas law that criminalizes "deviate sexual acts"
between people of the same sex.</TE>
<TE>   Two Houston men, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner, are
appealing their convictions and $200 fines for violating the law.
They were arrested in 1998 when sheriff's deputies, responding to a
false report of an armed intruder, found the two men having sex in
Lawrence's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund in New York who appealed
their case say the Texas law "brands gay people as second-class
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence and Garner were "punished for engaging in consensual
sexual intimacy in the privacy of one of their homes," said Ruth E.
Harlow, a Lambda lawyer. "Texas' 'homosexual conduct' law targets gay
and lesbian couples while leaving heterosexual couples free to engage
in the very same acts."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, in addition to Texas, still have
anti-sodomy laws that target gays only. Nine other states have laws
on the books that make oral and anal sex a crime, but they apply to
all adults. They are Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the high court rejected a gay man's challenge to
Georgia's anti-sodomy law and said the Constitution's right to
privacy did not extend to intimacy among gays.</TE>
<TE>   In a 5-4 decision in Bowers vs. Hardwick, Justice Byron R. White
commented that it was "at best, facetious" to say sex between gays is
a fundamental right deserving of constitutional protection.</TE>
<TE>   In the new case, Lawrence vs. Texas, the gay-rights lawyers urged
the court to overturn Bowers vs. Hardwick. But they spend most of
their energy arguing that the Texas law should be struck down on
equal protection grounds.</TE>
<TE>   In defending their law, Harris County prosecutors say the Texas
Legislature determined that "homosexual sodomy is immoral."</TE>
<TE>   The state repealed its anti-sodomy law for heterosexuals in 1976.
State legislatures are the "deliberative bodies properly charged with
the task of determining whether particular conduct is still regarded
as immoral," they said, and for that reason, the prohibition on
homosexual conduct was maintained.</TE>
<TE>   William Delmore III, the Houston prosecutor, also argued that the
law does not unfairly target gays. Heterosexuals can engage in
homosexual conduct, and the law is "applied equally to both men and
women who engage in the prohibited conduct," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the Bowers case in 1986, 24 states had anti-sodomy
laws. Since then, half of those laws have been repealed or
invalidated by state courts.</TE>
<TE>   Only three justices remain from the 1986 decision. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor voted with the
majority to uphold Georgia's anti-sodomy law. Justice John Paul
Stevens dissented.</TE>
<TE>   In the new case, which will be heard in March, Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy figures to hold the key vote.</TE>
<TE>   A Reagan appointee, Kennedy usually votes with the court's
conservative majority on such issues as affirmative action and
state's rights.</TE>
<TE>   However, he wrote an opinion for the court in 1996 that struck
down a Colorado voter initiative that repealed the state's many
antidiscrimination ordinances forbidding bias against gays and
lesbians. Kennedy called the initiative arbitrary and irrational and
said it violated the equal-protection guarantee in the 14th
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor joined in the 6-3 majority in the case of Romer vs.
Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's opinion stopped short of saying the discrimination based
on sexual orientation was generally unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   However, his approach opened the door to striking down other laws
as arbitrary and irrational.</TE>
<TE>   The justices have refused repeatedly to hear challenges to the
military's policy of excluding openly gay men and women.</TE>

<HD>Toll of Officers Slain in Line of Duty Rises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianne Aryanpur</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty
rose from 51 in 2000 to 142 last year, with 72 of those officers
killed in the Sept. 11 attacks alone, an FBI report released Monday
said.</LD>
<LD>   "The year 2001 will always be remembered as the year terrorists
turned commercial airliners into murder weapons and used them to kill
3,047 innocent people," the report said. "Counted within that number
are 72 local, state and federal enforcement officers, the most
officers ever lost in a single day."</LD>
<LD>   The annual report by the bureau's Uniform Crime Reporting Program
investigates trends and circumstances surrounding the killing of law
enforcement officers across the country.</LD>
<TE>   In the Sept. 11 attacks, 69 police, fire and port officers from
New York and New Jersey, one agent with the U.S. Secret Service and
one FBI agent were killed. An officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service also died aboard Flight 93, which crashed in rural
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The report notes, however, that excluding those slain in the
terrorist attacks, the number of officers killed still increased from
51 in 2000 to 70 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at
Northeastern University, said that may be misleading because the
number of officers killed on the job was uncharacteristically low in
the previous two years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, 42 officers were killed, and the number was 51 in 2000,
according to Department of Justice statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the long-term trends, this bounce-back to 70 puts
it at a much more typical level," he said. "It's not that 70 is so
bad, it's that 51 was so good."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the report found that in the last five years, the number
of officers killed has decreased 1.4%. "If you look at the
statistics, you see that there's been a general downward trend," Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also examines the number of killings based on
geographic region. The largest concentration was in the southern
states, where 29 officers were killed in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the number of slain officers rose from two in 2000
to six in 2001. Of the 133 officers killed in the western U.S. since
1992, almost half -- 63 -- were killed in California. The most recent
killing of a law enforcement officer in the region took place last
weekend when a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was fatally shot
in Norwalk while investigating reports of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   The report also examines the circumstances involving the killings,
noting that there is often a tendency to assume that officers are
slain only in situations that pit them against antagonistic
individuals. While the majority of officers were killed either
investigating suspicious people or making arrests, the report notes
that in 2001, some officers were slain while coming to the aid of
people perceived to be in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten officers were the victims of violent attacks that were as
unsuspected as they were unprovoked," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "In three of these instances, the officer walked into an ambush
situation; in seven others, the officer was gunned down for no
apparent reason, perhaps just for being a law officer."</TE>
<TE>   The remaining officers were killed while transporting prisoners,
following traffic pursuits or by mentally deranged people.</TE>
<TE>   City police departments employed a total of 105 of the officers
who died, county police and sheriff's offices employed 24 and three
were employed by state agencies. Four of the officers were employed
by federal agencies, and six were working as police officers in the
U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement is a high-risk occupation," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   "The men and women who serve the public in this way put themselves
in danger as a matter of routine."</TE>

<HD>Study Questions U.S. Policy on Pot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Casting doubt on a basic principle of U.S. anti-drug policies, an
independent study said Monday that marijuana use does not lead
teenagers to experiment with hard drugs such as heroin or cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the private, nonprofit Rand Drug Policy Research
Center countered the theory that marijuana acts as a so-called
"gateway" drug to more harmful narcotics, a key argument against
legalizing pot in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers did not advocate easing restrictions on marijuana,
but questioned the focus on the substance in U.S. drug control
efforts.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence has seemed so strong in favor of the gateway effect
that a lot of policymakers and others have taken it for granted the
gateway effect is real. We have shown why this is not necessarily the
case," said Andrew Morral, lead author of the Rand study.</TE>
<TE>   Using data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse from
1982 to 1994, the study concluded that teenagers who took hard drugs
were predisposed to do so whether they tried marijuana first or not.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids get their first opportunity to use marijuana years before
they get their first exposure to hard drugs," Morral said. "It's
possible marijuana is not a gateway drug. It's just the first thing
kids come across."</TE>
<TE>   Morral said 50% of U.S. teenagers had access to marijuana by age
16, while the majority had no exposure to cocaine, heroin or
hallucinogens until they were 20.</TE>
<TE>   He said the four-year gap in exposure to drugs raised doubt about
the gateway theory.</TE>
<TE>   Given limited resources, Morral said the U.S. should reconsider
the prominence of marijuana in its much-publicized "war on drugs."</TE>

recognized by their mischievous twists, folds and dimples and the
physics-defying thinness of their walls, can fetch $20,000 or more
from among the small but growing universe of Ohr cognoscenti.</TE>
<TE>   His admirers say the potter, dismissed by many contemporaries as a
grandstanding buffoon, should be considered a pivotal figure in
American art -- and not just in pottery. Some argue that Ohr, working
on a Biloxi side street far from the big-city salons of cultural
innovation, may have been among the world's pioneering abstract
artists.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing abstract ceramics at the time Picasso and other
modern artists in Europe were just beginning to think about it," said
Robert Tannen, an Ohr aficionado who lives in New Orleans. "He was
not just a potter, not just a sculptor ... but an innovator, working
alone in Biloxi, Miss."</TE>
<TE>   Now, long after his death in 1918, Ohr's work is about to get its
biggest nudge toward mainstream acclaim. The current collection --
about 225 pieces -- will move from its makeshift gallery beside the
Biloxi library to a $20-million museum complex designed by Frank
Gehry. The four-acre site, on a grassy parcel with giant live oaks
overlooking Mississippi Sound, will house the pottery, plus a
collection of African American art, in a series of pavilions that
appear in drawings to have been frozen in mid-twist, very much like
Ohr pots.</TE>
<TE>   The involvement of Gehry, a renowned architect who rarely takes on
projects as modest in size as the museum, is bound to steer fresh
attention to Ohr from beyond the usual ranks of pottery buffs. Ground
is to be broken in March. The museum is scheduled to open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry, who calls his own attempts at pottery years ago "terrible,"
said Ohr brought to mind the sculptor Claus Sluter, a Flemish artist
from the 14th century whose accomplishments went largely unrecognized
by the world. "Ohr could very well be much more important than people
give him credit for," said Gehry, who was recruited for the project
by Tannen and his wife, Jeanne P. Nathan, both longtime friends.</TE>
<TE>   The newfound appreciation would undoubtedly amuse the potter, who
went to absurd lengths to gain the public's notice. Acting more like
a midway barker than a man of the arts, Ohr plastered signs up
declaring himself the greatest art potter on Earth. He penned silly
epigrams and posed for gag photographs that made full use of his
flowing mustache, which drooped so long that he could knot it behind
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Ohr was noisy and unabashed. He called his studio the "Pot-Ohr-E"
and dubbed himself the "Mad Potter of Biloxi" -- a playful moniker
that only made people wonder more as his behavior grew increasingly
bizarre. (Nine years before his death, Ohr was subjected to a sanity
hearing amid a dispute over land. He was found sane.)</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ohr is still known fondly as the mad potter. But the new
Gehry museum represents a redeeming final chapter in the tale of the
colorful iconoclast.</TE>
<TE>   "He is now about to be all the things he predicted he would be
someday," said Marjie Gowdy, executive director of the Ohr
collection. "Unrivaled, unequaled, undisputed -- the greatest art
potter of all times."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of artistic genius belatedly recognized is as familiar as
a Van Gogh painting. Ohr's saga features a headstrong artist who was
in many ways his worst impediment to fame, working in a medium --
pottery -- that has long struggled for legitimacy in the fine arts.
His vindication came on a stroke of plain luck.</TE>
<TE>   It was a chance visit to Biloxi by a New Jersey antiques dealer
that would rescue the potter's creations from a cluttered storage
shed, paving the way for its introduction into some the nation's
finest galleries and museums and planting the seeds for Ohr's
long-delayed celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Modern-day Biloxi, where beachside casinos are replacing shrimp
boats as the region's main providers, offers scant sign of Ohr's
life. The current pottery collection, most of it borrowed, is housed
in the former Biloxi cultural center, a block off the boulevard of
casinos. The site where Ohr made his pots is today a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Ohr was born in Biloxi on July, 12, 1857, the second of five
children. His father, George, was a blacksmith, and his mother,
Johanna, ran a grocery. Even within his family, the young Ohr didn't
fit in. The children consisted of "3 hens, 1 rooster and a duck," Ohr
wrote later. "I'm that duck."</TE>
<TE>   Ohr's was a laborer's youth -- a succession of menial jobs, from
file cutter's apprentice to tinker's helper to warehouse worker. The
offer of work as a potter's helper from a Biloxi native named Joseph
Meyer lured Ohr to New Orleans and introduced him to the medium that
became his obsession. For a salary of $10 a month, Ohr would learn a
trade.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found the potter's wheel," Ohr recalled in a brief
autobiography, "I felt it all over like a wild duck in water."</TE>
<TE>   Meyer taught Ohr the basics of pottery -- "how to boss a little
piece of clay into a gallon jug," Ohr said -- and about glazes. It
was not long before the apprentice was ready for the next level in
his artistic education. Instead of choosing formal arts schooling,
Ohr hit the road.</TE>
<TE>   For two years, he traveled a zigzag route around the eastern
United States, finding pottery studios and shows wherever he could.
"I sized up every potter and pottery in 16 states, and never missed a
show window, illustration or literary dab since that time, 1881," Ohr
recounted.</TE>
<TE>   Ohr returned to Biloxi in 1883 and threw himself into his trade.
He built his pottery and kiln by hand and took to scooping the grainy
clay from the banks of the nearby Tchoutacabouffa River and hauling
it back on a barge. His early years as a potter were devoted to the
practical. He produced household essentials: inkwells, flue pipes,
jugs and flowerpots. They were mundane and so, for the moment, was
Ohr's life. He sold his kitchen goods by pushcart to housewives and
produced tacky novelty items, such as trick cups and souvenir clay
medallions with bawdy captions, for the tourists who flocked to the
Gulf Coast.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to New Orleans to help Meyer again, this time to throw
pots for a women's arts club that would later be attached to Newcomb
College. At the time, pot makers were considered craftsmen. The
vessels became art once they were painted -- flowers and symmetrical
shapes were favored decorations, often rendered with painstaking
detail and repetition. The prevailing attitude toward artistic
pottery was that of the Arts and Crafts movement, which tended to
value ornamentation of handmade pieces that were disciplined,
traditional, uniform and lovely.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Biloxi, Ohr kept at his folk pieces, selling his household
goods from his shop and at country fairs, where he'd set up his wheel
and perform for the crowds. By the 1890s, he was also embarking on
his own art pottery -- an adventurous version that broke free from
the starched-collar rules. A fire in 1894 left his pottery in cinders
and destroyed his stock. Instead of quitting, Ohr returned to the
potter's wheel with newfound daring.</TE>
<TE>   His pots were like no other. While capable of creating vases with
all the ruffles and beauty of classical works, Ohr preferred turning
familiar forms into something exotic. He threw pots that were as thin
and delicate as eggshells; to this day, ceramics experts express awe
at the feat. When he failed, Ohr turned flaws into part of his art;
if the rim of a pot was chipped, he would chip the rest and glaze
over it.</TE>
<TE>   His designs betrayed a mischief-maker's glee. He made round bowls
like everybody else, then pinched them into barely recognizable
square forms. He gave pitchers huge flowering mouths that were
useless for pouring and punched holes in vases so they couldn't hold
water. He festooned some pots with complex, interlocking dimples and
etched others with flowers, only to glaze right over the engravings
with a cavalier defiance. Still other vessels were smoothed
unmistakably into the shape of female genitalia. At some point, he
abruptly quit applying glazes, saying it was the form that mattered
most.</TE>
<TE>   Stare long enough at an unglazed Ohr cup, with its undulating
folds and flares, and the plain vessel gives way to other forms: a
face, a woman's body. It is as if the pots are props in a magic show.</TE>
<TE>   "His stuff is fast and vigorous and energetic. He spins the pot in
a matter of minutes -- spins it, bends it, smashes it. It's Jackson
Pollock standing over a canvas hurling paint," said Eugene Hecht,
co-author of a book on the artist's work.</TE>
<TE>   During an age when pottery's effete leading lights were obsessed
with precision, the thick-armed Ohr flung pots with plebeian abandon.
He was a cowboy at a cotillion, a reckless inventor whose pots were
as extreme as their maker. While some visiting critics poured warm
praise over the work, Ohr mostly met with sneers from the top
ceramics figures of the era, who thought him a lowbrow.</TE>
<TE>   "He came across as hokey, particularly to this sort of rather
grand and elegant set of the Arts and Crafts," said Garth Clark, an
Ohr expert who runs ceramic studios in New York City and Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ohr marketed his work through clowning and shameless
sloganeering -- "No two alike," he crowed -- little of his art
pottery sold. He'd haul his pieces from one fair to another,
including some of the nation's major expositions, and invariably drag
them back. (One tragic exception came after an exposition in New
Orleans in 1885, when all 600 pieces were stolen, apparently by his
hired hauler.) Ohr managed to win a silver medal once, but he
complained that "my name is mud" when it came to collectors.</TE>
<TE>   In large part, this was because of his rigid insistence that any
buyer purchase his entire body of work -- as many as 10,000 pieces --
or nothing at all. Selling the pots piecemeal, Ohr sniffed, was akin
to selling Shakespeare by the line. And Ohr's prices -- $10 to $15
apiece -- were exorbitant for that era. Ohr eked out a living for his
wife and 10 children by making conventional pots.</TE>
<TE>   The all-or-nothing stance cemented his eccentric image and ensured
that his mud babies would never make it out of Biloxi, at least while
he lived. After his death from cancer in 1918, his wife offered the
pots, but found no takers. So, Ohr's creations were tossed by the
hundreds into crates and stored on the property, where his sons fixed
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The pots remained there, all but forgotten, for 50 years. Then, in
the late 1960s, a New Jersey antiques dealer named Jim Carpenter was
touring the Gulf Coast with his wife, Miriam, hunting for vintage car
fixtures -- horns and hood ornaments. Someone steered him toward the
Ohrs' shop in Biloxi.</TE>
<TE>   There, Ohr's son Ojo offered to show the couple something else. In
a cinder-block shed surrounded by junk cars and discarded
refrigerators were the neglected pots of George Ohr. There were "a
couple of hundred packing crates, like orange crates, with pottery
teetering around the edge of it and some stuck here and there,"
Miriam Carpenter recalled. "It was so filthy dirty."</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey couple ultimately wrangled a deal to buy the lot --
at least 6,000 pieces -- for a price that has never been made public.
Soon, the pots were making their way into the New York galleries and
into the hands of such art figures as Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns.
In ensuing years, as word spread, Ohr's work was snatched up by new
devotees; selected pieces were displayed in some of the nation's
elite museums, including the Smithsonian's National Museum of
American History.</TE>
<TE>   Some pieces remained in Biloxi, where an Ohr cultural center was
set up in 1994. That was the foundation for the new Ohr-O'Keefe
Museum of Art, for which officials have raised about half of the
$20-million cost. (O'Keefe is the name of museum benefactor Jerry
O'Keefe, a former mayor, who donated $1 million in the name of his
late wife, Annette.)</TE>
<TE>   Alongside the museum effort is a separate campaign to persuade the
far-flung private collectors to donate or lend their Ohr pieces. It
is called "Bring George Home." The posthumous salute to the artist
also promises a measure of glory for the town that spawned him, even
if it once scratched its head at his antics.</TE>
<TE>   "He was here in this little coastal village, way down on the Gulf
Coast of the United States, experimenting with an art form," said
Gowdy, the Ohr collection director. "And taking it to the limit."</TE>

<HD>Alabama Ordered to Improve Prison</HD>
<DH>The women's facility is a 'ticking time bomb,' judge says.
State has four weeks to submit a plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Monday that Alabama's prison for women is
overcrowded, understaffed and unsafe, and gave state officials four
weeks to come up with a plan to solve the problem.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson called the Tutwiler prison a
"ticking time bomb."</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Southern
Center for Human Rights on behalf of 15 Tutwiler inmates.</LD>
<TE>   The women's prison near Wetumpka was built in the 1940s to hold a
maximum of 364 inmates; it now houses 1,017.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation there has become so volatile with people living in
large open dormitories, extremely idle with almost no supervision at
all. It is a recipe for violence," said Tamara Serwer, a Southern
Center for Human Rights attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson gave Gov. Donald Siegelman and prisons Commissioner Mike
Haley until Dec. 30 to submit a plan to relieve the
"unconstitutionally unsafe conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Corbett said Haley was
studying Thompson's ruling and "will come up with a plan and submit
it."</TE>
<TE>   Corbett said prison officials might revise a plan that is already
in place to deal with overcrowding in general in the state's prison
system.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Siegelman, Mike Kanarick, said the governor will
come up with a plan that includes alternative punishment for
nonviolent prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's ruling says that lack of money is not an excuse for the
overcrowding at Tutwiler, but Corbett said, "The bottom line is it
does come down to adequate funding."</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials also face an order from a state judge that they
transfer all state prisoners from county jails to state prisons
within 30 days of sentencing.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Questionable Benefits in Prostate Cancer
Screening</HD>
<DH>Government panel says there is insufficient evidence for
recommending men should or should not undergo routine tests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Screening for prostate cancer provides only uncertain benefits, a
U.S. government panel found Monday, saying there was not enough
evidence to recommend for or against men undergoing routine tests.</LD>
<LD>   The report's findings, based on a review of other studies of the
effect of screening for the disease, the second-leading cancer killer
of U.S. men after lung cancer, add to a growing debate on the
subject.</LD>
<LD>   "While the jury is still out on the value of routine screening to
improve health outcomes, patients should talk with their clinicians
to make individualized decisions," Alfred Berg, head of the panel and
chair of the University of Washington's Department of Family
Medicine, said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "Men will need to make this decision based on their personal
preferences and values until we have better scientific evidence on
whether screening is effective."</TE>
<TE>   About 189,000 men will be affected by the disease in 2002 and
30,200 will die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest report, by an independent task force sponsored by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, echoes the findings
of other researchers in October who questioned whether the benefit of
screening outweighed its harms.</TE>
<TE>   Men older than 50 are often advised to get a blood test that
checks for the cancer by measuring the level of prostate specific
antigen, a protein produced by prostate cells and especially by
prostate cancer cells.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called PSA test and another test called a digital rectal
exam have been found to be effective at finding the cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the debate over early screening, another study released
Monday found that black men in the United States suffer and die from
prostate cancer at higher rates than white men but could be cured
just as easily as whites if the disease is caught and treated early.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that when diagnosed early, prostate cancer is
frequently curable in African Americans," said William Barrett, lead
investigator.</TE>
<TE>   His study, released at the annual meeting of the Radiological
Society of North America, compared 12 black patients with 161 whites,
all of whom underwent a treatment in which radioactive seeds are
implanted in the gland.</TE>
<TE>   None of the black men experienced a recurrence of the cancer,
although 5.6% of the whites did -- a difference that was
statistically insignificant, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The study said black men in the United States suffer from prostate
cancer at a rate of 234.2 per 100,000 population compared to 144.6
per 100,000 for whites. The death rate for blacks is 53.1 per 100,000
compared to 22.4 for whites.</TE>
<TE>   "There has long been debate about the usefulness of prostate
cancer screening because some forms of the disease are slow growing
and they will never be an issue for the patient," said Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   "But because prostate cancer in African Americans is generally not
slow growing, the combination of early diagnosis and effective
treatment should be particularly beneficial."</TE>

<HD>High Schools Aid Military</HD>
<DH>New federal education law requires personal data on
students be given for recruiting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A little-noticed provision in a new federal education law is
requiring high schools to hand over to military recruiters some key
information about its juniors and seniors: names, addresses and phone
numbers.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon says the information will help it recruit young
people to defend their country. But the law disturbs parents and
administrators in some liberal communities that aren't exactly
gung-ho about the armed forces.</LD>
<LD>   Some say the law violates students' privacy and creates a moral
dilemma over the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy concerning
gays.</LD>
<TE>   "I find it appalling that the school is sending out letters to do
the job of the military," said Amy Lang, the parent of a student at
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where Coca-Cola was once banned in
a protest against the soda giant's investments in apartheid South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The No Child Left Behind law, signed in January, pumps billions
into education but also gives military recruiters access to the
names, addresses and phone numbers of students in 22,000 schools. The
law also says schools must give the military the same access to their
campuses that businesses and college recruiters enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   School systems that fail to comply could lose federal money. The
measure also applies to private schools receiving federal funding.
But Quaker schools and others that have a religious objection to
military service can get out of the requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Students and parents who oppose the law can keep their information
from being turned over to the military, but they must sign and return
an "opt-out" form. The Boston school system, which has 7,500 juniors
and seniors, included the opt-out notice in a take-home student
handbook, but fewer than a dozen parents opted out.</TE>

<HD>Low-Profile Rove Pushed Into Political Spotlight</HD>
<DH>A magazine article about the Bush advisor's power ignites
firestorm in the nation's capital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With publication of a sharply critical attack on the influence of
President Bush's chief political advisor, Karl Rove found himself on
Monday once again in the public eye he so carefully tries to avoid.</LD>
<LD>   John J. DiIulio Jr., a Democrat and university professor whom Bush
brought to Washington to run the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives --
and who left seven months later -- was quoted in a magazine interview
as saying the administration's policy was run by the political
operatives.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis," DiIulio said in an
interview in the January issue of Esquire magazine.</LD>
<TE>   His comments raced through the capital, and the firestorm they
created was barely dampened when White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer called them "baseless and groundless."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, those were the very words DiIulio chose to use by the end
of the day when, in his second statement backing away from his
remarks, he said his commentary on the White House was "groundless
and baseless due to poorly chosen words and examples."</TE>
<TE>   The commentary by the man Bush summoned to shepherd into existence
one of the most important elements of "compassionate conservatism"
touched a nerve, because Rove is considered central to Bush's
domestic policy and politics.</TE>
<TE>   That Rove would likely end up in such a position was forecast this
year by no less than the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In lengthy remarks that also appeared in Esquire in its July
issue, Card worried that the departure from the White House last
summer of Karen Hughes, another senior Bush advisor, would leave the
ideological Rove with the upper hand among all Bush assistants.</TE>
<TE>   "The key balance around here has been between Karen and Karl
Rove," Card was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   A GOP lobbyist with ties to the White House said Rove's power
stemmed from Bush's readiness to listen to his advice and Card's
disinclination to tangle with him. The lobbyist used the words
"benign neglect" to characterize Card's approach to Rove.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran of the first Bush White House, who admires Rove's
political and policy acumen but has found himself at odds with him,
said that to some extent Rove can do little to avoid the sort of
problem he encountered Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a dangerous place in Washington. His profile is getting
high, not through self-promotion but because of his success and his
being an increasingly attractive target for a lot of people," the
Republican said. He added pointedly: "Bagging Karl Rove -- that would
be the biggest trophy in town."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the lobbyist nor the former aide in the administration of
the president's father would speak on the record, seeking to avoid
drawing Rove's fire.</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, Rove, who will turn 52 on Christmas Day, tries
to keep a low profile, granting few interviews to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, his effort to remain out of the public eye is
countered by factors that unavoidably draw attention to him: his
closeness to Bush, his success in engineering Bush's triumph in 2000
and his most recent achievement, choreographing Bush's hands-on role
in the 2002 congressional elections, which returned both houses of
Congress to GOP control.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic magazine Blueprint assessed the White House work in
the congressional campaign, described the process as "Rovery" and
came up with this definition for the new word in the political
lexicon: "The art of acting in a thoroughly partisan manner while
appearing to be above the political fray."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Texas Monthly magazine is preparing a profile of Rove's
work for Bush in Texas, and at least two biographies are in the
works.</TE>
<TE>   Rove is known for his attention to detail, in politics and policy.
The staff member in the previous Bush White House said admiringly
that Rove would know "the number of yard signs you need in Amarillo,"
Texas, as well as the details of pending legislative issues -- the
ins and outs of tort reform, for example.</TE>
<TE>   DiIulio returned to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania
in August 2001 after creating the office. It was intended to make it
easier for religious organizations and private charities to perform
some of the social welfare functions of government. Congress has yet
to pass legislation at the center of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In the Esquire interview, he said, "There is no precedent in any
modern White House for what is going on in this one: complete lack of
a policy apparatus."</TE>
<TE>   "What you've got is everything, and I mean everything, being run
by the political arm," he said, adding that Rove is "enormously
powerful, maybe the single most powerful person in the modern,
post-Hoover era ever to occupy a political advisor post near the Oval
Office."</TE>
<TE>   DiIulio's office said Monday that he would not be available to
comment on his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   But he issued two written statements.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said, the magazine story was "unjustly hard on Mr. Rove
and over-the-top complimentary to me, thereby creating a too-pat
contrast that is, I feel, most unfair to Mr. Rove." (His written
statement emphasized in boldface the final five words of the
sentence).</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the White House press secretary spoke up, DiIulio
issued a second statement, incorporating the words "groundless and
baseless."</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely apologize and I am deeply remorseful," he wrote.</TE>

<HD>Court Test for College Race Policy</HD>
<DH>Justices to rule on the constitutionality of affirmative
action in the admissions process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court announced Monday it will decide whether the
nation's colleges and universities can continue to use affirmative
action in choosing new students, marking the first time the court has
revisited the issue since the Bakke decision in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   The justices took up two appeals from white applicants who were
rejected by the University of Michigan and its law school, despite
their strong qualifications.</LD>
<LD>   If the high court were to outlaw the explicit use of race in
college admissions, the ruling could have broad impact at private
universities, such as USC and Stanford, as well as state colleges.</LD>
<TE>   Federal education law forbids race discrimination in colleges that
receive federal funds, and lawyers say discrimination that violates
the equal-protection standard also violates the federal education
law.</TE>
<TE>   "What they decide in this case will apply to private institutions
as well," said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American
Council on Education, the Washington lobbying group for higher
education.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the University of Michigan cases, Jennifer Gratz, a
white high school senior with a 3.8 grade-point average, was turned
away by the Ann Arbor campus in 1995. She blamed her rejection on the
preferences given to black and Latino applicants.</TE>
<TE>   She and another woman, Barbara Grutter, who was rejected by the
law school, became the lead plaintiffs in lawsuits that say "racial
preferences in student admissions" violate the Constitution's
guarantee of the equal protection of the laws.</TE>
<TE>   University officials admit they give a decided edge to minority
applicants, but they say their affirmative action policy is needed to
ensure racial diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is not the time to turn back the clock," said University of
Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman. "Race still matters in our
society." A ruling rejecting the use of affirmative action "could
result in the immediate resegregation of our nation's top colleges
and universities."</TE>
<TE>   Affirmative action has been under attack for more than a decade in
the courts and in states that use the ballot box to decide major
controversies.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in California and Washington approved measures that abolish
official race-based preferences in state programs, including the
universities. Meanwhile, federal courts in Texas and Georgia have
struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1989, the Supreme Court has rejected affirmative action in a
series of settings, but it has done so by 5-to-4 votes. For example,
the court said cities cannot set aside some of their public contracts
for black and Latino entrepreneurs. It also rejected race-based
preferences in federal contracts and struck down "racial
gerrymandering" by state legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   Four conservatives -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas --
have said repeatedly that officials may not use race as a
decision-making factor.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has joined them in all the key
rulings, has refused to go along with the clear, strict standard that
prohibits all use of race. She has said, for example, that officials
can favor black applicants to remedy clear, past discrimination
against blacks. In one such case, the court upheld hiring and
promotion quotas for black officers in the Alabama state police
because of the department's long history of blatant discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Connor has not said whether she would endorse the use of a
student's race as a "plus" factor in college admissions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., later to be O'Connor's
closest friend and mentor at the court, set forth the "plus" factor
standard in the case of Allan Bakke, a well-qualified white applicant
to the UC Davis Medical School. Bakke alleged in a lawsuit that he
was rejected because a preference was given to black and Latino
applicants. He won in a 5-4 decision that said the medical school had
maintained an illegal quota by reserving 16 of its 100 slots for
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's "plus" factor, laid out in a separate opinion, said that
colleges may not use quotas or treat black and white students
differently because of their race. However, admission officers can
take a student's race into account "in the interest of diversity,"
Powell wrote. The Powell standard in the Bakke case has remained the
law ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore M. Shaw, counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and a
former Michigan law professor, said the cases "represent the most
significant civil rights cases the Supreme Court will have decided in
the last quarter-century. This issue is nothing less than whether the
doors of opportunity remain open for students of color at highly
selective institutions."</TE>
<TE>   One expert for the University of Michigan testified that a
race-neutral admission policy would have reduced the percentage of
black and Latino students from nearly 14% to about 4%.</TE>
<TE>   High school students applying to the Ann Arbor campus are rated on
a 150-point scale. On this scale, 80 points are given for a
straight-A average, and 60 points for a B average. Only a maximum 12
points turn on the student's score on the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 10 points are awarded based on the quality of the high
school, up to eight points for taking a demanding course of study, 10
points for in-state residency, four points for an alumni
relationship, three points for an outstanding essay and up to five
points for personal achievement. Beyond that, the school awarded 20
points for applicants in an underrepresented racial or ethnic group.
This was limited to African Americans, Mexican Americans and Native
Americans, lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based Center for Individual Rights, which
represents the white students, made two arguments in its legal
challenge to the Michigan policy.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Bakke ruling allowing the use of race to achieve
"diversity" is no longer the law, the lawyers for the center said.
More recent high court rulings have implicitly overturned Powell's
view, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, even if schools can use a student's race as a plus factor,
the Michigan officials go too far, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "They use race as a super factor. If you get an extra 20 points,
that's the difference between an A average and a B average," said
Curt Levey, a center lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal, lawyers for Gratz said the university "employs,
formally and functionally, a race-based two-track admissions system."</TE>
<TE>   University officials said minority applicants automatically
receive the 20 points, but they add that white students also may
receive the same extra points if they come from an economically
strapped family or if they attended a predominantly minority high
school.</TE>
<TE>   This last year, 25,000 students applied for admission to the Ann
Arbor campus, and about half of them -- 12,315 -- were admitted. Of
these, 1,040 were black, 692 were Latino and 93 were Native
Americans. About 15% of those admitted were from underrepresented
minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   Gratz attended the University of Michigan at Dearborn and
graduated in 1999. Grutter did not go to law school after she was
rejected but would still like to do so, her attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Grutter vs. Bollinger and Gratz vs. Bollinger are to be argued in
late March.</TE>
<TE>   Lee C. Bollinger was president of the university when the suits
were filed.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Club Rift Opens Over Stance on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Environmental group threatens to disband Utah chapter for
its antiwar statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sierra Club is threatening to disband a Utah chapter whose
leaders are speaking out against the U.S. threat of invading Iraq,
openly defying a decision by the venerable environmental group to
avoid a formal stance on the war issue.</LD>
<LD>   The board members of the Sierra Club's 175-member Glen Canyon
chapter in southern Utah are challenging what they call a gag order
on antiwar opinions imposed by the executive board of the San
Francisco-based organization, the nation's oldest environmental
group.</LD>
<LD>   Although the club hasn't taken a poll, the Glen Canyon group says
its views mirror those of most of the 700,000 members and should be
reflected in the organization's official position on war with Iraq.
The Utah contingent believes that the Sierra Club should join with
other activists to strongly oppose the Bush administration's moves
toward a conflict with Iraq. They note that in 1981 the Sierra Club
adopted a resolution opposing war in general because of its
environmental consequences.</LD>
<TE>   ''War is not healthy for children and other living things,'' Dan
Kent, secretary of the Sierra Club's Glen Canyon Group, said in a
recent statement. ''It is the ultimate act of environmental
destruction.... For the board to compel our silence plays right into
Bush's mad world, where a nation of police, prisons, bombs, bunkers
is better than lowering oneself to diplomacy to save lives.''</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Club representatives say that contrary to those assertions,
the potential war with Iraq is controversial among its members, and
that is why no stance was taken. They contend that the so-called gag
order is really just an attempt to ensure that the Sierra Club speaks
with one voice and does not publicly divide into bickering factions
on important issues.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Sierra Club's 15-member ruling board came out in
support of stripping Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, but
declined to take a position for or against a war. The decision was
the result of a long, open and fully democratic process, according to
the board, and club members should now respect the leadership's
decision, even if some disagree with it.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the need for unity, Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive
director, has threatened to remove the Utah activists from their
regional ruling board and disband their group.</TE>
<TE>   ''Civil disobedience is an honorable tradition,'' he said in a
recent e-mail, ''but you can't continue serving as sheriff while
practicing it.''</TE>
<TE>   The dispute, reminiscent of a similar Sierra Club spat over
immigration policy a decade ago, illuminates the ideological fissures
that often divide the group's membership. The Glen Canyon board
members are part of a faction that contends that the Sierra Club
compromises far too often and has strayed from the uncompromising
activism of its founder, naturalist John Muir. Known as the John Muir
Sierrans, some of the faction's members have pushed for more
aggressive stands in recent years, such as a referendum to prevent
all commercial logging on public lands.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen former Sierra Club board members joined with the
activists in October and asked the board to pass a resolution urging
the United States to seek a peaceful compromise with Iraq. But some
members opposed taking an antiwar stand, considering it outside the
scope of the environmental group's mission, and some leaders
questioned claims that opposition to war among Sierra Club members
was widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Sierra Club leaders adopted a resolution stating that the
organization is ''concerned about the global dangers presented by
possible Iraqi aggression and about the dire environmental
consequences of war.'' The resolution concluded that the Sierra Club
''supports disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction,'' and
believes in disarmament inspections as a way to peacefully resolve
the dispute. That upset some activists, who argued that the
leadership should at least have polled members. What particularly
disturbed some activists, however, was another resolution that
attempted to ''clarify'' the Sierra Club's 1981 stand against war,
calling it a ''broad general policy framework'' that ''does not
authorize members, leaders, or club entities to take positions on
military conflicts.'' Supporters of a tough antiwar resolution
considered it a brute attempt to muzzle their views.</TE>
<TE>   ''The board action was extremely divisive,'' one of the Glen
Canyon board members, Patrick Diehl, said Monday. "I sincerely
believe that the majority agrees with our position. I think we are
expressing the general disagreement with the board's action.''</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he considered whether the antiwar position might lead to
criticism of the environmental group at a time when polls suggest
most Americans support war with Iraq, Diehl demurred.</TE>
<TE>   ''We realize that there is a risk that the Sierra Club will appear
unpatriotic,'' he said. ''But it's patriotic to prevent one's country
from doing something really stupid.''</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Club officials said privately that nothing is likely to
happen to the board members of the Utah group unless they force the
issue by ratcheting up their criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everyone in the Sierra Club is opinionated; that is why they
join, because they care passionately about the issues,'' said Sierra
Club spokesman Allen Mattison. "But there is only one Sierra Club,
and when the group comes up with a position, whether it is on logging
or factory farming, that is going to be the position the members have
to honor.''</TE>

<HD>Apology for Oregon Forced Sterilizations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Gov. John Kitzhaber formally apologized Monday for an old eugenics
law that led to the forced sterilization of hundreds of Oregonians.</LD>
<LD>   Girls in reform school, people in mental institutions and poor
women selected by welfare workers were among the more than 2,500
Oregonians subjected to sterilizations under a law that stood from
1917 to 1983.</LD>
<LD>   "To those who suffered, I say the people of Oregon are sorry,"
Kitzhaber said at a ceremony in his office. "Our hearts are heavy for
the pain you endured."</LD>
<TE>   He is the second governor to atone for state eugenics laws after
Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, who also erected a memorial in May to the
first woman sterilized under the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who crowded into Kitzhaber's office for Monday's
ceremony was Velma Hayes, 68, who was sterilized at age 15 while
living at the state-run Fairview Training Center, an institution for
the mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes called the state's acknowledgment of wrongdoing "long
overdue," but praised Kitzhaber's bid to make things right.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was satisfied. Ken Newman, 61, who said he was
given a vasectomy without his consent when he was a teenager living
at Fairview, said the governor's remarks don't erase what happened.
"I want more than an apology. I want to be compensated," he said.</TE>

<HD>Women's Sports Still Looking for an Audience</HD>
<DH>There are more female athletes than ever, but attendance
ebbs and flows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin and Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started in 1996, with the Olympics in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. basketball team, filled with modest, honest, talented and
hard-working women, easily won a gold medal while charming fans all
along the way.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, the U.S. women's softball team, led by Dot Richardson, a
charismatic orthopedic resident who had juggled team workouts with
medical school, won gold and drew crowds that jammed traffic on the
roads of Columbus, Ga.</LD>
<TE>   Women's sports, it seemed, were hitting their stride, and
investors believed the time was right to start professional leagues.
In the four years after the 1996 Games, four women's professional
leagues -- softball, soccer and two for basketball -- would launch in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened since is a series of mixed signals. While
women's participation in sports spikes annually, women's professional
leagues that haven't folded are struggling.</TE>
<TE>   WUSA, the women's professional soccer league, an offshoot from the
success of the last women's World Cup, had a 14% attendance drop
between years one and two. Even the WNBA, backed by the powerful and
popular NBA, has had little or no growth in either attendance or
television ratings in the last two seasons. Another basketball
circuit, the ABL, quit after two seasons. So, too, after four
seasons, did the professional softball league.</TE>
<TE>   That women's sports generally lag far behind established men's
games in attendance and TV ratings is certainly predictable. Men's
professional leagues in many cases weren't overnight sensations,
either, including the XFL, the football circuit that lasted only one
year despite millions spent on promotion and a network television
deal with NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're midstream in a major historical transformation,"
said Michael Messner, professor of sociology and gender studies at
USC and the author of "Taking the Field: Women, Men and Sports."</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 30 years, the athletic budgets for women's sports
have grown to millions of dollars. Taking that bigger historical
scope is important now as we sit here talking about low attendance
figures, sponsorship problems, marketing and promotion sliced into
pieces.... It's two steps forward, one step back."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the steps forward can be traced to Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972, which protects people in education
programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance from
discrimination based on sex. It requires equal distribution of
athletic aid and resources among men and women in high schools and
colleges. At the time it became federal law, one in 27 high school or
college-age girls competed for a school team. That ratio is now one
in 2.5.</TE>
<TE>   But even Title IX can't legislate viewership and attendance for
the more than 3 million female athletes in high school, college,
amateur and professional sports.</TE>
<TE>   The ebb and flow is, in many cases, dramatic:</TE>
<TE>   * In the summer of 1999, the women's World Cup-winning U.S. soccer
team toured the country, gathering fans and cachet as if they were
the Beatles. Scalpers prowled at a sold-out Rose Bowl, where the U.S.
defeated China in the Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, back at the Rose Bowl last month, only 6,911 sprinkled the
seats to watch the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup soccer finals and
third-place games, a World Cup-qualifying event.</TE>
<TE>   * Driven by the red-hot Williams sisters, Serena and Venus,
Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati, Martina Hingis and Monica
Seles, a core of top players as interesting and charismatic as they
are competitive, the Women's Tennis Assn. tour established attendance
records at 13 of its tournaments this year. Also, women's matches at
Grand Slam events have earned higher television ratings than the
men's during the past two years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a few weeks ago, there were afternoon crowds of fewer than
500 and evening crowds of barely 5,000 creating echoes at Staples
Center for a season-ending tournament featuring 16 of the world's
best women's players.</TE>
<TE>   * The Women's Final Four in college basketball was played before
record-setting crowds of more than 29,000 at the Alamodome last April
and the 28,210-seat Georgia Dome is already sold out for next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, while the UCLA men's basketball team spent about $3.8 million
and generated revenue of more than $8 million in the 2001-02 school
year, the Bruin women's team spent $1.2 million with revenue of
$171,100. At USC, the men's team spent $2.3 million and brought in
$3.1 million and the women spent $1.6 million and had revenue of
$27,458.</TE>
<TE>   Geno Auriemma, whose University of Connecticut women's basketball
team plays before huge crowds at home and on the road, had a one-word
answer -- "No" -- when asked whether women's sports such as
basketball, soccer and softball will ever draw crowds consistently
comparable to that of men's sports.</TE>
<TE>   But most experts say it's silly to forecast the future or compare
women's attendance and ratings to that of men.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is when we're compared to established men's sports
when ours are in their relative infancy," said Mary Jo Kane, director
of the Tucker Center for research on girls and women in sport at the
University of Minnesota. "If baseball attendance slips, no one ever
asks if it's in trouble for its survival. Poor attendance in our
sports calls into question if the team or the league will survive."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is a fundamental difference in the way men's and
women's professional leagues were formed. Most men's sports developed
from small leagues into larger organizations which, after they
reached considerable size, had increasingly grand playoff and
championship events. The women's leagues seem to have formed the
other way around: leagues spinning off from large, single events.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make a pro sports venture successful overnight," said
Donna Lopiano, head of the Women's Sports Foundation, an advocacy
group. "The killer problem in women's sports is the glut of sports on
television."</TE>
<TE>   Lopiano said the advent of a digital environment on television,
where everybody can have a channel, will be both a help and a proving
ground. "You create your own space, your own product and then you can
create your own promotional dollar investments in prime time," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Donlon, who was a top executive for Lifetime Sports when the
network signed an agreement to televise WNBA games, said it's a
mistake for anyone to focus solely on attendance or ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get a better rating by running a movie than you would be
airing women's sports," said Donlon, who is now vice president of
iVillage television, "but your audience composition -- more upscale,
younger -- is more desirable in sports, so it was a trade-off worth
making."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, according to a recent national study, most of the 50 million
women who avidly follow professional sports prefer to watch male
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by Scarborough Sports Marketing asked women if they were
"not at all interested," "somewhat or very interested" or "avidly
interested" in the NHL, NFL, NBA, WNBA, PGA, NASCAR, Major League
Baseball or pro soccer, both the MLS and WUSA.</TE>
<TE>   It showed that in the last four years the number of loyal female
major league baseball fans grew from 12% to 28%; women very
interested in the NFL went from 17% to 31%; female NASCAR fans who
are very interested in the sport went from 5% to 13%; and those very
interested in the NBA jumped from 11% to 19%. But women's interest in
the WNBA dropped, from 11% to 9%.</TE>
<TE>   The results were of no surprise to some. "You expect that as the
[female] fan numbers have grown, their interest will be more focused
on the mainstream sports," said Howard Goldberg, senior vice
president of Scarborough Sports Marketing. "What you'll find in the
future is that the sports in their infancy, like the WNBA and WUSA,
will have a chance to refine their product while their level of
expertise will increase as women evolve."</TE>
<TE>   Promoters, investors and coaches say that if women's professional
sports are to succeed they must be aggressively marketed and
promoted.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president and CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group,
which owns Staples Center, blamed the poor turnout for last month's
tennis event on a shortened and ineffective sales effort. Pam
Shriver, a television commentator and former U.S. Open finalist,
agreed. "A lot of people I know, friends who play tennis and love the
game, didn't know the significance of the tournament ... You have to
work hard here to get the word out."</TE>
<TE>   As for the tiny soccer crowds, they were likely the result of poor
timing. Women's soccer is traditionally supported by young female
soccer players, the Mia Hamm wannabes, and the CONCACAF Rose Bowl
games were played on a Sunday afternoon, and then on a Sunday night
in the rain and fog. There were similarly poor turnouts at Cal State
Fullerton and at Safeco Field in Seattle, too, for earlier round
games on weeknights. The one good crowd, of 21,522, come on a
Saturday night in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of tickets might have been another factor. Prices ranged
from $15-$40 and youths didn't get a discount.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors aside, experts have one other pointed suggestion for
women's sports: If sex appeal sells, use it.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Armato, commissioner of the Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals, said he bought the tour a year ago partly because of
the relatively untapped marketing power on its women's side.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't deny that beach volleyball can be a sexy sport without
being shameless," he said. "Because of that, there is so much
potential for us to build our sport very quickly. Look at tennis. A
lot is made of what Serena Williams wears, if she's wearing that
body-clinging cat suit. And then there's Anna Kournikova ...</TE>
<TE>   "The LPGA goes on and on about finding a beautiful player, but
they'd get killed if they ever put a golf club in the hands of a
woman in a bikini. Our players compete in bikinis and they are very
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Armato said, "Athletes are attractive and that helps sell
a sport. Men's or women's."</TE>
<TE>   One high-ranking women's sports executive, a man, said sex appeal
is an undeniable selling point of women's sports that some miss.</TE>
<TE>   "The WNBA doesn't have that," he said. "They've chosen to model
their league as if it's a men's league being played by women, as if
they've just swapped jerseys. The public doesn't want women athletes
trying to be like men. They aren't as good as men."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Connecticut basketball Coach Auriemma said, it is up
to women's leagues to find a marketing niche -- and be ready for a
long haul.</TE>
<TE>   "Will we sell out every arena for a World Cup? Yeah," he said.
"Because we sell national pride, it's international, it's a
happening. A UCLA men's basketball game is a happening. A USC
football game is a happening. If you put together a league, you gotta
give people a reason to come. Tell me why. And it's not enough to say
you have the best players in the world. That's not good enough
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new day. You've gotta have dynamite teams, dynamite
personalities and you gotta work at it. The men didn't just open the
doors to 20,000-seat arenas 100 years ago and people poured in. You
gotta build things and that takes hard work and patience."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Love, founder and editor of Real Sports, a magazine devoted to
women's sports and athletes, said too many investors in women's teams
and publications have misjudged what should be their core audience.</TE>
<TE>   She invested her own money to start up Real Sports -- and has
watched larger operations funded by Conde Nast and Sports Illustrated
fold. Those competing publications overestimated their market, Love
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Conde Nast sought a circulation of 700,000 and SI for
Women wanted 500,000, Love's magazine projected about 250,000.
"That's a sizable market," she said. "It's not a home run market. But
do we ignore that market?"</TE>
<TE>   She said women's professional leagues would be wise to use the
same tactic. Average attendance of 9,000-10,000 at a WNBA game might
not make for an immediate windfall, but "if marketed correctly, those
are reasonable numbers, long term, to grow a market from," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I use the scene in the movie 'Beautiful Mind' when John Nash is
in the bar with his friends and everybody wants to go after the
blond," Love added.</TE>
<TE>   "Nash tried to explain that if everybody went for the blond,
everybody loses. Go for the woman who is the friend, then everybody
wins. There seems to be this need to hit an immediate home run
instead of just getting on base.</TE>
<TE>   "Viewing women's sports as the blond or the home run or it's not a
success is a guarantee of failure. You don't make social change
overnight."</TE>

<HD>Hearing Waived in Child Abduction</HD>
<DH>Clearing way for trial, defense in Samantha Runnion murder
case forgoes preliminary hearing after the judge denies request for
delay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake Elsinore man agreed Monday to give up his right to a court
hearing that would have established whether there is enough evidence
to bring him to trial in the abduction and slaying of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro "Alex" Avila, 27, waived his preliminary hearing after
his defense team failed to convince Orange County Superior Court
Judge Francisco P. Briseno that they needed more time to review DNA
evidence that allegedly links him to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to skip the proceeding, which the defense did not
explain in court or afterward, sets the stage for the trial to begin.</LD>
<TE>   Avila has pleaded not guilty to one count of kidnapping, two
counts of lewd acts on a child under 14 and one count of murder. A
special-circumstances filing along with those charges can bring the
death penalty, which prosecutors have said they will seek.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton home. Her body was found the next day along a mountain
road near Lake Elsinore, in Riverside County. The case was one of at
least four child kidnappings this year to draw nationwide attention.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that DNA evidence, credit card and cell phone
records, tire tracks and footprints link Avila to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   They have provided the defense with more than 11,000 pages of
documents and other records to review.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, assistant public defender Phil Zalewski said he
was not comfortable going forward with the information that he and
DNA experts had gathered so far because even though the scientific
analysis was complete, further interpretations were necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But Briseno said there was insufficient evidence to delay the
preliminary hearing. He noted that he had previously granted the
defense more time to prepare for the hearing.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Beach, Festival of Arts OK 40-Year Deal to Fund
Improvements</HD>
<DH>New lease, expected to be signed tonight, ensures the city
will host the event. Stage, community theater to get face lifts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laguna Beach City Council is expected to sign a 40-year lease
tonight with the Festival of Arts, formally ending years of
negotiations during which organizers threatened to move the popular
summer event from the canyon compound it has occupied since 1932.</LD>
<LD>   The lease, the product of six years of negotiation, guarantees
that 6% of the revenue generated by the festival will be spent on
capital improvements, said Mayor Wayne Baglin.</LD>
<LD>   The money is expected to pay for new buildings for the production
staff, a storm drain to prevent flooding and a retaining wall to
protect the Laguna Canyon site from landslides.</LD>
<TE>   Other improvements expected to be funded include remodeling the
stage area, upgrading the sound system, and improving or rebuilding
the community theater.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a 40-year lease between the two entities,"
said Bruce Rasner, president of the festival board and part of the
negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have the opportunity to avoid any future impasses for [40
years] and have the ability to finance major redevelopment of the
grounds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach has hosted the eight-week exhibition of more than 150
regional artists since 1932.</TE>
<TE>   Festival directors said they were close to signing the lease in
August, but Baglin said there were nagging details -- such as what
qualified as a capital expense -- that had to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new lease, the festival will pay Laguna Beach $200,000 a
year to rent the property, considerably less than the $600,000 yearly
it had been paying. It was those rent checks that prompted the
festival board to search for a new site in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   As negotiations deteriorated, festival directors threatened to
move the event to San Clemente. Those directors were later recalled
and replaced.</TE>
<TE>   A new board of directors ran into its own share of frustrations
with the city, but the two sides have met regularly since last year.
All nine members of the festival board and the City Council will sign
the lease at tonight's council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin said he will ask that the council agenda be adjusted so
that the festival lease is signed before the council is reorganized
with a new mayor and new council member.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the council that worked so hard to put it into place
should be the council that votes on it," Baglin said.</TE>

<HD>Berkeley Takes Small Steps for Traffic Safety</HD>
<DH>The City Council has purchased 3,000 yellow flags and
placed them at busy intersections, but many pedestrians still cross
empty-handed.</DH>

<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>An unusual pedestrian safety program here boasts the kind of civic
activism that Berkeley is known for, but it has received less than a
banner response from residents.</LD>
<LD>   Last December, the City Council bought 3,000 6-by-8-inch flags and
installed them, a few at a time, in canisters at four busy
intersections. Council members hoped that, as pedestrians prepared to
cross the street, they would pick up a flag and wave it to alert
approaching drivers. Once safely on the other side, they would return
the flag to another canister.</LD>
<LD>   The program got off to a rocky start: Two days after the flags
were unfurled, a Jeep struck and injured a woman carrying one of the
orange pennants as she crossed the street. Then, by summer, all the
flags had disappeared, presumably stolen.</LD>
<TE>   But Berkeley officials refused to give up. Last month, the council
bought another 3,000 flags, placed them at the same four locations,
and vowed to expand the program in coming weeks to three more
intersections, with and without stoplights, where many cars and
pedestrians converge.</TE>
<TE>   These flags are yellow, to keep them from being confused with
construction zone signage.</TE>
<TE>   "This time it won't be so new, so hopefully we won't see people
stealing them," said Councilwoman Polly Armstrong, who proposed the
program after hearing a friend rave about a similar one in Salt Lake
City. The flag-usage rate there: 14%, according to a formal study.
"But I always wonder if there weren't some grown-ups who stole the
flags to sabotage the [Berkeley] program," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Chuck Betz, an employee at a local cooperative bicycle
shop, crossed the road without one of the new flags. "I used one once
for the novelty of it," he said, "but that wore off quickly." Betz
said the flag concept emerged after a concrete-mixing truck killed a
woman at the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, a man in a brown fedora with a waist-length
blond ponytail jaywalked across the intersection. Half-running,
half-darting, he didn't bother with the flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're the biggest joke we've ever seen. They'll last
another week," said Tom Bruce, a Berkeley resident and retiree. "If
we want to do something about protecting pedestrians, we ought to
enforce traffic laws, like the one I just violated."</TE>
<TE>   At another intersection supplied with flags, a woman with a black
backpack attached to her wheelchair motored across on a recent
afternoon without a flag.</TE>
<TE>   A Berkeley resident, Flavio DaSilva, walked the crosswalk three
times empty-handed. When a reporter asked why, he responded: "Oh, is
that what they're for?" When told the city had spent more than $6,000
on them, the student at the University of Creation Spirituality shook
his head and said, "That's crazy. It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he approves of other city actions, such as the sign it
installed down the road telling people they have entered the city:
"Nuclear Free Zone, established by City of Berkeley ordinance, 1986."</TE>
<TE>   An hour and a half later, the flags found some use at last. Two
young girls plucked some from a canister and slowly crossed the
street, each holding a mother's hand. The flags' yellow hue blended
with the double yellow line in the center of the road and a spray of
sunflowers at a nearby florist's booth.</TE>
<TE>   Safely on the other side, Wendy Boals, hugging her daughter
Morgan, said, "It makes them more aware of cars and safety. It makes
you feel very entitled to cross the street."</TE>
<TE>   Boals estimated that she has used the flags more than 30 times.</TE>
<TE>   "They said these are a lot cheaper. But they've only been lasting
how long, six months?"</TE>

<HD>Families Send Children Back Home for Traditional Education</HD>
<DH>Immigrants say it's worth the sacrifice in time and money
for their youngsters to learn the culture and values of Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHULA VISTA</DL>
<LD>Irma Padres has seen how quickly Mexican children can adapt to life
in America, refusing to speak Spanish and resisting visits with
grandparents across the border.</LD>
<LD>   She did not want that to happen to her three children when the
family moved from Tijuana to this San Diego suburb four years ago. So
every morning, Padres gets up at 5:30 to drive her children over the
border -- to school in Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   The Padreses are among dozens of families bucking the custom that
for generations has led most immigrants to seek out American schools,
along with jobs, in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Although some of her neighbors north of the border call her crazy,
Padres, like others here, is willing to suffer early mornings and
long days carpooling so her children can be taught the religion,
culture and values that she feels they would not get in American
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and school officials estimate that more than 100 students
make the daily commute from their homes in the United States to a
handful of private Tijuana schools -- such as Colegio La Paz and
Instituto Cumbres.</TE>
<TE>   The families will not soon reverse the more common tradition of
Mexican families seeking better schools in the United States. But
these committed parents believe they have the best of both worlds --
their children learn in Tijuana while living in the quieter, safer
suburbs of San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "When I cross the border into Tijuana, it's hurry, hurry," Padres
said. "Everybody is honking. When I cross the border into San Diego,
oh my God, this is heaven."</TE>
<TE>   To cut down on driving time, the families create carpools and
apply for electronic passes that allow them to speed through a
special lane at the border crossing in San Ysidro, when they pass
back into the United States. But Padres said there are still some
days when she spends hours in the car, making two or three round
trips to take her children to after-school activities or parties in
Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "By Friday, I'm crawling," said Padres, who takes care of her
children full time while her husband works as an architect in Tijuana
and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping her children in the private Mexican school requires
discipline -- waking them each day by 6 a.m. and getting them
dressed, fed and out the door with backpacks by 6:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   One morning last month, they followed the daily schedule to the
minute. There was just one glitch, a missing necktie for 14-year-old
Francisco, which Padres quickly remedied by borrowing one from her
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Then the family piled into the minivan, made one stop to pick up
another cross-border commuter, 11-year-old Georgina Pinos, and drove
south into Mexico. They arrived just after 7 a.m., and the children
headed to their classrooms at Colegio La Paz, a Catholic school that
has 900 students from preschool through 11th grade.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Padres children said they would miss their friends
in Mexico, they would prefer to attend American schools. Francisco,
who spends his free time playing his electric guitar, said he hates
waking up when it's still dark and wants the extra month of summer
vacation that his friends in San Diego have.</TE>
<TE>   His 11-year-old sister, Barbara, whose shelves are decorated with
pictures of Britney Spears and statues of angels, said she wishes she
were in school in San Diego so she could carry lip gloss and a
cellular phone in her backpack -- both banned at Colegio La Paz.</TE>
<TE>   But Padres said the commitment to the school is working -- the
children are learning English but are still keeping up their Spanish.
And they see their relatives in Tijuana regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Colegio La Paz, founded by nuns, sits above Tijuana on a hill,
where streets are quiet except for the morning and afternoon rush of
hundreds of children. Many of them represent the second or third
generation in their family to attend the school, which is three
stories tall and built around a central courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, the students watched an assembly to
commemorate the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. The girls,
wearing black pleated skirts, white button-down shirts and checkered
jackets, and the boys, dressed in dark coats and ties, sang the
national anthem and listened to speeches about Mexico's wartime
heroes. When one group of ninth-grade boys seated on the benches
started to fidget, they were quickly reprimanded.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Perez Lopez, a nun who is principal of the high school, said
she believes the spirituality, discipline and the unity of the campus
attract families from both sides of the border. "Even though we have
a lot of kids, we know each one," she said. "This is a family at
Colegio La Paz."</TE>
<TE>   The school also pushes its students -- sons and daughters of
entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors -- to excel past their counterparts
in Tijuana's public schools, Perez said. "Our students have to want
to succeed," Perez said. "A school with lazy kids is a club, where
they play, talk and eat. This is not a club."</TE>
<TE>   For Ruben and Minerva Padilla, who live in Chula Vista, the
decision to send their children to the Colegio La Paz was based on
academics and tradition. Minerva Padilla and her six siblings
attended the school, and now most of their children are students.
"There is something about Colegio La Paz," she said. "It creeps into
you. [The nuns] enforce a love of country and a love of the school."</TE>
<TE>   Four of the five Padilla children have donned the Colegio La Paz
uniforms, with the eldest now a student at UC Riverside. The youngest
Padilla is not even 2 years old yet, but his parents said he will
follow the path of his older brothers and sisters.</TE>
<TE>   The commitment to Colegio La Paz has come at a cost for the
Padilla family -- nearly $200 a month in tuition per child, in
addition to several hundred more each year in insurance, uniforms and
books.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruben Padilla, who works in sales at an automotive accessory
company, said the tradition and sense of belonging at the school
cannot be replaced. Minerva Padilla said she remembers wearing those
same uniforms, sitting on those same benches and listening to the
same lectures on morals from the nuns that her children now hear.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't pay that much attention then," she said. "But when you
get out in the real world, it comes back to you."</TE>

<HD>Request to Delay Trial of Date-Rape Suspect Is Denied</HD>
<DH>Judge says attorneys for cosmetics heir have had ample time
to prepare. But the defense says prosecutors have not turned over
evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of trial, attorneys for millionaire date-rape suspect
Andrew Luster urged a judge Monday to delay jury selection and allow
them additional time to mount a defense.</LD>
<LD>   But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley denied the
request, saying that defense lawyers have had months to prepare. He
intends to start jury selection this morning.</LD>
<LD>   Luster's lawyers have complained for months that prosecutors are
concealing evidence while forcing them to trial.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, they asked Riley to halt the proceedings and give
them at least eight more weeks to investigate alleged misconduct by
police and prosecutors. Riley denied the request, and the defense
asked an appellate court to intervene. The 2nd District Court of
Appeal denied the request last week.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Los Angeles attorney Kiana Sloan-Hillier told Riley she
now intends to take the request to the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are being forced to go ahead with our hands tied behind our
back," she said. "It is really not fair to the defense."</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the 38-year-old great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max
Factor, is accused of raping three women after rendering them
unconscious with the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, known as
GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported
being drugged at a downtown Santa Barbara bar and raped at his Mussel
Shoals beach house. During a search of Luster's home, detectives
found videotapes of him engaging in sex acts with two other women,
allegedly while they were unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend that Luster has been framed by the Ventura
County sheriff and district attorney. They say the tapes were altered
and witnesses coached to lie.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan-Hillier said that delays in the case can be attributed to
the refusal of prosecutors to turn over tapes, photographs and other
evidence. She said that the defense only recently obtained a copy of
a taped police interview with another woman who suspects she was
drugged by Luster.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, here we are on the eve of trial, caught unprepared,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold said defense attorneys have had
access to the disputed evidence for more than a year and are
stalling.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-and-a-half years this case has been in the system," Wold
said. "The problem is, they want to set their own pace."</TE>
<TE>   Luster's attorneys have filed a motion to recuse the Ventura
County district attorney's office. But Sloan-Hillier, who appeared on
behalf of lead defense attorney Roger Jon Diamond, said she was not
prepared to argue the motion. The matter was postponed.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Suggests Moving Some LAPD Functions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Monday asked a panel working on
the replacement of LAPD headquarters to consider moving some
operations to the San Fernando Valley or other areas away from
downtown.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the benefits that came out of the secession movement is
that it raised our awareness about how city government is perceived
-- as far off and unreachable," Hahn wrote in a memo to the city's
Municipal Facilities Committee.</LD>
<LD>   "Therefore, as you look at possible locations for a replacement
Parker Center building, I would like you to seriously consider which
functions could possibly be located in existing commercial space in
the Valley or other appropriate areas of the city."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said units that should be considered for possible
decentralization include the Robbery-Homicide Division, burglary and
financial crimes detectives, juvenile services and organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   He also identified vice, narcotics and anti-terrorist units,
community affairs officers and Police Commission staff members who
issue bingo and alarm permits.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities committee agreed Monday to ask its leasing agents,
engineers and Los Angeles Police Department officials to report back
in two weeks on possible moves.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 report commissioned by the city urged that Parker Center be
demolished and replaced, rather than retrofitted with fire alarms and
sprinklers, seismic safety features, a new roof and new floors.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by delays, the Police Commission voted last week to set
a goal of moving the 1,200 employees out of Parker Center in as
little as 90 days because the building is a safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Philip Tondreault of the city General Services
Department told the Municipal Facilities Committee that it would take
at least 10 months -- and possibly much longer -- to move employees
out of the building into leased space, because extensive
communications systems would have to be transferred.</TE>
<TE>   There is a chance some functions in Parker Center could be moved
to the Valley, but the idea would require study and planning,
according to LAPD spokesman John Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that some units that used to be in Parker Center,
including internal affairs and rape detectives, have been partially
moved to the Valley already.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's proposal was welcomed by Richard Katz, chairman of the
Valley Independence Committee, a group that pushed unsuccessfully for
passage of a Valley secession measure Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea," Katz said. "It would make it easier to get
the Valley crime issues addressed. Some people might see this as
symbolic, but I see it as a commitment to the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn campaigned hard against secession, asking Valley voters to
give him and the City Council a chance to bring government closer to
the Valley and other neighborhoods far from downtown.</TE>
<TE>   In his memo Monday, Hahn said some functions will have to stay
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize that there may be both advantages and disadvantages
to 'splitting' the Parker Center functions into two locations," Hahn
said. "However, by genuinely considering this option, it will also
show our continued commitment to all parts of the city."</TE>

<LD>Santa Ana Unified School District and the city of Tustin agreed
Monday to postpone their latest court showdown over the closed Tustin
Marine base to study a new compromise offer from the city, attorneys
for the school district said.</LD>
<LD>   Last May, Tustin agreed to pay Santa Ana Unified $60 million for
the latter's claim to land in the closed base.</LD>
<LD>   In dispute is how Tustin will guarantee payment. The school
district wants a letter of credit; Tustin is seeking a less costly
alternative. Both parties are due back in court Dec. 17.</LD>

<LD>Economic turmoil and new air-security measures after Sept. 11 have
forced officials to scale back plans for a $1.4-billion expansion of
Oakland International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Subject to Port Commission approval, the smaller project's
$425-million cost is split between a new seven-story, 6,000-slot
parking garage and an expansion of Terminal 2.</LD>
<LD>   The work, though less ambitious than original plans, is intended
to restore convenience and comfort to the airport by early 2006,
officials said.</LD>

<HD>Jury Deadlocks on Penalty for Deputy's Killer</HD>
<DH>Judge declares a mistrial after an 11-1 standoff in the
Orange County case. Most favored life, not execution, because of
defendant's delusions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Monday declared a mistrial in the case of a Lake Forest
man convicted of killing a sheriff's deputy, with 11 of the 12 jurors
concluding that he should get life in prison instead of the death
penalty.</LD>
<LD>   The panel declared itself deadlocked after seven hours of what one
juror described as emotional and at times angry deliberations. Most
panelists said they favor life in prison without parole because they
considered the defendant, Maurice Steskal, mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   The same jury last month convicted Steskal of first-degree murder
in the death of Brad Riches, who became the first Orange County
deputy sheriff to be slain in the line of duty since 1958.</LD>
<TE>   The judge scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine whether the
penalty phase should be retried. Juror Lee Jarvis, 63, of Fullerton
said several shouting matches broke out during the deliberations,
mostly when those in the majority tried to persuade the lone holdout
to change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people were of the opinion that this person who wanted the
death sentence had a preconceived idea that any person who kills a
police officer ... deserves the death penalty," Jarvis said. "We were
asked to set those kind of feelings aside."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis said he gives the lone holdout credit for sticking to his
beliefs despite the pressure from the rest of the panel.</TE>
<TE>   "We were also asked to vote our conscience. I can't fault him for
that. I'm sure it was a struggle for him, when you have 11 people
trying to persuade you to vote the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis said the majority was swayed by testimony that Steskal
suffered from long-standing mental problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This person was delusional for a long time prior to the event,"
Jarvis said. "It started in early childhood. He had trouble in
kindergarten and it stuck with him forever."</TE>
<TE>   Steskal was diagnosed with severe paranoia, and his history of
mental illness became central to his defense. His attorneys said he
was haunted by an irrational and delusional fear of authority
figures. That's why he carried a rifle and what made him pull the
trigger, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Mark Davis told jurors that Steskal was
physically and emotionally abused as a child</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not argue that his client was not guilty by reason of
insanity. Instead, he had asked the jury to find his client guilty of
voluntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis pointed out that the jury had wholeheartedly rejected that
idea in its earlier deliberations, voting unanimously "in real short
order" that Steskal was guilty of first-degree murder. "He killed
him. We knew it. There was no question in anyone's mind about that."</TE>
<TE>   Steskal, 43, entered a 7-Eleven store in Lake Forest early on June
12, 1999, toting an assault rifle. He told the salesclerk not to
worry, that he was not going to rob the store but intended to use the
weapon to protect himself from the law.</TE>
<TE>   Steskal, an unemployed laborer who lived near the convenience
store, bought a pack of cigarettes and walked out as Riches was
arriving. He emptied the gun's magazine into the patrol car, firing
30 rounds that tore through the deputy's bulletproof vest,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Riches, who was on routine patrol, managed to make one radio call
before the hail of gunfire began. Authorities identified Steskal with
help from a surveillance tape at the store. They arrested him that
day in his car, finding 30- and 100-round magazines in the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent, the lead
prosecutor, characterized Riches as a "hero cop" and Steskal as a
coldblooded killer, "pure and simple," who killed the deputy because
he despised law enforcement officers.</TE>

<HD>Text of Letter From California Bishops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>December 8, 2002</LD>
<LD>   Dear Brothers and Sisters,</LD>
<LD>   We the bishops of California write to advise you of a major
development related to the issue of sexual abuse, a matter which has
so deeply affected us all during this past year. Last June, the
California Legislature took the unprecedented step of changing the
statute of limitations applicable to claims for sexual abuse. For the
duration of year 2003, this law allows people to file lawsuits
against dioceses and California employers based upon claims that
arose many decades ago. Some of the lawsuits may involve the revival
of already settled cases and some may involve alleged perpetrators
and witnesses long since dead. Under those circumstances, it will be
difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the truth. The ability to
conduct a fair and vigorous search for the truth has been part of the
very foundation of our American system of justice for more than two
centuries.</LD>
<TE>   We anticipate that new lawsuits, some involving very old
allegations, will be filed against dioceses in California. We bishops
stand ready to respond to legitimate claims by victims of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church has been falsely portrayed as a large
corporation with "deep pockets." In reality, the vast majority of
Catholic assets belong to the people of our parishes, schools,
charities, and other institutions. They are not devoted to the
accumulation of wealth but to education, worship, and sacraments: to
the poor and other works of charity. With God's help, the church must
continue to respond to the needs of the victims of abuse, and
maintain the vital spiritual, educational and social services
provided to the Catholic community and to our society at large.</TE>
<TE>   During the past year, the Bishops in the United States enacted a
national Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People and
related "Norms" that will have the force of Church law. These
decisions strengthen and add to policies that have been in place in
the dioceses in California for many years. They include the following
provisions:</TE>
<TE>   * To assist and support victims of sexual abuse;</TE>
<TE>   * To work with parishes to maintain and provide a safe environment
for children and young people;</TE>
<TE>   * To report allegations of sexual abuse against minors and to
cooperate with civil authorities;</TE>
<TE>   * To engage lay-majority review boards to assist in implementing
our sexual abuse policies;</TE>
<TE>   * To remove sexual abusers permanently from ministry.</TE>
<TE>   In this difficult time we reiterate our commitment to a safe
environment for children and youth in the Catholic Church. We offer
again our apologies to the victims of sexual abuse by clergy and we
promise our prayers and ongoing support. We commit ourselves to keep
you, the faithful, fully informed on these matters.</TE>

<LD>Dog show -- The cover story in the Nov. 24 TV Times and a story in
last Tuesday's Calendar mistakenly said that NBC's telecast of the
National Dog Show on Thanksgiving Day marked the first time a dog
show had been shown on one of the major broadcast networks. It
wasn't.</LD>

<HD>Rising USC Joins BCS-tablishment</HD>
<DH>Trojans move up to No. 4 in bowl championship series and
are positioned for a major bowl bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC completed 32 passes against Notre Dame on Saturday, but those
were all flanker screens compared to the pass the Trojans made
Monday, when they zoomed by Iowa into the all-important No. 4 spot in
the bowl championship series standings.</LD>
<LD>   If USC can maintain its position through Sunday's final rankings,
it will under BCS rules be guaranteed a $13-million at-large bowl
berth.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans, who trailed idle Iowa by .94 last week, now lead the
Hawkeyes by .71 with both schools having concluded their regular
seasons.</LD>
<TE>   It appears the only way USC could lose this advantage would be for
Miami to lose to Virginia Tech next weekend and drop between Iowa and
USC in the media and coaches' polls, which could provide Iowa the
poll average point it needs to reclaim the No. 4 spot.</TE>
<TE>   USC was able to make up ground by improving its computer average
by 2.33 points, from 5.33 to 3.00, while Iowa made up only 1.66 in
the category. The Trojans also gained a half-point in the poll
average and another .28 when Iowa's strength of schedule fell from
40th to 47th.</TE>
<TE>   Miami remained No. 1 in the BCS with 3.53 points followed by Ohio
State at 4.01, Georgia at 9.03, USC at 9.84 and Iowa at 10.55. Notre
Dame fell three BCS spots to No. 10, but the Irish will be
BCS-eligible if they finish in the top 12.</TE>
<TE>   USC's leapfrog move over Iowa, however, potentially throws the BCS
into a contentious showdown between the Rose and Orange bowls and
could force the Rose Bowl to reassess its relationship with the
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, which for 55 straight years hosted a matchup of
Pacific Coast and Big Ten schools, is miffed that the Orange Bowl
might take 11-1 Iowa and leave the Rose with a potential rematch of
USC vs. Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Rose Bowl does not get Iowa?</TE>
<TE>   "We would be severely disappointed," Rose Bowl Chief Executive
Mitch Dorger said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA victory over Washington State would solve the problem
because it would move USC from an at-large berth into the Rose Bowl
as outright Pac-10 champion.</TE>
<TE>   In that scenario, the Orange Bowl, which gets the first BCS pick
if it loses No. 1 Miami to the Fiesta Bowl, might be inclined to take
Notre Dame and let Iowa go to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But if Washington State wins Saturday to earn the Rose Bowl berth,
it forces one of the other three BCS bowls -- Orange, Sugar or Rose
-- to take USC.</TE>
<TE>   In that situation, the Orange Bowl would have to choose among USC,
Iowa or Notre Dame. Since filling seats is critical to the bowl, that
choice would likely be narrowed to Notre Dame or Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl could not, in good conscience, take two-loss Notre
Dame over Iowa because it would knock Iowa out of a BCS game
(Remember, USC has the other guaranteed spot).</TE>
<TE>   So, logic says the Orange Bowl would take Iowa to protect itself
financially and let Notre Dame fall all the way to the Gator Bowl to
the tune of a $11.5-million bowl pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   And that would leave the Rose Bowl with steam coming out of its
ears.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl entered the alliance to ensure that the No. 1 and
No. 2 schools could meet in a national title game, which it would
host every four years, but did not envision being stripped of its
traditional Pac-10/Big Ten pairing in other seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this year, the Rose Bowl can't get Ohio State because the
Buckeyes are playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title and
may also lose out on Iowa, the nation's third-ranked school.</TE>
<TE>   "It would clearly not be what we signed up for, and it would
clearly be a factor in future considerations," Dorger said of the
Rose Bowl's relationship with the BCS. "But I can't say that it would
alter anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is contracted with the BCS through the 2005 season,
and will host the 2006 title game.</TE>
<TE>   After that, who knows?</TE>
<TE>   The potential of losing Iowa has the Rose Bowl perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different than we expected," Dorger said. "We expected
essentially a national championship game and three years of normalcy.
We recognize that there was always that possibility, but there was
always the unspoken expectation that the tradition could still
continue in some shape."</TE>
<TE>   How's this for tradition:</TE>
<TE>   If push comes to shove, the Rose Bowl may have to take USC with
its at-large pick and match it against Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect became more of a reality when Oklahoma lost to
Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the Washington State beats UCLA scenario, the Rose Bowl
may be left with a choice among USC, four-loss Florida State,
three-loss Colorado or two-loss Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Before it lost, Oklahoma at 12-1 would have been an attractive
option to pair against Washington State in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Dorger says the Rose Bowl does not want a USC-Washington State
rematch, but that may be better than the alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unprecedented in the BCS and probably unprecedented
in the Rose Bowl to have two teams from the same conference," Dorger
said. "But it would certainly be something we'd have to look at and
compare. It is clearly a technical option and something we would have
to look at."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which Washington State,
which defeated USC this season, would relish a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly isn't the most desirable option," Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen said. "But the Rose Bowl is in a real
difficult position."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Delaney, the Big Ten commissioner, told the Chicago Tribune
that the potential of losing Iowa to the Orange Bowl was a risk when
the Rose Bowl, Big Ten and Pac-10 agreed to join the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make a deal, you make a deal," Delaney said.</TE>
<TE>   Delaney said he'll be happy as long as Iowa goes to a major bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be in than out," he said.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   BCS Rankings</TE>
<TE>   The bowl championship series formula used to ultimately determine
the Nos. 1 and 2 teams that will play for the national championship
at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3. Rankings are for games through Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EXPLANATION KEY</TE>
<TE>   Poll Avg.--The average of The Associated Press media poll (AP) and
USA Today-ESPN coaches poll (U-E). Others receiving votes are
calculated in order received.</TE>
<TE>   Computer (Comp) Avg.--The average of Anderson &amp; Hester (AH),
Richard Billingsley (RB), Colley Matrix (CM), Kenneth Massey (WM),
David Rothman (DR), Jeff Sagarin (JS), and the Peter Wolfe (PW)
computer rankings. The computer component will be determined by
averaging six of the rankings. The lowest will be disregarded.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule Rank--Rank of schedule strength (Strgh) compared to other
Division I-A teams divided by 25. This component is calculated by
determining the cumulative won/loss records of the team's opponent
(66.6 percent) and the cumulative won/loss records of the team's
opponent's opponents (33.3 percent).</TE>
<TE>   Losses--One point for each loss (L) during the season.</TE>
<TE>   Quality Win Component--The quality win component (QWin) will
reward to varying degrees teams that defeat opponents ranked among
the top 10 in the weekly standings. The bonus point scale will range
from a high of 1.0 points for a win over the top ranked team to a low
of 0.1 for a victory over the 10th-ranked BCS team. The final BCS
standings will determine final quality win points. If a team
registers a victory over a team more than once during the regular
season quality win points will be awarded just once. Quality win
points are deducted from the team's total of poll average, computer
average, schedule rank and losses.</TE>
<TE>   Total--Total BCS points, by adding poll average, computer average
and schedule ranking, plus one point for each loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pick Six Plus Two</TE>
<TE>   There are places for eight teams in the four BCS bowl games. Six
of those spots are reserved for the champions of the six BCS
conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, Pac-10, SEC), regardless
of their place in the BCS standings. The teams that finish No. 1 and
No. 2 in the BCS will play in the championship game, which rotates
among the BCS bowl games. This year, the Fiesta Bowl will play host
to the title game. Besides the six conference champions, two at-large
teams are selected. The at-large teams must come from different
conferences, unless the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the BCS are from the
same conference.</TE>
<TE>   At-large teams are selected in the following ways (in order of
preference):</TE>
<TE>   * Finish first or second in the BCS rankings.</TE>
<TE>   * Finish in the top six of the BCS standings as an independent
team or as champion of a non-BCS conference. If a team other than
Notre Dame qualifies in this manner, the Irish would also
automatically qualify for the second at-large spot if they win nine
games or finish in the top 10 in the BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   * Be the highest-rated at-large team remaining and finish either
third or fourth in the BCS rankings. Only one team can automatically
qualify under this provision.</TE>

<LD>A favorite thing for columnists to do around the Thanksgiving holiday
is name a "turkey of the year."</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune nominated soccer
star Rivaldo. Here's why:</LD>
<LD>   "The Brazilian set an example for other soccer fakers to follow
throughout last summer's World Cup. A ball was fired after the
whistle and struck Rivaldo in the leg. He grabbed his head and went
down as though he had been shot in the face by a bazooka. He was
cited by FIFA for what was termed 'disgraceful overreaction.'</LD>
<TE>   "And here's the good part: Rivaldo did this against Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the all-time leading scorer in women's college
basketball?</TE>
<TE>   Just a humble guy: Kobe Bryant, in SLAM magazine, says this about
public perception that he is arrogant:</TE>
<TE>   "I work really, really hard at what I do. I don't think people
know that. They don't know I'm putting in eight hours of work a
day.... You know, I'm not a cocky person. I believe in what I'm
capable of doing, but I'm not cocky."</TE>
<TE>   Long way from Texas: "The Junction Boys," an original movie that
will be shown on ESPN Dec. 14, will portray the story of 35 young men
who survived Bear Bryant's harrowing 1954 Texas A&amp;M football training
camp in desolate, drought-ridden Junction, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But the ESPN-produced movie was not shot in Texas. Because of
budgetary concerns, it was shot in Australia with Australian actors
used for some of the roles.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tom Berenger, who stars as Bryant: "The three boys that are
the principals did an excellent job and you will think they're
Texans, not Aussies."</TE>
<TE>   Texas thinking: Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas Morning News recalls
this philosophy of former Texas A&amp;M basketball coach Shelby Metcalf:
"I like married players on my squad. They're used to taking orders."</TE>
<TE>   No math major: Sherrod offers this from former Saint running back
George Rogers: "I want to rush for 2,000 yards or 1,500, whichever
comes first."</TE>
<TE>   Necessities of life: And then there's this philosophy from former
Minnesota Viking coach Bud Grant: "A successful coach needs a patient
wife, a loyal dog and a great quarterback -- but not necessarily in
that order."</TE>
<TE>   The eyes have it: "Elton John is scheduled to have laser surgery
on his eyes in February and is uncertain what to do with his 4,000
pairs of glasses," says comedian Jerry Perisho. "He'll either donate
them to a museum or offer them to the Major League Baseball Umpires
Assn."</TE>
<TE>   Sweet scientist: Ukrainian heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko, who
fights Jameel McCline in Las Vegas on Saturday, has a doctorate in
sports science and philosophy from the University of Kiev.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Patricia Hoskins scored 3,122 points and averaged
28.4 a game during her four seasons at Mississippi Valley State
(1985-89). She averaged 33.6 points as a senior, the all-time high
for a season.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Clippers have long been the butt of Jay Leno
jokes. Now it's the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers did some charity work -- gave away two more games,"
Leno said recently.</TE>

<HD>Optimism Persists Through the Pain</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The laughter echoed through Los Angeles Southwest College on Monday
morning. When Keyon Dooling  sank a three-point shot to win a Clipper
post-practice shooting contest, an electrifying roar went up.</LD>
<LD>   You take your victories and your three-pointers and your cheers
where you can get them. And these days, Southwest College seems to be
the only refuge of joy for the injury-wracked Clippers, 6-12 and
stuck at the bottom of the Pacific Division alongside the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   There was no joy on the face of center Michael Olowokandi as he
limped out of the gym, on his way to an MRI exam to better determine
the cause of a sore left knee that landed him on the injured list
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just wear and tear," Olowokandi said. "It gets inflamed and
it's difficult to bend. When you're in your defensive stance, you
have to bend your knee to get an explosive start."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi believes the problem might have started in the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't take a day off in the summer," he said. "Even when I was
on vacation, I would run. I wanted to make sure I would show up for
training camp in shape. Looking back, maybe I should have taken some
time to let my body rest."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi had no idea how serious his injury is, saying, "All I
know is that there's pain."</TE>
<TE>   There was no joy on the face of guard Andre Miller either. He sat
out practice because of a sprained left ankle, suffered Friday
against the Sacramento Kings. Miller is listed as doubtful for the
Clippers' next game, Wednesday at Staples Center against the Miami
Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to make a habit of this," he said of joining the
Clipper parade to the training room. "This is a one-time thing for
me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also missing from practice was guard Quentin Richardson, who had
stomach flu.</TE>
<TE>   Add in the previously injured Lamar Odom (ankle) and Corey
Maggette (knee) and it's enough to make a coach cry.</TE>
<TE>   But not Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not about to give up on this team because I know how this
league works," he said. "Nobody except Dallas is playing great
basketball in the [Western Conference]. And teams can suddenly get
hot and win eight of 10 or 10 of 13."</TE>
<TE>   But until the Clippers get well, they don't figure to get hot.</TE>
<TE>   Except maybe at Southwest College.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Long Bomb: How the XFL Became TV's Biggest Fiasco"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Brett Forrest</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Crown</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Why would anyone devote a 254-page book to the XFL? As the title
implies, the league, which lasted only one season, was a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   This book isn't, though. The author, free-lance writer Brett
Forrest, does a nice job of detailing what happened in 2001 to an
idea that blew up in the faces of NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol
and wrestling promoter Vince McMahon.</TE>
<TE>   There is very little about football. Mostly, the book deals with
the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest provides more than we need to know about the Las Vegas
Outlaws and their best-known player, Rod "He Hate Me" Smart. But
that's because the author moved from Brooklyn, N.Y., to Las Vegas to
do his research, and he spent a lot of time with the Outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   There could be more about some of the personalties around the
league, particularly the coaching staffs. These were all men with
football backgrounds who took this league and their jobs seriously.</TE>
<TE>   But what is impressive is the attention to detail. For instance,
it's pointed out that McMahon sat across the table from Times Sports
Editor Bill Dwyre and a Times reporter during a lunch meeting. And
indeed he did. It's also noted that McMahon took a tour of the Times
newsroom, and he did.</TE>
<TE>   In the epilogue, Forrest gets to the heart of what went wrong with
the XFL: "It was a league of empty promises. The cheerleader
[camera], the abolishment of the fair-catch rule, placing announcers
in the stands, these are just a few examples of the XFL's corrupt
sales philosophy ... [Ebersol and McMahon] over-promised and
oversold."</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Smirnov Is Playing Below Expectations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexei Smirnov, projected as a quality power forward by the Mighty
Ducks, keeps treading water.</LD>
<LD>   Forwards Stanislav Chistov and defenseman Kurt Sauer, who like
Smirnov are young rookies, continue to make significant
contributions. But Smirnov, a 6-foot-4, 218-pound bull with figure
skater moves, sits perched on the verge of good things.</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, it is easy to forget that he is only 20.</LD>
<TE>   There are eye-catching moments, when he baffles opponents and
dazzles Duck officials, such as his hard drive to the net Sunday that
required a heroic save by Chicago goalie Craig Andersson. Then there
are times when Smirnov is a ghost on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Such are the growing pains.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to be more consistent," Coach Mike Babcock said. "His
work ethic and battle level have to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov had a goal and an assist in the season opener at St.
Louis. He has been scoreless since, although there have been several
near misses.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to score a goal, that would give me much more
confidence," Smirnov said, with defenseman Ruslan Salei translating.
"It has been awhile. It would be nice to come up with one."</TE>
<TE>   His Duck peers haven't made things any easier.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, 19, has made a fast adjustment, with skills that few
rookies possess. He ranks second among rookies in scoring with 14
points.</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, 21, has been solid on defense, playing beyond his years.
His alert clearing of the puck from in front of the net in the
closing seconds Sunday wasn't the entire reason the Ducks hung on for
a 3-2 victory, but it certainly helped.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov, meanwhile, has meandered. He has been out of the Duck
lineup seven of the last 16 games -- five as a healthy scratch and
two while he was at minor league Cincinnati. His play has been
adequate, spiced by moments of brilliance.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a power forward in this game when you're 20 years old is
tough," Babcock said. "He has a chance to be a star. The size of man
you've got to be to play that way is tough to be at his age,
especially when you haven't been in North America before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' charity event to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, will be held Dec. 13 at the Hyatt Regency in Garden
Grove. Details: (714) 938-1393 or (714) 940-2969.</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Ducks 9-7-6-3; Red Wings 13-7-3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Red Wings -- 0-0-0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Red Wings were without defenseman Chris Chelios and
center Pavel Datsyuk on Sunday night. Chelios, who has a broken
finger, may play tonight. Datsyuk, however, is out at least three
weeks with a twisted right knee. After 25 games last season, the
Ducks were 7-15-3-0.</TE>

<HD>All New Course Needs Is Event</HD>
<DH>PGA Tour is building a Tournament Players Club in Valencia,
but tournament to be played there hasn't been settled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The PGA Tour doesn't build one of its Tournament Players Clubs
without the intent of moving a tournament there, so when the TPC at
Valencia opens in June, the big question will be what tournament is
going to be played there?</LD>
<LD>   Course design consultant Mark O'Meara, fresh off his victory at
the Skins Game over the weekend, visited Valencia on Monday to
discuss the progress of the course. He said that the original intent
of building the course was to have a PGA Tour event there, but it's
more likely now the Champions Tour will play there first.</LD>
<LD>   "When it was originally planned, we were hoping to bring the
[Nissan] Open in here," O'Meara said. "But now we're looking at a
senior event."</LD>
<TE>   The Champions Tour, formerly the senior tour, plays the SBC Senior
Classic at Valencia Country Club, across from the TPC. The contract
between the Champions Tour and Valencia Country Club runs through
2004, with an annual renewal option, according to tournament director
Brian Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour's Nissan Open has a deal with Riviera Country Club
through 2005, but Riviera is a player favorite. The PGA Tour has
played there 40 times since 1926, including 27 of the last 29 years.
That kind of history makes it almost impossible to pry the tournament
away though Perry Dickey, general manager for the TPC at Valencia
hasn't ruled out any type of tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything concrete in the works, but the intent is to
bring the SBC across the freeway," Dickey said. "But we could have
any number of things here from the seniors to maybe even a special
event."</TE>
<TE>   The course probably wouldn't be tournament ready until then
anyway, but O'Meara acknowledged he thought of possible future
tournaments when consulting on the design.</TE>
<TE>   "When building a course such as this, you gotta have in the back
of your mind what are the long-term goals," O'Meara said. "Everyone
takes pride in having the best players in the world play their
course."</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour owns 33 TPCs worldwide. The PGA, Champions or
Nationwide (formerly Buy.com) Tours play tournaments at 22 of those.</TE>
<TE>   The philosophy behind these clubs has been the same since the
original TPC at Sawgrass opened in 1980: quality golf courses owned
by the tour that would challenge professional players and provide
enhanced viewing areas for spectators.</TE>
<TE>   The TPC at Valencia meets the criteria. The front nine will
meander through homes, but the back nine will be a tree-lined, quiet
experience.</TE>
<TE>   There are only 27 bunkers on the course -- tame by today's
standards -- and water comes into play on only two holes, but length
and elevation changes will make for a challenge. The course measures
a beefy 7,260 from the back tees and includes a 244-yard par three.
Fortunately, there are five sets of tees.</TE>
<TE>   The greens will be subtle, said O'Meara, who added that the
average weekend hacker will be able to enjoy the course if they
choose the right set of tees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a lot of fun going out and losing your golf ball,"
O'Meara said. "I tried to keep the average to high handicapper in
mind, but from the back tees it will be all the golf course you
want."</TE>
<TE>   Green fees have not been set yet, but the TPC at Valencia is a
semi-private club. Members will have priority for tee-time
reservations and will be allowed to make reservations for friends up
to 30 days in advance, director of marketing Marcus Slaton said. The
general public can make reservations seven days in advance. The club
has sold 168 memberships.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult for the general public to get tee
times," Slaton said.</TE>

<LD>The girls' golf season concludes today with the CIF-WSCGA
championships at the SCGA Members Club in Murrieta.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament, sponsored by the California Interscholastic
Federation and the Women's Southern California Golf Assn., pits the
top teams and players from the Southern, San Diego, Central and City
Sections.</LD>
<LD>   Encinitas Torrey Pines is the two-time defending team champion,
and with UCLA-bound senior Hanna Jun leading an experienced lineup,
the Falcons are again favored.</LD>
<TE>   Goleta Dos Pueblos, Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula, Anaheim
Esperanza and Camarillo are the Southern Section representatives and
Granada Hills will represent the City Section.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section individual champion Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana, a
senior at Long Beach Wilson, is among the favorites for the
individual title. Southern Section runner-up Jennie Lee is also among
the favorites. A sophomore from Huntington Beach Edison, Lee tied for
sixth last year and is coming off a quarterfinal appearance last week
in the match-play portion of the AJGA Polo Junior Golf Classic.
Torrance freshman Angela Park should also fare well. Her postseason
rounds of 72, 70, and 72 are the tops among Southern Section players
and she was a semifinalist at the AJGA tournament last week.</TE>

<TE>   Ed Lalau is considering whether to return as football coach at
Wilmington Banning as he tends to his ailing mother.</TE>
<TE>   Lalau just finished his fifth season with the Pilots who went 4-7
and were defeated by Woodland Hills Taft in the first round of the
City Section playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Lalau learned that his mother needed emergency surgery on
Wednesday to remove a tumor from her stomach. Banning Athletic
Director Marc Paez said he spoke to the coach on Monday and Lalau

<KH>High Schools / GIRLS' WATER POLO PREVIEW</KH>
<HD>Blue-Chip Bonanza</HD>
<DH>This season's gifted senior class may be the Southland's
best yet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California is in the middle of its own gold rush.</LD>
<LD>   The prospectors are college water polo coaches who have been
scouring the region since late last year, hoping to lay claim to one
of the many talented seniors who begin girls' water polo season this
week.</LD>
<LD>   Many involved in the sport agree that the senior class is the best
to come through since the sport was sanctioned by the Southern
Section five seasons ago. Top universities such as Stanford, UCLA and
USC rushed to secure Southland players during last month's early
signing period, trading six-figure educations for long-crafted water
polo skills.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no better collection of high school players in the
country," said Temple City Coach Chuckie Roth, who has also coached
the women's program at UC Santa Barbara and a variety of youth teams
from the region.</TE>
<TE>   The current crop of seniors includes Gabbie Domanic of Santa Ana
Foothill, who left Sunday for the FINA World Cup in Perth, Australia.
Domanic has been training full time with the national team since last
summer and is the only high school player on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Domanic signed with UCLA last month, as did teammate Emily Feher,
a goalkeeper who last year helped the U.S. junior national team win
gold at the FINA World Championships. Another Foothill standout,
Brittany Hayes, signed with USC. She is also a starter for the junior
national team.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also secured Newport Harbor's Jenna Murphy, Santa Margarita's
Kacy Kunkel, Santa Barbara's Molly Cahill and Corona del Mar's
Brittany Bowlus. USC signed Erika Figge of Santa Margarita and UC
Santa Barbara signed her teammate, Aimee Stachowski. Stanford, the
defending NCAA champion, didn't miss out on the treasure hunt,
landing Meridith McColl of Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley and
Christina Hewko of Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Theories abound as to why this senior class is deeper in blue-chip
talent than those before. Some say it's simply a result of the
sport's growth.</TE>
<TE>   Girls' water polo has been steadily increasing in popularity since
the early 1990s, when many universities added the sport in an effort
to comply with federal gender-equity regulations. Most of the current
seniors also began playing at a much earlier age than the first high
school players, giving them a chance to develop team chemistry at the
age-group level and carry it over to their high schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Meridith and Christina have grown up playing with and against
some very good competition," Stanford Coach John Tanner said. "It's
evident by watching their level of play."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, who was The Times' player of the year last season after
helping Foothill win its third consecutive Division I title, said
many girls began competing on boys' teams, then switched when girls'
water polo became available at the high school level.</TE>
<TE>   She said the early experience of playing against boys gave many of
her peers the added desire to be successful in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "With the boys, you were always looked down upon and it made you
want to work harder," Hayes said. "It helped to shape me as a
player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Arlington and Riverside North may have finally lost
their grip on Southern Section Division V. Arlington won the last two
division titles and North has been in the last three finals, but
early indications point to Upland and Riverside Poly as the teams to
beat this season.</TE>
<TE>   Upland was ranked No.1 in the division when the section's
preseason coaches' polls were released last week and Poly was No. 2,
although Upland Coach Terry Kimberling said not much separates the
two teams. Upland returns all but one player from last season's team
that lost to Bell Gardens in the Division III semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Poly, which lost to North in the Division V semifinals last
season, features Monique Blanchard, the division's best overall
player, and transfer Alison Riddle, who led San Bernardino to a
semifinal berth last season. Both were first-team All-Southern
Section selections.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberling won't need to wait until the playoffs to face Poly.
They could meet Saturday in the semifinals of the Benson Cup at
Placentia El Dorado. If that doesn't materialize, the teams play a
nonleague game Dec. 19 at the Bobby Bonds Sports Complex in
Riverside.</TE>

<HD>Horry Better Amid the Soul-Searching</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By mid-afternoon Monday, Samaki Walker had gone off for his MRI exam
and Robert Horry, despite feeling enough improvement in his left foot
to participate in practice, was making plans for the same errand.</LD>
<LD>   The MRIs -- on Walker's strained back and Horry's foot -- would
prove negative, so the waiting continues. Horry, who has sat out two
games, could play tonight against Memphis. Walker can come off the
injured list Wednesday, but probably won't.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant skipped the half-court, three-on-three portion of the
day, choosing instead to take medical treatment on his bruised calf
after watching film and lifting weights.</LD>
<TE>   The 12 players on the floor in El Segundo were soaked in sweat by
the time reporters were allowed through the locked, purple door,
nearly 2 1/2 hours after the team reported, half a day after their
12th loss in 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Rick Fox paused for a sip of Gatorade and pushed a
smile through the gloom. They are rich and they are famous, so one
can assume it is never a bad day to be a Laker, but if there are
uncomfortable days, frustrating days, this almost certainly would be
one.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson's joke that they can only win 70 games now
(falling from 73, then 72, then 71) doesn't get the laughs it once
did. When he gathers the players it is for a short speech first, and
only then is Shaquille O'Neal allowed to bark "1, 2, 3," so everyone
else can respond "Lakes," and go home.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I worried?" Fox repeated. "Uh, I may be worried that we're not
taking the losses serious enough. It's hard to digest what has
happened the last month and a half, because it's been an array of
issues, which all line up to an array of excuses. So, you know, when
you think about it, they all boil down to excuses."</TE>
<TE>   You remember. They were waiting on Bryant to pass. They were
waiting on Bryant to score. They were waiting on O'Neal to heal. They
were waiting on O'Neal to blend in. They were waiting on O'Neal to
dominate. They were waiting on everyone else to heal.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the moment it took to play a month's worth of basketball,
they were in last place in the Pacific Division, still waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're the only team that's had to deal with what
we've dealt with," Fox said. "It's the determination and mental
toughness that will force you to push through those things, to not
settle on the fact you've won three championships, to not settle on
the fact that it's early in the season, to not settle on the fact
you've been without one star. Those are all excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to look around and give an explanation of why our
record is 6-12, and why we're playing as inconsistently as we have
been playing, I can give you 10 different reasons. But if I went home
and turned on the TV and saw myself talking and was an unbiased
observer, I'd say, 'Sounds like an excuse to me.' "</TE>
<TE>   "So, at what point do you put the excuses aside and realize
winning four championships in a row is not easy? If it was easy, [it
would] have been done numerous times before.... I don't know why we
feel we're going to show up and [win]. It's kind of how we look
sometimes when I watch it on tape; it's as though the presence alone
of the Lakers on the floor is supposed to diffuse any attacking
mentality of an opponent.... We went out and took three championships
and right now we think somebody's going to hand it to us."</TE>
<TE>   The pat answers have been about the length of the season and the
scope of the challenge, about diminishing November, but Christmas is
three weeks away, and it's all getting harder to dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   "That explanation is turning into an excuse and that excuse is
going to get us into a deeper hole," Fox said. "It is a long season,
but the way you conduct yourself in practice, the way you get
yourself on the floor, that karmic rhythm thing of what you put out
you get back, right now we seem to be putting out a lot of
explanations ... as opposed to going out and doing something about
it."</TE>

<LD>Mike Bibby will begin jogging this week for the first time since
breaking his foot nearly two months ago, but the Sacramento Kings'

<LD>   An X-ray of Bibby's right foot taken Monday showed he has been
healing on schedule since getting hurt during practice Oct. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The news wasn't so encouraging, however, for forward Peja
Stojakovic, who has missed six games and could need surgery for
inflamed tissue in his right heel, and backup center Scot Pollard,
who shows no significant healing after a month of inactivity to the
stress fracture in his back.</LD>

<LD>A preseason look at the top girls' water polo teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Foothill (SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   The Knights return three of the best players in the country,
seniors Emily Feher, Gabbie Domanic and Brittany Hayes, who have led
the team to the last three Southern Section Division I titles.</LD>
<TE>   2. Newport Harbor (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors have 10 seniors on their team, led by UCLA signee
Jenna Murphy, who had 42 goals, 53 steals and 44 assists last year.
They meet Foothill in much-anticipated Sea View League game on Feb.
12.</TE>
<TE>   3. Santa Margarita (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Their best player graduated, but Eagles have a loaded senior
class, led by returning starters Erika Figge, Aimee Stachowksi, Kacy
Kunkel and Sarah Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   4. Corona del Mar (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Last season's Division IV champions move up two levels, but that
shouldn't slow seniors Christian Hewko, Brittney Bowlus, Danielle
Carlson and Daniela DiGiacomo, all first-team All-Southern Section
selections a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   5. Santa Barbara (SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   Dons lost Division II player of the year Lauren Boreta to
graduation, but return first-team selections Molly Cahill and Miranda
Nichols and second-team picks Laura Borneman and Brittany Young.</TE>
<TE>   6. Los Alamitos (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The return of seniors Robyn Kaake and Sarah Kilgore and juniors
Jessica Lewis and Dayna Wawrzynski should make Griffins one of the
region's more improved teams.</TE>
<TE>   7. Anaheim Canyon (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Courtney and Lauren Mathewson bring power and speed to the
Comanches, who will get a quick test when they host Santa Margarita
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   8. Villa Park (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Cara Colton and Kathryn Sullivan were mainstays last
season for the Spartans, who begin Century League play by hosting
Canyon on Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   9. Riverside Poly (SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Junior Monique Blanchard is Inland Empire's top player and she
will be joined by junior transfer Alison Riddle, an All-Southern
Section first-team selection last season at San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   10. Long Beach Wilson (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins graduated their two best players but feature one of the
region's top sophomores in Lauren Silver, who scored game-winning
goal in quarterfinal playoff against Lake Forest El Toro last season.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael McCrary was put on injured reserve by the Baltimore Ravens on
Monday, a move that could usher the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end
into retirement.</LD>
<LD>   McCrary has played in only five games this season because of a
nagging knee injury. Chronic knee problems limited him to 10 games
last year, leading Raven Coach Brian Billick to believe McCrary's
career is over.</LD>
<LD>   "He's been a great warrior and a great player," Billick said. "I'm
pleased he gets to go out as a Baltimore Raven. I think that's
important to him, and that he can leave with a Super Bowl ring in
tow."</LD>

<HD>Bad News for Warner</HD>
<DH>Ram quarterback will sit out two games because of broken
right hand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner's throwing hand is broken, and he will miss the St. Louis
Rams' next two games.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Martz ordered Warner to have his right hand X-rayed
Monday after the quarterback insisted several times during a meeting
that he is fine. The exams showed a hairline fracture, which won't
require surgery.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time NFL MVP appeared to have trouble gripping the ball in
Sunday's 10-3 loss to Philadelphia. He fumbled trying to tuck the
ball in and also lost control of the ball trying to pass.</LD>
<TE>   Against the Eagles, Warner threw two interceptions and lost his
third fumble of the season. He has three touchdown passes and 11
interceptions in going 0-6 as a starter in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Martz said backup quarterback Jamie Martin will start next weekend
against the Kansas City Chiefs, with Marc Bulger -- 5-0 as an
emergency starter this season but hampered by a sprained index finger
on his throwing hand -- as the backup.</TE>
<TE>   Warner will be the third quarterback, available only as a last
resort.</TE>
<TE>   The loss to the Eagles was Warner's second game back after missing
nearly two months because of a broken pinkie on the same hand. Martz
said the latest injury is unrelated to the first.</TE>
<TE>   Martz criticized Warner for underthrowing Isaac Bruce on a
probable touchdown pass in the third quarter, and for holding the
ball on a fumble in the first quarter,</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't play very well," Martz said. "The fumble -- he's got to
get rid of that ball.... We visited this morning with it."</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Was Sutter the Real Problem?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dean Lombardi praised Darryl Sutter so effusively it sounded as if he
had just hired Sutter to coach the San Jose Sharks, instead of having
fired Sutter and his assistants.</LD>
<LD>   Sutter "gave us an element of respectability we truly lacked,"
Lombardi said. And no, the general manager didn't think players had
tuned Sutter out after five seasons, during which the Sharks
increased their point total each season.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not denying that six years is a long time," Lombardi said,
"but that's also one reason Darryl had success. You know who he is,
and it served him very well."</LD>
<TE>   If it served him so well, why was he the first NHL coach fired
this season?</TE>
<TE>   Team President Greg Jamison offered the usual platitudes, saying
Sutter had improved the team but a change was needed to take it in
another direction. Lombardi, who made the decision after the Sharks'
3-2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes on Saturday, also offered little
insight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not an easy decision to make when you have a track
record with a person for a long period of time," said Lombardi, who
delegated scout Cap Raeder and pro development director Doug Wilson
to coach until he hires a replacement, probably within a week (can
you say Ron Wilson?). "There's no magic formula.... I told him,
hopefully we can talk later and analyze it."</TE>
<TE>   Analyze this: The Sharks (8-12-2-2) have an identity crisis,
caught between Sutter's grind-it-out mentality and a need for more
speed and offense. They didn't get the bounce they expected when
goaltender Evgeni Nabokov and defenseman Brad Stuart returned after
resolving contract disputes, and they probably relied too much on
veterans. The retirement of Gary Suter shouldn't have shattered their
defense so badly, and their team defense has slipped. Was that
personnel or coaching?</TE>
<TE>   Lombardi said Sutter hadn't pressured him to sign Nabokov and
Stuart, and both expected the team to struggle without them. But
Lombardi said he was concerned by "the degree of drop-off even
without those guys.... It's not realistic to think we'd be 10-0 but
we should be able to be X-Y-Z. We took a bigger hit than we
expected."</TE>
<TE>   And it was easier to fire Sutter than dump 20 players from a
$47.7-million payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his faults, no coach is more principled than Sutter. He
can be gruff, but most players considered him fair. Growing up on a
farm as one of seven brothers -- six of whom played in the NHL -- he
had to be tough. But he was also compassionate. He coached the
Chicago Blackhawks to the 1995 conference final and walked away
because he wanted to make a difference during the early years of his
son Christopher, who has Down syndrome. He went to San Jose in part
because the area has good educational facilities for Christopher, and
he shaped the Sharks into a Stanley Cup contender.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows what he did, and that organization knows what he and his
coaching staff did," said his older brother Brian, fighting his own
battles as coach of the Blackhawks. "They're as responsible for that
as anyone. They're the only organization in professional sports
that's done what they've done over the last five years."</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Sutter might resurface in Calgary if the Flames fire Greg
Gilbert. Wherever he goes, improvement will follow. It's less certain
that will be true for the Sharks, unless they can lure Scotty Bowman
out of semiretirement.</TE>
<TE>   One Day at a Time</TE>
<TE>   When a fan taunted Theo Fleury and offered him a beer while he
watched his Blackhawk teammates play the Kings on Saturday at Staples
Center, it was another test on a road full of trials</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, he might have reacted angrily. But Fleury, suspended
Oct. 8 for violating the terms of his substance-abuse aftercare
program, laughed, shook his head and declined. He moved to the back
row of the press box with the man he calls his "life coach," Jim
Jenkins, his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor and constant companion.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea behind having a sponsor is, he's gone through a
lot of the same things I've gone through," said Fleury, who signed
with Chicago last summer. "He can relate to what I'm thinking and
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, forbidden by his doctors to discuss his problems, resumed
practicing with the team last week. He missed a session Friday after
he'd overslept and his cab driver couldn't find the Kings' El Segundo
practice facility, but Blackhawk General Manager Mike Smith said he's
not counting that against Fleury and has been impressed by Fleury's
fitness.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the risks when we signed him," Smith said. "He's still a
top-level player, and if he can keep his life in order, he can be a
big help."</TE>
<TE>   Fleury said he's in game shape and ready to play as soon as the
NHL evaluates his doctors' recommendations and reinstates him. Hockey
has always been his refuge during a rough-and-tumble life, although
he lost his grip on his game with his erratic behavior last season
while with the New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing all right. Everything's good," said Fleury, who looks
trim and has a bone-crushing handshake. "I've been ready to go for a
long time. It's a matter of when the doctors say is the right
time.... I couldn't have had more support than I've gotten in
Chicago. I'm at a point in my career where I wanted to be in a
winning situation. They were a great team before I came and my role
is to provide leadership and help the young kids. I've got a lot of
good years left."</TE>
<TE>   Howling at the Moon</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes, 1-2-4 in their last seven games and 2-5-4 in their
last 11, are scrambling to stay within playoff reach in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of injuries and we haven't been playing very well,"
said Wayne Gretzky, the Coyotes' managing partner. "First of all,
we're not a prolific goal-scoring team to begin with, and when we
lose people to injuries, it's worse. And when you lose confidence
that makes it more difficult. We have a few guys who haven't scored
the way we'd like them to score.</TE>
<TE>   "The teams in our conference have gotten better. Look at L.A.,
Dallas and Anaheim. The competition has become more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   It's tougher without goalie Sean Burke, who sprained his ankle
Oct. 24 and hasn't returned. Also missing long-term are center
Krystofer Kolanos (concussion), defenseman Drake Berehowsky (knee
surgery) and winger Brad May (shoulder surgery). Forward Brian Savage
has missed 11 games, and prize free agent Tony Amonte hasn't had a
major effect, contributing six goals and 18 points in 25 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to face reality," Coach Bobby Francis said. "We have a
tough time scoring goals. We're going to have to keep it tight in
every zone."</TE>
<TE>   Their schedule has also been a killer, sending them on the road
for 15 of their first 25 games. But they're merely 2-5-3 at home and
playing before dwindling crowds. Their announced average at America
West Arena is 12,353, 76% of capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of things you can look at, but they're all
excuses," Francis said. "The reality is, you can talk about the
schedule all you want, and being on the road so much, and the ungodly
number of injuries we've had. But those are things we can't control.
The only thing we can control is our play."</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   New York Islander goalie Garth Snow's new pads have drawn
attention from the NHL because they're so long. He appears to have
found a loophole in the rules, which govern the width of pads but not
the length. However, that might soon change.... Memo to Islander
management: Drop those hideous orange third jerseys that turn players
into giant yams. Unless, of course, the idea is for opponents to
laugh themselves into submission.</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Canadiens seem more combative in practice than in
games. Richard Zednik and Karl Dykhuis got into a fight on the bench
during a scrimmage last week, duplicating a scrap between Donald
Audette and Craig Rivet.... The Globe and Mail, a national newspaper
in Canada, detailed some serious financial problems facing the Ottawa
Senators. The club owes more than $350 million to creditors and has
borrowed $14.3 million from the NHL, with plans to borrow more.
Majority owner Rod Bryden has proposed restructuring the club's
finances through selling partnerships, which were expected to raise
more than $230 million.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost spooky, but identical twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin of
the Vancouver Canucks ended long scoring droughts within a short
span. Henrik scored his first goal of the season Nov. 25, then Daniel
ended a 17-game slump in the next game. Their revival and the
resurgence of Trevor Linden have helped the Canucks win 10
consecutive games and pass early-season leader Minnesota atop the
Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa forward Marian Hossa, whose career was nearly derailed by a
serious knee injury, has a 13-game point-scoring streak, the league's
longest this season. He has 12 goals and 22 points in that span, a
key reason for the Senators' 8-0-2 surge.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mighty Duck goalie Guy Hebert, a team ambassador and radio
commentator, believes forecasts of a work stoppage in 2004 might be
hurting teams at the gate. He thinks fans could be reluctant to make
financial and emotional investments if the sport's future appears
gloomy. "People are not going to renew season tickets if there's a
strike possibility," he said. "I think for the sake of the players
and the fans, both sides have to sit down now or next season and make
sure it's not something that goes on." Amen.</TE>

<HD>He's a Crowd-Pleaser On and Off the Course</HD>
<DH>Whether he wins or loses, Phil Mickelson's got time and a
gracious greeting for his fans and they love him for it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIO, Calif</DL>
<LD>INDIO, Calif. -- The No. 2 golfer in the world is Hertz to these
fans.</LD>
<LD>   It is more than an hour since Phil Mickelson finished the 18th
hole of the made-for-TV-and-real-estate-buyers event called the Skins
Game. He has spent the weekend here at the Landmark Golf Club,
playing in a foursome with Tiger Woods, Fred Couples and Mark
O'Meara, and for his roughly four hours of work over two days and 18
holes, he has added $300,000 to the more than $22 million he had
already won in his career.</LD>
<LD>   So, there are a couple of ways to look at this:</LD>
<TE>   * He doesn't need to spend another 45 minutes gradually making his
way along a line of fans who want him to sign anything and everything
they thrust his way.</TE>
<TE>   * He thinks he does. He actually wants to. And he wants to make it
clear that the $200,000 birdie he made on the last hole Sunday made
no difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether I win or lose doesn't affect the way I treat people," he
says, almost with defiance to anybody who would think otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   So he signs and chats. The people stand behind a rope and wait
patiently, knowing that he will get to them. They have caps and hats
and golf towels and programs. One man has a framed picture of
Mickelson to be signed and, while that is happening, assures
Mickelson that 2003 will be his year to win a major. Mickelson
smiles, just as he had earlier when a police officer approached him
for an autograph and urged him to make 2003 the year he wins his
first Grand Slam tournament title "because I've got a $50 bet on it
... that way, we both win."</TE>
<TE>   At 32, the best golfer not to have won a major is deflecting the
ever-present mention of that as he works his way down the ropes, 35
minutes into this golf line-dance, smiling and wishing every couple
of people a happy holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great advantage over football, basketball, baseball and
hockey," Mickelson says. "We don't have the stadium effect. We don't
put on helmets and we aren't separated by walls and fences. The
people walk with us, and talk to us. That is a great strength of our
tour."</TE>
<TE>   He will play in Tiger Woods' Target World Challenge, yet another
event in the golf world's November-December silly season of non-real
events for very real money, Thursday through Sunday at Sherwood
Country Club. Woods, the No. 1 player, attracts a field of 16 players
for the event that benefits his foundation, and the 16 compete for a
purse of $3.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, normally absent during this time of year because he
uses the post-tour months "to refresh myself, to work on the things
that I need for the next year and to set my schedule," is direct
about why he is in the swing of things right now.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be around much in March," he says. "Our third baby is due
then."</TE>
<TE>   He will be at home, in Rancho Santa Fe, and when the baby, this
time a boy after two girls, gets to be 8 weeks old, he will be there
for more than just moral support.</TE>
<TE>   "I take over, at 8 weeks, when they are old enough and strong
enough to pay attention," he says. "I go in when they cry at night,
and I sit and talk to them. Maybe every 15 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   And pretty soon, they sleep through the night.</TE>
<TE>   To the cynic, this all sounds like so much pablum. But to the
people standing in line as Mickelson signs, it is as real as they are
certain he is. They know he is a multimillionaire, but everything
they hear and see tells them he is also a regular guy.</TE>
<TE>   He likes to put a wager down now and then, and what's wrong with
that? One of the pools he is in includes his mother-in-law, who has
been redoing her house with some of their joint winnings.</TE>
<TE>   His mother is a 60-year-old jock who plays competitive basketball.
Mickelson says he is proud of what good shape she is in and how she
has nearly beaten asthma this way.</TE>
<TE>   He once broke his leg skiing. He likes to ski and he likes to win
and he was racing. Other pro golfers wondered about the advisability
of taking that kind of risk. Mickelson pointed out that he had won
the race.</TE>
<TE>   He once skipped a shot across a lake and across the green to the
edge of the rough because it was the only shot he had, and he doesn't
lay up or pitch out sideways. When asked, he likes to talk about
that. He took a bogey on the hole, but he still likes to talk about
the shot.</TE>
<TE>   In the '97 Ryder Cup at Sotogrande, Spain, he needed to hit a shot
248 yards to a pin placement that had water on the right and the pin
only a couple of yards in from the water's ledge. He hit a two-iron
to within six feet, and says, "That was a wow."</TE>
<TE>   In the ongoing Masters matter of Hootie Johnson-versus-Martha
Burk, he is slightly below the radar that tracks Woods at every turn
on this issue, but says it is something that should not be aired in
public and that he and a number of other players are working behind
the scenes with the PGA to get this settled. He smiles and says, "And
I will play in the Masters next year."</TE>
<TE>   Those who stand in line as they wait for him to sign like what
they see. He is the main pursuer of the main man, and as popular as
Woods is, Mickelson is a huge favorite too.</TE>
<TE>   He not only knows that, he keeps working at it.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been talking about making the pro-am experience a lot
better for the people who play in them," he says. "Most of the time,
they get done and it has been a long day, probably too long. They are
happy, but tired. We need to make that shorter and better and so good
that they walk away saying, 'This was one of the better experiences
of my life.' "</TE>
<TE>   And he keeps on signing.</TE>

<HD>Toledo's Turmoil</HD>
<DH>A loss to Washington State could mean the end of the line
for UCLA's coach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After seven years of surviving everything from humor to pathos, Bob
Toledo's UCLA career wobbles today on the precipice of irony.</LD>
<LD>   His cross-town rivals have beaten him to within a whisker of
losing his job.</LD>
<LD>   Yet he must help them Saturday to save it.</LD>
<TE>   Indications are that Toledo may have to defeat Washington State --
thus landing USC in the Rose Bowl -- to avoid being removed as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is saying anything official. But the signs are as obvious
as the empty Rose Bowl seats in the second half of the Bruins' recent
blowout loss to the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   The athletic department is receiving piles of angry
correspondence. Alumni are reportedly making elaborate proposals to
buy out Toledo's contract at $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some boosters are already discussing replacements. Others are
openly hoping the Bruins lose to the Cougars so USC and Toledo will
be nailed at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   And the only guy who can quiet the mob refuses to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Guerrero, the athletic director who was so open in his support
of Toledo earlier this season, refused an interview request Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an appropriate time," a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does such a refusal potentially hurt recruiting, it also
doesn't do much for a coach's confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all up to them," said Toledo, referring to university
officials. "It's all about how much pressure can the administration
handle, and whether they are willing to stand by me or not."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "They have to know they will always feel heat about
their coaches. The question is, how will they handle it?"</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Bruin athletic department was impervious to heat.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, it would have taken something extraordinary for UCLA
to fire a coach with a 49-31 record, six bowl qualifications in seven
seasons, and a school-record 20-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   But Guerrero, a former Bruin baseball player who was hired as
athletic director last spring, has never run a program with a
football team. His history with Toledo only goes back eight months.</TE>
<TE>   And at such a relatively quick glance, Toledo's numbers are an
electric clash of positive and negative.</TE>
<TE>   Negative: Toledo is only the second Bruin coach in history to lose
four consecutive games to the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Positive: The other coach was Terry Donahue, who rebounded to have
a Hall of Fame career.</TE>
<TE>   Negative: Since that 20-game win streak ended in 1998, Toledo's
teams are only 24-23.</TE>
<TE>   Positive: With only seven senior starters, the Bruins have won
three of their last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Negative: Toledo has been the coach during a handicapped-parking
scandal, a marijuana scandal, a drunk-driving scandal, a borrowed-car
scandal, and an alley full of barroom scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Positive: Since he implemented tighter controls this year, the
hijinks have apparently stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget about things, remember some others," Toledo said.
"It's all about, what have you done for me lately. I understand that.
I accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, in his case, is a 79-21 deficit to USC over the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Lately is a questionable quarterback change that hurt UCLA's
momentum against USC, and a questionable running play that led to a
long missed field goal that could have beaten Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But lately is also a 2002 season that has been free of problems
off the field, and full of effort on it.</TE>
<TE>   For those who say they laid down against the Trojans, well, then
what did Notre Dame do?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been proud of this team, and I really think we've responded
to each other," Toledo said. "And with all these great freshmen, I
really think we're going to get better and better next year. I would
like to be around for that."</TE>
<TE>   But will he?</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of pressure to win this next game," Toledo
acknowledged. "This is a big, big game. This is the one."</TE>
<TE>   If the Bruins beat Washington State, they will finish the regular
season 8-4 and in third place in the Pac-10. With the best players
returning, how can you fire a coach after that?</TE>
<TE>   But if they lose to Washington State -- which is beatable because
of an injured starting quarterback -- they are 7-5 and headed for a
lousy bowl game and you know what?</TE>
<TE>   It could happen.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero could act on a belief that Toledo, whose easygoing
personality hinders his fight for locker-room respect, has lost the
team.</TE>
<TE>   He could respond to fears that if UCLA doesn't make a move now,
USC will dominate for the next several years and Bruin recruiting
might never catch up.</TE>
<TE>   The very un-Bruinlike firing that could never happen might
actually happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I should be judged on, have we had a competitive football
team?" Toledo said. "Do we play hard? Do we give our best effort?"</TE>
<TE>   The usual answer to all those questions has been yes.</TE>
<TE>   But there are two glaring exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most crushing losses in program history, against
Miami in 1998 -- breaking the 20-game win streak -- the Bruin defense
seemingly missed tackles on purpose after chafing under Toledo's
season-long public criticism. The Bruins were so distracted the week
of the game, they even discussed wearing black armbands in protest of
a then-ambiguous college athlete movement.</TE>
<TE>   Many thought Toledo had lost that team.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last November, the Bruins quit in a shutout loss to USC
after quarterback Cory Paus admitted he had been charged with drunk
driving the previous summer. Paus' infraction was reportedly made
public by associates of DeShaun Foster, the suspended running back
who was angry at what he perceived to be Toledo's derisive comments
about his borrowed car incident.</TE>
<TE>   Many thought Toledo had also lost that team.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I've made some mistakes," Toledo said Monday. "And if I had
to do some things different, I would do them. But I've learned. I've
made adjustments. I feel I've improved.''</TE>
<TE>   He recently showed how much when he publicly admitted that he
never should have brought in quarterback Matt Moore for hot
quarterback Drew Olson against USC.</TE>
<TE>   The old Bob Toledo would never publicly admit he was wrong, at
least not until he had fired a defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never trying to pass off blame, I was just trying to be
honest," Toledo said. "But I've learned from that too. I'm now much
more careful with what I say. And I'll admit when I was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Critics will say, yeah, fine, but the quarterback switch is
another example of how Toledo is too flighty on a sideline, how his
best work came when since-departed Al Borges helped him upstairs, how
Toledo would be a better offensive coordinator than coach.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are increasingly saying lots of things about Toledo, none
of which will matter if he beats Washington State, even though that
would help the one team trying to destroy him.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's conference call, Cougar Coach Mike Price was asked
to imagine playing a game in which a victory would help rival
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd tank it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Bob Toledo heard the quote, laughed, then pounded
his fist on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not tanking it," he shouted, seriously, a renewed charge or
last call.</TE>

<HD>Grand Night for the Raiders</HD>
<DH>Brown makes his 1,000th reception and Oakland improves to
8-4 with 26-20 victory over Jets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>As far as he has brought the New York Jets this season, quarterback
Chad Pennington couldn't bring them back quite far enough Monday at
that Oakland Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Not when he was facing a ravenous Oakland Raider defense that was
protecting a six-point lead with little more than a minute to play.
Say what you will about Pennington, compare him to Joe Namath -- and
some New York radio analysts actually have -- but don't deem him the
NFL's green monster. Not yet.</LD>
<LD>   "He's got a long way to go to prove himself," Raider defensive
tackle Sam Adams said after a 26-20 victory that gave the Raiders
(8-4) a share of the AFC West lead with San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   "He gets a couple of wins and everybody wants to jump on the
bandwagon. He's a good quarterback, I don't want to take that away
from him. But, please, let him earn it."</TE>
<TE>   If the Raiders were jumping on anything it was Pennington, the
third-year player who replaced Vinny Testaverde early in the season
and rescued the Jets (6-6) from the wreckage of a 2-5 start. He
showed a bit of the magic on New York's last-gasp drive Monday.
Working with no timeouts, he used 46 seconds to drive the Jets from
their 26 to Oakland's 35, where he spiked the ball with 19 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Rod Coleman sacked him for an 11-yard loss, leaving
the Jets just enough time for one shot at the end zone. The
desperation pass was intercepted by Rod Woodson, who assured the
Raiders of their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty tough situation to put anybody in," Woodson said of
Pennington. "It would be tough for John Elway, let alone a young
guy."</TE>
<TE>   This game belonged to the Raiders, even though the scoreboard
didn't always reflect it. They led for most of the game, held the
ball almost 13 minutes longer, and outgained the Jets, 411 yards to
274.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Oakland players reached some significant
milestones.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable of those was Tim Brown, who made his 1,000th
reception to join Jerry Rice and Cris Carter as the only players in
NFL history to reach quadruple digits in catches.</TE>
<TE>   The game was stopped early in the third quarter so Brown could be
honored for his achievement. With a video montage of his career
playing on the scoreboards, he was greeted on the field by players
from both teams as well as some relatives, chauffeured onto the turf
in a swanky golf cart.</TE>
<TE>   Brown wiped his eyes with his wristbands and handed the ball to an
equipment man for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   It was a landmark night for Rich Gannon, too. The Raider
quarterback threw for 342 yards, the ninth time this season he
surpassed the 300-yard plateau.</TE>
<TE>   That tied the NFL record held by Dan Marino, Warren Moon and Kurt
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to star power, though, no one has the wattage of
Rice. There was a reminder of that on the play immediately after the
Brown celebration, when Rice reeled in a pass over the middle,
twisted out of a tackle and glided into the end zone for a 26-yard
touchdown. The place went crazy as the Raiders -- who briefly trailed
7-6 and 10-6 -- regained the lead, 13-10.</TE>
<TE>   With 2:35 remaining in the third quarter, the lead grew to 20-10
after New York's Chad Morton muffed a punt return, which the Raiders
recovered. Four plays later, Zack Crockett scored from the one.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets wouldn't have been close at the end, many Raider players
said, if not for a slew of penalties. The Raiders were flagged 10
times for 83 yards -- including one possession that featured three
false starts and a holding call.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say we were antsy," tackle Lincoln Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was jitters, nerves. Everyone wanted to put on a good
performance with the world watching.... We shot ourselves in the
foot."</TE>
<TE>   Merely a flesh wound for a team that has endured roller-coaster
symmetry this season, winning its first four games, losing its next
four, and winning its next four.</TE>
<TE>   On deck are the Chargers, who will play host to the Raiders on
Sunday. San Diego beat Oakland in overtime in their first meeting
this season.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers' Turn to Make Waves in America's Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has Seattle's OneWorld Challenge been sailing with design secrets
stolen from America's Cup defender Team New Zealand?</LD>
<LD>   Is Sean Reeves a hero or a villain?</LD>
<LD>   Who stole the Italian lawyer's laptop?</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps all will be revealed over the weekend and the remaining
challengers can get on with the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials
at Auckland to determine who gets a chance to take the Cup away from
the Kiwis in February.</TE>
<TE>   Or, perhaps not. The scenario has the international intrigue of a
John Le Carre spy novel wrapped into a Tom Clancy techno-thriller.
There's even a "smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   The challenger semifinals are scheduled to start Sunday -- Monday
in New Zealand -- with San Francisco's Oracle BMW and Switzerland's
Alinghi to meet in one best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Prada's opponent is uncertain. OneWorld, backed by
billionaires Craig McCaw (cell phones) and Paul Allen (Microsoft),
qualified with a 4-0 rout of Team Dennis Conner in the quarterfinals
repechage round, but the America's Cup arbitration panel will meet
Friday or Saturday to consider questions about that team's behavior
submitted by the New York Yacht Club, on behalf of Team DC, and the
Yacht Club Punta Ala, on behalf of Prada.</TE>
<TE>   NYYC Commodore David Elwell said: "These are allegations that have
been out there, and we, along with Yacht Club Punta Ala, feel for the
benefit of the event that they absolutely need to be cleared up. I
hope that they are cleared up satisfactorily and OneWorld goes on to
win the America's Cup and they can go home with a wonderful feeling
that they've done a great job and they've done it the way the rules
state. We at the New York Yacht Club had no expectation that we were
going to be sailing OneWorld [in the repechage]. It came as a
surprise to us, and it made the decision very, very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   So, nothing personal -- but the timing is interesting.</TE>
<TE>   The joint submission was made a few days after Team New Zealand
had turned over to the challengers an affidavit recorded nine months
earlier in which Reeves presumably detailed his role in the dispute.
The former Team NZ lawyer defected to OneWorld, along with lead
designer Laurie Davidson and several sailors, then had a falling out
with the Seattle team and allegedly tried to peddle design secrets to
Team Dennis Conner and San Francisco's Oracle BMW -- allegations
supported by other affidavits.</TE>
<TE>   Releasing the Reeves affidavit at this time would create chaos
among the challengers. Gee, did that cross the Kiwis' minds?</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the semifinals scheduled to start a day or two after the
arbitration panel meets, only three of the survivors are certain:
Alinghi and Oracle BMW, who remain blissfully above the row, and
Prada, which will meet OneWorld or its replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Team Dennis Conner also filed a protest with the event's
International Jury that OneWorld had violated Racing Rule 2, which
concerns "fair sailing." But rather than risk arriving at a decision
that would contradict a subsequent decision by the arbitration panel,
the subordinate jury deferred its action.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration panel is composed of five prominent international
jurists with sailing backgrounds -- two New Zealanders, one Swiss,
one Italian and an Australian chairman.</TE>
<TE>   There is an assumption that if OneWorld is kicked out, Team Dennis
Conner will take its place.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily. Sweden's Victory Challenge, a 4-0 loser to Prada
in the repechage, had a better won-lost record than Team DC, 7-9 to
6-10, through the two round-robins that determined quarterfinal
matchups.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday the Swedes announced they were packing up to go home.
Even the Swedes' departure, however, won't guarantee Team DC a spot.
If OneWorld is dumped, the arbitration panel could order a sail-off
among the remaining quarterfinalists -- Team DC, Britain's GBR and
France's Le Defi Areva -- or, in the most expeditious solution, have
a three-boat semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   There is doubt whether Reeves will testify or if the arbitration
panel will have to rule on the face value of his affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Elwell said, "We do believe that Sean Reeves will be there to
testify. There have been some efforts to prevent that from
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers suspect the "efforts" are preceded by U.S. dollar
signs. OneWorld also has pointed out that Reeves is under a gag order
in its proceedings in U.S. federal court.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld skipper Peter Gilmour, who has seen other bitter quarrels
in his five America's Cups, said: "I'm more disappointed than
anything. I'm just very surprised by the New York Yacht Club, Team
Dennis Conner and Yacht Club Punta Ala, the Prada team, with their
approach here.</TE>
<TE>   "They clearly have not respected the efforts that we went to last
year, in putting the application in front of the arbitration panel
and presenting a very detailed and thorough internal investigation.
What was seen at the time was a lot of very small combinations of
small rule infractions that had occurred."</TE>
<TE>   The "application" was a confession that OneWorld had the
information, but there was no evidence to prove it had been used.
Rivals now think there is.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the plot thickened last weekend when Alessandra
Pandarese, the principal legal advisor to Prada Challenge 2003 and
secretary-general of Challenger of Record Management (CORM), reported
the overnight theft of her laptop computer from the premises of her
supporting law firm in Auckland.</TE>
<TE>   Pandarese is one of an armada of lawyers who will be center stage
by this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   One prominent one is Richard Scruggs, the successful anti-tobacco
lawyer from Mississippi who is a supporter of Team DC. Although he
may be only in the wings, he smells another smoking gun. Scruggs
accused OneWorld's lawyers of trying to use U.S. courts to keep
evidence from the arbitration panel. He urged OneWorld to withdraw
from the series so as "not to taint the dignity of this event."</TE>
<TE>   As in the previous America's Cup, Scruggs has had his private
motor yacht, the 120-foot Emerald K, berthed in front of Team DC's
compound at the head of syndicate row.</TE>
<TE>   How does the America's Cup keep getting itself into these messes?
One problem is that it has no continuing central authority -- no Bud
Selig, David Stern or Paul Tagliabue. That isn't all bad but, at
times, it seems more like the Anarchy Cup.</TE>

<HD>When Chargers Move Here, It Won't Be Pretty</HD>

<LD>The new neighbors are moving in, and since they have a rug rat, we
were kind enough to throw up chicken wire along the fence to prevent
our dog Ralphie, who loves chew toys, from running off with one of
the toddler's arms.</LD>
<LD>   At the very most now the kid is only going to be able to put a
finger or two through the fence, which should leave at least eight
good fingers and the hard-learned lesson to never do that again. I
sure hope if the kid grows up to be a Trojan fan, it's not those two
fingers.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   TOM &amp; AIDA never really appreciated the effort we had to put in to
be their neighbors before they moved, but then we never had to call
the cops on them or buy World Famous Chocolate Bars from their kids,
so it could have been worse.</TE>
<TE>   That's the fear now, of course, that a hockey fan or someone
really weird like a bowler has moved next door, intent on talking
sports all the time. In fact, I found myself shopping with the wife
at Fashion Island last weekend to avoid bumping into the new
neighbors, and I don't think it's right that someone should be
punished just because they'd like to live in peace and quiet.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a while since I'd been to a mall, too, and I couldn't
believe the number of people who were walking their dogs, which got
me to thinking about the Chargers, of course. Well, that's how I
explained it to the wife when I told her I had to leave, drive to San
Diego and check to see if they had broken free from their leash, uh,
lease. (If she knew the new neighbors better, she probably could have
called them for a ride home instead of having to hitchhike).</TE>
<TE>   Now everyone knows by now that the Chargers are going to be our
team in two, maybe three years at the most. Beginning on Sunday they
had 60 days to trigger an escape clause in their Qualcomm Stadium
lease, and while the NFL wants them to wait until after the Super
Bowl on Jan. 26 to officially put the city of San Diego on notice,
I'm hearing talk an announcement might come as soon as this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CHARGERS are owned by the Spanos Goofs, a Stockton father-son
tag team with all the fumble-bum qualifications you'd expect from NFL
owners following in the footsteps of Georgia Frontiere and Al Davis.
In fact, a ticket guarantee that has had the city of San Diego
spending almost $30 million on unsold seats -- including money for
seats the city recently discovered do not exist -- has the feel of
something engineered by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Now I began covering and documenting the Goofs' Sterling-like
reign of mediocrity -- 127 wins and 172 losses to date -- for the San
Diego Union in 1986, later moving on to The Times, and I pretty much
deal with them now much as I do Georgia &amp; Al. Whenever we see each
other we make ugly faces. You're way ahead of me, but yes, Georgia
has a definite advantage on all of us.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday I positioned myself outside the Goofs' luxury box in
Qualcomm Stadium, and when Dean Spanos, the son, walked by, we made
grumpy faces at each other. My experience in doing TV on a show that
no one watches where I'm asked to shake my head in disgust when the
scoring goes against me has really been a blessing when it comes to
facing off with the Goofs.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to throw an ugly face at Alex Spanos, the father,
however, because ever since he was booed unmercifully after being
introduced to the hometown crowd on "Dan Fouts Day" in 1988, he walks
around with his eyes to the ground as if he's embarrassed to be
recognized. I gave it a good try, though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I wouldn't have anything against the Chargers if they came to
L.A. and left the Goofs behind, but that's not how it's going to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind I sat down Sunday to experience a Charger game
and get a feel again for what it's going to be like when they come
here. I began with a $5 program, Pages 4 to 6 detailing all of Alex
Spanos' accomplishments and donations to charity, and then Pages 42
and 43 dedicated to Alex Spanos' book, including this quote from his
mother: "Do something good and then throw it in the ocean. Don't brag
about it."</TE>
<TE>   On Page 90 the bragging continued with Spanos' picture, and this
caption: "Alex Spanos is one of San Diego's most generous
philanthropists."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DOWN ON the field the NFL game, as it is played today, is still
great theater. By the way, it's just as exciting on TV.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos and Chargers put on a thrilling show, San Diego
sending a crowd of more than 66,000 into a frenzy with a successful
kick to win, 30-27. Right now the folks in San Diego love their
Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   This week the first-place Chargers will be playing the Raiders,
and if the team triggers the escape clause in the next few weeks you
can bet it will be done to rally the excited fans behind them into
pressuring the city to be more responsive to their demands.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have offered to drop the ticket guarantee in exchange
for staying in San Diego through 2004 -- with the proviso that they
can leave free of litigation and financial responsibilities after
2004, and hello, Los Angeles. San Diego officials have refused to
discuss the offer with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Although it means making ugly faces at the Goofs again, I'm hoping
San Diego continues to turn its back on the Chargers, and they leave
to come here. I have a feeling I'm going to need a place to go every
Sunday to avoid the neighbors -- especially after Ralphie gets done
munching on their toddler.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jay Barasch:</TE>
<TE>   "You predicted UCLA and Notre Dame would derail the Trojans....
Your standard procedure when your predictions of doom for USC fail,
is to move on to the next game and start your campaign that
(so-and-so) will be the one to expose the Trojans as frauds. If you
admit you're wrong, maybe Trojan fans will apologize to you.... "</TE>
<TE>   I guess it all comes down to who is the real so-and-so here.</TE>

<HD>Thome Time for the Phillies</HD>
<DH>First baseman's six-year deal will be official if he passes
physical today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Thome's loyalty to the Cleveland Indians did not run as deep as
the pockets of the Philadelphia Phillies, who lured baseball's most
coveted free-agent slugger from the only organization he has played
for with a six-year, $87.5-million deal that will become official
pending his passing a physical today.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Phillies' General Manager Ed Wade nor Indians' General
Manager Mark Shapiro would confirm the agreement Monday, but sources
from both teams said Thome traveled to Philadelphia on Monday night
and will be examined today.</LD>
<LD>   Thome, the 32-year-old first baseman who hit a club-record 52 home
runs for the Indians last season, also informed teammates and friends
of his plans. A news conference to announce his signing the biggest
contract in Phillie history is expected today or Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "I talked to Jimmy [Monday] and he's pretty pumped, it's a good
challenge for him," Cleveland outfielder Ellis Burks said. "He went
back and forth between Cleveland and Philadelphia. He finally picked
Philadelphia."</TE>
<TE>   The Indians made every effort to re-sign one of the most popular
players in franchise history, bumping their original four-year,
$45-million offer to five years at $60 million, and then adding a
sixth-year vesting option that would have increased the package to
about $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the Phillies' aggressive attempts to improve as they prepare
to move into a new stadium in 2004 and a deal that guarantees an
average of about $14.5 million a year were enough to attract Thome,
whose signing could trigger a baseball renaissance in Philadelphia
and the return of the dark ages in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies have had a losing record in 15 of the last 17
seasons, but despite the departure of All-Star third baseman Scott
Rolen, who was traded to St. Louis in July, Philadelphia has one of
baseball's most promising young lineups, a core that includes
outfielders Pat Burrell and Bobby Abreu, catcher Mike Lieberthal and
shortstop Jimmy Rollins.</TE>
<TE>   Add Thome, who has hit at least 30 homers for seven consecutive
years and has driven in more than 100 runs in six of the last seven
seasons, and veteran third baseman David Bell, who signed a
four-year, $17-million contract on Nov. 24, and the Phillies have an
offense that should contend for the National League East title.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, flush with cash after the departures of Rolen and
free agents Doug Glanville, Robert Person, Mike Timlin and Terry
Adams -- who accounted for some $30 million in payroll -- have also
made a three-year, $30-million offer to pitcher Tom Glavine, the
two-time Cy Young Award winner who is expected to decide between the
Atlanta Braves, Phillies and New York Mets this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Thome adds a big bat to the lineup," a Phillie source said. "And
with Bell, we have a pretty good young team. If we can land Glavine
-- and I think our chances are decent -- that would be great. I think
he's taking a second look at us after the Thome deal."</TE>
<TE>   In Thome's wake, Cleveland will not rock. Once one of baseball's
most dominant franchises -- the Indians won six American League
Central titles and two AL pennants from 1995-2001 -- Cleveland is
clearly in a rebuilding mode.</TE>
<TE>   Since last December, Thome, pitchers Bartolo Colon, Chuck Finley
and Paul Shuey, outfielders Kenny Lofton and Juan Gonzalez and second
baseman Roberto Alomar have left Cleveland via trades or free agency.
Slugger Manny Ramirez left after the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Teams such as the Angels used to model themselves after the
Indians, locking up young stars to multi-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But now, the only recognizable names in Cleveland are Burks and
shortstop Omar Vizquel, who may also be traded this winter.</TE>
<TE>   When Eric Wedge reports for his first spring training as the
Indians' manager, he'll have to decide if players such as outfielders
Alex Escobar and Coco Crisp, pitchers Justin Davis and Billy Traber,
first baseman Ben Broussard, catcher Victor Martinez and third
baseman Marshall McDougall are ready for the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro's efforts to re-sign Thome seemed like a last grasp at the
past, a final attempt to stiff-arm mediocrity and give the Indians a
cornerstone to build on.</TE>
<TE>   But now some in Cleveland fear the Indians could lose 100 games in
2003, the depths of which Cleveland hasn't fathomed since 1991, when
the Indians went 57-105.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming up in the Indians system, Jimmy was a guy everyone looked
up to," Cleveland infielder John McDonald told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to play next to him, and I'm just sorry I won't
ever get a chance to do that again. I'm happy for Jimmy and his
family, but I'm just really sorry for the Indians family."</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sophomore Curtis Takes Step Forward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Two games into the season, three projected starters already have been
benched and USC has suffered a controversial last-second overtime
loss to Rhode Island.</LD>
<LD>   But the most surprising aspect of the Trojans' nascent season has
been the inspired play of sophomore power forward Nick Curtis.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis, the youngest member of the team, turned 19 on Nov. 23 but
has played like a veteran for the Trojans, averaging 13 points and a
team-high 8.7 rebounds. He averaged one point and 0.8 rebounds in 5.1
minutes per game as a freshman.</LD>
<TE>   "He's taken more of a leadership role and it's something that has
surprised me about him," Coach Henry Bibby said. "He's talking more
and he's coming out and fighting for what he thinks is right for the
basketball team. We need somebody to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so interesting what one game can do for a kid. I think that
game in Rhode Island just took him to another level of play. He
played 45 minutes.... He made four big free throws for us down the
stretch. One game can get a guy over the hump."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis, who is 6 feet 8, 220 pounds, grew up in Oxnard and will
have a homecoming, of sorts, tonight at UC Santa Barbara, where
numerous friends and family members will join the Thunderdome crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I'd have a bigger role this year, yeah, but I got a big
look in that Rhode Island game," said Curtis, who also considered
attending Santa Barbara and California. "It does give me confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby said chats with Curtis' mother, Colleen, gave him a clue
about what buttons to push.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has to get mad at times to play," Bibby said. "That's
what his mom talked about, that someone needs to really push him and
punch him and make him get mad so he'll go out there and dominate. He
can dominate if he wants to.</TE>
<TE>   "He's right along the lines of Sam Clancy, what he was his
sophomore year. Sam wasn't a super freshman. He got better his
sophomore year but his junior and senior years he just blossomed into
a great player. I think Nick Curtis can be that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bibby also talked about the prospect of the Trojans' contested
loss at Rhode Island being overturned and the result being vacated:
"There might be too much egg on everybody's face to do that. There
should be some fairness but like they said, the fair is in Pomona."</TE>

<LD>   St. Mary's (2-2) at UCLA (3-1), Pauley Pavilion, 7, Fox Sports
(1150) -- After four road games, including the championship of a
tournament at Nevada Las Vegas on Sunday, the Bruins play their home
opener and try to extend a three-game winning streak. UCLA hopes
reserve guard Gennifer Arranaga, who scored 25 points in the two
weekend games and joined Rebel Shootout MVP Michelle Greco on the
all-tournament team, can continue her hot play. UCLA holds a 2-1
series edge, but the Gaels won the last meeting in 1997 on their home
court. St. Mary's is paced by center Triola Jackson, who is averaging
17.3 points and 11.3 rebounds.</LD>

disappointing 6-6 in the regular season, capped by a 50-20 loss to
Texas on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Slocum's 123 career victories were the most in school history, and
he never had a losing season.</LD>
<TE>   "It was with great sadness and disappointment that I learned today
that I was being fired as the head football coach at Texas A&amp;M,"
Slocum said in a prepared statement.</TE>

gone either way and no one was more disappointed than me with our
record. However, we have some really outstanding young players and I
felt our future was bright."</TE>
<TE>   Slocum was 123-47-2 with the Aggies, but only 29-23 in the last
four seasons. The Aggies have lost three in a row to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Slocum, 58, won four conference championships, including the Big
12 Conference title in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the school said Slocum was asked to become special
advisor to Texas A&amp;M President Robert M. Gates.</TE>

<LD>Cal State Fullerton jumped out to its biggest halftime lead under
third-year Coach Donny Daniels and cruised to a 74-56 victory over
visiting Morris Brown on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Ralphy Holmes led the Titans (1-2) with 20 points, nine
rebounds and three assists. Center Pape Sow scored 16 and had a
game-high 10 rebounds. Reserve Forward Bron Groomes made all seven of
his shots and finished with 15 points and six rebounds in 16 minutes
of play. Guard Anthony Bolton made only one of 10 shots, but had five
assists.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Reshard Alonza scored 18 points and had nine rebounds and
guard Anthony Adams had 17 points and six rebounds for Morris Brown
(1-3), which is 5-28 since moving to Division I last season.</LD>
<TE>   Fullerton, which held only six halftime leads last season, led,
40-26, at the break and pushed that to 55-31 with 12:40 left on a
two-hand putback by reserve Jamal Forcheney. Morris Brown never got
closer than 13 points after that.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to have that lead," Daniels said. "But it was even
better that we had a lead at five minutes and a bigger lead at 10
minutes and then 15 minutes. We sustained the lead. We didn't have
many of those last season."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Fullerton's largest over a Division I opponent
since the Titans defeated San Jose State by 24 points early in the
1999-2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans, who play host to Pepperdine on Wednesday, held a 46-33
rebounding edge over the Wolverines, but made only four of 18
three-point attempts, with Bolton missing all six of his. Fullerton
has made only nine of 46 three-pointers overall.</TE>

<HD>Father's Illness Always on Mind</HD>
<DH>Visit to local hospital reminds King forward Laperriere of
his dad's two-year fight with pancreatic cancer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings' annual visit to Children's Hospital to distribute toys for
the holidays, always an emotionally draining experience for the
players, was especially wrenching Monday for veteran forward Ian
Laperriere.</LD>
<LD>   Laperriere's 55-year-old father, Michel, was diagnosed two years
ago with pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Though pancreatic cancer barely ranks among the 10 most commonly
diagnosed cancers, according to the Web site pancreatica.org, the
median survival rate from the time of diagnosis until death is
arguably the worst of any of the cancers. Untreated, it's about 3 1/2
months; with good treatment, it's about six months.</LD>
<TE>   Michel Laperriere has lasted more than 27 months since he was
diagnosed in August 2000, surviving through surgery, chemotherapy and
radiation, and was doing fine until about two months ago, when
doctors found a tumor in his neck.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a reflective Ian Laperriere who, along with teammates
Jason Allison, Bryan Smolinski, Mathieu Schneider and Mattias
Norstrom, visited youngsters afflicted with cancer and blood
diseases. Other players, all wearing their purple road jerseys,
visited children in other parts of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you think," Laperriere said. "Especially in the unit
where we are right now, most of the kids have cancer. It hit my
family two years ago and I know what their families are going
through. My dad's not a kid, but he's my dad and I love him in the
same way these kids are loved by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough just to walk around. I don't know what these kids are
going through, but I know they're suffering and it's no fun to see
that."</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere has spent a lot of time in hospitals during the last
week, and not only because he suffered a concussion in a Nov. 23
victory over the Dallas Stars, an injury that has kept him out of the
lineup the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   His father, who flew down two weeks ago for a visit after seven
weeks of chemotherapy in his hometown of Montreal, was hospitalized
last week after his latest round of chemotherapy sessions left him
anemic.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all worried it was something worse," Laperriere said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, though, Michel Laperriere was back at his son's
Manhattan Beach home. His breathing was no longer labored, as it had
been early last week, and he was energetic enough to play with his
8-month-old grandson, Tristan.</TE>
<TE>   But he leaves today. Another round of chemotherapy starts
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hard," his son said, eyes rimmed red as he fought back
tears. "I think about my dad every day. We're a close family. I get
emotional talking about it because ever since I was little he always
supported me in everything."</TE>
<TE>   Through the uncertainty, before his injury, the feisty Laperriere
continued to play his usual combative game for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," he said. "But the way my parents raised me, it's
like, 'You're a professional. You do your stuff, and you worry about
that later, at home.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think the rink has been really good for me, being around my
teammates. They know what I'm going through.... All my teammates and
coaching staff, they know what my dad's going through and they try to
support me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's difficult, he said, being so far away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad will talk to me and say, 'I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine,' "
he said. "I'll talk to my sister and he's not fine. He doesn't want
me to worry about anything."</TE>
<TE>   But worry he does, of course.</TE>
<TE>   His father, a large man, used to play football in Canada, and on
Sunday father and son watched NFL games on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I know everybody does that," said the son, "but when your dad's
sick, you appreciate those moments so much more."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics got their shots to start falling in the third
quarter and their defense on track in the fourth.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Pierce scored 18 of his 27 points after halftime and Eric
Williams had a season-high 21 points, and the Celtics won for the
sixth time in seven games, beating the Orlando Magic, 102-97, Monday
night at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a huge win," said Pierce, who also had 10 rebounds and eight
assists. "Coming in here against a quality team -- the Magic have
been playing really well lately -- to get a win on [the second game
of] a back to back, this is one of our biggest wins of the season."</LD>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady, his first step slowed after turning an
ankle early, scored 25 points. Grant Hill had 22 points and a
season-high 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 113, Toronto 102 -- Steve Nash scored seven of his 25
points during a key fourth-quarter run, and the Mavericks extended
their home winning streak to nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki had 23 points for the Mavericks, who improved their
league-best record to 16-1.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Williams scored 27 points for the Raptors, who lost for the
seventh time in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   New York 125, Cleveland 93 -- Allan Houston scored 29 points at
New York and the Knicks dealt the Cavaliers their 15th consecutive
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Dajuan Wagner had 25 points and 10 assists for the Cavaliers, who
are closing in on the longest losing streak in franchise history --
19 games in 1981-82.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 102, Indiana 91 -- John Stockton had 22 points and 10
assists, and Karl Malone had 21 points, and the Jazz held Reggie
Miller scoreless at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who played his fifth game since returning from an ankle
bruise, did not score in a game for the first time since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz won for the seventh time in eight games and ended
Indiana's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 100, Phoenix 90 -- Travis Best made a tying layup with 37

<HD>Remlinger, Cubs Close to Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliever Mike Remlinger intends to leave the Atlanta Braves to sign
with the Chicago Cubs, the Associated Press reported.</LD>
<LD>   The contract is contingent on the left-hander passing a physical
and an announcement could come as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is for three years and worth about $11 million, a person
familiar with the talks said on the condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   "We're really close and should have something done in a day or
so," Remlinger said Monday by telephone, acknowledging he will be in
Chicago today to take a physical.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger would bolster a Cub bullpen that blew many leads last
season and squandered 25 saves. He was 7-3 with a 1.99 earned-run
average in 73 games last season, his fourth with the Braves.
Remlinger, 36, has appeared in 440 games -- all but 59 as a reliever
-- with a 44-41 record and a 3.80 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger came up to the major leagues with the San Francisco
Giants in 1991, when new Cub Manager Dusty Baker was the Giants'
hitting coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Euclides Rojas, 35, the career saves leader for Cuba's national
team, was hired by Boston as bullpen coach.</TE>
<TE>   Rojas defected from Cuba in 1994 and played briefly in Florida's
minor league system before becoming a minor league instructor for the
Marlins and Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Callaway Golf has been sued by a golf professional and his
business partner, who accuse the company of stealing the idea for
what has become known as a two-ball putter.</TE>
<TE>   Clark Collins, the pro, and Patrick Riley filed suit last week.</TE>
<TE>   They contend Callaway and its subsidiary company, Odyssey,
breached a contract, violated confidentiality agreements and
misrepresented themselves during negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Callaway were not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   ABC's coverage of USC's football rout of Notre Dame on Saturday
drew a Nielsen rating of 12.6 with a 24 share in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   USC-UCLA the previous week drew a 9.6/23. The national rating for
the USC-Notre Dame game, which was shown in 70% of the country, was a
7.7/13.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. men's softball player Shawn Mandolesi has been suspended for
two years after testing positive for steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Crum, who coached Louisville to two NCAA men's basketball
titles, will return to the San Fernando Valley on Saturday to have
his jersey number retired at the game between Pierce and West L.A.
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Crum played and coached at Pierce before becoming an assistant to
John Wooden at UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Gionta's Goal Lifts Devils in Overtime</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Brian Gionta scored at 2:51 of overtime and Martin Brodeur earned his
third consecutive shutout over Philadelphia as the New Jersey Devils
beat the Flyers, 1-0, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Devils lead the Atlantic Division by a point over the Flyers
and two points over Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Gionta one-timed a shot from the slot past Roman Cechmanek for the
winner.</LD>
<TE>   Brodeur, who has shut out the Flyers for 207 minutes, finished
with 26 saves, including a game-saving stop on a breakaway by Simon
Gagne only seconds before Gionta's winner.</TE>
<TE>   It was Brodeur's 57th career shutout and second this season --
both against the Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the fourth consecutive 1-0 game between the teams,
with the Devils, and Brodeur, winning the last three.</TE>
<TE>   The loss overshadowed a strong performance by Cechmanek, who made
28 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Cechmanek stopped with his stick a shot by Patrik Elias during a
power play in the second period -- New Jersey's best scoring
opportunity in regulation -- and a slap shot from close range by John
Madden with 30 seconds left in the third period.</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Rally Turns Back 49ers</HD>
<DH>Senior forward Miggins ignites a late run and Waves
overcome a seven-point deficit to defeat Long Beach State, 65-63, for
their first victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepperdine's basketball team finally has a reason to smile.</LD>
<LD>   After losing their first two games and suffering the emotional
loss of center Will Kimble, the Waves reversed their recent
misfortunes Monday night by hanging on for a 65-63 victory over Long
Beach State in front of 1,914 at the Pyramid in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Senior forward Jimmy Miggins ignited a late run for Pepperdine
(1-2), which overcame a seven-point deficit in the last five minutes
and withstood the torrid shooting of Long Beach guard Tony Darden,
who scored a game-high 24 points by tying a school record with eight
three-point baskets.</LD>
<TE>   "It was real important," Miggins said of the victory. "We got off
to a bad start, but we know it's a long season. We got the monkey off
our back now. If we continue to focus and play hard, I think we'll be
all right."</TE>
<TE>   Miggins scored seven points during an 11-0 run that turned a 61-54
Pepperdine deficit into a 65-61 lead with 1:40 to play. Kevin Roberts
made a shot in the lane to pull Long Beach within two points with
1:08 left.</TE>
<TE>   Miggins bought Pepperdine some time by rebounding his miss, but
Wave guard Devin Montgomery missed a one-and-one free throw with 8.8
seconds left. Long Beach forward Lemi Williams got the rebound, drove
the court and missed a 10-foot bank shot at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed it," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   It was good news for a team coping with a decimated front line.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble was diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening heart
condition that caused him to pass out at practice last Tuesday. He is
seeking additional medical opinions, but for now his basketball
career is considered over.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the 6-foot-10 Kimble and the absence of 6-9 forward
Glen McGowan, who sat out his third consecutive game because of a
nagging knee injury, has forced Westphal to juggle his lineup.
McGowan is scheduled to have an MRI exam today.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the game, Pepperdine appeared headed for its first 0-3
start since 1973. The Waves missed five of their first six free
throws, committed turnovers and fell behind, 21-7, when Darden hit
the third of his five three-point baskets in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "They put us in a big hole," Westphal said. "Darden was
unbelievable. You can't shoot that good if there's nobody guarding
you. And sometimes there wasn't anybody guarding him."</TE>
<TE>   The Waves rallied to tie the score, 33-33, behind the shooting of
sophomore guard Terrance Johnson and an aggressive press. Johnson
made three of four three-point baskets and Pepperdine forced the
49ers into 14 turnovers in the first half, which ended with Long
Beach leading, 36-33, on a Darden three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves opened the second half with a 10-0 run and led until
Darden made successive three-point baskets to ignite a 13-0 run that
provided Long Beach (1-2) a 61-54 lead with 4:32 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson led Pepperdine with 18 points, forward Boomer Brazzle had
13 and Miggins scored 11.</TE>

<HD>Price Support</HD>
<DH>Washington State players fiercely loyal to their
down-to-earth coach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howie Stalwick</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>The strangest thing about Mike Price -- besides that he kissed his
future wife under the porch in the first grade and never had another
girlfriend, or that he wasn't fired, despite never putting together
consecutive winning seasons in his first 21 years as a head coach, or
that he started this season with a record of (yawn) exactly .500 --
is that he's so utterly, completely ... normal.</LD>
<LD>   Often, it seems, coaches of national college football powers are
so caught up in themselves and their teams that the real world
escapes them.</LD>
<LD>   Price, however, often looks and acts like the proud grandfather he
is. He's 56, graying where he's not balding and putting on just a bit
of a belly, but he's still got the smile, the energy and the
personality to get along famously with the teenagers and
20-somethings he coaches at Washington State.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think any coach is as in touch with his players as Coach
is," defensive tackle Rien Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jason Gesser said, "He's a players' coach all the way.
It's just the way he acts, the way he does things.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I came here on my recruiting visit. I went into a
store with Coach Price, and everyone in the store went, 'Hey, there's
Coach Price.' He didn't know who they were, but he'd go and have a
five-minute conversation with them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's good for the community, the football program and the
school."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention his staff. Coaching college football requires long
hours, but Price sends his assistant coaches home for dinner every
night. And if a coach's son or daughter has a game, or a recital, or
something else important in the child's life, chances are the
assistant will get the time off.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of coaches who understand how important that
is; that there's other things besides football," said Mike
Levenseller, the Cougars' offensive coordinator. "It makes you a
better football coach too. It's a lot easier to work into the night
if you know you can get away to watch your 13-year-old throw the ball
around."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Kasey Dunn, who coaches the Cougars' running
backs and is special teams coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just the best person to work with," Dunn said. "You see him
at practice, always smiling -- he's exactly that way when he comes to
our staff meetings. He always keeps it light, whether you win or
lose."</TE>
<TE>   Price said he always wanted to be a football coach, dating back to
childhood, when Walt Price, his father, coached Everett Junior
College in Everett, Wash. Price learned a lot about coaching from his
father, but he said his coaching philosophy also was influenced when
he was a graduate assistant with the 1969 Cougar freshman team and
one of his players was killed in a car crash.</TE>
<TE>   "That really got me to thinking," Price said. "I never told that
player how much he meant to me and how much I loved him. I decided
then to make sure my players know how much I care for them."</TE>
<TE>   Price has spent his entire 34-year coaching career at the college
level -- 1969-70 at Washington State, 1971-73 at Puget Sound, 1974-77
back at Washington State, 1978-80 at Missouri, 1981-88 as head coach
at Weber State, and since 1989 as head coach at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the college player-coach relationship you have," said
Price. "The growth; molding a teenager into a young man. But coaches
on pro teams make so much money, the NFL is something you might
consider."</TE>
<TE>   Price said he's been contacted by NFL teams regarding openings for
offensive coordinators or quarterback coaches, but has received no
firm offers. He said he's rejected other college head coaching jobs
while holding his two head coaching positions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say who I turned down," he said. "That's not fair
to them."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Denver and raised in Everett, Mike was the youngest of
three boys in the Price household. He grew up a Cougar fan, dreaming
of following brother Geoff as a football player at Washington State.
Geoff now sells real estate in California; the late Walt Jr. was an
artist. Price played a year for his father at Everett, redshirted one
season and played a year at Washington State, then finished up at
Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   He played quarterback and safety in college, as he had at Everett
High, where he competed for playing time with Oregon State Coach
Dennis Erickson. The two have long been close friends, and it was
Price who replaced Erickson as head coach at Washington State when
Erickson left for Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Price began the 2002 season with a 119-119 record, 73-75 at
Washington State. Though the Cougars never experienced consecutive
winning seasons under Price until the last two -- and finished last
in the Pacific 10 Conference from 1998-2000 -- Price said he's always
been staunchly supported by the administration. It didn't hurt when
he was named national coach of the year after guiding the 1997 team
to Washington State's first conference championship and Rose Bowl
appearance in 67 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it here," Price said. "Having three athletic directors,
two presidents and numerous vice presidents in between causes you to
sometimes wonder, 'What's going on?' Other times, it kind of
stimulates you."</TE>
<TE>   Price still seems hopelessly in love with Joyce, his childhood
sweetheart and wife of 36 years. They married when he was still
playing at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "She quit school [at Washington] to put me through college," Price
said. Joyce also was kind enough to produce two boys who wound up
playing and coaching for her husband. Aaron remains at Washington
State, where he coaches the receivers; Eric, a former Weber State
player and Cougar assistant coach, is now an assistant with the NFL's
New York Jets. Daughter Angie is the wife of Jim Fry, athletic
director at Spokane's Rogers High School and the son of former
Washington State sports information director Dick Fry.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Price signed a five-year contract that automatically
adds a year every time the Cougars post a winning record. He's the
only coach to have guided the Cougars to more than one bowl game --
this season's will be his fifth. The Cougars' No. 3 national ranking
before Nov. 23 overtime loss to Washington was the highest in school
history; and if the 9-2 Cougars beat UCLA on Saturday, they will tie
for the Pac-10 title, clinch a Rose Bowl berth and equal the school
record of 10 victories that Price's teams have tied twice already
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Price seems likely to stay at Washington State long enough to
break the school record for coaching victories, 93, held by the
legendary Babe Hollingbery. Price is in second place with 82 -- but
he's already bought a place where he plans to retire on Coeur d'Alene
Lake in Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll be doing this in 10 years," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Cougar coaches and players hope that isn't the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Price is like a brother for me at times, like a father to
me at other times," Gesser said. "He's done so much for me."</TE>
<TE>   Levenseller said, "I don't just work for him; we all work with
him. He's our boss, but he listens to us. He values our opinion. He
very definitely has veto power, but he does listen to us."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Real Madrid of Spain and Olimpia of Paraguay, both founded in 1902
and celebrating their centenary this year, will play today at the
International Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, in the annual
Toyota/Intercontinental Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The game, between the champions of Europe and South America, gives
Real Madrid the chance to win the mythical world club championship
for the third time.</LD>
<LD>   It also gives Ronaldo the opportunity to complete a rare double in
the same stadium. He scored twice against Germany to win the World
Cup for Brazil in Yokohama in June and now has his sights set on this
trophy.</LD>
<TE>   "It is my chance to return to the scene with Real Madrid and I
hope I can repeat what I did with Brazil," he told the Spanish daily
Marca.</TE>
<TE>   Real's previous victories were against Penarol of Uruguay in 1960
and Vasco da Gama of Brazil in 1998. It lost to Boca Juniors of
Argentina in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Olimpia is making its third Toyota/Intercontinental Cup
appearance. It defeated Malmo of Sweden in 1979 and lost to AC Milan
of Italy in 1990. Coach Nery Pumpido won a World Cup with Argentina
in 1986 and is not in awe of the Spanish team.</TE>
<TE>   "Real Madrid are the best team in the world. So what?" he said.
"We have great respect for them, but at the same time we are
confident we can win. I have said that all along."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Fan Killed</TE>
<TE>   Hours after his team had won the Argentine championship for the
first time in eight years, Independiente fan Miguel Angel Franco, 42,
was shot to death by a supporter of rival Boca Juniors, police said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant, identified only as a 36-year-old man, began firing
two handguns after an argument in Villa Itati, about 20 miles outside
Buenos Aires. Franco was struck and killed and another fan
celebrating with him was injured.</TE>
<TE>   The shooter was arrested and charged with "murder, injury, using a
firearm and resisting arrest," police said.</TE>
<TE>   Krough Retires</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Mogens Krough, who played on Denmark's 1992 European
Championship-winning team and its France '98 World Cup squad,
announced his retirement at 39, after playing his last game Sunday
for Brondby IF, a team with which he won three Danish league titles.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Krough's international career was spent as a backup to
Peter Schmeichel, limiting him to 10 games for his country.</TE>
<TE>   South African Violence</TE>
<TE>   South Africa's shortcomings as a potential World Cup host nation
were again exposed over the weekend when fan violence erupted at FNB
Stadium in Johannesburg during a cup final between Jomo Cosmos and
Kaizer Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Players and game officials were pelted with bottles and other
debris, and the incident sparked angry words between league and
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole issue of security surrounding our football games, or
major games, is just not adequate," Trevor Phillips, head of South
Africa's Premier League, told the South African Broadcasting Corp.
(SABC). "There are not enough trained security people in the country,
not enough coordination between the police and the security."</TE>
<TE>   Ngconde Balfour, the country's Sports Minister, criticized
Phillips during Saturday's match.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very angry, quite disgusted, at the scenes from FNB,"
Balfour told the SABC. "I am not sure why Trevor Phillips and all the
officials did not stop the game and allow these thuggish people to go
home."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips hit back on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all very well government ministers ... moaning about what
are we doing about this, what are we doing about that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have, throughout the country, a total lack of infrastructure
as far as soccer is concerned."</TE>
<TE>   South Africa is bidding to stage the World Cup in 2010.</TE>

<LD>Add one more absurdity to the bowl scenario.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA could find itself in a better bowl game playing against a
better opponent by losing to Washington State on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A UCLA loss would put Washington State in the Rose Bowl as Pacific
10 Conference champion, leaving second-place USC to accept an
invitation to a BCS game -- probably either the Orange Bowl or Sugar
Bowl.</LD>

Bowl prefers UCLA, the Bruins would head to San Diego for the Dec. 27
game.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Bowl contract allows it to choose any bowl-eligible
Pac-10 team if two teams from the conference gain BCS bids. And the
Holiday could very well choose UCLA because of its proximity to San
Diego and a solid television potential.</TE>
<TE>   However, a UCLA victory would put USC in the Rose Bowl and knock
Washington State to the Holiday. The Sun Bowl would have first choice
between the teams tied for third -- UCLA and Arizona State -- and the
Insight Bowl would get the other. It is expected that the Sun Bowl
would take Arizona State, leaving UCLA to play in the Insight Bowl on
Dec. 26 at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's opponent in the Holiday would be Oklahoma (if the Sooners
lose Saturday to Colorado) or Kansas State. The non-Pac-10 team in
the Insight Bowl probably will be Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is preparing as if Washington State's Jason Gesser will play
Saturday. The senior quarterback will practice today and split
repetitions all week with backup Matt Kegel.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser, who has passed for 5,932 yards the last two seasons,
suffered a high ankle sprain in the Cougars' triple-overtime loss to
Washington on Nov. 23. He is undergoing six hours of treatment a day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 50-50, and I'm staying firm on that until Saturday," Coach
Mike Price said. "We're not going to play him if he's going to get
himself hurt. He has to be able to move. He has to be pretty healthy
to play."</TE>
<TE>   Price admitted that he plans to keep UCLA off balance and not
announce until game time whether Gesser will play.</TE>
<TE>   "[UCLA defensive coordinator] Phil Snow doesn't need any more
information," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of UCLA's talented freshman class, but the four
Bruins chosen to the All-Pac-10 team are seniors -- tight end Mike
Seidman, tackle Mike Saffer, cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. and punter
Nate Fikse.</TE>
<TE>   Manning was picked for the third year in a row and Fikse is a
repeat choice.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo said he was disappointed that junior defensive
end Dave Ball, who has 10.5 sacks, was not a first-team pick.</TE>
<TE>   Ball made the second team along with tailback Tyler Ebell, tackle
Bryce Bohlander, guard Eyoseph Efseaff and linebacker Marcus Reese.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin receiver Tab Perry is questionable with a high ankle sprain,
defensive tackle C.J. Niusulu is out because of appendicitis and
receiver Ryan Smith will have ankle surgery Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Utah Eyeing Chow</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many members of USC's coaching staff, offensive coordinator Norm
Chow hit the recruiting trail Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojan offensive coordinator is a target as well as
pursuer.</LD>
<LD>   Chow is regarded as a leading candidate for the head coaching job
at Utah, which fired Ron McBride last week.</LD>
<TE>   Chow, who played offensive line at Utah from 1965-67 and coached
at Brigham Young for 27 seasons, was in Utah on Monday. Chow, who has
a home in Provo, said he was there to visit a high school recruit.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said he had been contacted by Utah representatives but
declined to comment about whether he met with them.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hill, Utah's athletic director, refused to comment about
Chow or other candidates for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We are early in the process," Hill said. "We're looking at trying
to have somebody before the Christmas holiday. We want to do it as
quickly as possible and as thoroughly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Chow has said that he is not looking for a head coaching position,
but would listen to schools that contacted him.</TE>
<TE>   Utah probably would have to significantly increase its financial
commitment to lure Chow, who earns about $300,000. McBride was paid
$310,000 last season.</TE>

<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said the Trojans' ascent to the No. 4 spot
in the bowl championship series standings was a reward for playing
the toughest schedule in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real pleased because it shows the respect for the people that
we've been playing against to get to where we are," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans can earn an automatic berth in the Rose Bowl if UCLA
defeats Washington State on Saturday. They also are eligible for
berths in the Orange, Sugar and, possibly, the Fiesta bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll watch how that UCLA-Washington State game goes, and then
kind of start to zero in after the weekend," Carroll said. "We're
really excited to see what the events allow."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said his first choice remains the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go to the Rose Bowl," he said. "If it should happen
that the Fiesta Bowl is there, that would supersede everything else.
The Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl are also great games to play in and it
would be fantastic to be a part of either one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I told the team. 'We don't know what's going on yet so
don't worry about it. When the time comes, we'll have some fun with
it and figure out where we're headed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The postseason awards blitz began with quarterback Carson Palmer
and Troy Polamalu selected to the All-American team chosen by the
Football Writers Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, a finalist for the Thorpe award, was chosen to the FWAA
All-American team for the second consecutive season despite missing
most of two games because of a high ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer also was selected as co-offensive player of the year in the
Pacific 10 Conference and as one of three finalists for the Davey
O'Brien National Quarterback Award. Ken Dorsey of Miami and Brad
Banks of Iowa are the other finalists.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, Polamalu, junior offensive tackle Jacob Rogers and
sophomore linebacker Matt Grootegoed were selected first-team
all-conference by Pac-10 coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer shared offensive player of the year honors with Washington
State quarterback Jason Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Mike Williams was named freshman of the year and was
one of seven Trojans selected to the second team. Others were flanker
Keary Colbert, running back Justin Fargas, offensive lineman Zach
Wilson, defensive end Kenechi Udeze, defensive lineman Mike Patterson
and safety DeShaun Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs was named defensive
player of the year. Jeff Tedford of California was coach of the year.</TE>
