<HD>A good-natured look at a family in cross-cultural chaos</HD>
<DH>In Rod Pulido's "The Flip Side," one Filipino sibling
explores roots, one copies whites and one emulates blacks.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rod Pulido's "The Flip Side" takes an affectionate, good-natured and
revealing look at a suburban L.A. Filipino American family who live
in a spacious, comfortable modern-style home in a pleasant upscale
tract. The Delacruzes (Abe Pagtama and Ester Pulido) are a
successful, settled middle-aged couple, both of whom work and have
provided well for there three children. They're financially secure
but not rich.</LD>
<LD>   It's summer but only their daughter Marivic (Ronalee Par) is
working, at a mall. Pretty and tart-tongued, Mari talks like a Valley
girl, is self-absorbed and is so eager to be seen as all-American she
would love to be able to rid herself of any traces of her Filipino
heritage. Deep into basketball and rap music, Davis (Jose Saenz) is a
height-challenged NBA hopeful and emulates African American teens in
style and speech. While Mari identifies with whites and Davis with
blacks, the reflective, sensitive Darius (Verwin Gatpandan) has
discovered his mission is to embrace Filipino culture.</LD>
<LD>   In short, Pulido is posing the familiar cultural identity issue
commonly experienced by young people of immigrant parents, but he
does so in a deftly compassionate manner. As a first-time filmmaker
Pulido has written a script a tad too talky, but his pacing is pretty
good. He also has hit just the right tone to express some serious
observations with humor and compassion.</LD>
<TE>   Darius occasionally carries some of his notions of ethnic fidelity
to extremes, such as wearing a traditional Filipino loin cloth, but
he is on to something. He finds that his siblings know virtually
nothing of Filipino culture --or for that matter, Filipino American
contributions to U.S. culture and society -- and couldn't care less.</TE>
<TE>   Caught up so long in making a good life in America for themselves
and their children, his parents have grown largely indifferent to
their heritage. Touchingly, Darius has reached out to his grandfather
(Peping Baclig), a World War II veteran who has withdrawn into
himself and secretly plays the lottery in hope of winning money for a
visit to the Philippines. When Darius asks his mother how long it has
been since his grandfather has visited his homeland, she replies,
"Oh, maybe 40 years -- it's not important."</TE>
<TE>   But of course it is, as are the other facets of cross-cultural
identity that in some ways might verge on the painful had not Pulido
viewed them with such a light touch. The first film by a Filipino
American filmmaker to premiere at Sundance, "The Flip Side" is a
small picture of many satisfactions.</TE>

<HD>'Guard!' goes for substance, not spoof</HD>
<DH>Director Phillipe de Broca's swashbuckler is a spirited
triumph of wit and daring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the French New Wave pioneers, Philippe de Broca is the least
serious, bringing a breath of fresh air to the romantic comedy and
injecting the adventure movie -- most famously "That Man from Rio"
with Jean-Paul Belmondo -- with an inspired, irreverent comic touch.
Throughout the '60s and into the '70s, De Broca was an art-house
staple but then faded from American screens.</LD>
<LD>   He kept on working, though less frequently and mainly in TV, so it
is a pleasure and surprise to have his 1998 "On Guard!" surface at
last and prove to be arguably his most substantial film. De Broca has
kept his light touch in bringing to the screen the 1857
roman-feuilleton, a novel commissioned for newspaper publication in
serial form. "Le Bossu" (The Hunchback) was written by Paul Feval, a
contemporary of Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, "On Guard!" has been made much in the same spirit as
Richard Lester's 1974 version of "The Three Musketeers" in that it
has been made by a filmmaker with a sense of humor and an affection
for the swashbuckler; but resisting the easy spoof, De Broca has made
it as emotionally engaging as it is amusing.</LD>
<TE>   This is crucial, for the Regency-era "On Guard!," an enchanting,
richly detailed period piece, is an epic tale of love and revenge.
The time is the turn of the 17th century, with the devil-may-care
Lagardere (Daniel Auteuil) emerging as one of the finest swordsman in
the land. He crosses swords with the dashing, handsome Duc de Nevers
(Vincent Perez), whom he ends up serving.</TE>
<TE>   A brilliant, innovative fighter all but illiterate, Nevers is a
nobleman of hauteur and naivete. He has taken under his wing an
impoverished, homely cousin Gonzague (Fabrice Luchini), whose true
love, Blanche de Caylus (Claire Nebout), he blithely stole for a
brief fling before she returned to her father's distant castle. Just
as casually he resists Gonzague's plea to invest in the stock
offering by another relative, the Regent Philippe d'Orleans (Philippe
Noiret), nephew of the late Louis XIV, to finance the colonization of
the Louisiana Territory. To Nevers, such an investment smacks of the
shopkeeper mentality; besides, he'll probably die soon enough in a
duel, allowing his cousin, his sole heir, to do what he wants with
his fortune.</TE>
<TE>   After Nevers learns that Blanche has given birth to their child,
Lagardere insists on accompanying the duke on his journey to restore
her honor.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far the rollicking gusto brings back fond memories of De
Broca's "Cartouche" of 40 years ago, but tragedy turns "On Guard!"
into a revenge odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   Even as it deepens with pathos, "On Guard!" never loses its energy
and humor, growing ever more gallant in spirit.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the foremost actors of his generation, Auteuil easily
embraces the athleticism, wit and cunning of Lagardere, who
eventually assumes the disguise that provides the French title.</TE>
<TE>   "On Guard!" is a splendid entertainment, young in spirit but
accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of
ease that comes only with experience.</TE>

<HD>Getting to the heart of voter apathy</HD>
<DH>Where Have All the Voters Gone? By Martin P. Wattenberg;
Harvard University Press: 224 pages, 18.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Day</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why don't more Americans vote? From 1920, when women first started
voting, the percentage of voting-age citizens who voted for president
rose steadily to a high, in 1960, of 62.8%. It has been falling
since; in 1996 it was 48.9%; in 2000, 51.2%. Tuesday's low voter
turnout, especially in California, is no exception to that trend.
Even as registering to vote has been made easier, Martin P.
Wattenberg explains, the decline has continued.</LD>
<LD>   "Where Have All the Voters Gone?" is a thorough review of the
recent academic studies of the question. A professor of political
science at UC Irvine, Wattenberg assesses the studies and adds a few
conclusions on how to get more voters to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   Does it matter that more people don't vote? Wattenberg argues that
it does. He believes that the interests of those who vote less in
proportion to their chunk of the potential electorate, especially
young people, are shortchanged by the political system. It is a
circle, he says: Politicians don't expect young people to vote,
therefore candidates don't appeal to them, therefore young people
don't find much to interest them in voting.</LD>
<TE>   He argues that the same effect extends to poor and uneducated
voters. Wattenberg believes, with many observers, that the decline in
the importance of political parties is a major cause of the decline
of voting. Before parties grew strong in the 1840s, voter
participation was sporadic. The parties marshaled interest groups
into powerful forces, and they gave voice and direction to the
immigrants entering American life in rapidly increasingly numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The rising level of education, and the increasing focus on
candidates, especially fostered by television, has diminished the
role of parties, Wattenberg writes. He doesn't offer prescriptions
for returning to the old party system. He does, though, put forth
some modest plans.</TE>
<TE>   Wattenberg argues that election day should be made a national
holiday to encourage people too busy to vote. To those who say that
adding another federal holiday would be wasteful, he endorses former
President Jimmy Carter's proposal of making Veterans Day election
day.</TE>
<TE>   Wattenberg thinks that American ballots are so complicated that
they resemble SAT tests, and so frighten people away. Long lists of
candidates and a multitude of state propositions and constitutional
amendments have changed the ballot from the means for the voter to
express his will toward a general direction of policy -- as by voting
a straight party ticket -- to an examination of his opinions on a
wide variety of subjects of which he may know little.</TE>
<TE>   Among democracies, Wattenberg notes, Switzerland and the United
States stand at the bottom of voter participation. In both cases, he
says, voters are asked to decide a large number of public questions
themselves, instead of through their representatives.</TE>
<TE>   In advocating simpler ballots stripped of complex questions of
public policy, Wattenberg ignores the reason such ballots came about.
They were inspired by the Progressive movement to bypass state
legislatures commonly corrupted by business interests and to put more
power directly into the hands of the people.</TE>
<TE>   In California, it was not until the election of Hiram Johnson as
governor in 1911 and the reform of the ballot that the overwhelming
power of the Southern Pacific Railroad and its allies was curbed. If
the California ballot has become a poster boy of complexity, it, with
its exemplary explanatory pamphlets, is also a model of a political
system's ability to take its voters seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Are legislatures now so free of corruption that they can safely be
entrusted with the public business without the check of a direct vote
of the citizens? Wattenberg does not address this question. Nor does
he examine the relative power of the money used to influence a
legislature through campaign contributions and the money used to
influence the voters through TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Wattenberg considers making voting compulsory, as Australia did in
1922, but he rejects the idea as incompatible with America's
individualistic political culture. He believes that Congress could
constitutionally require television and radio stations, as a
condition of their use of the public airwaves, to make air time
available equally to all candidates, but believes that Congress will
not do it.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage more voting, Wattenberg is thus left with two
proposals, the dubious one of cutting complex issues from the ballot
and the simpler one of making election day a holiday, say on Veterans
Day.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Britney Spears wore hers to all the spring shows in New York in
September, and there was no shortage of them during Los Angeles
fashion week either. What's the deal with newsboy caps? They conceal
a bad hair day, keep a bald head warm (the stylist Philip Bloch knows
that) and convey a tamely rebellious attitude. The caps, which are
associated with the youngsters who hawked hot-off-the-presses
headlines back when kids had jobs, have again become a fashion item.
They were popularized by child actor Jackie Coogan in the silent film
era and revived during the 1960s Carnaby Street craze. Part of a
general resurgence in hats, today's newsboy caps have been updated in
patchwork to fit the bohemian trend, corduroy for preppies and
leather for those with an affinity for 1970s urban soul.</LD>

<HD>L.A. newscasts score low in a national study</HD>
<DH>Local stations' coverage puts the market 16th out of 17,
with KCBS-TV faring the best of the big three.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think local TV newscasts aren't particularly good, you're not
alone. Los Angeles ranks 16th out of 17 markets examined in a
national study released Thursday that looked at 53 television news
operations. KCBS-TV produces the highest-scoring 11 p.m. newscast of
the three network-owned stations in town, but it and competitors
KNBC-TV and KABC-TV, were still ranked as average, with each station
receiving the same grade: C</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, associated
with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, called
the L.A. market one of the weakest in the U.S.; no local station
scored better than a D in enterprise reporting.</LD>
<LD>   KCBS and KABC's C grades marked an improvement over their scores
in last year's study, when both received Ds. KNBC was awarded a C
last year.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, KCBS ranked 43rd of the 53 stations in the survey. KABC
ranked 44th and KNBC was ranked 45th. The top-rated station was the 6
p.m. newscast at WHDH, the NBC affiliate in Boston. The lowest ranked
newscast was the 10 p.m. news at KMGH in Denver, an ABC affiliate.
Overall, the lowest ranked market was Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   The report studied the most popular news time slot in each city
over two nonconsecutive weeks -- March 4-8 and April 29-May 3, which
was during ratings sweeps -- and used criteria developed by a team of
veteran news professionals. The criteria included the breadth of a
newscast's coverage, its focus on key issues and ideas, and how
closely it reflected the community.</TE>
<TE>   KCBS offered a significant mix of viewpoints in its stories and
also was the station most likely to get a comment from one of the
main figures in a story, the study said. But only 8% of the station's
stories examined significant issues or public policy, while a
"whopping" 26% focused on unusual events. Many stories also quoted
unnamed sources or sources mentioned only in passing.</TE>
<TE>   KABC was the least likely of the three stations to broadcast
stories aimed at specific demographic groups, according to the study.
But the station was deemed to be the most likely to focus on everyday
crime. It also aired several national and international stories
without providing local context. Further, it was called the station
least likely to air stories on social issues.</TE>
<TE>   The survey said KNBC was the station most likely to give local
context to national news stories and least likely to use stories from
news wires. Its newscasts were also the most likely to get
"person-on-the-street" reaction on stories. However, KNBC was also
the station least likely to air political and business news, and the
most likely to cover stories with an anchor voice-over rather than
showing a reporter at the scene.</TE>

Based on a story by Cassandra de Jesus, and written by Ferrara and
Scott Pardo, "R Xmas" tracks some 24 tense hours in the life of a New
York City couple known only as "the wife" (a peroxided, very
watchable Drea de Matteo) and "the husband" (Lillo Brancato).</LD>
<LD>   It's Christmas Eve 1992, and the couple are busily shopping for
presents and tending to their drug empire. In between bagging heroin,
the two behave like any other nesters with an enviable ZIP Code: They
worry about the cost of private schooling and teach their daughter
how to pronounce Guggenheim. Then the husband is snatched by
kidnappers, and a stranger (Ice-T) warns that unless the wife comes
up with a sizable ransom, she'll celebrate the holidays as a widow.</LD>
<LD>   That's about it for the story, which isn't calamitous because with
Ferrara what happens next is rarely as important as what's happening
now. An impressionistic blur of scenes and fragments of scenes, "R
Xmas" is a film in which nothing much matters but room tone,
atmosphere and the way De Matteo stands in a kitchen nipping booze.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the frenzy that sometimes fills his frame, Ferrara is a
virtuoso of anti-action: Few directors can put loneliness on screen
as persuasively or capture the eerie quiet of people waiting for
something, anything to happen. It's in moments such as these, when
all sense of time disappears and all that remains are bodies in
motion and Ken Kelsch's limpid cinematography, that you remember just
how good Ferrara can be.</TE>
<TE>   "R Xmas" never reaches the highs (and lows) of a "Bad Lieutenant,"
but unlike the director's last feature, "New Rose Hotel," neither is
it inexplicable. If you look through the new film's haze of mood,
past a narrative that disintegrates with every scene, you can
discover an unlikely fable about New York. Squint and you can even
see traces of the great movie that could have been. (The French
seemed to agree: "R Xmas" premiered at last year's Cannes film
festival.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the flashes of the director's grotesque humor and
pockets of pure weirdness, which are always something to see. It is,
after all, hard to imagine anyone else getting as much mileage out of
a ceramic baby Jesus, a velvet clown painting or the terrifying image
of a "Party Girl" doll caught in a rearview mirror like some ghost of
Christmas past.</TE>
<TE>   Manohla Dargis</TE>
<TE>   "R Xmas": Rated R for strong language, drug content and some
violence. Exclusively at Laemmle's Grande, 345 S. Figueroa St.,
downtown L.A., (213) 617-0268. Running time: 1 hour, 23 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   'Leela' a deft bicultural portrait</TE>
<TE>   Somnath Sen's "Leela" represents a worthy departure from the
culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American
cinema. The film is not without humor or conflict, but it is a
complex coming-of-age story that places a premium on independence and
attacks sexual hypocrisy. The film also celebrates the seductive
vibrancy of Indian music, with songs written by the eminent composer
Gulzar and sung by another maestro, Jagit Singh.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of the striking, regal Leela (Dimple Kapadia) on a
Southern California university campus to teach a course in world
culture studies will have unexpected repercussions for herself and
one of her students, Kris (Amol Mhatre), the 18-year-old son of
another professor, Chaitali (Deepti Naval).</TE>
<TE>   Being far from home in a more relaxed society inevitably brings
Leela a fresh perspective on her unhappy marriage to Nashaad (Vinod
Khanna), a renowned singer-poet and middle-aged roue, an unabashed
womanizer whose wife nevertheless remains his muse. Kris enters
Leela's class with a firmly "more American than American" attitude,
ignorant of his cultural heritage and proud of his ignorance. Yet
Kris is beguiled by this beautiful, lonely woman who opens up to him
the world of his ancestry; at the same time she's eager to learn all
about American culture.</TE>
<TE>   She and Kris are often thrown together because she and his mother
become friends, but while Chaitali is an inspiration to Leela as an
independent woman who sent her own wealthy but unfaithful husband,
Jai (Gulshan Grover), packing years ago, Chaitali is not nearly the
free spirit she believes she is. For his part, Jai, who has remarried
and has little to do with his son, assumes that respect from his son
is automatic.</TE>
<TE>   Production values are first-rate, and Sen, in his feature debut,
makes good use of his locales. Best of all, "Leela" reveals Sen to be
capable of directing a large cast with ease and of unfolding a
complicated plot within a well-paced 96 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   "Leela": Unrated. Mature themes, some language. Exclusively at the
Naz 8 Cinemas, 6440 E. South St., Lakewood, (562) 866-2444. Running
time: 1 hour, 36 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Rising Place' falls victim to nostalgia</TE>
<TE>   Based on the David Armstrong novel, "The Rising Place" is a deeply
felt but flat and unimaginative rendering of a young woman coming of
age in the Mississippi Delta as Pearl Harbor looms. By then Laurel
Holloman's white, titian-haired Emily Hodge has embarrassed her rural
parents (Tess Harper, Gary Cole) and scandalized the community by
becoming pregnant by a soldier who's soon off to war. Although she
agrees to give her baby up for adoption, Emily refuses to go away or
seclude herself during her pregnancy. After the war, Emily's lifelong
best friend, Wilma (Elise Neal), an African American teacher,
persuades her to take a stand against racism as the civil rights era
looms.</TE>
<TE>   The film unfolds in the present as the dying Emily (Alice
Drummond) is comforted by her niece Virginia (Frances Fisher), who
has just uncovered a cache of letters that reveal her aunt to have
been a more courageous and unconventional woman than the content
spinster schoolteacher she has known. Emily, in turn, reveals without
bitterness a cruel, ironic secret.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there are possibilities here, but
writer-producer-director Tom Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to
bring any edge or personality to "The Rising Place" that would set it
apart from other Deep South stories. The film's strongest assets are
its actresses, who include Frances Sternhagen as Virginia's mother,
S. Epatha Merkerson as Wilma's mother and Beth Grant as a kindly cafe
owner. (Jennifer Holliday performs several songs of her own
composition, and one can only wish she had had a real role.)</TE>
<TE>   The ability of women to support one another, even across racial
lines, gives the film its strongest moments, yet even tragedy,
injustice and loss are undercut by "The Rising Place's" impenetrable
coat of sentimental nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   "The Rising Place": Rated PG-13 for elements of violence.
Exclusively at the Music Hall, 9036 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills,
(310) 274-6869. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Departure widens talk radio's gender gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 14 years at KABC-AM (790), and with her air time ebbing, Gloria
Allred vanished altogether from the airwaves last week. The
disappearance of the attorney and liberal commentator didn't just
change the lineup at her station; it also highlighted the overall
scarcity of female voices in talk radio.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically you have all-male radio, all the time, and I think it's
a real disservice to the community," said Susan Estrich, consultant,
commentator and USC law and political science professor, who had her
own KABC program on weekends until 1997. "I'm a believer we need to
have all kinds of voices on the air."</LD>
<LD>   Allred went from having her own show to being paired with
conservative partner Mark Taylor; then their show went from nearly
three hours on weekday mornings to 45 minutes, when Fox commentator
Bill O'Reilly's radio show debuted and ate up their first two hours
earlier this year.</LD>
<TE>   Allred wouldn't discuss how the show was canceled, or where or
when she might reappear on the air. But she said that instead of
serving its presumed audience of conservative white men, talk radio
"should always be trying to expand its base. What is its duty to its
community, or does it have none?"</TE>
<TE>   "It is a problem. It's 2002, and for the most part talk radio in
the nation is still a white male bastion, with rare exceptions,"
Allred said.</TE>
<TE>   KABC executives couldn't be reached for comment. But Allred's
departure may have little to do with gender, said Michael Harrison,
publisher of Talkers magazine, the industry's trade publication. "I
think it's as much a case that she's a liberal."</TE>
<TE>   Sports and conservative politics have long been the staples of
talk radio, and those have traditionally been the purview of men.
"It's not that there aren't women participating in talk radio, or
there aren't women listening to talk radio," Harrison said. "Women
are definitely in the minority in talk radio, which is a holdover of
the early trend of radio. But it's changing slowly."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to Laura Schles- singer, whose nationally syndicated
show has the country's third-largest audience, behind only Rush
Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. She's heard locally from noon to 3 p.m. on
KFI-AM (640), the Southland's top-rated talk station. But she's also
the only woman in its weekday lineup. KABC now has none.</TE>
<TE>   On Talkers' list of the 100 most important radio talk-show hosts
in America, only 14 are women, and three of those -- including Allred
-- are members of male-female duos. In addition, many have only local
programs or niche-subject, once-a-week shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think there is a conspiracy," Harrison said. "Men [also]
have trouble breaking into the talk radio field. It's a slow business
to change."</TE>
<TE>   There may not be a conspiracy, but Estrich contended that "the
nature of discrimination nowadays is unconscious. People put on
people they like to hear, and they like to hear people like them.
It's safe. If 199 other stations are doing it, you're not going to
get fired by doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Allred put it, "The old boys choose the old boys."</TE>
<TE>   But one woman in charge, Robin Bertolucci, director of AM
programming in Los Angeles for Clear Channel Communications, said she
would welcome more female on-air talent. "I'm looking. I'm available.
Call me. I wish I knew why there aren't more," said Bertolucci, who
oversees KFI as well as talker KLAC-AM (570) and Fox sports outlet
KXTA-AM (1150). To be successful in talk radio, a host must be
opinionated, but although that trait is generally accepted in men,
she said, women who display it are often labeled "bitchy."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have a woman who has a sense of playfulness," she
said, but who also has the strength of her opinions.</TE>
<TE>   KLAC features two women on weekdays: personal finance guru Suze
Orman from 1 to 3 p.m., and interviewer Leslie Marshall from 7 to 10
p.m. Christian talk station KKLA-FM (99.5) has Rita Pardue anchoring
a six-hour block starting at 10 a.m. weekdays. And conservative
commentator Laura Ingraham has a show airing weekdays from 9 a.m. to
noon on KPLS-AM (830).</TE>
<TE>   For a while -- six months, anyway -- Los Angeles had an entire
station aimed primarily at women. Disney bought KMPC-AM (710) -- then
the flagship station of baseball's Angels -- and in February 1997
turned it into KTZN, "the Zone," a talk station with a primarily
female air staff and an ad campaign that announced, "Talk radio isn't
just a guy thing." The move was Disney's attempt to reverse the
typical talk-radio demographic, an audience that was 60% male and 40%
female. But after poor ratings the company gave up and that August
converted the station to the children's-oriented Radio Disney format,
which it's been ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was on, there were more women calling, there were more
subjects covered," Estrich said, noting that her show dealt with
topics such as pregnancy, fertility, rape, abortion, the economy and
politics in ways that male hosts don't have the personal experience
to address. Without women on the air, "there are different points of
view that get lost," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Allred said she's concerned about balance and fairness on the
public airwaves, noting the Republicans' election gains and the
possibility of war with Iraq. "If there's all conservative talk-show
hosts, we're going to hear little dissent. That's dangerous at any
time," said Allred, who also is on the board of directors of the
National Assn. of Radio Talk Show Hosts.</TE>

<HD>'The Chase' can't quite keep pace with itself</HD>
<DH>Woodland Hills Community Theatre's production lacks
momentum and emotional depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conflicts far beyond those supplied by the text complicate "The
Chase," the final presentation of Woodland Hills Community Theatre's
2002 season at the West Valley Playhouse in Canoga Park. Horton
Foote's 1952 account of a disillusioned Texas sheriff and the escaped
convict bent on destroying him here finds the author's burgeoning
early voice inadvertently clashing with a wildly misguided approach.</LD>
<LD>   Unfolding on Victoria Profitt's resourceful dual location set, the
narrative covers 48 hours in the life of its protagonist, Sheriff
Hawes (Jon Berry). This undervalued, overworked peacekeeper of
Richmond, Texas, cites spouse Ruby (Diana March) and the long-awaited
child she is carrying as reason enough for his announced retirement.
But there are other considerations.</LD>
<LD>   These include Hawes' disenchantment with tracking runaways and the
insufficient pay. More irritations come from Edwin Stewart (Howard
Gibson), son of the town's banker, and the bombastic Hawkes Damon
(Steve Whittaker), a prominent merchant who controls Richmond's
political scene.</LD>
<TE>   Such concerns seem trivial set beside life-term convict Bubber
Reeves (Daniel Lennox), whose escape from the state penitentiary sets
the plot in motion. A bona fide sociopath, Bubber is deaf to the
entreaties of his accomplice (David Stifel), estranged wife (Valerie
Hager) and tormented mother (Nadya Starr) to get out of state, now.
He only wants revenge on the sheriff he blames for his incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   What follows aligns character study, melodrama and morality play
with Hawes' grim determination to bring his nemesis in alive while
preventing town panic. Meanwhile, Bubber grows more unbalanced and
lethal.</TE>
<TE>   The original Broadway production -- starring John Hodiak, Murray
Hamilton, Kim Hunter and Kim Stanley under Jose Ferrer's direction --
was a commercial failure, although such critics as Brooks Atkinson
championed Foote's writing. They had valid reasons for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   True, the script's architecture sometimes suggests a Southern
Gothic written by Elmer Rice. Yet the comprehension of regional
behavior, details of character and unexpected revelations of subtext
all foreshadow the author destined to become what Robert Duvall
termed "the rural Chekhov."</TE>
<TE>   In a sincere attempt to master the drawling cadences of the
writing, director Steve Ruggles fails to provide equivalent inner
pace. It is one thing for the initially comic exposition to saunter
along, quite another to maintain such excruciatingly measured tempos
all night long.</TE>
<TE>   Combining Acts 2 and 3 into an overstuffed second half only
heightens the tortoise-like trajectory. This in turn upends the game
performances, which largely feel half-formed. Berry's soft-grained
James Cromwell quality, though appropriate, never develops beyond one
wan note. This does not leave the amiable March much to play against,
dulling their scenes of emotional resonance.</TE>
<TE>   Lennox similarly lacks a core to his surface psychosis.
Whittaker's promising start devolves into stock redneck postures, and
while Starr's strained anguish bespeaks intelligent casting, her
emoting fails to supply the denouement with tragic impact.</TE>
<TE>   Their supporting colleagues fare slightly better, with Hager
notably vivid, and Ruggles' own appearance as Deputy Tarl supplies
the best acting of the evening. Regrettably, this gives the game
away, as "The Chase" fails to generate enough steam to catch its own
tail, let alone grip an audience.</TE>

<HD>They're pets, not lunch</HD>
<DH>City dwellers are discovering what farm families have known
for years -- chickens can be affectionate, loyal and entertaining
companions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mira Tweti</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cherylynn Costner is walking down the Venice boardwalk with Pecker, a
brown and red Bantam. He is on a leash in a color that coordinates
with Costner's outfit. "There's nothing like a chicken -- they're
sweet, they're lovable," she says as heads turn along the beachfront
and refrains of "Is that a chicken?" can be heard over the din of
music and skateboards.</LD>
<LD>   Even in the epicenter of the unusual, a rooster on a leash,
contentedly taking in the sea air, attracts attention.</LD>
<LD>   Pecker is a "companion chicken," the kind of chicken that comes to
dinner as a guest, not as the main course. And though chickens are
still far more common in the latter role than the former, a number of
city dwellers have found them to be affectionate, loyal and
entertaining pets. Among those who've been charmed is Martha Stewart,
whose favorite chickens are the Araucanas (she used the color palette
of their eggs -- pastels in blue, green, yellow and pink -- as
inspiration for her Sherwin Williams paint line). George B.E. West, a
professor of veterinary medicine at UC Davis, goes so far as to
predict chickens will become "the pet of the 21st century."</LD>
<TE>   Costner, an actress who makes her home in Beverly Hills, takes her
chickens everywhere with her, from the bank (in her arms wrapped in a
baby's blanket so as not to attract attention) to the Hare Krishna
temple for a service, and out to restaurants. Taking a chicken out on
the town is not unlike taking a dog out. It must be kept on a leash
because it can get a notion to take off -- actually, to fly off. How
high? Costner points to a balcony 10 feet up on a beachfront home,
"in a heartbeat," she says and then smiles as three pedestrians stop
to take pictures and Pecker "coos" for them.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens enter the friend-of-person world in a variety of ways.
Carl Hunter got his chicken at the poultry market on Broadway in
L.A.'s Chinatown. He bought Carol (named for her look-alike, Carol
Channing) for $7. She is a Silkie, a breed named for long feathers
that resemble Persian cat fur. When Hunter got Carol, she was
lethargic and dirty, but he knew she was a diamond in the rough. He
took her straight to a vet, and a round of antibiotics later, she
sits like a white powder puff, fluffed and purring as he pets her.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and his partner, Dan Hooper, keep several egg-laying and
companion chickens at their Silver Lake home. They love the fresh
eggs -- especially the pastel ones from the Araucanas. Hunter
recently brought some unhatched eggs to work after the hens had left
them to care for chicks that already had hatched. He brought heating
pads from home to the office kitchen to keep the eggs warm. Word
spread throughout his downtown office at the Transamerica Life
Insurance Co. and his co-workers became a human foster flock for the
young chicks. When two of the chicks hatched Sept. 11 his co-workers
promptly named them Patriot and Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Duncan is a kindergarten teacher who lives in Torrance.
Her class had a chick-hatching project to study the process of life.
Even though Duncan took care with the gestating eggs, including
staying overnight in her classroom, most of the chicks died. Duncan
(who now advocates using butterflies rather than eggs for such
projects) felt responsible for the two chicks that survived the
classroom project and took them home but came up against a zoning
rule prohibiting farm-type animals.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, 34, hired an attorney and succeeded in persuading the
Torrance Environmental Quality Commission (which oversees animal
permits and Animal Control) that her roosters, Bunny and Zorro, were
companion animals. She even brought in photos of the birds with her
family. "The commission was nice about it," she said. "They said they
seem like really nice birds." But the commission worried that the
crowing might disturb neighbors, and required Duncan to get written
approval from 20 neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Bunny and Zorro are full-grown roosters now, each weighing around
14 pounds and more than knee-high to an average human. Duncan and her
husband spend a lot of time watching and playing with the birds,
whose silly behavior is so entertaining they call it "Chicken TV."</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of relationship that Costner understands. Lately

<HD>Tears without apology</HD>
<DH>With a nod to Douglas Sirk, 'Far From Heaven' deftly
updates '50s melodramas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Haynes' melodrama "Far From Heaven" opens at the height of a New
England autumn when the trees are ablaze in yellow, orange and a red
so vivid it looks like blood. Set in Connecticut in the late 1950s,
the film takes place in a small town where people go about their
business quietly, including the business of dying inside, none more
beautifully than Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore), whose world
disintegrates after she discovers her husband in the arms of another
man.</LD>
<LD>   A model mother to two children and a dutiful wife to television
sales executive Frank (Dennis Quaid), Cathy is a frequent subject of
adoration in the society pages of her local newspaper. Her
translucent white skin gleams as brightly as her immaculate kitchen.
Her closest friend is her neighbor Eleanor Fine (Patricia Clarkson,
in a wonderfully lethal performance), but her closest companion is
Sybil (Viola Davis), a black woman who works as the family's domestic
and with whom she has developed harmonious communion. It seems
perfect until Cathy discovers Frank's infidelity. Stunned, she deals
with the revelation the only way she knows how, which is to keep
smiling. Even when Frank smacks her across the face, all she can do
is reassure him that everything is fine -- just before politely
asking if he could bring her some ice for the swelling.</LD>
<TE>   What makes the exchange wrenching isn't just the violence that
Frank commits but the soul-crushing violence he inflicts on himself
the moment he strikes Cathy, turning himself into her victimizer.
Tortured by his desires, Frank has taken to furtive late-night
cruising, following men down alleys and into local dives. The
character's agony is palpable, understandable given the time and the
place, but there is more at stake than his private anguish. As with
director Douglas Sirk before him, Haynes is using melodrama to
uncover what lies beneath the surface of things. He's exposing the
cracks in the American ideal and tracing them to the margins, from
clandestine gay bars to suburban homes where black waiters serve
whites who never see them and from whose shadows a gardener named
Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert) emerges to change Cathy's life.</TE>
<TE>   In his greatest melodramas, Sirk explored bourgeois repression so
mummifying he would cram the frame with flowers, as if to say
people's homes were like mausoleums. Reviewers often sneered at the
movies as "two-hankie weepies," the sort made for "sob sisters,"
language that suggested that what got under their skin wasn't the
extravagance of the on-screen emotion but the reaction of the mostly
female audience. Although Sirk's films were rediscovered by academics
during the 1970s, mainstream audiences and critics seem to appreciate
them for their dubious camp value and the fact that a handful starred
Rock Hudson, Hollywood's most famously closeted male actor.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes borrows from several of Sirk's films, but his biggest
inspiration is Sirk's 1955 "All That Heaven Allows," in which Jane
Wyman plays a widow who begins a scandalous romance with her younger
gardener, a Thoreau-reading hunk played by Hudson. Haynes follows the
film's arc in broad outline, tweaking its style and substance to put
them into play against contemporary expectations. At first glance,
the two features appear like visual echoes -- a pale blue-and-white
station wagon, even the gardener's red plaid shirt look the same --
except that in the Haynes film it all seems brighter, more luxuriant.
In Sirk's world a slash of bold color could express a world of
repressed feeling. The characters in "Far From Heaven" are held
similarly in check by their Eisenhower moment, but because we know
how to fill in the ellipses Haynes shades everything bolder, laying
color upon color.</TE>
<TE>   When Cathy and her friends stand huddled together in her heavily
treed frontyard, the yellow ocher and copper of the women's dresses
are a blur with their billowing hair and the leafy iridescence behind
them. The women look like advertisement models for some mythic
Arcadia (or perhaps next year's Buick), while the leaves are so
drenched with color it's as if they had been individually dipped in
paint, then hung on the trees like ornaments. Sometime later, after
the wind has carried Cathy's scarf from her grasp and delivered it
into Raymond's, the shimmering lilac in his dark hands doesn't just
suggest; it screams.</TE>
<TE>   As the story unfolds, the gloss begins to rub off and the colors
mute. The season changes, characters reach toward one another across
ever-widening chasms and Cathy struggles to hang onto her smile even
as her world crumbles. The film's three leads are extraordinary, but
what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters of what we
call great acting that it nearly defies categorization. Although it's
the least naturalistic of the performances because the character is
an artificial construction, yet another imitation of life, it's also
the most devastating. Quaid strips away his charm to show us Frank's
struggle under his mask, baring the man beneath. In contrast,
Raymond's realness is imprinted on his very skin: As he says to
Cathy, he doesn't have a choice but to live in the reality that's
been forced on him. As in each of Haynes' previous films, the men and
women in "Far From Heaven" carry their identities much as beetles
carry their carapaces, protected from the world but also shut away
from it.</TE>
<TE>   It's in Cathy's fight to escape that prison, in her struggle
between the woman she's been and the woman she yearns to become, that
Moore breaks our hearts. Most filmmakers are no longer interested in
making us cry; they want us to shiver, to shake, to jump in our seats
or watch impassively as another one bites the dust. Have we become
afraid to cry? Haynes knows that the impossible world he's created
will inspire giggles, but he's savvy enough to have orchestrated the
precise moment in "Far From Heaven" when the laughter stops dead.
He's an independent filmmaker who loves Hollywood, and with this
feature he's grasped that no matter how righteous a film's politics,
there's no more powerful way to seduce an audience than to sweep it
away in a flood of tears.</TE>
<TE>   Not long into "Far From Heaven" there's a scene in which Cathy
waits for Frank outside a hospital. In desperation, the couple has
visited a psychiatrist in hopes of finding a "treatment." Politely
shooed aside by the doctor, Cathy stands in front of the hospital
under an overcast sky. She's tugging at her gloves and coat when the
sun emerges, bathing her in light. It's an audacious image -- the
suburban wife and mother flooded with the sort of celestial radiance
that illuminates paintings of martyrs and stars from Hollywood's
golden age -- and as with the rest of this gloriously generous film,
there isn't a suggestion of cynicism gilding the rapture. Then the
film cuts away from Cathy, and we discover that it's more than the
sun that's brightening her face: She's watching a boy and a girl kiss
on a nearby park bench.</TE>
<TE>   The idyll lasts only seconds. By the time Haynes returns to Cathy,
still standing alone and still waiting, the light has gone out and
she's staring into space. The tragedy of the moment is as piercing as
her desire. It's as if she were looking for something but can't bear
to remember how it went missing or why. All she wants is what
everyone wants -- to hold and be held, to love and be loved -- and
although there's nothing simpler, neither is there anything more
profound. Haynes knows this deeply, which is why Cathy may be far
from heaven, but never once is she out of the director's embrace.</TE>

<HD>Invigorating portrait of an analytical mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To paraphrase Raymond Chandler, French philosopher Jacques Derrida is
smart the way other people think they're smart. And the great
pleasure of "Derrida," an absolutely first-rate documentary about his
life and thought that is the cinematic equivalent of a mind-expanding
drug, is how invigorating and refreshing it is to be in the presence
of such a powerful, agile intellect.</LD>
<LD>   Now in his early 70s, Derrida is considered the father of
deconstruction, a key philosophical movement that questions the
assumptions both everyday language and rarefied theoretical discourse
are based on. As one French interviewer put it, he is "a thinker of
lightning thoughts, like those miners who work by exploding the beams
supporting their shafts."</LD>
<LD>   Derrida has been ranked with Marx and Freud as an influential 20th
century figure, but you don't need a familiarity with his work to
appreciate those keen insights, to feel how tonic it is to experience
the workings of a piercingly analytical mind.</LD>
<TE>   More than five years in the making, "Derrida" is the result of an
unusual collaboration between the philosopher and two co-directors.
Kirby Dick is an award-winning documentary filmmaker whose works
include "Chain Camera." Amy Ziering Kofman, on the other hand, is a
former academic who became a fan of Derrida's when she stumbled on
his writings at age 16 and has known the philosopher since she
studied with him as a graduate student in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   This long-term friendship benefited the film in several ways
during the time it took to shoot. At the most basic level, it gained
the crew access, resulting in a number of charming "the genius at
home" sequences, where we see Derrida searching for his keys,
buttering his toast and deciding which jacket goes with which pair of
pants.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it's clear that Kofman has Derrida's respect, that
he takes her seriously. Some of "Derrida's" best moments reveal the
man's playful side, as he spars with the interviewer about the
questions she's asking and makes amused comments about the complete
artificiality of the film's nominally realistic structure.
"Everything about cinema verite," he says tartly, "is false."</TE>
<TE>   Derrida is often a wary subject, unwilling to give away too much
about his personal life. Yet he is candid about growing up Jewish in
French-ruled Algeria, and about the profound effect that being
expelled from school at age 10 in a wave of anti-Semitism had on his
worldview.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the back-and-forth between Kofman and Derrida leads to
compelling results. After first refusing to answer a question about
his thoughts on love ("I'm incapable of generalities"), he launches
into a fascinating discourse about love as the difference between who
and what, about whether we love someone for the singularity of who
they are or their specific qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Equally at home in English and French, Derrida is a masterful
speaker, whether talking about the paradox of forgiveness in South
Africa, the nature of archives at UC Irvine (where there is one
dedicated to him), or why he would be interested in hearing the great
philosophers of the past talk about their sex lives.</TE>
<TE>   With his unruly white hair and hawk-like face, Derrida is a
compelling presence even when he is merely pondering a question. Even
his off-the-cuff comments are intriguing, because everything gets
serious consideration. And when he is wary, he's never difficult for
its own sake but because his philosophical positions make him that
way.</TE>
<TE>   "Derrida" benefits greatly from the ethereal, other-worldly score
it commissioned from veteran composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. In a paradox
the subject would probably enjoy, the only aspect of the film that is
not successful is the decision to have co-director Kofman read
lengthy excerpts of Derrida's work as voice-overs. Though these
selections do give a sense of the texture of the philosopher's work,
phrases like "narcissistic reappropriation" are too dense and hard to
follow when a printed page can't be referred to. Fortunately, we have
the man himself to listen to, and there turn out to be few things as
bracing, as purely joyous, as that.</TE>

<HD>'Derrida's' subject remains enigmatic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sorina Diaconescu</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Common sense suggests that philosophy does not lend itself to
cinematic spectacle, which may explain why few thinkers, dead or
alive, have ever taken the leap to the silver screen -- until now.
Opening this week at the Nuart for a limited engagement is "Derrida,"
a documentary in which two enterprising filmmakers, Amy Ziering
Kofman and Kirby Dick, attempt to deconstruct the father of
deconstructionism.</LD>
<LD>   Derrida is certainly a rich subject. He is responsible for a
hugely influential strand of postmodernist theory that proposed a
rigorous critical examination -- "deconstruction," as he dubbed it --
of fundamental concepts embedded in Western philosophy.</LD>
<LD>   Given to a lifelong exploration of the nature of language, writing
and meaning, he has produced a massive oeuvre -- 45 books, countless
articles and essays -- that has been alternately revered or derided
as "babbling obfuscation." A brawl broke out in academe when
Cambridge University considered him for an honorary doctorate in
1992. (The matter went to a vote with the dons of the institution,
and Derrida won.) Controversial and influential, his work has been a
well of inspiration for everybody from scientists puzzling out DNA
maps to DJs, to fashion designers who artfully dismember old garments
and sew them back together into newly configured wholes, to
deconstructivist architects like Frank Gehry.</LD>
<TE>   His writing is known for its extreme subtlety and sense of
playfulness: He once published an experimental book, "Glas,"
consisting of two running columns -- one an analysis of Hegel's
philosophy, the other a discussion of French thief and man of letters
Jean Genet ("a work whose untranslatability must compare only to
'Finnegans Wake,' " a review noted).</TE>
<TE>   So how did the two filmmakers go about capturing all that on
screen, with no road map to boot? "It was a struggle because we did
not want to make a standard biopic, and we did not want to make a
primer," said Dick, who co-directed and co-edited the movie. "So we
had to invent a [new] form."</TE>
<TE>   "What really interested us was to really make an art film, a
complicated film that draws people into the complexity of the
thinking and gets them excited about that," added Kofman,
co-director, producer and longtime Derrida buff. "Our model was a
fugue: to have certain themes that are planted at the beginning and
then complicate each other. Everything is working off of everything
else, but not in a linear way."</TE>
<TE>   The duo interviewed Derrida over the course of seven years. With a
battery of digital cameras in tow, they followed him around his Paris
home, joined him on transatlantic travels, attended many of his
lecture engagements. The resulting 100-plus hours of footage were
eventually edited down to 85 minutes into a black-and-white portrait
of the thinker, startlingly unadorned save for a fluid, minimalist
score by Riyuichi Sakamoto.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface "Derrida" functions as a portrait of an influential
intellectual force, something future generations will most likely
treasure. (If only cameras had been around to record Plato, Descartes
and Nietzsche for posterity!) They will see Derrida as a 72-year-old
Frenchman with a leonine head of white hair, intense brown eyes and a
forehead creased by four horizontal furrows. They will note that
occasionally a pipe dangles from the corner of his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   But the project, the filmmakers noted during a recent interview,
was intended to be a meditation on biography, celebrity, the
interaction between the public and the private sphere: all issues
that figure prominently in Derrida's work.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuitously, the very making of the documentary was already ripe
with opportunities for deconstructionist analysis, and Derrida
pounced on each and every one of them. He would preface every planned
interview with lengthy remarks about the artificial character of the
situation. "I want to acknowledge the surrounding technical
conditions and not feign a naturalness which doesn't exist," he says
in one scene.</TE>
<TE>   "His inability to forget the camera wasn't put on," said Kofman.
"The fun of the film is that we used it to our advantage." To
circumvent Derrida's hyper-awareness, the filmmakers reached for
improvisation. Rather than go through a battery of prepared
questions, they decided to provoke him to a Socratic dialogue. The
plan was to spring on him simple, generic questions, such as, "What
do you have to say about love?" or "Tell us about Ego and Narcissus."</TE>
<TE>   "He had no idea that the questions were going to be asked at all,"
said Dick. "So he had to either refuse to answer -- which is not
really his style -- or formulate a thought, and an answer, on the
spot."</TE>
<TE>   Superimposed over snippets of talking heads calling Derrida "a
thinker of lightning thoughts," authoritative voices from around the
globe extolling his brilliance, are private moments -- vignettes of
conjugal life, shots of Derrida buttering his breakfast toast,
lunching in a Parisian brasserie, getting a haircut.</TE>
<TE>   "This is always an issue in documentaries," said Dick. "There are
these marginal moments that seem to have real significance, as if all
of a sudden you understand the person -- but in fact, do you? It was
a question we wanted to ask with this film." And if parts of the
movie are challenging, they are meant to be that way, the filmmakers
said. The hope is that the very complexity of the work will needle
moviegoers unaccustomed to philosophical discourse into further
exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't get it all in the first pass, that's OK," said Dick.
"This is something that either inspires you to go and read his work
or to come back and see the film again. There's a certain thrill that
Amy and I have in reading Derrida's, or really, any great thinker's
work, and we want an audience to experience it too." Derrida, the
filmmakers said, was always himself -- on camera as in person as on
the printed page. "He held to all the precepts that he put forth in
his writing," said Kofman. "At least professionally -- I don't really
know him privately still -- he was always very careful and
pedagogical, and you see that in the film." When an interviewer
suggests parallels between his work and the television show
"Seinfeld," Derrida remarks coolly, "Deconstruction the way I
understand it does not produce any sitcoms." His advice for armchair
philosophers who mine the TV lineup for deconstructionist nuggets?
"Do your homework, and read."</TE>

<KH>JAZZ REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Elvin Jones master of his Machine</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it pays to go back to the source, even in jazz, an art that
tends to emphasize newness and innovation.</LD>
<LD>   And the performance of Elvin Jones' Jazz Machine at the Jazz
Bakery on Wednesday night provided a particularly valuable
opportunity to experience one of the fountainhead sources of
contemporary jazz percussion in action.</LD>
<LD>   Most young (and even not-so-young) drummers would be quick to
acknowledge the debt they owe to Jones, at 75 still a rhythmically
vital, technically proficient player.</LD>
<TE>   His electrifying percussion work with the John Coltrane Quartet of
the '60s, along with the similarly dynamic playing of the late Tony
Williams, have become the primary jazz drumming influences of the
last few decades.</TE>
<TE>   Seated in a magisterial center-stage position at the Bakery, Jones
was surrounded by a surprisingly modest-looking drum kit, at least in
comparison to the massive batteries of percussion and cymbals favored
by many of his younger musical disciples.</TE>
<TE>   And it was equally fascinating to note that, once the virtually
nonstop set began, his drumming, despite its multilayered rhythms and
enormous sense of power, never overwhelmed the other players or --
particularly important in the Jazz Bakery -- the acoustics of the
room.</TE>
<TE>   Like all gifted jazz artists, Jones made difficult tasks seem
simple and logical: keeping different levels of rhythmic time
functioning simultaneously; filling open spaces with sudden, subtly
complex bursts of sound; shifting to brushes on several numbers to
deliver surging waves of sparkling rhythm; supporting and energizing
his soloists without overpowering them with expressions of his own
ego.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' current installment of the Jazz Machine is first rate, with
trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis (a longtime associate), tenor
saxophonist Pat La Barbera, pianist Anthony Wonsey and bassist Gerald
Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   Each had ample opportunity to solo. Marsalis continued his
exploration of the seemingly limitless expressive potential of his
instrument via slips and slides, rapidly articulated runs and,
especially on "It's a Wonderful World," a warm and fuzzy sound.</TE>
<TE>   La Barbera was mostly focused on high-voltage shots into musical
outer space, his affection for Coltrane apparent in most of his
solos.</TE>
<TE>   Wonsey brought a briskly swinging taste of mainstream to many of
his solos, emphasizing catchy melodic improvising underscored by a
foot-tapping sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   And Cannon laid down the sort of solid foundation required by each
of these individual stylistic ventures.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of it all: Jones and his magical playing.</TE>
<TE>   And every young percussionist who thinks that contemporary
drumming is all about storm and bluster would do well to stop by the
Bakery this weekend to experience Jones' master-class seminar in how
to be powerful without being overbearing.</TE>

<HD>New BMW Internet films: popular advertising vehicles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Desson Howe</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a new trio of BMW films, called "The Hire," out on the
Internet. The three shorts -- John Woo's "Hostage," Joe Carnahan's
"Ticker" and Tony Scott's "Beat the Devil" -- are the latest series
promoting the cars and motorcycles of BMW of North America.</LD>
<LD>   A BMW series last year, directed by John Frankenheimer, Ang Lee,
Wong Kar-wai, Guy Ritchie and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu, commanded
a popular cult following: reportedly 14 million film views.</LD>
<LD>   In the three new films, Clive Owen (as in the last series) is an
unnamed chauffeur who drives a very flashy BMW sports car for three
characters.</LD>
<TE>   In "Hostage," currently online at www.bmwfilms.com since Oct. 24,
he's hired to deliver ransom money for a kidnapped corporate
executive (Kathryn Morris) trussed in a secret location.</TE>
<TE>   In "Ticker," also now playing, he's speeding along precipitous
mountain highways with Don Cheadle -- a desperate man with a
mysterious metal box.</TE>
<TE>   And in "Beat the Devil," debuting Nov. 21, the driver revs engines
for passenger James Brown (playing himself). The reason: Brown's
racing with the devil (Gary Oldman) for his soul.</TE>
<TE>   Woo, Carnahan and Scott, all known for their action-oriented,
visceral work, provide a dazzling display of power cuts, striking
images and hand-held camerawork.</TE>
<TE>   Famous faces appear everywhere, sometimes so quickly you can miss
them.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Dennis Haysbert ("24" and "Far From Heaven"), Ray Liotta
and Marilyn Manson, among others.</TE>

<HD>Parenthood aspirations in sly, absorbing 'Hush!'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hush!," from writer-director-editor Ryosuke Hashiguchi, is
deceptively simple yet evolves to create one surprise after another.
What starts out as a story about a gay couple meeting and falling in
love, and a young woman who decides she wants to bear a child, ends
up revealing the conservative streak in the Japanese psyche.</LD>
<LD>   Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality,
suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released
in the U.S. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema. In this
absorbing film Hashiguchi moves from the sly to the profound with
ease and assurance.</LD>
<LD>   Hashiguchi deftly introduces his three principals, cutting back
and forth, until they all eventually meet. Seiichi Tanabe's
Katsuhiro, the pivotal character, is a Tokyo research engineer, so
deeply closeted that he cannot bring himself to discourage the
attentions of a pretty co-worker.</LD>
<TE>   Kazuya Takahashi's Naoya could not be more different. A pet shop
employee, he's a completely out gay man, attractive and into
one-night stands.</TE>
<TE>   Katsuhiro and Naoya would seem to confirm the old truth that
opposites attract, and their relationship grows serious. Pointing out
that gay relationships rarely last, Naoya has long decided that
children are out of the question -- he must be prepared for
eventually going it alone in life. Katsuhiro, however, cannot help
but imagine what it might be like to be a father, which plays into
Asako's (portrayed by Reiko Kataoka) desire to find a suitable sperm
donor.</TE>
<TE>   Nearing 30, Asako is a free-thinking, hard-living dental lab
technician who has known lots of casual sex but little love or
affection. Single motherhood, she concludes, is the answer, but a
sperm bank is too impersonal an answer for her.</TE>
<TE>   Were these three living in any sizable city in America, there
would be little problem. But it's Japan, and neither man has a clear
idea of how Asako could possibly conceive outside of sexual
intercourse. By the time Asako has convinced them that there are
other ways, events in Katsuhiro's life make the lives of all three
more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Hashiguchi asks much of his cast; the actors sustain extended
sequences of emotional depth and shifts in mood. The director is
alert to the comic absurdities that erupt in the most wrenching
outbursts of anger. Yet as unafraid as Hashiguchi is of the long
dramatic scene, he is a cinematic director, with a sense of the
expressive power of spatial relationships among his people
reminiscent of the master of this technique, Yasujiro Ozu.</TE>
<TE>   Hashiguchi is also adept at capturing the seeming contradictions
of his people. Katsuhiro is far more shy and conforming than the
uninhibited Naoya, yet he's also the more intellectually
sophisticated. He's more open-minded and not so quick to draw
distinctions between what is conventionally thought to be gay and
straight. Yet because Naoya is more self-accepting than Katsuhiro, he
is able to take the leap of faith that love demands.</TE>
<TE>   The rebellious, defiant Asako discovers she yearns for the
traditional role of motherhood. The odyssey of self-discovery these
three embark upon is intensified by the claustrophobia of everyday
existence in crowded Tokyo. Bobby McFerrin's wry original score and
songs (in English) complement the shifting moods of Hashiguchi's
characters.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, "Hush!" is like Chinese director Stanley Kwan's
recent "Lan Yu" in that a gay romance becomes but a starting point
for an all-encompassing view of human behavior. If both films are
concerned with love and mortality, they also raise questions of
values and priorities in a changing society. If ever there were two
contemporary films in which it was possible to perceive the universal
in the particular, it would be these two outstanding accomplishments
of today's Asian cinema.</TE>

<KH>CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK</KH>
<HD>Guess who's in for a little criticism?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When art critic Emily Genauer died last August at 91, obituaries
dutifully noted that she had received the Pulitzer Prize for
criticism in 1974. What they didn't say is that she's the only
newspaper art critic ever to win it.</LD>
<LD>   Initiated in 1970, the Pulitzer in criticism has most often gone
to book reviewers and music critics, who have received fully half the
awards. Once it went to a critic who occasionally wrote about art
(but mostly about opera), and once it went to a writer on the
specialized subject of photography. But Genauer, who won while
working at Newsday, remains the roster's lone art critic in more than
30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Now I think I know why. Last week, a survey of 169 art critics at
general-interest news publications across America was published by
the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University (the
school, coincidentally, that hosts the Pulitzers). The 71-page report
noted that in the majority of the surveyed publications, large and
small, the visual arts generally receive less than half the coverage
of books or music. (Art coverage averages 6% of editorial space.) But
sheer quantity of articles, which surely ups the statistical chances,
wouldn't seem to explain the qualitative phenomenon.</LD>
<TE>   Here's what does: By and large, journalistic art critics don't
write art criticism.</TE>
<TE>   That's the stunning conclusion that emerges -- almost between the
lines -- of this wide-ranging, unprecedented study of the field. The
report is based on responses to a lengthy questionnaire from 123
critics at daily papers, 43 at alternative weeklies and three at
national newsmagazines. It includes lots of inside-baseball stats, of
possible interest mostly to art critics and journalists. (You can
read it online at www.najp.org.) But one factoid deserves wide
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   A critic, the report notes in a quote from the American Heritage
Dictionary, is one who forms and expresses judgments of the merits,
faults, value or truth of a matter. Yet only 27% of survey
participants said they place a great deal of emphasis on forming and
expressing those judgments. Twenty-seven percent!</TE>
<TE>   In fact, of five aspects of reviewing queried in the survey,
making judgments ranked at the bottom. Far greater weight was given
to important but nonetheless routine concerns, like offering accurate
descriptions of art and exhibitions and providing historical
background.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller the newspaper, the less interested critics were in
writing actual criticism (only 18% of writers at papers with
circulations of less than 110,000). It's not hard to see why:
Provincial social attitudes can be brutal. For several years a friend
in a small town wrote thoughtful and penetrating weekly commentaries
on art subjects for the local paper -- and was duly ostracized by the
region's insular art world for having the temerity to speak her mind.
Eventually she gave up, left the field (and the town) and became a
successful art museum curator.</TE>
<TE>   Americans don't much like art, so a bunker mentality can prevail
in the art world. (It's us against them, and a critic better be with
us.) One participant in the survey succinctly described the problem:
"I wish I could write using a pseudonym. If I write anything negative
in this Midwestern town where I now live, either I or my husband are
punished in all sorts of interesting ways." Since the majority of
journalistic critics are part-time freelancers, who can blame them
for flinching at small-minded abuse?</TE>
<TE>   Even more disturbing, though: It isn't just small markets where
journalistic art critics are avoiding criticism. Significantly fewer
than half of those at large papers said that making judgments is a
high priority. Since Genauer's day, the art world has exploded into a
global multibillion-dollar industry, in which critical acuity would
seem more necessary than ever. But critics appear to have buckled
under the force of its big bang.</TE>
<TE>   So, if they're not writing criticism, what are America's
journalistic art critics scribbling in the pages of their newspapers,
alternative weeklies and weekly newsmagazines? Miniature schoolbooks,
apparently. In overwhelming numbers, journalistic art critics see
themselves primarily as educators. No fewer than 91% said they see
their role as not just informing readers about visual art but
educating them.</TE>
<TE>   The goal sounds benign, but its courtly arrogance is actually
astounding. When a writer begins with the presumption that the reader
is uneducated about the subject -- or at least not as well educated
as he -- be prepared to be bored silly by what is written. Worse, a
creeping tone of superciliousness is almost impossible to escape.</TE>
<TE>   The problem grows acute in the Age of the Internet, when access to
news is less bound by the geographic issues of distribution that
historically circumscribed newspapers. At every waking moment, any
sane writer ought to be aware that somewhere, out in the ether, lurk
readers who know a hell of a lot more about the particular subject of
his discourse than he will ever know. Condescend to them and you're
toast.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, criticism is a considered argument about art, not a
priestly initiation of the unenlightened into a catechism of
established knowledge. Education is a lavishly funded bane of today's
increasingly institutionalized art world, where Puritan exhortations
about the value of learning over sensuous experience and unruly
imagination regularly destroy art's singular worth. Apparently the
epidemic has spread, laying low the nation's art journalists.</TE>
<TE>   And, speaking of journalism, there are solid journalistic reasons
why the sentiment should make us queasy. Art critics, like those in
other disciplines, walk a precarious line. On one hand, close and
active participation in the scene can sometimes be indispensable to
informed judgment. On the other, they need to keep an arm's length
from the field, avoiding entanglements that can create journalistic
conflicts of interest. The report correctly notes that art critics
who see themselves as educators have already positioned themselves as
stakeholders and champions of the beat they cover. Shills occupy an
uncommon place in a newsroom, especially at a daily paper.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of full disclosure, by the way, I should add here
that I did not participate in the survey, which was conducted on the
Internet in March. Not that I wasn't asked and didn't try. To secure
the electronic questionnaire from prying art critical hackers, the
organization devised an elaborate numerical code, one for each of the
participants, who could then visit the Web site at their leisure. I
spent a few hours answering some questions; when I came back at the
end of the month to finish up, I discovered that my entire
questionnaire had been completed. (The answers of course were
horrifying.) It turns out that the organization had mistakenly given
the same individual secret code to more than one person.</TE>
<TE>   A mortified Columbia spokeswoman insisted that the error was an
anomaly and that the integrity of the survey hadn't been compromised.
I'm inclined to take her at her word.</TE>
<TE>   But let it be known that, had I been able to participate, the
number of America's working journalistic art critics claiming
"educator" as their job description would have been only 90%, not
91%.</TE>
<TE>   I decided to put the question to the New Yorker magazine's Peter
Schjeldahl, because he's the writer who topped the survey
respondents' list of most influential art critics working today. What
about it, I asked; do you think of yourself as an educator?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not," Schjeldahl said, punching every syllable.
Furthermore, he said, "I refuse to accept any responsibility for
anything anybody might claim to have learned from my criticism."</TE>
<TE>   I confess I knew in advance that he would answer that way, since
we've discussed the canard many times in the past. But just wait
until his legions of adoring, education-besotted colleagues find out!</TE>

<HD>'Frida,' but not all the Frida they knew</HD>
<DH>Prominent students of the artist praise aspects of the film
but say the maestra's magnetism, refinement and politics don't come
through.</DH>

<DL>Mexico City</DL>
<LD>Mexico City</LD>
<LD>   EveryONE'S a critic, but the opinions of four elderly viewers at a
preview screening of "Frida" here this week carried unusual authority
because of their personal connection to the subject, Mexican
surrealist painter Frida Kahlo. Arturo Garcia Bustos, Guillermo
Monroy and Arturo Estrada all took art classes from Kahlo in the
1940s and remained intimate friends until her death in 1954. They are
known in Mexico as "Los Fridos" for their disciple-like devotion to
the artist. A joint exhibition of their work is installed at a
gallery here.</LD>
<LD>   Rina Lazo, who is married to Bustos and who was an assistant to
Kahlo's husband, muralist Diego Rivera, also attended the screening.
Like the Fridos, she spent many hours at the Kahlo home, Casa Azul,
which is now her museum and shrine. Watching the preview brought back
a flood of memories of the woman they described as at once humble and
highly sociable, politically militant and irresistibly charismatic, a
painter who with her husband assiduously courted publicity but would
have never guessed her fame would reach today's proportions.</LD>
<TE>   Kahlo's work has generated enormous interest in recent years with
her paintings fetching upwards of $5 million at auction. To her fans,
feminists and collectors, Kahlo long ago attained mythical status for
overcoming the effects of polio and serious injuries suffered in a
trolley accident, and for establishing her own reputation despite
Rivera's huge shadow. But to her former students, Kahlo was a
flesh-and-blood amalgam of charm, quirks and skills. How closely did
their memories jibe with what they saw on the screen?</TE>
<TE>   They all gave Mexican actress Salma Hayek credit for her
performance and for bringing the biopic to the screen after a
years-long struggle. But they slammed the movie's nudity, historical
liberties and what they asserted is a one-dimensional look at a
protean persona by stressing carnal aspects over her political
commitment as a Communist and pacifist.</TE>
<TE>   "A movie is a not a carbon copy of reality. A film director is
like a painter organizing his picture, and he has the liberty to
arrange the elements as he sees. But it could have been more
complete," said Monroy, 78, an art teacher and painter based in
Cuernavaca.</TE>
<TE>   All praised the film's cinematography and director Julie Taymor's
effort to translate Kahlo's surrealistic technique to film. But the
movie failed to capture the revolutionary ferment in which Kahlo and
Rivera worked and their intense love for all things Mexican, they
contend.</TE>
<TE>   The three men have been known in the local press as Los Fridos
since 1947, when they painted a mural on Kahlo's favorite
neighborhood bar. The appellation doesn't bother them. Although all
went on to successful careers, they admit the defining moments in
their lives were their associations with Kahlo.</TE>
<TE>   All made several day trips with Kahlo to places she loved: the
pyramids at Teotihuacan, the colonial city of Puebla and the
indigenous market at Toluca. They went to movies together (Charlie
Chaplin and Ava Gardner were among her favorite actors) and read Walt
Whitman poetry together. She inspired all to pursue careers in the
arts.</TE>
<TE>   Bustos, 76, just completed a cycle of murals at the Oaxaca state
government building. Now retired, Estrada, 77, was long the director
at the Esmeralda Art Institute, the government-sponsored school
through which they met Kahlo. Monroy held several arts administrative
posts in Chiapas and Guerrero states before his retirement in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "She radiated light and happiness," Monroy said. "She was very
maternal and encouraging, which made the fact that she couldn't have
children all the sadder. But we never saw her depressed despite all
the surgeries she underwent."</TE>
<TE>   Bustos said the movie's most touching scenes were of Kahlo
attending her one-woman show at a Mexico City gallery shortly before
her death, so ill that she was brought in an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   "She saw the people waiting in the streets who had come to see her
and all of Mexico's leading cultural lights inside. But we never
thought of it as her farewell appearance. We never thought she would
die so young," Bustos said.</TE>
<TE>   Monroy struggled to explain his former maestra's fame, saying it
is due to her revolutionary works but also an extraordinary magnetism
that no film could ever capture.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a woman without poses or affection. She was very warm and
sexual, like a bouquet of flowers in movement. Everyone wanted to
know her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world fell in love with her -- men, women, her friends
and journalists. First came exhibitions of her work, then the books,
and now the movies. With all its faults, this movie is contributing
to that fame. And as long as the Fridos live, we'll keep talking
about her."</TE>
<TE>   Said Estrada: "She died 48 years ago, and it seems like
yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Lazo, who helped Rivera paint several murals in the decade before
his death, said Alfred Molina's portrayal of her former maestro is
the best she's seen on screen. But she found the language
unnecessarily gross and the movie too focused on the sexual escapades
of the couple.</TE>
<TE>   "The movie was good in that it didn't show Frida as a victim or a
tragic personality, which she never was, and it showed the tenderness
between the two of them. But it presented a vulgar atmosphere,
whereas they were both extremely refined people. It was too bad they
had to resort to commercial resources to create box office," said
Lazo, 74.</TE>
<TE>   Previews of the movie, set to open in Mexico on Nov. 20, are
already generating controversy for the explicit sex scenes and
because the movie's dialogue was filmed in English, a sore point for
Mexicans, for whom Kahlo is a national treasure. Theaters here will
show a version with Spanish subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Loaeza, a columnist at the Reforma daily newspaper who
also attended the Tuesday screening, said that Kahlo would have been
mortified that the movie made such a naked appeal to commercialism,
given her distaste for most things American.</TE>
<TE>   "For a movie on this most Mexican of women, I had to do
simultaneous translation in my mind as I watched. It was horrible,"
Loaeza said. Her column Thursday was headlined pejoratively: "Frida
Made in the USA."</TE>

<LD>Now that the elections are over and all of those who were called
crooks and/or liars have mended fences and are pulling together and
moving forward, I am free to reveal the (almost) gubernatorial
candidacy of Adrian Simple. He had looks, he had money, he had
presence, he had a beautiful wife and three lovely rented children,
and he had determination. But what he didn't have was Arnold
Schwarzenegger.</LD>
<LD>   Even at the start of the gubernatorial campaign, the Terminator
was perceived as a power to be dealt with. The subsequent victory of
the proposition he endorsed, while others went down to defeat, proved
that.</LD>
<LD>   Simple, which he pronounced Sim-play, had been thinking for months
about running as a candidate for the new Entertainment Party. An
actor who had starred in several top never-released features, Simple
had made money investing in Koo Koo Roo chicken. In addition to his
wealth, he also possessed the Kennedy wit, the Reagan smile and a
unique ability to speak without cue cards.</LD>
<TE>   I was allowed to be present at a meeting that consisted of Simple
and an expert in theatrical politics on the condition that I not
write about it until after the election. The expert, known to me only
as Lenny, was said to be behind the election of former U.S. Sen.
George Murphy, and also as someone who had almost married Julia
Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "What you've got to do," Lenny said to Simple, "is get yourself a
Hollywood star who will represent your position." Pause. "Er, exactly
what is your position, Simp?"</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I prefer not to be called Simp. Secondly, my
position is that I am strongly in favor of good over bad."</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-huh," Lenny said, "then you've got to get a star known for his
good." Thinking time, then, "I've got it," Lenny said, snapping his
fingers. "Arnold Schwarzenegger!"</TE>
<TE>   There was a long silence as the idea penetrated Simple's brain.</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmm," Simple said. "Not bad. He does fight crime and he was in
that kindergarten movie and in that Christmas flick. A crime-fighter
who likes kids and Christmas. I love the way he says, 'I'll be back.'
Do you know him?"</TE>
<TE>   "I know him through a friend who knows him through a producer who
knows him through an agent who met him at a party. My only hesitation
is, will people think he's a real American?"</TE>
<TE>   "What're you talking about?" Simple said. "He's married to that
woman who's a relative of the Kennedys, right?"</TE>
<TE>   "Right," Lenny said, "but that accent.... "</TE>
<TE>   "JFK had an accent. Hit the phone."</TE>
<TE>   Simple paced while Lenny put in a call to Schwarzenegger, whose
telephone number he had obtained from a friend who had been at the
same party mentioned earlier, a fund-raiser for stars of commercials
seeking serious roles. The call was brief, and when it was over,
Simple asked, "Well?"</TE>
<TE>   "Can't get him," Lenny replied in a tone of woe he had perfected
in the days of the George Murphy re-election campaign. "He's already
locked into supporting some after-school initiative. Anyhow, he says
he doesn't like you because you're a phony, self-serving,
insensitive, low-IQed blob."</TE>
<TE>   "Did you mention my Reagan smile?"</TE>
<TE>   "The Reagan smile, the JFK wit, the Robert Redford hair....He
still said you were simple-minded."</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm rich!"</TE>
<TE>   "I told him. He said, 'I'm rich too,' and hung up." They paced the
room and then Lenny said thoughtfully, "I might be able to get Vin
Diesel. He's only popular among non-voters and non-thinkers and those
with criminal records, but he's got a powerful image."</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't he the guy with XXX tattooed on his neck?" Lenny nodded.
"That was his hit movie. He's not pretty, he's not smart and he has
no commitments, but he's a new action hero."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want tattoos in my campaign," Simple snapped. "God knows
what he's got tattooed on his behind."</TE>
<TE>   Other suggestions included Steven Seagal (too fat), Jean-Claude
Van Damme (too intellectual) and even Sarah Michelle Gellar, who
plays Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but who was rejected due to Buffy's
obsession with kicking men in the groin area.</TE>
<TE>   "I could probably get you Ed Begley Jr. if you campaigned for
turning the Santa Monica Freeway into a bicycle path," Lenny said.
Simple gave the idea four thumbs down, doing it twice in order to
achieve the effect.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, they decided it was Schwarzenegger or nothing, and
dropped their campaign to take on Davis and Simon. They were right
about the Terminator. He proved in the election that he had political
muscle by powering Proposition 49 to victory, and now Lenny is doing
groundwork to convince him to run for president in 2004. So far,
Scharzenegger is noncommittal. He's waiting to see if Jackie Chan
will go as his running mate.</TE>

<HD>Old World prints; a thrilling 'Revelation'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenn McNatt</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Mark McDonald peered closely at the 15th century hand-colored print
of St. Jerome by Albrecht Durer, then examined the black-and-white
version of the same work hanging next to it. McDonald wanted to get a
good look; after all, he'd traveled across an ocean to see them side
by side.</LD>
<LD>   An art historian and curator at the British Museum, McDonald has
spent a lifetime specializing in prints made during the 15th and 16th
centuries -- the great Age of Discovery. And the works he traveled to
see this week at the Baltimore Museum of Art's new show "Painted
Prints: The Revelation of Color," are among the rarest and most
beautiful examples of their type in the world.</LD>
<LD>   "This is possibly one of the most important print shows in the
last 20 years," the curator said earlier this week as he strolled
through the galleries. "It's a completely new and fresh subject, and
I'm quite stunned by it."</LD>
<TE>   The BMA show, put together by prints and drawings curator Susan
Dackerman, has created quite a stir in the art world. As a result of
meticulous research in historical archives, Dackerman has presented
an astonishing thesis: that printed images, which first became widely
popular during the 15th and 16th centuries, were from the start not
only made in black and white, but also in brilliantly colored
versions that until now have remained largely unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "Revelation" offers many examples of such colored prints side by
side with their monochrome counterparts, and, since it opened two
weeks ago, has attracted curators and print-lovers from across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   But for McDonald, the BMA show holds a particular attraction
beyond its groundbreaking revelations about the history of color
printmaking.</TE>
<TE>   As director of the Columbus Print Collection Project at the
British Museum, McDonald is working on an ambitious project to
reconstruct the fabulous collection that once belonged to Ferdinand
Columbus (1488-1539), son of the Italian explorer who discovered the
New World for Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Showered with royal favor as a result of his father's exploits,
Ferdinand amassed some 40,000 prints during his lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   And McDonald thinks some of the hand-painted prints in the BMA
show may well have once been part of Columbus' collection.</TE>
<TE>   "By showing prints as rare, refined, valuable objects," he said,
"this exhibition is opening up whole new areas in print studies,
collecting and works on paper. That's important."</TE>

<KH>SPRING 2003 / L.A. FASHION WEEK</KH>
<HD>Out of focus</HD>
<DH>Inspiration hits in fits and starts at the shows. But is
anyone even looking at the clothes?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When MTV's fashion director Susan Bauer and her team of eight
stylists trekked from New York for the runway shows this week, they
were on a mission. New York fashion week, they decided, had gone too
mainstream for their "Osbournes" and "Jackass"-loving audience. Bauer
was in search of the edge, hoping that L.A. could be the inspiration
for the next big style show. "I was anticipating different venues,
paparazzi, rock stars instead of DJs playing live music maybe....To
me, that's L.A.," she said.</LD>
<LD>   What she found instead, she said, was poor fashion-show etiquette.
"There were no seating charts, proper lighting or sound systems,
people walked all over the runways. They didn't darken the house
before they brought the lights and music up, so there wasn't any
sense of excitement. And people seemed more into making fun of the
models than critiquing the clothes....I was disappointed."</LD>
<LD>   But, she added, perhaps echoing what many are feeling: "There's a
lot of good talent out here. There is potential."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed there is. And once the shows get more organized, as they
are sure to next April when 7th on Sixth blows into town from New
York to impose some order on the local fashion chaos, the focus can
be where it properly belongs: on the clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The far-flung shows of L.A. fashion week, which began last Friday
and ended Tuesday night, didn't produce much in the way of spring
trends, but there were flurries of inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best designers at work in the city is Eduardo Lucero,
who incorporates themes from his Mexican heritage. Lucero, who has
dressed red carpet regulars for more than five years (Cameron Diaz,
Jennifer Lopez), presented his collection at Smashbox Studios in
Culver City. This season, he delved into casual looks -- with a sexy
black-and-white hibiscus-print minidress, a tangerine twill fitted
jacket paired with tapered silk trousers in a jungle floral print,
and an ivory crocheted blazer that put one in mind of a delicate
mantilla. He also offered a head-turning red slip of a dress with
hot-pink lace flower insets, and a naughty-but-nice blush beaded
bikini top worn under a crocheted tank with a taffeta skirt.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Lawhon, who has not quite hit on a signature look,
revisited high school for her show, even rounding up Marshall High
School's cheerleading squad for a finale. Cardigan sweaters, Oxford
shirts and camisoles in pastel pinks, blues and yellows were accented
with dangling satin ribbons. Cotton poplin miniskirts were decorated
with yarn or pom-poms, evoking, in one case, the iconic poodle skirt
of yore. The theme was well conceived, but Lawhon's idea of home
economics chic was a little too literal; some clothes looked almost
threadbare.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Freddie Rojas, who designs for the label Private, seems
caught in variations of the same varsity punk theme. He offered
low-slung jeans and off-the-shoulder tops in sweatshirt fabric, "I
love Jesus" tank tops and the now-ubiquitous cargo pants for men and
women. Technically, Rojas is a more than capable designer, but the
mystery is why this mass-market-minded collection needs to be on the
runway at all?</TE>
<TE>   Since Jared Gold already showed his main collection in New York,
he hosted a party at the Palace Theater downtown for his lower-priced
line, complete with cakes he baked himself. (The food-averse fashion
crowd was surprisingly indulgent, scarfing up the homemade goodies.)
Gold showed his secondary line, Black Chandelier, on mannequins,
instead of models. The clothes -- a silver glitter shirt jacket, a
collarless white blouse with a Victorian shoe painted on the chest,
and a black pantsuit with a scalloped hem jacket -- seemed to lack
the verve of past seasons. After all, he is one of the few local
designers who has been able to create a consistent style with Edward
Gorey-like sketches of hot-air balloons, retro robots, Victorian
bicyclists and this season's shoes as recurring motifs.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomer Susana Mercedes, a former model who has done custom work
for private clients for two years, couldn't have picked a more
stunning spot for her runway debut than the 1926 Lloyd
Wright-designed Sowden House in Los Feliz. In the courtyard, with
dramatic Mayan arches on either side, models circled the swimming
pool. The collection was dominated by evening wear in shades of red,
black and cream -- silk charmeuse halter tops with ruffles running
horizontally across the chest; mid-calf-length skirts with
flamenco-like flounces; high-neck chiffon blouses with full, bishop
sleeves; and silk jersey dresses with bell sleeves. Mercedes
exhibited fine dressmaking skills, but the collection didn't do much
to distinguish itself from the evening wear offerings of established
lines such as BCBG and Nicole Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Goretti, a year-old line, had a more auspicious runway debut at
Les Deux Cafes. There were buttery leather bomber jackets cut close
to the body, and short silk "calla lily shorts" with icy blue piping
around the legs. A champagne-colored silk charmeuse evening gown had
a V-shaped back woven with a luxurious net of silk cord. The label is
designed by Monica Behan, Desiree Kohan and Rebecca Broussard, one of
Jack Nicholson's former flames. Nicholson skipped both this show and
his daughter Jennifer's. Guess the front row at an L.A. fashion show
just can't compare to the Lakers. At least not yet.</TE>

<KH>THEATER REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Two companies, two approaches to the Bard</HD>
<DH>'Henry V' and 'Standup Shakespeare' at the Odyssey offer a
pair of revisionist views that keep the playwright fresh and
contemporary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Shakespeare gets a shake-up at the Odyssey Theatre in two
notable productions demonstrating that after 400-plus years, the Bard
remains the most pertinent writer around. Moreover, beyond
contemporary accessibility, both "Henry V" and "Standup Shakespeare"
offer considerable fun.</LD>
<LD>   Marking the local debut of the Independent Shakespeare Company,
"Henry" illuminates Shakespeare by imagining corollaries to
Elizabethan performance conditions, recalling the actor-managed
troupes of yore by way of commedia dell'arte.</LD>
<LD>   The sagely edited text is rich with eloquence and innate
topicality. On a stage sporting a ladder, a flat and a rolled-up
banner hanging overhead, actors randomly prep until a figure with
clipboard (Melissa Chalsma) calls places.</LD>
<TE>   The troupe assembles, the banner unfurls and, with Chalsma's "O
for a Muse of Fire," the 1599 account of Henry Plantagenet's French
connection unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   Director Brett W. Reynolds maintains narrative clarity, cleanly
joining discursive ease with fidelity to meter. The lighting is
unaltered throughout, placing focus squarely on the actors. The
minimalist props and costumes are unerringly apt, especially the
sashes and headgear.</TE>
<TE>   As is the 10-member cast, a marvel of ensemble unity in 38 roles.
Chalsma is a genuine find: voracious as the Chorus, pugnacious as
Macmorris, delicious as Katharine. If David Melville's intense,
turtleneck-bedecked Henry mutes the heroic abandon, he is
nevertheless royally gifted, his resemblance to Windsors past and
present an added boon.</TE>
<TE>   Standout characterizations include J. Paul Boehmer's daft
Bardolph, fine York and electrifying Dauphin; Danny Campbell's
spot-on Pistol; Megan Cornelius' taut Montjoy and sweet Boy; Lorenzo
Gonzalez's brash Nym and droll Alice; Matthew Henerson's wily
Canterbury; Randy Howk's oily Ely and bluff Fluellen; Andrea Stevens
Morgan's lewd Mistress Quickly; and David Nathan Schwartz's hangdog
King of France.</TE>
<TE>   In its West Coast premiere, "Standup Shakespeare" is even more
revisionist at its core. Ray Leslee and Kenneth Walsh introduced
their cabaret setting of Shakespearean verse at New York's West Bank
Cafe in 1984, followed by the 1987 off-Broadway production under the
direction of Mike Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   A regional favorite, "Standup" makes reference to current
attitudes through word-pointing, transposition of sources and
Leslee's excellent, eclectic compositions.</TE>
<TE>   A hipster-clad Fool (Gregory Itzin, alternating with Armin
Shimerman) offers a polyglot prologue, opening with "I am a fellow of
the strangest mind in the world," ending on "there is nothing either
good, or bad, but thinking makes it so." He is joined by two
vocalists (Peyce Byron and Mary Jo Mecca), a pianist (musical
director David Manning), a violinist (Andrea Gaspar) and an in-house
heckler (John Kassir, alternating with Mark Povinelli). These
ingratiating folk trace a roundelay of romance and ribaldry, with
undercurrents merging R&amp;B and the Renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Under Casey Biggs' direction, the piece stands coronet and doublet
above most cabaret offerings. The singers are smashing, with Byron a
clarion jazz tenor and Mecca an incendiary enchantress.</TE>
<TE>   The baser juxtapositions might trouble purists -- one disgruntled
gentleman departed midstream during the reviewed performance -- and
uninitiated audiences may not withstand the eventual repetition of
point. Still, "Standup Shakespeare" is highly entertaining in its
anomalous fashion, and thespians should hie themselves hence.</TE>

<HD>Baldessari plays with puzzles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 71, John Baldessari is making the best work of his career. At
Margo Leavin Gallery, his new pictures of people, places and things
are also among the best being made by anyone today.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 35 years Baldessari has established his reputation
as the poet laureate of L.A. Conceptualism. Long after that
emphatically cerebral approach to art-making grew stale in New York
and Europe (not to mention California), he has kept it fresh by never
letting viewers forget that art can be at once whip-smart and fun.</LD>
<LD>   In two ongoing series of painted photographs and drawings,
Baldessari does for images what crossword puzzles do for words. He
compresses loads of otherwise unrelated elements into small spaces in
ways that make sense if you know what you're looking for, yet
befuddle those unfamiliar with the loose logic that links them.</LD>
<TE>   Each of his nearly 7-foot-square works consists of five, seven or
eight rectangular compartments arranged in the shape of a cross, the
letter "H" or a tick-tack-toe grid (whose center remains empty).
Baldessari fills these tidily framed spaces with two, three or four
photographs he shot in color with a landscape camera or enlarged from
carefully cropped B-movie stills, which are often, but not always,
black and white.</TE>
<TE>   Running vertically or horizontally, each of these digitally
printed images occupies three abutted compartments. Sometimes, a
single compartment contains a single part of a panoramic image. These
read clearly. Most depict the mountains, deserts and beaches of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, two photographs occupy the same rectangle,
overlapping to form pictures of anonymous actors in less than
memorable movies superimposed over trees, seascapes and other bit
players. These are harder to discern. Most have the presence of
ghostly collisions between the parallel worlds of long-forgotten
dramas and the ordinariness of everyday reality.</TE>
<TE>   Baldessari complicates matters by painting over fragments of the
superimposed sections with solid blocks of bright color. Adding
outlines and accents, he makes images that combine the playfulness of
a kid's coloring book with the finality of a crime scene's taped
silhouettes. An in-the-street formalist, Baldessari transforms 3-D
illusions into flat paintings that recall the work of artists as
diverse as Alex Katz, Roy Dowell, Ellsworth Kelly and Matisse.</TE>
<TE>   Although he sticks with such tried-and-true media as photography
and painting, his images are far more sophisticated (and stimulating)
than most made with more advanced computer technology. And, unlike
crossword puzzles, the answers to the enigmas his deliciously
puzzling pictures embody will not be published in tomorrow's paper.
This further distinguishes Baldessari's art from run-of-the-mill
Conceptualism, which strives to produce knowledge in a medium more
suited to the unpredictability of pleasure.</TE>

<TE>   Head for numbers, an eye for delicacy</TE>
<TE>   Another 71-year-old Conceptual artist makes his L.A. solo debut
with a single, unfinished work he began 37 years ago. In 1965, Roman
Opalka painted a white number "1" in the upper left corner of a black
canvas. Like a schoolboy forced to endure some strange punishment, he
continued painting neat rows of tiny numbers from one side of the
canvas to the other. When he reached the lower right corner, he was
up to 35,327.</TE>
<TE>   Opalka then recorded his voice reading the sequence of numbers and
snapped a black-and-white photograph of his face. The rest is
history.</TE>
<TE>   The French-born artist, who lived in Poland from 1949 to 1979
before moving back to France, added a few drops of white paint to the
black background (exactly 1% of its volume) and started his second
canvas with the number 35,328 in the upper left corner. Upon
completing it, he again recorded his voice reading the sequence, shot
a nearly identical self-portrait, added 1% more white paint and
continued where he had left off.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Opalka has never looked back. Like the U.S. Postal
Service or the Baltimore Orioles' Cal Ripken Jr., he hasn't missed a
day of work. Whatever misgivings he must have felt about his
plodding, Sisyphean task, he has committed every minute he has spent
in the studio to his extraordinarily focused project.</TE>
<TE>   At Grant Selwyn Fine Art, five large canvases and a row of
photographs record the passage of time. The photographs do so in an
instant. Portraying Opalka over the years, they document the effects
of growing old: a whitening of hair, a softening of facial features
and an increasingly androgynous appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings reveal themselves more slowly. Now, as their numbers
continue well beyond 6 million, their backgrounds are closer to white
than to black. Shifts from medium- to light-gray are discernable.
Plus, the diminishing contrast between the figures and their grounds
causes the paintings' surfaces to shimmer, like sunlight reflecting
off nearly still water.</TE>
<TE>   Opalka enlivens his works by dipping his brush in paint only once
for each number, when he begins to paint its seven digits. Each
numeral is slightly more faded than the last. This causes his
canvases to appear to quiver -- not quite like they're breathing, but
as if they're animated. The effect is meditative yet stimulating.
Like some Light and Space works, his paintings heighten perception by
diffusing a viewer's attention over wide expanses.</TE>
<TE>   If Opalka lives long enough, eventually he will be painting
numbers on surfaces so lightly tinted that it will be extremely
difficult (if not impossible) to see the results of his labor. When
that happens, it will be clear that his entire oeuvre, all of which
is titled "Opalka 1965/1-infinity," is an elaborate, slow-motion
disappearing act, one in which workaday drudgery is redeemed by the
clarity and elegance of what it leaves behind.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cartoonish fun, mixed with drama</TE>
<TE>   At a time when many artists are acting as if advanced computer
technology had laid painting to rest, it's refreshing to see a
painter treat digital imagery as a good old-fashioned source for
abstract pictures. In an eye-grabbing group of new acrylics on panel
at Patricia Faure Gallery, Scott Grieger combines the format of
bit-mapped imagery with the exuberance of cartoons and the drama of
freely splashed paint.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to pause for long before gleefully going over the top,
the veteran L.A. artist also tosses in patterns based on the paths of
orbiting electrons and DNA ribbons, both of which sit atop surfaces
so sleekly polished and exquisitely finished that they could be
kitchen counter tops from high-end design magazines -- or mobile
homes from the 1950s. At once stubbornly independent and promiscuous,
Grieger's gregarious paintings are equally at home in a Beverly Hills
mansion or a trailer park on the wrong side of the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   His handsomely framed panels, which range in size from 8 inches to
6 feet on a side, do not appear to have been painted with a brush.
Instead, each looks as if it has been built from the ground up with
the tools an artisan might use to construct a terrazzo floor.
Although Grieger uses nothing but paint to craft his multilayered
images, he treats pigment and the various mediums in which it's
suspended as if they're as useful and sturdy as mortar.</TE>
<TE>   A pragmatic, hands-on sensibility infuses his art with the pride
and dignity of do-it-yourselfers who never settle for second-best --
and who have the fortitude and talent to realize their visions. Most
of the marks that appear in Grieger's paintings catalog properties of
paint: drips, smears and splashes; properties of pictures: shadows
and highlights; and the molecular structures of both. Moon eyes pop
out of the backgrounds of several of the best ones (including a
trompe l'oeil brick), suggesting that if you look long and hard,
these potent paintings will look right back at you.</TE>

<TE>   When a pack rat gets creative</TE>
<TE>   If your garage is as messy as mine, it's the perfect setting for
Jason Meadows' six new sculptures, which bear a strong family
resemblance to the frayed brooms, bent folding chairs and
precariously balanced stacks of scrap lumber that spill from its
corners.</TE>
<TE>   The materials that make up the 30-year-old sculptor's casually
bolted-together works at Marc Foxx Gallery do not distinguish them
from the around-the-house stuff guys who like to fix things can't
seem to throw away. What sets Meadows' terrifically inventive
sculptures apart from such higgledy-piggledy piles of junk is their
acute formal intelligence. Seemingly slapdash, his 3-D collages hide
their refinement amid oddly angled fragments, jerry-built platforms
and ingeniously adapted braces.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what Brancusi's mature work would look like if he had had
a nervous breakdown and spent years recuperating among the Beverly
Hillbillies. Meadows lavishes thought and care upon otherwise forlorn
materials. Like Jessica Stockholder, he transforms household
materials into wonderfully precise arrays of color, texture and
weight. Unlike her abstract compositions, his piecemeal sculptures
often resemble the bodies of humans, horses and bats, as well as
cigar-store Indians.</TE>
<TE>   In Meadows' hands, ordinary two-by-fours, zigzagged fragments of
pressed wood and homemade signs are held together with lengths of
clothesline and aluminum brackets so lovingly customized that it's
hard to reconcile the labor that went into them with the scrappiness
of the objects they're attached to. Likewise, passages of virtuoso
woodworking are interspersed among quickly stapled dowels,
nonsensically rigged bases and hastily painted components. Beauty is
in the eye of the beholder, and the affection an artist brings to an
object is more powerful than whatever it is made of. This ethos is no
more perverse than the fact that people who take pleasure in making
things with their own hands are more likely to appreciate these
idiosyncratic sculptures than viewers who hire others to do such
labor for them.</TE>

Pistols.</LD>
<LD>   The Police, the Clash and Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions made it
into the hall in the first year they became eligible for membership
(that is, 25 years after the release of their first record), along
with Southern California blue-eyed soul duo the Righteous Brothers
and Australian hard-rock band AC/DC.</LD>
<LD>   The 18th-annual induction ceremony will be held March 10 at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the Sex Pistols, who were eligible for the second year,
acts on the final ballot included Patti Smith, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black
Sabbath, ABBA, Steve Winwood, MC5, Kraftwerk, Chic and the Dells.</TE>

<HD>Alan Jackson hits CMA jackpot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Jackson is looking for a change of pace after winning a
record-tying five Country Music Assn. awards, including single and
song of the year for his Sept. 11-themed song "Where Were You (When
the World Stopped Turning)."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm ready to get back to them drinking songs," he said with a
grin after Wednesday night's show at the Grand Ole Opry House in
Nashville. "I've always looked at music as more as entertainment.
I've tried not to be too preachy in my songs, because for the most
part people want music that's happy."</LD>
<LD>   Jackson wrote "Where Were You" shortly after the terrorist
attacks, and he performed it days later at the 2001 CMA Awards.
Although he didn't want it released as a single for fear of
capitalizing on the tragedy, the song took on a life of its own as
radio stations started broadcasting his performance.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm still humbled by this whole experience that came with this
song. It's uplifting and hard to swallow at the same time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was nominated a record 10 times, and tied a record for
most awards won in a single year with five. Johnny Cash had that many
in 1969, as did Vince Gill in 1993.</TE>

<HD>More legal woes for Bobby Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown was arrested in Atlanta early Thursday and
charged with drug and traffic offenses, in yet another scrape with
the law for the husband of pop diva Whitney Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, 33, a former member of the group New Edition, was stopped
in a Cadillac Escalade and charged with possessing a small bag of
marijuana, speeding and having no driver's license or proof of
insurance, said Marion Lee, an Atlanta police information officer.</LD>
<LD>   Brown posted bond but was then taken to nearby DeKalb County to
face traffic charges pending from a 1996 arrest. In 2000, Brown spent
26 days in a Florida jail for violating probation stemming from a
1996 drunken driving incident in Hollywood, Fla.</LD>

<HD>No more rap from Run-DMC</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>-- Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Run-DMC is calling it quits after last week's shooting death of
member Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, the pioneering rap group's
surviving members said Wednesday. Rappers Joseph "Run" Simmons and
Darryl "DMC" McDaniel said they decided to retire from touring and
recording because Mizell, the group's DJ, was irreplaceable.</LD>
<LD>   "As a tribute to the positive legacy of Jam Master Jay, we started
together, and we want the Run-DMC legacy to always reflect the three
of us together," Simmons said in New York City. Simmons and McDaniel
were joined at a news conference by two dozen rappers, musicians,
record executives and other members of the hip-hop community,
pledging to help raise money to support Mizell's widow and children,
and to solicit information from the public that could lead to the
arrest of the killer or killers.</LD>

<HD>Pop goes a subversive cartoon for adults</HD>
<DH>Artist Kenny Scharf has long stolen popular images. Now he
tries his hand at the medium that inspired him -- TV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Roug</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Scharf is about to realize a dream. The painter and
installation artist who in the 1980s kept company with Andy Warhol,
Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and who these days sells his
artworks for upwards of $100,000, has always had Saturday morning
cartoons on his mind. Now his own animated creation, "The
Groovenians," will air Sunday on the Cartoon Network.</LD>
<LD>   For him, it's just a matter of coming home. "That's where I'm from
-- the TV generation," Scharf said. "It's a natural project for
someone who is a believer in pop art and art for the masses. I've
always taken a non-elitist stand. It's like coming full circle: to
draw from cartoons and then to put back into that culture."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, with "The Groovenians," Scharf gives back exactly what he
stole -- characters -- to the medium from which he stole them -- TV.</LD>
<TE>   Working as a pop surrealist (a term he coined), Scharf has always
subverted images in popular culture. In his paintings, the
Flintstones, for example, might have worm-like bodies; in recent
portraits he painted well-known people costumed and in settings as if
they were "starring in a movie."</TE>
<TE>   "That's how I got my foot into the art world," he said, "using
recognizable imagery and making it my own."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Groovenians," aspiring artists Jet and Glindy live on the
beige planet Jeepers (the San Fernando Valley) but, on the advice of
a neighbor, escape to colorful Groovenia, a planet where, as one
character explains, "all the hipsters seek refuge." (It's New York,
circa 1978.) In Groovenia, though, the two have to battle the
formidable King Norman, tax collector in chief. It's a whimsical
art-and-commerce parable.</TE>
<TE>   The cartoon also charts something of Scharf's own journey from the
Valley, where he grew up, to Manhattan, and from wannabe artist to
success. Scharf's work has been shown at the Venice Biennale; his
paintings are included in the permanent collections of the Whitney
and the Guggenheim in New York, the Ludwig Museum in Cologne,
Germany, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Monterrey Museum of
Art in Mexico and the Sogetsu Museum of Art in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists have crossed into popular media. Warhol, Jean
Cocteau, Julian Schnabel and Salvador Dali all made movies, for
example. But a complete immersion in a world populated by the
Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack?</TE>
<TE>   "This is terrific -- an important American artist doing art on
TV," said Bob Sain, director of LACMALab, the research and
educational unit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, as he sat
on stage at the museum's Bing Theater with Scharf during a LACMA
"salon" Tuesday night. Sain lamented the paucity of art on TV. "There
was Sister Wendy and one episode of 'Sex and the City' -- a tour of
the Museum of Modern Art," he joked. "We should have art reports like
weather reports: 'There's a Conceptual [wave] sweeping the West
Coast, but we'll see a return of painting on Tuesday.' "</TE>
<TE>   The LACMA event was itself pure pop, part of the unorthodox
publicity tour for "The Groovenians." Scharf took a traveling
installation -- a customized psychedelic Day-Glo mobile home -- to
museums nationwide, serving Kahlua Snowballs and introducing Jet and
Glindy to the art world.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborators on his cartoon included Scharf friends Dennis Hopper
(he sings) as well as Drena De Niro, Paul Reubens, Debi Mazar,
Vincent Gallo, RuPaul and Ann Magnuson, who all did voice-overs.
Scharf's favorite band, the B-52's, wrote the music. "They're the
musical equivalent to my visualizations," Scharf said. "We were very
much influenced by the same things."</TE>
<TE>   That would be those Day-Glo colors, space travel and suburbia --
just some of Scharf's favorite things. "Paint what you love" was the
advice he received as a young artist, and Scharf loved the creations
of Hanna-Barbera. They offered a geography (a fantastical, whimsical
take on suburbia), a history ("The Flintstones" as the past, "The
Jetsons" as the future) and a language.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, Scharf was asked to create mannequins in his
cartoon style for a New York manufacturer. Realizing that they could
be brought alive, Scharf packed up his family, moved back to Los
Angeles and began to pitch the networks. After three months, he made
contact with Linda Simensky, senior vice president of original
animation at the Cartoon Network. During their first phone
conversation, she looked at postcards of his artwork displayed on her
office walls.</TE>
<TE>   "This was kind of unusual," she said. "We wouldn't normally go
after an artist." But the network thought it was a good fit. "His
work has that kind of animation-friendly feel to it."</TE>
<TE>   The half-hour special will air as part of "Adult Swim," the
network's block of animation aimed at adults. But Scharf said it's
meant for children as well, "like the Pee-wee Herman show."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't gone unnoticed by adults in the art world.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Holdengraber, director of the LACMA Institute for Art and
Cultures, calls the project "an interesting gesture" directed at
serious issues.</TE>
<TE>   As public institutions, including museums, become shopping
destinations (think Monet coasters) and soft drink companies bring
advertising into classrooms, Holdengraber said, high art, low art and
commerce are "areas that are really fuzzy and controversial."</TE>
<TE>   While planning the Scharf salon at the museum, Holdengraber asked
the artist who he would choose as his interlocutor. The answer? Dr.
Seuss. "I think there's a clue in that," Holdengraber said.</TE>
<TE>   On a less fanciful note, he observed, "A museum supposedly takes
the object out of circulation and elevates it beyond its usefulness.
People like Kenny and others are saying, 'Wait a minute, let's put it
back in.' "</TE>
<TE>   And not for the first time. Scharf's mannequins have decorated
windows at Saks Fifth Avenue on Wilshire Boulevard, and his artwork
has been turned into other kinds of products as well -- refrigerator
magnets, milk glasses, thongs -- which are sold at the Shop Chuey
gallery/boutique in Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny straddles the pop movement of the 1980s and the new kids of
the 21st century," like Shepard Fairey of the ubiquitous Obey Giant
stickers, said David Keeps, owner of Shop Chuey. These days, he said,
an artist can choose to be both artist and T-shirt designer.</TE>
<TE>   Or, in this case, cartoon creator.</TE>
<TE>   "It just broadens the whole notion of the boundaries of art,"
Scharf said. "It's a quest to bring the whole pop media world and the
art world to merge, and it's a great way to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Andy would be very proud."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Passion and initiative pay off big time as "Cliff DeYoung in the
Works of Samuel Beckett" marks the film and television actor's return
to his Cal State L.A. alma mater, inaugurating the newly renovated
99-seat Arena Theatre on an auspicious note.</LD>
<LD>   DeYoung's longtime passion for Beckett plays impelled him to seek
permission from Beckett's estate to resurrect this long-forgotten
anthology, compiled in 1962 by Beckett and his legendary interpreter,
Jack MacGowran.</LD>
<LD>   In a compact but impressively complete tour of the Irish author's
signature existential themes and obsessions, DeYoung, in the persona
of Beckett's archetypal dirt-encrusted vagabond, seamlessly weaves
sequences from the more familiar plays ("Waiting for Godot," "Krapp's
Last Tape," "Endgame") with passages from lesser known works, such as
the trio of longer novels ("Malone Dies," "Malloy" and "The
Unnamable") and several short poems and stories.</LD>
<TE>   "I have never been on my way anywhere -- simply on my way," the
nameless wanderer (quoting "From an Abandoned Work") sums up
Beckett's overarching vision of life without meaning. Solitary
attempts to wrest whatever fleeting moments of significance and
contentment we can along the way are chronicled in a thematically
associated stream of consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Beckett's favorite satirical targets are also well represented.
Cheap sentimentality gets skewered in a detailed account of the petty
annoyances that demolished a first love, and the recollection of a
mother waving goodbye is continuously distracted by flat details --
the color of the window pane, the lighting -- everything but emotion.
In another high point, DeYoung delivers Lucky's tongue-twisting
parody of pedantic scholarship from "Godot" in its entirety.</TE>
<TE>   Under Dennis Redfield's minimalist staging, DeYoung adroitly mines
irony, despair and absurdity. A sequence (from "Malloy") detailing a
meticulous procedure for continually redistributing six stones among
four pockets goes Sisyphus one better -- the pointless repetition is
not only a punitive sentence but also enthusiastically embraced.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a complaint to be leveled, it would be the lack of
out-and-out clowning. Beckett plays are frequently cast with
comedians (there are Chaplinesque elements to his tramps). DeYoung's
comedy is more stoic, but he is very much in tune with this
challenging, rarely performed material.</TE>

<TE>   Study in contrast: 'Punk' and 'People'</TE>
<TE>   Two one-acts at the Stage 52 Playhouse span the spectrum from the
tensely compressed to the good-naturedly profuse. The evening's
opener, "Happy Anniversary, Punk!" is the shorter and more controlled
offering. Written and directed by Michael Ajakwe Jr., this
greyhound-paced drama concerns a bereaved father, Al (Bill Lee
Brown), who "celebrates" the first anniversary of his 14-year-old
son's murder by confronting his teenage killer, Big Mac (Willie
Latimore).</TE>
<TE>   Outraged because the legal system has released Big Mac on
probation, Al breaks into Big Mac's house to administer his own
vigilante justice at the point of a pistol. However, Al's efforts to
understand why his son had to die lead him into a discourse with the
rebellious teen -- a conversation fraught with tension, rage and
unexpected humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Ajakwe interjects a bounty of earthy humor into his somewhat
simplistic story, and Brown and Latimore play their polar opposite
roles with raw power and authority. Brown's hard-working family man,
pushed to the limit by his loss, is effectively balanced by
Latimore's unfeeling suburban kid, a youth on a violent shortcut to
manhood who is finally forced to contemplate the consequences of his
actions.</TE>
<TE>   Longer and much more diffuse, Kosmond Russell's "The Cubicle
People" shows the behind-the-scenes feuding and fondling at a big
city advertising agency. Occasionally very funny indeed, the play
features a winning cast, spearheaded by the marvelous Aloma Wright
("Scrubs") as Quita, the agency receptionist, a big and feisty woman
who never hesitates to throw open a closet and rattle the company
skeletons.</TE>
<TE>   Also outstanding is Bonita Brisker as Pashion, the agency femme
fatale, who is unabashedly sleeping her way to the top when her
upward mobility collides with true love. Russell gets unfortunately
preachy in the play's later scenes, losing comedic momentum in
sentimentality and sermonizing. Also problematic is the slipshod
direction by Denise Dowse, whose frequent blackouts for frantic
furniture shifting seem unnecessary and amateurish.</TE>
<TE>   -- F. Kathleen Foley</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Anniversary, Punk!" and "The Cubicle People," Stage 52,
5299 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends

<TE>   Goodwill, but a loose 'Connection'</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, a play is such a mess it seems purposeless to try to
quantify its shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point is Roy Avigdori's "The Palestinian Connection" at
Theatre 6470. Written by, directed by and featuring Avigdori, a
native Israeli who grew up in the Middle East, the play "supports
peace and nothing else" -- or so the writer's notes in the program
would have it. Those writer's notes are about the only clue we have
in this generally clueless production, which vacillates wildly
between farce and polemic.</TE>
<TE>   The action opens in a Tel Aviv apartment, where Vazir (Navid
Negahban), a Palestinian, sits tied and gagged in a chair. (Negahban,
a native-born Iranian, is the best actor in an otherwise ragtag
bunch.) When Betty (vacuous Martina Geller), returning from a
European junket, happens onto a beaten, bound man in the apartment
she shares with Joseph (Sam Feuer), she seems more befuddled than
genuinely alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Betty frolics off to take a bath -- what else would you
do if you found a suspected terrorist in your apartment? -- Vazir
manages to get out of the chair, crawl to the phone and place a
muffled call, gag still in place. That prompts Betty to pistol-whip
him in short order -- a real stretch, considering she's a fluffy,
dumb blond who has no idea who this guy is.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of tone-deaf and unmotivated interaction prevails for
the rest of the play. We soon learn that Joseph and his fanatical
ally Cohen (Avigdori) have caught Vazir with a suitcase full of
explosives and have taken him to this apartment to interrogate him.
(Why Cohen, an Israeli cop, didn't take his suspect directly to
headquarters is anyone's guess.) Vazir's brother Ahmed (Herzl Tobey),
a Palestinian terrorist whose fanaticism rivals Cohen's, vows
vengeance against the men who captured Vazir. While all this equal
opportunity fanaticism is raging around them, Joseph and Vazir
discover that they have a lot in common after all.</TE>
<TE>   But of course. And just as predictably, nice guys finish last in
Avigdori's confused play, which strives hard to make some warm, fuzzy
statement about the purposelessness of war. However, there's a wide
divide between intention and execution, as proven by this pointless
exercise in goodwill and bad art.</TE>

<HD>Yo, Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Incendiary rapper Eminem makes a surprisingly compelling
screen debut under Curtis Hanson's direction in '8 Mile.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How angry is Eminem, the brooding dark prince of perpetually
aggrieved sensitivity? Let us count the ways.</LD>
<LD>   Angry enough to sell 30 million albums, a record for rap. Angry
enough to outrage guardians of public decency and allow every
disaffected teenager in America to slipstream on his inextinguishable
hostility. And angry enough to attract commercially savvy producer
Brian Grazer and Curtis Hanson, one of the most adept and
sophisticated of directors, to make "8 Mile," a major studio release
based loosely on the first steps in the up-from-the-underclass
journey Marshall Mathers took to become one of the rulers of rap.</LD>
<LD>   But just as "8 Mile's" story is book-ended by battles, one-on-one
gladiatorial rap contests in which the audience picks a winner, so
the film itself is a battle between God's angry man, this creature of
insatiable rage and the boa constrictor Hollywood system, willing and
able to swallow anything whole and make it fit a predigested mold.
Even an artist whose justifiable boast is "I just say whatever I want
to whoever I want whenever I want wherever I want however I want"
could disappear without a trace.</LD>
<TE>   Remarkably, however, that did not happen with "8 Mile," a
fascinating, surprisingly entertaining stand-off that has adroitly
managed to satisfy both of its constituencies, allowing all sides to
legitimately claim victory.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, as written by "The Mod Squad's" Scott Silver (with, according
to Entertainment Weekly, uncredited work by Jesse Wigutow), "8 Mile"
is very much an old-fashioned somebody-up-there-likes-me kind of
story, replete with traditional plot devices (will the hero have to
work on the night of the climactic battle?) that are decades old.
This venerable structure in effect facilitates the mainstreaming of
rap, enabling civilian audiences to feel the safety and security of
familiarity that's simply not in the cards when listening to Eminem's
earlier, more nasty and threatening work.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, though you can see "8 Mile" and not really know exactly why
the man aroused passion pro and con across America, you certainly get
a strong hint. Eminem has such intense presence that even in the
film's somewhat denatured form, he and his music have undeniable
power and integrity. In fact, Eminem's seething fury, impossible to
even think of disguising, is the realest thing in the film and the
heart of its appeal. His hostility, savagery and disgust as well as
his undeniable musical gifts come from too deep a place to be
completely blanded out the way Elvis' talents notoriously were, and
fans who come to ride this particular whirlwind will also not be
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Given the past history of rock-star movies, it was far from
certain that this particular marriage of sensibilities would work.
Two interlocking factors were key in frankly enabling us to forget
how formulaic "8 Mile" is. One was Eminem's genuine presence and
on-screen charisma; the other, director Hanson's filmmaking gifts,
including an ability (witness Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in "L.A.
Confidential" and Michael Douglas in "Wonder Boys") to get memorable
performances from his lead actors.</TE>
<TE>   With deep-set, out-from-under eyes and an eight-mile stare, Eminem
is someone the camera likes from the moment he steps on screen. With
his tattoos covered by a hooded sweatshirt and his piercings on
hiatus because of the film's 1995 setting, the actor has something of
the quality of an updated James Dean (the director suggested he watch
"East of Eden," but apparently that never happened) and he carries
the picture like it's second nature.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr., a.k.a. Bunny Rabbit, an aspiring
Detroit rapper with a genuine gift for language but an uncertainty
about what to do with his life. When "8 Mile" begins, he's carrying
everything he owns in a black plastic trash bag and is about to move
back in with his impecunious mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger, who won
an Oscar in Hanson's "L.A. Confidential"), and her loutish boyfriend,
Greg (Michael Shannon).</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy and his friends dream of rap stardom, and in fact two
different people insist that they are Bunny Rabbit's ticket out. One
is his pal Future (Mekhi Phifer of "Clockers" and "O"), who wants
Jimmy to persevere in the rap battles he hosts; the other is
neighborhood entrepreneur Wink (Eugene Byrd), who insists, "I'm
building my empire, and I'm taking you with me."</TE>
<TE>   With a guy as good-looking as Jimmy, a romantic entanglement is
also inevitable. He runs into the attractive Alex (the talented
Brittany Murphy), an aspiring model, at the car-bumper factor where
he works. At the same factory, Jimmy has "8 Mile's" most curious
scene, a rap battle where he comes to the defense of a maligned gay
fellow worker, a sequence that feels like it has more to do with the
star's well-publicized difficulties with the gay community than
furthering the film's plot.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jimmy has run-ins with rival rappers, Eminem has such an
overpowering presence that the only involving conflict his character
has is with himself. Like Shakespeare's Prince Hal, he is royalty in
mufti, wrestling with inner demons before feeling the confidence to
declare himself the heir apparent, if not the king.</TE>
<TE>   This is a classic story, and in Hanson "8 Mile" has one of
Hollywood's most accomplished classicists, a director whose films
seem instinctively to make all the right moves. Hanson was also
shrewd enough to build in a six-week rehearsal schedule to enable his
star to feel comfortable with the moviemaking process.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson also insisted that "8 Mile" (named after a Detroit street
that is a racial and economic dividing line) have the particular
texture of the Motor City, Eminem's hometown. He shot the film on
location and used Philip Messina, the production designer on
"Traffic," and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who did the gritty
"Amores Perros," to ensure an authentic look.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of "8 Mile's" realistic touches get wearing -- there's
more use of "dog," as in "yo, dog" than in the annual meeting of the
Westminster Kennel Club -- the film is never more real than when
Jimmy unloads his anger on someone close to him, a frequent
occurrence. Eminem is an actor with a rare gift for rage, and movie
careers, even big ones, have been built on less.</TE>

<HD>That '70s game show: Genial hosts revive 'Pyramid,' 'Feud'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's meet our new players.</LD>
<LD>   Donny is a former teen idol who's a little bit rock 'n' roll. A
father of five, he is married to the lovely Debbie and his hobbies
include car racing and genealogy.</LD>
<LD>   Richard is a comedic actor who portrayed a handyman on "Home
Improvement." Oddly enough, Richard managed an apartment building
before landing the sitcom and hails from a long line of builders.</LD>
<TE>   Donny Osmond, star of the new "Pyramid," and Richard Karn, who
emcees the latest incarnation of "Family Feud," may not be competing
against each other, but since September they have been merrily
fighting for ratings as hosts of their syndicated game shows.
Locally, both shows air weekdays on KCAL-TV Channel 9 ("Family Feud"
at 8 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., "Pyramid" at 7 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   Both shows stay close to their 1970s roots. "Pyramid," known as
"$25,000 Pyramid" and "$100,000 Pyramid" back in its heyday, is the
same effortless party game, but the players have notebook computers
and the set has an industrial glitz design. The "Feud" benefits from
its invitingly simple format in which contestants try to match survey
answers, though it's still a bit aggravating to watch teammates jump
for joy no matter how inane the response.</TE>
<TE>   You can relax and feel smart watching either game. On style
points, however, Osmond is the clear winner: smooth, genial and
generically handsome in a Dick Clark kind of way.</TE>
<TE>   Though Karn is less polished and won't make anyone forget original
host Richard Dawson, he at least tries to be funny, coming off like a
svelte Louie Anderson, his most immediate predecessor here.</TE>
<TE>   And what if these new hosts don't make it in the ratings? There
are always parting gifts.</TE>

<HD>It's Martin for Oscars 2003</HD>
<DH>Picking the comedian to host the Academy Awards, producer
Gil Cates calls him witty, quick on his feet and 'always on top of

<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Martin, the actor, playwright, novelist, art collector and
comedian of "Saturday Night Live" fame, whose dry and cutting
monologue drew rave reviews when he hosted his first Academy Awards
in 2001, has accepted an invitation to emcee the 75th anniversary
Oscars next March in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Martin issued a statement that noted he was pleased to be hosting
his second Oscar telecast "because fear and nausea always make me
lose weight."</LD>
<LD>   Gil Cates, who returns for his 11th stint as producer of the
Academy Awards show, said he was "thrilled" to get Martin, who he
added has what it takes to host the Oscars because he is witty, quick
on his feet and "always on top of the unfolding action."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, when Martin took the stage during the 73rd Academy Awards
in March 2001, it was a question whether he would knock 'em dead a la
Billy Crystal or flame out like David Letterman, but Martin soon had
the star-studded audience in stitches and applauding.</TE>
<TE>   In just one of many memorable jokes from that show, Martin cracked
that even though best actress nominee Ellen Burstyn had gained 30
pounds and looked 20 years older for her role in "Requiem for a
Dream," she would be "hit on" by actor Russell Crowe.</TE>
<TE>   He further needled the dour Crowe, who had apparently been the
target of a kidnapping plot, when he mentioned that the FBI had
uncovered who was behind it -- and pointed to fellow best actor
nominee Tom Hanks in the audience. Without missing a beat, Hanks
bowed his head in shame and whispered, "I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, Martin was not the first choice to host next
year's show. Cates initially approached Crystal and asked if he would
like to emcee what would have been his eighth Oscar telecast, but
Crystal wanted more time to think about it. With a deadline looming,
Cates turned to his longtime friend Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "No comment" was all Cates would say Thursday when asked about
approaching Crystal. Then he added, "There are a lot of great people
who have hosted this show, from Johnny Carson to Bob Hope. Billy
Crystal was and is a great host, but this year it's Steve."</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Cates have a relationship in the theater going back
years. Martin's play "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" was the first
production at the UCLA Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, where Cates
serves as artistic director. The comedy, which concerns a fictional
meeting between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein at a Paris cafe at
the turn of the 20th century, is also being developed as a film.</TE>
<TE>   Martin recently completed filming on "Bringing Down the House,"
which co-stars Queen Latifah and Eugene Levy and is due out next
spring. Filming begins in January on "Shopgirl," which he adapted
from his novella.</TE>
<TE>   Cates noted that Martin's next play, "Underpants," will be
produced at the Geffen next year. Hyperion will publish Martin's next
novel, "The Pleasure of My Company," next fall.</TE>
<TE>   The 75th Oscars are scheduled to be presented March 23 at the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Cates recalled with a chuckle that in Martin's first stint as
host, the Oscars began with Martin's photograph displayed by U.S.
astronauts as part of a space-travel visual sequence. Cates, who's
returning after a year off, is confident that Martin will top that
performance.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Loses Ruling on Cybersquatting Law</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. lost a bid to reinstate trademark suits against Web sites
such as Hotwheelsweb.com and Barbie-Club.com.</LD>
<LD>   The world's top toy manufacturer sued 57 Internet sites two years
ago, invoking a 1999 law requiring the sites to cancel or transfer
the domain names. The law targeted people who were "cybersquatting"
by using other companies' trademarks to register their Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge in New York dismissed the claims, saying El
Segundo-based Mattel should have filed suit elsewhere against sites
registered in Maryland, Virginia and California. An appeals court
agreed in a ruling that clarifies where companies must bring such
cases.</LD>

<HD>AMD to Cut Jobs as Part of Restructuring Effort</HD>
<DH>The struggling tech firm will reduce its work force 10% to
20% by the end of next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squeezed by a bruising price war and a steep downturn in the
semiconductor market, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said Thursday that
it would cut 10% to 20% of its work force by the end of next year as
part of a larger restructuring effort.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 2 maker of computer microprocessors has struggled against
eroding market share and aggressive price competition from industry
leader Intel Corp. Those factors have led Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD
to post five consecutive quarterly net losses totaling $561.5
million.</LD>
<LD>   Shares fell 41 cents to $6.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   In its third quarter ended Sept. 30, AMD's loss widened to $254
million, or 74 cents a share, from $187 million, or 54 cents, in the
second quarter. Sales crumbled by a third from the prior year to
$508.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The chip maker told investors in October of its plans to trim $300
million in expenses next year and take an unspecified charge in the
current quarter to pay for the restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   The job reductions are expected to yield $200 million in savings,
AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said. The remaining $100 million will come
from a reduction in spending on chip-building plants and equipment,
he said. To save money, AMD's new chief executive, Hector Ruiz, has
departed from the company's usual insistence on owning all of its own
fabrication plants and has been selectively farming out some of its
manufacturing to outside companies.</TE>
<TE>   AMD employs 13,187 full-time workers, including 2,500 at its
headquarters. Although the company hasn't released details of which
departments will be affected, Prairie said the cuts probably would
hit workers in sales, marketing and corporate support functions but
would not hurt research and development. The company is expected to
release more information on its restructuring in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Because sales of personal computers have been anemic this year,
AMD is not expected to get much of a boost this winter. Company
executives forecast a 25% sales increase this quarter, but analysts
say profit margins are unlikely to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "A big piece of AMD's business tends toward the value-end
machines, and Intel has been very aggressive on pricing," said Steve
Kleynhans, vice president of research firm Meta Group Inc. "This adds
up to a very bad Christmas for AMD."</TE>
<TE>   AMD has been losing market share to Intel. In the third quarter,
AMD's share of the PC chip market fell to 11.6% from 15.6% in the
second quarter and 20% a year earlier, said Dean McCarron, president
of Mercury Research Inc. Intel's share grew to 86.8%, up from 82.6%
in the second quarter and 79.2% in 2001.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Productivity grew briskly in the summer, consumers splurged in
October and fewer Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits
last week, a dose of good news for the wobbly economy.</LD>
<LD>   Productivity -- the amount of output per hour of work -- picked up
in the third quarter, growing at an annual rate of 4%, the Labor
Department said Thursday. That was more than twice as fast as the
second quarter's 1.7% pace.</LD>
<LD>   For the 12 months ended in September, productivity grew at a 5.3%
rate, the strongest showing since the 12 months ended in the third
quarter of 1983.</LD>
<TE>   Gains in productivity are helping to keep a lid on inflation, an
important factor for Federal Reserve policymakers as they try to
energize the sputtering economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Fed reported Thursday that consumers are borrowing
at a brisk pace, with consumer credit growing at an annual rate of
6.9% in September, up from an August growth rate of 3.9%. Consumer
debt outstanding rose by $9.9 billion in September to $1.733
trillion.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the consumer was not discouraged by the uncertainties
that have been plaguing the economy and financial markets," said
Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Another report from the Labor Department found that new claims for
unemployment benefits dropped last week by a seasonally adjusted
20,000, to 390,000, the lowest level since early October.</TE>
<TE>   Workers got paid for their efficiency. Hourly compensation --
before being adjusted for inflation -- rose at a rate of 4.8% in the
third quarter, up from a 3.9% growth rate in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusted for inflation, hourly compensation rose at a 2.9% rate in
the third quarter, up from a 0.5% pace in the second quarter.</TE>

<HD>FCC Allots Airways for Wireless Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators on Thursday set aside additional airwaves for the
wireless industry to provide high-speed mobile Internet access and
other advanced services.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote by the Federal Communications Commission
follows a compromise reached with the Pentagon last summer, which
agreed to relinquish control over about 90 megahertz of spectrum that
the military had been using for satellite and aircraft operations. As
the number of wireless phone subscribers has ballooned to more than
137 million, the wireless carriers have pressed the government to
allocate more airwaves for commercial uses.</LD>
<LD>   Over the coming months, the FCC will draft rules for using the new
airwaves and then auction the spectrum off to commercial wireless
users by 2004.</LD>
<TE>   The burgeoning market for advanced mobile services -- known as
third-generation wireless, or "3G" -- represents a crucial challenge
for the Bush administration, which must balance the wireless
industry's voracious appetite for new spectrum with strategic and
national security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The world's nearly 500 million wireless subscribers are projected
to nearly triple to 1.3 billion in 2005, creating a $561-billion
market in high-speed wireless Internet devices.</TE>
<TE>   Although existing mobile phones can provide wireless Internet
access, the process is slow and cumbersome. By contrast, advanced
mobile services being introduced by carriers such as Sprint PCS Group
and Verizon Wireless Inc. promise to nearly quadruple current
transmission speeds. That will allow users to download music, surf
the Internet faster and even get instantaneous navigational
information such as the location of nearby restaurants or gas
stations.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate but related action, the FCC on Thursday began a
sweeping examination of the government's management of the nation's
airwaves in hopes of making more spectrum available for wireless
devices.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Sales Fall; Turnaround Still Expected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite posting a small but crucial gain in service revenue, Global
Crossing Ltd. said Thursday that overall sales fell and its net loss
rose nearly 14% in September compared with the previous month.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based company, which filed for bankruptcy protection
in January, said the results show that Global Crossing is meeting its
projections and is on track to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings at
the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The communications network operator acknowledged that it still
faces challenges, but Chief Executive John Legere said, "We continue
to execute a full-scale turnaround of the business."</LD>
<TE>   In its monthly operating report for September, Global Crossing
said it lost $157 million, or 17 cents a share, an increase from a
loss of $138 million, or 16 cents, in August. Sales totaled $254
million, down from $255 million the previous month. The unaudited
report includes the financial results of the company's subsidiary
Asia Global Crossing, a separate company that is facing its own cash
crunch but is not part of Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which had executive offices in Beverly Hills,
said its revenue from telecommunications and data services -- a
category vital to the company's future -- rose for the second month
in a row, totaling $237 million, up from $236 million in August.
Reflecting its continuing review of sharply devalued assets, the
company also reiterated its plan to write down the value of its
worldwide fiber-optic network by about $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But Global Crossing also slashed income projections for 2003,
expected to be its first year out of bankruptcy. In a recent court
filing, Global Crossing reduced its net-income estimate to $73
million, down from an earlier estimate of $174 million for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Since filing for bankruptcy, Global Crossing has been trying to
wean itself from its heavy reliance on large multi-year sales of
network capacity to other telecommunications carriers. Those sales
boosted Global Crossing's revenue over the years, but they have
become problematic now that the market for long-term deals has
evaporated and the accounting behind them has been discredited by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>

<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shuttered KWHY television studios in Hollywood have been
purchased by a Los Angeles developer who plans to turn them into
stores and possibly apartments.</LD>
<LD>   Champion Development Group bought the blighted five-building
campus at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and St. Andrews
Place for $2.4 million and plans to spend an additional $5 million in
upgrades.</LD>
<LD>   The property last served as the production and office facilities
for Spanish-language TV station KWHY Channel 22, which was acquired
by Telemundo Communications Group in June 2001. Telemundo merged KWHY
with its other Southern California TV station, Glendale-based KVEA
52, leaving the Hollywood property vacant.</LD>
<TE>   The buildings were erected in the 1920s and 1930s, said Robert
Champion, principal of Champion Development. The former KWHY sound
stages started as garages and have high wood-trussed ceilings that
are often considered desirable by tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Champion said he plans to rent the space to retailers that would
appeal to nearby residents, such as a drugstore or a furniture store
that would attract shoppers from the Home Depot across the street.
Apartments may be added to the 18,600-square-foot property's second
level, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely see Hollywood reemerging and thought this property
would make a great opportunity to do retail or retail with a
residential component," Champion said.</TE>

<HD>ICN Shares Jump 30% on Restructuring News</HD>
<DH>Appointment of new management, strong third-quarter
earnings encourage investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors boosted ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s shares by 30% Thursday
after the Costa Mesa company announced a new management team, a
restructuring plan and better-than-expected earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The company said Robert O'Leary, who had been serving as interim
chief executive, will take the position permanently. ICN also named
Timothy Tyson, an executive at British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, as
president and chief operating officer, and Bary G. Bailey, an
executive vice president at PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., as chief
financial officer.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the top management appointments encouraged
shareholders despite the fact that ICN reported a net loss of $74.9
million, including asset write-downs, or 90 cents per share. That
compared with a loss of $11.7 million, or 14 cents a share, a year
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   But ICN's third-quarter operating earnings beat Wall Street
projections by 3 cents a share. ICN reported a profit of 18 cents per
share for the third quarter, not counting one-time items, up from 12
cents a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% in the third quarter to $215.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   ICN shares finished the day up $2.79 at $11.99 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also said the company's restructuring plan signals that
ICN's leadership will steer a much different course from that of its
founder and longtime chief, Milan Panic.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, ICN said it will sell its Eastern European and
Russian businesses as well as its raw-materials operations in Hungary
and the Czech Republic as part of its concentration on specialty
pharmaceuticals, O'Leary said. Even the company's converted Boeing
737-100 corporate jet is on the selling block, and its smaller
JetStar has already been sold.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing the logical things that need to be done to get back
on track," O'Leary, 58, said in an interview. "We were a specialty
pharmaceuticals company before that term was invented. We have a
wonderful global footprint, but we were spread too thin and wide."</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary said ICN would place more emphasis on its dermatology unit
and pharmaceutical sales in North America, Latin America and parts of
Western and Central Europe. The company also announced that it would
complete cost reductions amounting to $21 million by the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   The company continued to benefit from its 80% stake in Ribapharm
Inc., which makes the hepatitis C treatment ribavirin. ICN received
$63.4 million in royalties for ribavirin during the quarter, up from
$24 million a year ago, because patients infected with the hepatitis
C virus have begun taking it in combination with a newly approved
Schering-Plough interferon drug called PEG-Intron that lasts longer
and works better than older treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Ribavarin royalties helped mitigate lower revenue and sales from
the company's North American specialty pharmaceutical business.</TE>
<TE>   The restructuring signaled that "there is light at the end of the
tunnel and that there is a viable business here that will be able to
turn a decent profit," said Arnhold &amp; Bleichroeder analyst Richard R.
Stover.</TE>
<TE>   Herman Saftlas, an analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's, added that
O'Leary is a respected manager who seems to have a good team in
place.</TE>

<HD>Judge in Idealab Investor Case Seeks More Details Before
Deciding Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ralph Dau on Thursday asked for more
information before deciding which allegations can go forward to trial
in a case involving angry shareholders of Pasadena technology
incubator Idealab Inc.</LD>
<LD>   After questioning attorneys on both sides for more than four hours
on certain details of the case, Dau said he would make a ruling after
he receives additional information by Nov. 18.</LD>
<LD>   The civil case, filed this year by more than 40 shareholders who
put about $1 billion into Idealab in early 2000, alleges that company
founder Bill Gross mismanaged the firm after the tech bubble
collapsed and that he arranged sweetheart financial deals for himself
and company insiders with investors' money.</LD>
<TE>   The investors, who own so-called preferred shares, want the
company dissolved so they can take back at least a portion of the
$350 million of liquid assets left in Idealab.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, 44, says the allegations are false. He wants to continue
operating Idealab, promising that many of the fledgling ventures in
development will prove successful.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the plaintiffs said their attorney, Skip Miller,
would be unavailable for comment. David Siegel, attorney for Idealab,
also was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Dau seemed particularly interested in the "breach of
fiduciary duty" allegations, asking such rhetorical questions as, "Is
it a breach of fiduciary duty to lose money?"</TE>
<TE>   Dau also questioned plaintiffs' allegations that Marcia Goodstein,
Gross' wife and the company's chief operating officer, is overpaid
and unqualified to hold her job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's staggering to think that one person owning one share of
preferred stock can say, 'Wait a minute, the person you just hired is
not competent, so I will put a stick in the wheel of your bicycle and
file this lawsuit,' " Dau said.</TE>
<TE>   In his next ruling, Dau is expected to decide whether the
shareholders, who own only about 10% of Idealab even though they put
up about 96% of its capital at the firm's peak, are significant
enough investors to even have the right to call for the company to be
dissolved.</TE>

<HD>JetBlue Reports 21% Surge in Profit</HD>
<DH>The carrier's improved results come despite an 82% rise in
costs, most of them expansion-related.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JetBlue Airways Corp. said Thursday that its third-quarter profit
jumped 21% from a year earlier even as the low-fare carrier spent
heavily to expand service in California and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   But the airline also incurred some unusual costs in the quarter,
including a sharp rise in credit card fraud, and JetBlue's stock
tumbled $3.70 to close at $37.10 on Nasdaq after the earnings were
released.</LD>
<LD>   JetBlue is one of the few airlines making money, mainly because
its general operating costs are among the lowest in the business. The
New York-based airline, which launched service in early 2000, also
said it enjoyed its best quarterly load factor yet in the quarter,
with 84.8% of its seats filled.</LD>
<TE>   JetBlue's net income rose to $12.2 million, or 27 cents a share,
in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $10.1 million, or 30 cents,
a year earlier. Its per-share earnings fell because JetBlue, which
had its initial public stock offering in April, now has more common
shares outstanding than a year ago. Revenue doubled, to $165.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue's improved results were contrasted with the third quarter
a year ago, when the industry suffered from the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 attacks. But the higher profit also came despite an 82%
surge in third-quarter costs, which largely reflected JetBlue's
expansion of flights from Long Beach -- its West Coast hub -- and
other cities.</TE>
<TE>   One of its major expansions came in early September, when JetBlue
began service between Long Beach and Oakland. It has since added
flights from Long Beach to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. The new
flights were rolled out earlier than JetBlue had planned because AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines and other carriers are pressing to take
over JetBlue's unused slots at Long Beach Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of money going from six flights a day ... to 18
flights" today, David Neeleman, JetBlue's chief executive, said in a
conference call with analysts. "It was the preservation of an asset,
and we had to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But Neeleman also said JetBlue suffered "a big spike up" in credit
card charge-backs that the airline attributed mostly to Internet
fraud. In an interview, Neeleman said the charge-backs, in which a
cardholder is reimbursed after disputing a transaction, nearly
tripled from the second quarter, to about $1.2 million, but that the
company is employing new technology and employee training to curb the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue sells most of its tickets online. Its average one-way fare
in the quarter was $106.69, up from $101.41 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue also said it moved up plans for service between Las Vegas
and New York to capture business from National Airlines, which
grounded operations Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Playing by the Rules?</HD>
<DH>Top song on Radio Disney is by a Disney Channel actress
under contract to a Disney label. Critics call for more disclosure
from the parent company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among radio broadcasters across the country, Hilary Duff's sugary pop
tune "I Can't Wait" has fallen completely flat. A single station --
in Albuquerque -- has played the song just one time, and that was
back in September.</LD>
<LD>   There is, however, a glaring exception: the Radio Disney empire.
On its 52 stations nationwide, "I Can't Wait" is ranked No. 1, with
Duff getting more airplay than Britney Spears. In Los Angeles,
Disney's KDIS-AM (710) has played the song a whopping 850 times
during the last six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   So why is Radio Disney in such a hurry to play "I Can't Wait"?</LD>
<TE>   Critics in the industry think they have an answer: Duff is under
contract with Buena Vista Records, which is a sister company of Radio
Disney, which is affiliated with the Disney Channel, which telecasts
"Lizzie McGuire," which stars Duff.</TE>
<TE>   Many question whether the cozy relationship among the players --
all owned by Burbank-based entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. --
violates arm's-length broadcasting rules of the Federal
Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of those rules have become murkier with sweeping
consolidation in radio, media watchdogs say Disney and other
broadcasters are testing the limits.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff clearly violates the spirit -- if not the letter -- of
the law," said media expert Robert McChesney, a professor of
communications at University of Illinois. "It undermines the
integrity of the public airwaves, corroding editorial space with
commercial factors. It's very damaging."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Jones, head of programming at Radio Disney, said the radio
chain does not give preferential treatment to acts with business ties
to its corporate parent.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see where someone might misconstrue that there was a
conflict of interest with this song," Jones said. "But Hilary Duff
was truly driven to No. 1 by kid requests ... not by what label" her
song is on.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said Duff is more popular with Radio Disney listeners than
young pop star Avril Lavigne is. Lavigne has sold 2.5 million U.S.
copies of her smash CD "Let Go," according to Neilsen/SoundScan.
Duff's song, a track on the "Lizzie McGuire" soundtrack, has sold
barely 124,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations are granted broadcast licenses by the government in
exchange for a pledge to serve the public interest. The government
prohibits broadcast licensees from using the airwaves for their own
benefit or to gain a competitive advantage in any transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years ago, after a payola scandal, the government instituted
a law prohibiting broadcasters from accepting money or anything of
value for playing songs without disclosing that information to
listeners.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Congress passed a bill designed to crack down on
"plugola," demanding that broadcast licensees take "extraordinary
measures" to let listeners know about potential conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   That law required broadcasters to disclose "publicly and
prominently" the existence of financial ties.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mid-1980s, the FCC decided the disclosure regulation
was "unnecessarily restrictive." The agency believed market forces
would correct abuses naturally. Stations that plugged their own
products, the theory went, would be abandoned by listeners, who would
turn to a plethora of other choices on the dial.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that those choices no longer exist, and the rules
have not been updated to reflect the effect of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which eliminated restrictions on broadcast
mergers.</TE>
<TE>   "The tremendous consolidation of recent years has made the entire
landscape less competitive," FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps said.
"I understand the arguments for synergy. But I think it's time that
broadcasters start taking their public interest responsibilities more
seriously. And I think the FCC needs to be more vigilant in
monitoring and enforcing the laws."</TE>
<TE>   Today's broadcast environment is dominated by corporate giants
such as Clear Channel Communications Inc. It controls more than 1,200
stations, many in the same city.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's relentless promotion of Duff's music is the latest in a
series of controversial issues that raise questions about FCC rules
and enforcement policies. Last month, it was disclosed that KPWR-FM
(106) was giving heavy play to rapper Shade Sheist, whose CD was
financed by the station's parent, Emmis Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Emmis radio division President Rick Cummings said the radio chain
had no legal obligation to disclose the business arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   But in the face of mounting criticism, the chain decided to begin
alerting listeners to the connection between the artist and the
company.</TE>
<TE>   KPWR programming executive Damion Young, who runs the Emmis label
that releases Sheist, also charges record labels a fee to remix
singles that eventually get played on Emmis stations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, several disc jockeys at Emmis stations have signed
artist contracts with record labels whose music they play regularly
on their shows.</TE>
<TE>   "In theory, if you had to announce every one of the relationships
that some of our employees at various stations have with artists and
record labels, you wouldn't be able to take care of any other kind of
business," Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   "So the question is, at what point do the disclosures have to
stop?"</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of critics, of course, the more relevant question is:
When will most stations start them?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, for Radio Disney anyway, seems to be no time soon.
"Britney Spears and 'N Sync used to be No. 1 here -- and they weren't
on a Disney label," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's Hilary Duff that kids want to hear. It doesn't matter
that she's signed to Disney. We don't need to disclose it."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Retreat on Economy Worries, Cisco Warning</HD>
<DH>Wall Street takes a breather as investors reassess Fed's
bold move. The tech sector takes a hit after networking giant's dim
outlook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell and bond yields plunged Thursday as investors took a
skeptical second look at the Federal Reserve's surprisingly steep
interest cut, which touched off a rally on Wall Street the day
before.</LD>
<LD>   "The Fed's move has not necessarily improved confidence," Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, said of the
policymakers' decision Wednesday to cut their key borrowing rate by a
half of a percentage point.</LD>
<LD>   "The Federal Reserve has telegraphed to the world that the U.S.
economy is so bad that interest rates have to be cut a whopping" half
point, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 184.77 points, or 2.1%, to
8,586.24, snapping a four-day winning streak. The broader Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index slipped 21.11 points, or 2.3%, to 902.65 and the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sank 42.28 points, or 3%, to 1,376.71.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.88%
from Wednesday's close of 4.03%, as traders shifted assets out of
stocks and into bonds. The 10-year T-note yield has been falling back
toward the 44-year low of 3.57% it reached Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Reassessment of the Fed's bold move was only one of several
factors contributing to the day's stock slide, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Systems' earnings announcement late Wednesday -- in which
the networking giant said the revenue outlook remains weak -- spurred
selling in big tech names. Cisco slid 61 cents to $12.35, IBM dropped
$2.59 to $78.95, Hewlett-Packard lost 79 cents to $16.72 and
Microsoft slipped $1.02 to $56.01.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment Thursday of Westar Energy's CEO on bank fraud
charges put the issue of corporate malfeasance back in the spotlight,
sending the firm's shares reeling. Although it was unclear whether
the indictment was related to Westar's operations, the firm's stock
sank $2.35 to $8.50 before the NYSE issued a midday trading halt.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a "reinvigorated" President Bush -- whose party took
control of both congressional houses in Tuesday's election -- rattled
nerves by issuing another warning to Iraq regarding weapons
inspections, said Reg Gipson, president of L.A.-based Alpha Analytics
Investment Group.</TE>
<TE>   "All these factors reminded investors that what ails the economy
unfortunately cannot be cured by the Fed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the market may simply have been due for a breather
after its recent run-up, said James Midanek, partner in the Walnut
Creek, Calif.-based investment firm Midanek/Pak Advisors. From its
five-year low Oct. 9 through Wednesday, the Dow rose 20.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Midanek also said a Labor Department report showing that
productivity grew at a brisk 4% annual rate in the third quarter may
have unnerved some. Though productivity helps keep inflation in
check, he said the report may have added to the increasingly loud
"deflation" buzz.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * J.P. Morgan lost $1.46 to $20.60 amid rumors about potential
losses in its derivatives trading. The company called the speculation
"false and irresponsible." Other bank stocks fell in reaction to
lower interest rates, which can chip into profits, including
Citigroup, off $1.44 to $36.45, and Wells Fargo, down $1.44 to
$47.21.</TE>
<TE>   * Homebuilders slumped after CS First Boston downgraded the
sector, saying the housing boom may have peaked. Centex slid $3.04 to
$44.92, Toll Bros. fell $1.49 to $20.20 and Calabasas-based Ryland
Group lost $3.80 to $38.40.</TE>
<TE>   * European indexes fell, including a 4.3% drop in Germany and a
3.2% slide in France, in advance of the European Central Bank's
decision to leave interest rates unchanged.</TE>

<HD>'Monsters' Pushes Up Disney Profit</HD>
<DH>Movie division helps propel earnings rise of 18%. Income
falls at three other divisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates and Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. capped one of its most difficult years ever with an
18% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter results, thanks in part to strong
DVD and video sales of "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Michael Eisner predicted even better results down
the line. He said profit should grow 20% to 30% in the year ahead,
despite continuing problems with the ABC television network and soft
theme park results. Some media specialists say that goal may be
achievable because current profit levels are so low.</LD>
<LD>   Although fourth-quarter earnings were up overall, operating income
at three of Disney's four divisions was down for the period.</LD>
<TE>   In a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Thursday, Eisner
described the last year as "difficult on many fronts, but one in
which we emerged stronger and in a better position than when we
began."</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank entertainment company reported quarterly net income of
$222 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
profit of $188 million, or 9 cents, adjusted to reflect revised
accounting rules. Without the adjustment, net income a year earlier
would have been $53 million, or 3 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The latest results, which Disney had telegraphed to investors,
were in line with Wall Street's diminished expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the three-month period ended Sept. 30 rose 15% to $6.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Recovery still appears to be way off," said Jordan Rohan, an
analyst with SoundView Technology Group.</TE>
<TE>   Added John Tinker, managing director of Blaylock &amp; Partners, "The
company is still in the 'show me' mode."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's last fiscal year was one of the bleakest the company has
endured in a decade, mainly because of the steep falloff in tourism
and weak ratings at ABC. The company's stock price has lagged, and
its credit rating was downgraded. Eisner has been under pressure from
investors and some members of the Disney board to quickly repair the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal 2002, Disney's net income rose to $1.3 billion, or 63
cents a share, from $891 million, or 42 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Although up 46%, the numbers are skewed because the 2002 figure
includes a $216-million pretax gain from the sale of an investment in
media chain Knight Ridder, and the 2001 number reflects restructuring
charges of $1.5 billion at Disney's ill-fated Internet operation.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Disney executives told analysts and reporters that
they believe the ship is being righted.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting Disney's earnings was the fourth-quarter performance of
the studio, which reversed a year-earlier loss of $121 million with
operating income of $149 million on a 52% jump in revenue, to $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The results underscore how important DVD sales have become to
entertainment giants. In addition, Disney benefited from the
theatrical release of the hits "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Signs."</TE>
<TE>   It's a different story for Disney's media networks, which include
the highly profitable ESPN cable channel and ailing ABC. Income in
that unit fell 60% to $147 million on a 6% rise in revenue to $2.4
billion. The division saw a 49% drop in operating income for the year
to $990 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney President Robert Iger said ABC's losses would continue to
be substantial this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're crawling back out of a hole that was larger than
we ever hoped," Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   But Iger and Eisner touted ABC's success at gaining a foothold in
the ratings with such shows as "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter" and "The Bachelor."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's theme parks continued to reflect the effects of the weak
economy and a drop-off in travel after last year's terrorist attacks.
Operating income for the division fell 25% in the quarter to $235
million on a 1% dip in revenue to $1.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, attendance at Walt Disney World was down
11% from the prior year. Attendance at Disneyland was slightly higher
than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives said they expected an improvement in the theme
park business by next year, but gave mixed signals.</TE>
<TE>   Although international travel has improved, local attendance at
Walt Disney World suffered in the fourth quarter, which Disney
attributed to steep discounting by rivals such as Universal Studios
and SeaWorld in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's consumer products unit suffered an 8% decline in income
to $82 million as revenue dropped 8% to $569 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares fell 60 cents to $18.26 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Results were announced after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>United Online Posts First Profit</HD>
<DH>Firm operating cut-rate access services NetZero and Juno
has surprised analysts and skeptics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discount Internet service provider United Online Inc., which offers
online connections for $9.95 a month, posted its first quarterly
profit Thursday, prompting analysts to declare that the cut-rate
Internet service is finally in the game.</LD>
<LD>   The Westlake Village company said it earned $1.5 million, or 3
cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, contrasted
with a loss of $23.9 million, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenue jumped
to $58.1 million, or 38%, from $42 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which offers online service under the brand names
NetZero and Juno Online at about half the rate of competitors such as
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online unit and EarthLink Inc., had
long struggled.</LD>
<TE>   "This is really a milestone for them," said media analyst Fred
Moran of Jefferies &amp; Co., which doesn't do business with United
Online or own its shares. "It proves once and for all that they have
uncovered an efficient strategy for growth in the Internet access
business that can generate real profits."</TE>
<TE>   Moran, who does not own stock in the firm, had predicted United
Online would add about 88,000 paid subscribers in the quarter.
Instead, the company added 140,000, bringing its paid-subscriber
total to 1.85 million.</TE>
<TE>   "They have put on a very careful, methodical marketing program,"
Moran said. "This shows it has gained traction."</TE>
<TE>   The earnings announcement came before markets closed. United
Online shares Thursday jumped $1.28, or nearly 10%, to $14.70 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company's original goal was to offer free Internet service to
subscribers willing to look at its ads.</TE>
<TE>   But like many Internet ventures, it was not able to make a go of
it on advertising income alone. United Online still offers free
Internet access, though service is limited to 10 hours a month.</TE>
<TE>   United Online was formed by the June 2001 merger of NetZero and
Juno, and the combined company focused on luring paid subscribers
with discount rates.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the merger, several analysts expressed doubts that
the company would be successful, but "just a year later they're
confounding the skeptics," Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   The company successfully bid $8.4 million last month to buy the
Bluelight.com discount Internet access service from Kmart Corp.,
which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>

<HD>Osbourne May Host TV Talk Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharon Osbourne -- the matriarch and business mastermind behind MTV's
popular unscripted series "The Osbournes" -- has reportedly signed a
deal with AOL Time Warner's Telepictures Productions unit to host a
weekday talk show that would tentatively premiere in the fall of
2003.</LD>
<LD>   Warner Bros., which would syndicate the program to television
stations, declined to comment, as did representatives for the
Osbournes at the Endeavor talent agency. Industry sources, however,
say the agency had been seeking a commitment to Osbourne of $3
million to $5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Several questions linger over any potential project, not the least
being that Osbourne is battling colon cancer, casting doubt over her
ability to withstand the rigors of a daily production schedule.</LD>
<TE>   Still, program distributors have been hungry for the next
talk-show hit, and the Osbournes currently are basking in
considerable recognition. On Wednesday, Osbourne's Barbara Walters
interview on a special edition of ABC's "20/20" attracted 15.3
million viewers, based on Nielsen Media Research estimates --
delivering the newsmagazine's highest rating in the young-adult
demographics sought by advertisers in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   In that interview, Osbourne said she hoped to quit "The Osbournes"
-- which documents the lives of Sharon, rock-star husband Ozzy
Osbourne and the couple's teenage children -- to focus on a talk
show. She later recanted after MTV protested, saying the family was
committed to 20 more episodes. The program, which drew record
audiences to the Viacom-owned channel, begins its second season Nov.
26.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. -- which distributed "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" --
has been courting big names to sell talk properties because the
company does not own television stations, a handicap when competing
with Viacom, News Corp. and General Electric's NBC, all of which own
TV station groups and have put a priority on providing their own
programs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Osbourne, Warner Bros. is pitching a talk show
hosted by comic Ellen DeGeneres and is discussing a series for
talk-radio host Larry Elder. Other names connected to proposed
daytime talk projects include Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of
York.</TE>

<HD>PUC to Probe SBC Plans for Job Cuts</HD>
<DH>The agency will decide whether layoffs at the phone company
will diminish service quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators Thursday launched an investigation into SBC Pacific
Bell's planned job cuts in California, vowing to make sure the
cutbacks don't diminish the quality of service the phone company
provides to two-thirds of the state's homes and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission's move, approved in a
unanimous vote, follows an October pledge by two commissioners to
look into the issue. The PUC's action comes at an awkward time for
the local phone company, which is hoping to win federal approval to
begin selling long-distance phone service in California by the end of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   Among many other requirements, state and federal regulators must
rule that SBC PacBell's expansion into the state's $10-billion
long-distance market is in the public interest. Critics of the phone
company could argue that customers will suffer if SBC PacBell expands
into new markets even as it lays off workers.</LD>
<TE>   The PUC's concerns stem from a late September layoff announcement
from San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc., the parent of the
California phone company. Citing regulatory and economic pressures,
SBC said it would slash capital spending and cut 11,000 workers from
its payroll, including about 3,000 jobs from its California
operations.</TE>
<TE>   In its Thursday decision, the agency cited company statements and
presentations to regulators "that the layoffs and reduced capital
spending place in jeopardy the quality of service received by
customers" of SBC PacBell.</TE>
<TE>   If the probe finds cause for concern, the PUC said, the agency
"will take the necessary steps to ensure that service quality is not
degraded" and that SBC PacBell "is able to meet its regulatory
obligations."</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton said the PUC will find its
concerns unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC Pacific Bell is committed to providing outstanding service,
and we do not expect service quality to be adversely affected by this
position reduction," Britton said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC's investigation requires the phone company, along with
sister company SBC Advanced Solutions Inc., to supply within seven
days specifics of which jobs in which departments will be eliminated
later this year and in early 2003. SBC ASI sells high-speed Internet
connections that use digital subscriber line, or DSL, technology. The
companies also must provide details about cutbacks at any units that
serve Californians from outside the state.</TE>

<HD>Shoppers Return to Gap, Other Retailers</HD>
<DH>October sales are stronger than expected, but outlook is
uncertain for the make-or-break holiday season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just weeks after taking the top job at Gap Inc., Chief Executive Paul
Pressler already can take credit for at least one brilliant decision:
signing on when he did.</LD>
<LD>   In October, for the first time in 2 1/2 years, the San
Francisco-based owner of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic
apparel stores posted a sales increase in stores open at least a
year.</LD>
<LD>   The 11% gain was far better than expected -- a showing reflected
throughout the retail sector last month, with cold weather and
pent-up demand driving consumers to spend after months of languid
buying.</LD>
<TE>   Pressler certainly isn't taking credit for the jump -- and isn't
talking publicly about the company's performance or plans -- as Gap's
strong sales on full-price goods highlight the turnaround efforts of
his predecessor, Millard "Mickey" Drexler.</TE>
<TE>   "October's results are a good sign for the holiday, and I'm much
more upbeat because of it," said Michael Niemira, senior economist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Gap shares rose 65 cents to $13.42 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Several other retailers, in reporting October sales results
Thursday, cited strength in moving full-price items, particularly in
apparel.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. led the pack with an 18.6%
increase; J.C. Penney Co., Nordstrom Inc., Pacific Sunwear of
California Inc., and Gottschalks Inc. posted above-average gains for
the month.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing sellers have suffered over the last several months as
consumers -- uninterested in the fashion offerings and worried about
the economy and a possible war with Iraq -- pulled back on spending.</TE>
<TE>   October's sales numbers offered solace to economists, who have
worried about the weakened retail sector because consumer spending
has been one of the economy's few bright spots.</TE>
<TE>   Still, consumer spending for the rest of the year will be hard to
predict and even tougher to analyze.</TE>
<TE>   This year's late Thanksgiving -- the holiday that marks the
traditional start of the holiday shopping season -- will skew results
over the next two months, shifting most Christmas sales into December
and making November appear artificially weak.</TE>
<TE>   "How does the industry motivate the consumer over the next two
months, since they have no control over the weather?" Niemira said.
"We are likely to go through a choppy period here and we won't be
able to assess it well until after the season is over."</TE>
<TE>   Gap said gains came at each of its brands and in spite of lower
traffic. That's proof that new merchandise initiatives at Gap, put
into place by former CEO Drexler, are finally taking hold, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair to say everything is back on track and [Pressler's]
job is easy, but Mickey Drexler may have set the table for him," said
Todd Slater, an analyst with Lazard in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes include targeting the clothes, particularly at Gap,
at a slightly older consumer. Some of Gap and Old Navy's most loyal
customers had complained last year that the offerings seemed to
target teenagers, and moved too far away from the updated classics
they had come to expect from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said it will fall to Pressler, a former executive with
Walt Disney Co., to make broader systemic changes, including store
refurbishments and closures and improvements in the supply chain.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still so much work to do," Slater said. "This business
is far from fixed and there is an enormous amount of renovation that
needs to occur."</TE>
<TE>   Overall in October, retail sales rose 3.1% compared with a year
ago, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi chain store sales
index.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs, which cited a 2.5% gain in its retail composite
index, noted the particularly surprising results among the specialty

<TE>   That group posted same-store sales gains of 5.1% over October
2001, as cold weather in much of the country sent consumers looking
for warmer clothing. Goldman Sachs had expected a 1.1% decline among
the specialty group.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, are a
key measure of a retailer's health because the figure excludes new
and closed stores, which can skew results.</TE>
<TE>   Like Gap, teen clothiers also benefited from shoppers' desire for
new merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim-based Pacific Sunwear raised third-quarter earnings
guidance to 47 cents to 48 cents a share, well ahead of the 40-cent

<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it has decided not to sell its back-office
operations to Electronic Data Systems Corp., scuttling an $8-billion
deal.</LD>
<LD>   P&amp;G, the Cincinnati maker of Tide laundry detergent, Ivory soap
and other products, had planned to contract with EDS for services
such as payroll processing. It put the deal on hold in September
after EDS issued a surprise profit warning.</LD>
<LD>   P&amp;G may outsource those operations to several partners, one of
which might still be EDS, a P&amp;G spokeswoman said. Shares of EDS fell
$1.93 to $14.87 and P&amp;G gained 15 cents to $88.01, both on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<LD>Diageo's $2.26-billion sale of Burger King to Texas Pacific Group may
collapse as revenue growth at the restaurant chain stalls, delaying
plans by the world's biggest liquor maker to focus on its drinks
business.</LD>
<LD>   Texas Pacific and partners Bain Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. want to renegotiate the terms of the July agreement, a
Diageo spokeswoman said. Stagnant sales may hinder the buyers' plans
to borrow $1.5 billion to fund the purchase, she said.</LD>
<LD>   London-based Diageo plans to sell the world's No. 2 hamburger

<HD>Tenet Admits Price Hikes; 2 Execs Leave</HD>
<DH>CFO and COO step down at the hospital chain as its chief
executive questions policies that have led to an audit. Shares
tumble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., facing a federal audit of its Medicare
billings, announced a top management shake-up Thursday and
acknowledged that some of its hospitals aggressively raised prices
that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in higher Medicare
reimbursements.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company said there was nothing illegal in
sharply boosting retail hospital charges, which are used in
calculating special Medicare reimbursements known as "outlier
payments." These payments are made in addition to regular Medicare
reimbursements to help hospitals defray expenses for unusually costly
procedures.</LD>
<LD>   Under heavy pressure from investors, Tenet on Thursday disclosed
that it received $763 million in outlier payments in fiscal 2002,
much of it from 11 hospitals that have ramped up retail charges.
Seven of those 11 hospitals are in California.</LD>
<TE>   Although Tenet did not identify them, analysts believe Redding
Medical Center -- which is at the center of a separate federal probe
of two doctors -- is among them.</TE>
<TE>   In a lengthy conference call with analysts and investors, Tenet
officials did not answer a question about whether they deliberately
pursued a pricing strategy so as to maximize outlier payments, which
accounted for about 39% of Tenet's earnings per share in fiscal 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeffrey Barbakow, Tenet's chairman and chief executive, said
it had come to his attention only recently that aggressive pricing
was leading to big increases in outlier payments.</TE>
<TE>   He said the aggressive hospital price hikes would now stop,
suggesting that it was not good corporate policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is inconsistent with the position and posture that I want
Tenet to maintain," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But many investors and analysts appeared to be shocked and
disappointed by Tenet's announcements Thursday. Tenet withdrew its
long-term earnings guidance and said it would overhaul its pricing
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they were troubled by the implications of a future
change in pricing strategy and by Tenet's management shake-up, which
included the immediate departure of its chief financial officer,
David L. Dennis, and chief operating officer, Thomas B. Mackey.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow announced the appointment of Trevor Fetter, who
previously worked at Tenet, to a new position of president.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow called the resignation of Dennis and the retirement of
Mackey voluntary, but analysts wondered why the two executives who
probably knew the most about the hospital's pricing strategy were now
gone.</TE>
<TE>   "It signals to me that the company is trying to engage in
preemptive damage control," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at
Fulcrum Global Partners in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "They can now blame any further problems on the folks who left,
who engaged in strategies that are not in keeping with the direction
that Jeff would like to take the company."</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick said that she would not recommend the stock, even at its
latest depressed prices.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet shares were up 6% to $27.95 in regular New York Stock
Exchange trading, but plunged to $19.60 in after-hours trading,
during the three-hour-long conference call with investors.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's stock has fallen from about $50 in the last two weeks,
since a UBS Warburg analyst on Oct. 28 questioned Tenet's outlier
payments.</TE>
<TE>   On that same day, officials at the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services notified Tenet that it would audit Tenet's outlier
payments, and the agency sent a formal letter of an audit this week.</TE>
<TE>   The credibility of Tenet's management also has been damaged by its
handling of the federal raid last week at Redding, where the FBI and
HHS agents seized records in an investigation focusing on whether two
doctors performed hundreds of unnecessary heart procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials have said the Redding investigation and the
outlier controversy are two separate issues. But they are linked in
that Tenet's Redding hospital has been getting a significant amount
of outlier payments, according to analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Outlier payments are calculated by a Medicare contractor using a
complicated formula on a case-by-case basis. But because gross, or
retail, hospital charges help determine outlier cases,
higher-than-expected increases in charges would lead to more cases
qualifying for the payments.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare officials say outlier payments are not supposed to exceed
5% to 6% of Medicare's total inpatient hospital reimbursements
nationwide. But Tenet's outlier payments accounted for about 23% of
its total Medicare reimbursements in the last fiscal year. Tenet's
high rate by itself does not violate Medicare rules, but it was the
only major hospital company in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   During the conference call, Tenet officials said that the 11
hospitals especially benefited from outlier payments, partly because
of a lag in Medicare's payment formula that allows facilities with
rapid price increases to obtain huge windfalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the basic problem lies in the outlier payments as it's
structured, and that Tenet played it to the hilt," said Clifford
Hewitt, an analyst at Legg Mason, a brokerage in Baltimore. "I don't
think it's illegal. But it's embarrassing. They gamed the system to
an embarrassing degree and I think they realized it's an image they
can't live with. You come across as being socially irresponsible."</TE>

<HD>Univision Earnings Surge in Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Univision Communications Inc. said Thursday that its third-quarter
profit more than doubled because of stronger ad sales for its
Spanish-language television networks, but the company also noted
slower-than-expected growth in its music division and its newest TV
network.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Univision posted net income of $20.3 million, or
8 cents a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $6.9
million, or 3 cents, a year earlier. The nation's largest
Spanish-language broadcaster also narrowed its full fiscal year
earnings estimates to 31 cents to 34 cents a share, compared with its
previous forecast of 29 cents to 34 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   The company's revenue increased 22% to $269.9 million in the
quarter, up from $221.7 million in the third quarter of 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "Our revenue growth continues to be fueled by advertisers' growing
recognition of the importance of the Hispanic community," Univision
Executive Vice President Andrew Hobson told analysts in a conference
call.</TE>
<TE>   Univision released its results after the stock markets closed.
Univision's shares closed at $25.89, down $2.10, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The media conglomerate is controlled by billionaire A. Jerrold
Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter revenue from Univision's TV Group unit increased 13%
to $239.9 million, with strong gains in markets such as Houston,
Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, Hobson said. However, Univision's
stations attracted relatively little advertising money from political
candidates, in contrast to English-language TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that the company's second broadcast network,
TeleFutura, which launched in January, has been slow to gain
momentum. Univision had anticipated that TeleFutura would break even
by year-end, but company executives said Thursday that the network's
start-up losses would be about $24 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts also anticipated that Univision's Spanish-language
music division would contribute about $80 million in revenue for the
full year. However, Univision said Thursday that its music revenue
would be about $70 million to $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The third-quarter earnings beat the estimates, but we need to
lower the fourth quarter [estimates] because of the music division,"
Deutsche Bank analyst Andrew Marcus said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Board Agrees to Utility Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning its back on the business it established 150 years ago,
Vivendi Universal is moving ahead with the sale of its remaining
stake in one of the world's largest water utilities.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi said Thursday that its board of directors agreed to sell
half its 40% stake in Vivendi Environnement to a group of private
investors by year-end. The group has the option to buy the rest of
the stake by the end of 2004. In all, the sale would fetch about $4
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Although profitable, Vivendi Environnement does not fit with
Vivendi's plans to evolve into a pure media company, with assets that
include Hollywood's Universal Studios and Universal Music Group.</LD>
<TE>   New Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou wants the cash to pay down
Vivendi's crippling $19 billion in media debt, which almost forced
the company to file for bankruptcy protection this summer. Vivendi
also wants to beat out Britain's Vodafone for control of the
profitable French telecom business Cegetel, of which Vivendi owns
44%.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi also said Thursday that it completed the sale of Houghton
Mifflin Co. for about $1.6 billion to buyout firms Thomas H. Lee
Partners and Bain Capital.</TE>

<HD>Compromise on Webcast Royalties Sought</HD>
<DH>Religious broadcasters and record labels are meeting to
discuss a bill blocked by Sen. Helms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a lame-duck session of Congress about to begin, religious
broadcasters and record labels are seeking a last-minute compromise
on royalties that could clear the way for a bill to aid small
Internet broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   Meetings between the National Religious Broadcasters Assn. and the
Recording Industry Assn. of America are expected to begin today, said
Frank Breeden, president of the Nashville-based Gospel Music Assn.
The goal is to clear the objections that derailed a bill offering
reduced royalties to some small Webcasters.</LD>
<LD>   The religious stations are close to Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a
former broadcaster who blocked the bill last month, but they're not
the only ones criticizing HR 5496. The others include large and
mid-size Webcasters, over-the-air broadcasters and college stations.
All contended that the royalties in the bill were too high.</LD>
<TE>   A new group of small online broadcasters, the Webcaster Alliance,
has formed to lobby against the bill. The group wants Congress to
overhaul the royalty-setting process, lobbyist David LeGrand said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are the fees that online radio stations must pay labels
and artists for the songs they play.</TE>
<TE>   The librarian of Congress ordered commercial Webcasters to pay
about a penny per hour of music broadcast to each listener, but many
stations complained that the royalties would drive them out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   A few small commercial Webcasters negotiated a compromise last
month with the RIAA and artists groups, agreeing to pay 8% to 12% of
their revenue or 5% to 7% of their expenses. But a House-passed bill
to put the deal into law -- and extend it to any Webcaster with less
than $1 million in revenue since November 1998 -- was stopped by
Helms.</TE>
<TE>   Several Webcasters and lobbyists said Helms' staff is trying to
come up with an alternative that would help all Internet
broadcasters. It's not clear what that might be, or whether the
proposal could be squeezed into the lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Helms could not be reached Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the RIAA said the bill offers the best deal to all
parties, including small Webcasters. But if Helms wants to talk about
changes, "we will always do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Breeden said the main concern of religious broadcasters is that
the bill could set a precedent for the royalties they have to pay. In
the new talks , "we're talking about whatever it would take for the
NRB to remove its objection to the bill," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pressure Grows for Webster to Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>William H. Webster, designated chief of the nation's new accounting
oversight board, has called an initial meeting of the panel for next
Wednesday. But more questions arose Thursday about whether he can
hang on that long.</LD>
<LD>   Webster faced new pressure to resign after accounting firm BDO
Seidman released documents indicating that he took part in a July
2001 conference call in which the auditors warned of poor financial
controls at U.S. Technologies Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Webster, then a director of the company and head of its audit
committee, last week told the Washington Post that he didn't recall
receiving the warnings. U.S. Technologies, which since has been sued
by investors for fraud, fired BDO Seidman a month after the
conference call.</LD>
<TE>   BDO Seidman earlier this week filed suit against U.S.
Technologies, contending that Webster, in the Post, had made "false
and misleading statements" about his awareness of financial problems
at the company.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, BDO Seidman released documents it said were sent to
members of the audit committee before the conference call, raising
concerns about U.S. Technologies' financial controls.</TE>
<TE>   Webster could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   BDO Seidman's retort triggered new calls for Webster to withdraw
from the accounting-panel post, two days after the resignation of
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, who had
championed Webster's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO, which seeks a stronger role in corporate governance
issues, Thursday called for Webster to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's role at U.S. Technologies came to light after he was
confirmed Oct. 25 by the SEC as head of the accounting panel.
Webster, 78, said he had told Pitt about the company before the SEC
vote, but Pitt apparently did not advise the four other SEC
commissioners -- subsequently triggering a political firestorm.</TE>
<TE>   Webster has sent agendas for next week's organizing meeting of the
panel to his four fellow appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm planning to go unless somebody tells me not to," said one
designee, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The board, created by Congress to adopt corporate bookkeeping
standards and to monitor and discipline accounting firms, still has
no headquarters, no budget and no staff.</TE>
<TE>   When asked Thursday at a news conference if Webster should quit,
President Bush praised the former FBI and CIA director's service to
the nation, but also said he wanted to see an SEC inspector general's
report into the panel selection process.</TE>

<HD>SEC Suit Accuses Beacon Hill of Overstating Fund Values</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hedge fund manager Beacon Hill Asset Management was sued Thursday by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the firm of
failing to disclose "massive portfolio losses" to investors.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, accuses Beacon
Hill of overstating the values of two hedge funds it manages, Bristol
and Safe Harbor, from July to September while the funds lost $400
million, or 54% of their value.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks civil penalties and the transfer of fund assets to
a new investment manager independent of Beacon Hill.</LD>
<TE>   Summit, N.J.-based Beacon Hill has agreed to move the assets of
the funds to rival Ellington Management Group, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Beacon Hill, founded by Jack Barry in 1997, told investors in
early October that its funds had lost 25% in September. A few weeks
later, the group more than doubled loss estimates and said it would
close the funds over the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC suit blamed the losses largely on "short" positions taken
on Treasury securities, bets that the securities' value would
decline. Instead, the value of the bonds soared as market interest
rates plunged.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the Beacon Hill board's demand that its principals
turn over assets to another hedge fund is extremely rare in an
industry in which sophisticated investors generally try to move their
money on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Confidence in Brokers Down, Survey Finds</TE>
<TE>   Securities industry executives Thursday got a sobering assessment
of just how upset many small investors are with Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Hit by corporate scandals and the long bear market, investors'
opinion of the brokerage business has fallen to its lowest level in
at least eight years, according to a survey by Harris Interactive.</TE>
<TE>   The data were released at the Securities Industry Assn.'s annual
meeting in Boca Raton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,500 investors polled from Aug. 22 to Sept. 22, 41% said
the main issue facing the securities industry is "dishonesty." A year
ago, 8% said that was the big issue. Before this year, the highest
percentage mentioning dishonesty was 14% in 1995, the first year of
the survey.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 55% said they have a "very favorable" or "somewhat
favorable" opinion of the securities industry, down from 62% in 2001
and 63% in 2000. But significantly, the "very favorable" rating fell
to 9% from 22% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's reluctance to punish wrongdoers was cited by 68% of
those surveyed as a key problem, up from 41% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Industry greed" was cited as a big problem by 66%, up from 52% in
2001 and 49% in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Unveils 311 Phone System for City Services</HD>
<DH>The mayor hopes the line will reduce the number of 911
nonemergency calls and improve access to the city's departments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn, continuing his campaign to improve city
services, launched a new 311 telephone system Thursday, aimed at
reducing the number of nonemergency calls to 911 and improving access
to city government offices.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, the new phone number is not accessible from some
business telephone systems, a quirk that city officials said they are
working on.</LD>
<LD>   Many large organizations have blocks on their internal telephone
systems, and those restrictions often prevent callers from
successfully dialing 311. As a result, Los Angeles city officials
said they will work with the Chamber of Commerce and others to
encourage changes in those business phones. Dialing 311 is free, so
city officials said they don't expect any resistance from firms.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles would be the largest city in the country to have the
system, which connects callers to about 1,400 services, 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Additionally, the service is accessible on
the Internet at www. lacity.org to locate city departments and
services.</TE>
<TE>   "We know our constituents want better service; we're committed to
giving it to them," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said the 311 system will allow him to finally stop
carrying a tattered 3-by-5 card with city department telephone
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor acknowledged that the new phone system probably won't
reduce police response time, but he said he hopes it will reduce the
number of 911 calls. Cutting response time, Hahn said, will require
hiring more officers -- not just creating new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said, however, that he
believes that the department will be able to "free up a significant
amount of police resources" by having fewer nonemergency calls
through the 911 system.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at a console at the new 311 center across the street from
City Hall, Hahn took the first call -- from Tommy Lasorda, the former
Dodgers baseball team manager.</TE>
<TE>   "You did it again, mayor," Lasorda said, as television news crews
surrounded Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The launch of the system came a day after the mayor helped defeat
secession efforts in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. Having
won that contest, Hahn said he is committed to responding to some of
the impulses behind it, and he wants Los Angeles to serve as a model
for efficient and accessible municipal services.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he will roll out several other initiatives next week.</TE>

<HD>Baca Wants Sales Tax Hike for Terror Fight, Hospitals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Lee Baca said Thursday that he will seek to place on next
year's ballot a half-cent increase in the county sales tax to provide
as much as $500 million to protect against terrorism and provide for
emergency hospital care.</LD>
<LD>   Baca said he will ask Los Angeles County supervisors to place the
measure on the November 2003 ballot to ensure that his department has
the money to respond to acts of terrorism and natural disasters.</LD>
<LD>   If necessary, Baca said, he would be willing to gather signatures
to place the measure before voters. If two-thirds of voters approved
the measure, the county sales tax would increase to 8.75% from 8.25%.</LD>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Baca said Los
Angeles County cannot afford to be unprepared. "The threat of
international terrorism has not gone away," he said. "These federal
alerts aren't an exercise. If something happens, we must be able to
respond."</TE>
<TE>   Baca is proposing that two-thirds of the money raised go to public
safety -- most of it to the Sheriff's Department -- with the balance
being used to bolster hospital emergency-care services in the county.</TE>
<TE>   He said that despite Tuesday's passage of Measure B, which will
raise property taxes to provide $168 million annually for emergency
and trauma care services, more money is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said his proposal would provide stable funding for the
Sheriff's Department, which is the backbone of mutual aid countywide,
and pay for all police and fire agencies to have an integrated
communications system. The proposed sales tax increase would continue
indefinitely, Baca said, so that services can be built up and then
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "When [the World Trade Center] towers were hit, police officers
and firefighters in New York could not talk to each other because
they did not have compatible communications systems.... The same is
true for the agencies in this county," the sheriff said. "We need a
mutual communications system."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Thursday he had not seen
Baca's proposal but "was open to hearing his justification for this
funding request."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky called Baca's announcement curious in its timing,
coming just two days after voters approved Measure B.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what he's trying to accomplish, other than get
a large revenue stream into the Sheriff's Department," Yaroslavsky
said. "I'm not anxious to rush out to the voters with another tax. We
need to remain credible with the voters."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich termed the proposal "an act of
frustration. [Baca] has always wanted to do it. He is trying to find
resources to fit his budget needs."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department's budget was slashed by more than $60
million this year by supervisors as they approved an austere budget.
That reduction, Baca said, left the department struggling for
adequate manpower and equipment to respond to a major disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The county, he said, sorely needs to invest in emergency planning
and new technology to combat bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately the voters will decide this issue," Baca said.</TE>

<HD>Slaying Shakes Neighborhood</HD>
<DH>In an unusual midday attack, Rosita Anaya, 58, was stabbed
in her car near the front door of her favorite bakery in Orange.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every Sunday morning, Rosita Anaya would drive to the La Poblana
Bakery in Orange's quaint downtown to pick up sweet bread for her
family.</LD>
<LD>   Last Sunday, she never made it home.</LD>
<LD>   The 58-year-old mother was stabbed to death as she sat in her car
in the bakery's parking lot on Chapman Avenue, a few blocks from the
city's historic plaza. Police said robbery doesn't appear to be a
motive behind the city's first homicide in two years.</LD>
<TE>   "She lived for us," said Cathy Juarez, 19, one of Anaya's two
children. "She was so devoted to us and protective of us.... I feel
envious that other people have mothers. She was my best friend. She
meant the world."</TE>
<TE>   Anaya was found about 11:30 a.m. slumped over the steering wheel
of her Pontiac Sunbird, which was parked four spaces away from the
bakery's front door. Her windows were rolled down, her purse
untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it happened in broad daylight is very unusual,"
said Orange police Sgt. Dave Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a man, described as being about 50 years old with gold
or silver dental work around the edges of his teeth, was seen running
from the scene. A witness said he was wearing a hat with "Coroner"
across the front.</TE>
<TE>   Anaya's life revolved around her children, friends and family
said. Her family loved her tacos as much as she loved to eat sweets.</TE>
<TE>   "The times she didn't bake, she'd buy sweets," said Mini Galvan,
her best friend for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Anaya, a single mother for 18 years, began working two weeks ago
as a receptionist at a Costa Mesa insurance company. She enjoyed
finding bargains at local garage sales or Goodwill stores. But her
joy was staying home to care for her children.</TE>
<TE>   They were her superstars. Juarez is to be married in May. Anaya's
son, Tony Juarez, nicknamed Chewy because of the way he smacks on
chewing gum, is a wide receiver on El Modena High School's varsity
football team.</TE>
<TE>   Anaya attended every game, screaming, "Go, Chewy!" and whistling
from the front row of the bleachers. Students at the high school have
been collecting donations for Anaya's funeral, and the football
players wrote her initials on their helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "She took care of everybody," said Lorenzo Calderon, 17, a senior
running back. "She'd cheer really loud, and she was always full of
joy."</TE>
<TE>   She was so generous, family members said, that when she returned
from her Sunday trips to the bakery, she would pass out pastries to
neighbors as she went up the stairs to her apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Her killing has unnerved merchants and customers in downtown
Orange. Jose, a cake decorator at La Poblana Bakery who declined to
give his last name, said customers are coming to the store only
during the day now.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really scary because it's very peaceful around here," Jose
said. "My customers are afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Customer Stacey Owens said she is keeping her children indoors and
not going out at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid for my children. I'm afraid for myself," said Owens,
35, of Orange. "Nothing like that happens around here, and for
someone to do it during broad daylight, it's very brave and scary."</TE>
<TE>   Friends, family and strangers placed candles, roses and cards at
the parking space where Anaya was found.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean everything to me. I wasn't ready for this," her
daughter, Cathy, wrote in a letter propped up against bouquets of
flowers. "Save a place for me up in heaven. Promise me that you'll be
there on my wedding day. I can't stand this pain."</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Assault May Have Been Latest by Serial Predator</HD>
<DH>Woman fights off an intruder in her home suspected to be
the same man who has eluded arrest despite at least 11 attacks over
six years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attempted sexual assault of a Long Beach woman in her home early
Thursday may have been the latest by a sexual predator who has eluded
police for at least six years and attacked women at least 11 times,
creating anxiety in the communities where he struck.</LD>
<LD>   Previously referred to as the Belmont Shore rapist before he was
linked to attacks in other parts of Long Beach as well as Seattle,
Los Alamitos and Huntington Beach, the serial attacker's appearance
is a mystery to victims and police: He has covered his face or that
of his victims, leaving detectives with no physical description.</LD>
<LD>   What he has left is DNA evidence that links him conclusively to 11
attacks, and perhaps several more, including two in August in which
evidence is still being studied. Investigators believe Thursday's
attempted assault may be linked to the others.</LD>
<TE>   Absent any composite drawing or even the vaguest of descriptions
-- hair color or height -- Long Beach police beseeched the public to
lock windows and doors, to discourage prowlers with good lighting and
to report even the slightest of suspicions about unfamiliar people or
sounds in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Those hundreds of thousands of eyes out there are what are going
to see something and help give us the break we need to find this
guy," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Paul LeBaron. "Citizens are not the
only ones having sleepless nights; so are the police officers.
Because no one is safe and no one can sleep until he's caught."</TE>
<TE>   A reward for information leading to the serial attacker's arrest
will be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest attack, police said, a man entered through an
unlocked window of a house near Stearns Street and Lakewood
Boulevard, near the traffic circle, around 1 a.m. His face covered,
he stood over the woman as she slept, then woke her and confronted
her, LeBaron said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman struggled with the man and he fled out a door, LeBaron
said. No weapon was seen. The woman ran to a neighbor's house and
called police.</TE>
<TE>   Officers sealed off the neighborhood, sent bloodhounds after the
intruder's scent and searched for several hours without success. A
man was arrested for possession of a crack pipe, but police said he
was not considered a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   In past attacks, the serial assaulter has been known to strip nude
either outside or inside the residence before he confronted the
women. The oldest victim was 77, the youngest -- the one attacked
Thursday -- was 30.</TE>
<TE>   The intruder may have been injured in the struggle Thursday
morning, police said, declining to be more specific, and they urged
the public to report signs of suspicious injuries to police.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack linked to the serial case occurred in Seattle, on
Aug. 1, 1996. The next seven cases occurred in Long Beach between
1997 and April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The man struck in June 2000 in Huntington Beach. Last May, he
surfaced again in a Los Alamitos attack, then in June in Long Beach,
the most recent case in which evidence links him to the previous
cases.</TE>
<TE>   In an attack near the traffic circle Aug. 15, which has not been
linked by DNA to the series, the home intruder's face was badly
scratched, police said. In an Aug. 13 incident possibly linked to the
serial attacker, a man confronted a Huntington Beach woman, 75, but
was fought off and fled her home.</TE>
<TE>   In most or all of the attacks, the man entered through unlocked
doors and windows and may have researched when the victim would be
alone. Information about the cases can be passed on to the Sexual
Assault Investigations Hotline at (866) 600-1110.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Revive Borough Plan for L.A.</HD>
<DH>Valley independence leaders, in meeting with four council
members, suggest creating a panel to study reorganizing city
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sometimes-tense meeting with Los Angeles City Council members,
San Fernando Valley civic leaders who supported the defeated
secession proposals pressed Thursday for the creation of a commission
that would explore a borough system for city government.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting in Sherman Oaks that one participant described as
"Camp David of the Valley," secession opponents and supporters sought
to smooth out their years of differences, which culminated in
Tuesday's breakup election.</LD>
<LD>   Some council members were lukewarm to the idea of a charter reform
commission that would study boroughs and other possible changes at
City Hall. But they agreed to continue talks exploring how such a
panel would work.</LD>
<TE>   "It was encouraging," said Bill Powers, chairman of the United
Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Powers was one of about 20 Valley business and political leaders
to meet with council members Alex Padilla, Wendy Greuel, Tom LaBonge
and Dennis Zine at the offices of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley delegation also urged the council members to end delays
on business tax reform, spend more on economic development and get
the Valley more federal and state grants.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be following up on these items," Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   Powers and David Fleming, chairman of the Economic Alliance of the
San Fernando Valley, made the recommendation for a borough
commission. It was endorsed at the meeting by VICA Chairman Fred
Gaines and Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   "I think it could be a truly exciting thing," Fleming said after
the private session. He suggested the commission could include
council members as well as residents.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg proposed last spring that Los Angeles be divided into
nine boroughs, each with elected boards. He got nowhere with Mayor
James K. Hahn and the council, however.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the future of Los Angeles, one way or the other," Hertzberg
said Thursday about a borough system. "The question is when."</TE>
<TE>   He also said a borough commission should have a time limit for
completing its study, but that it is probably too late to get a
borough plan ready for the March 2003 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines said it was important to let the council members know that,
even though secession was defeated, the Valley wants the borough
study to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is loud and clear that there need to be some changes
in the structure of city government, and we need to get the council
on a path to evaluating the proposals," Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine and Greuel said they were receptive. Five months ago, Greuel
asked the council to place on this week's ballot a measure that would
have set up a panel to develop a borough system. The council voted
down the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said Thursday she is interested in revisiting the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm committed to changing the governance structure, and we need
to look at all avenues," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said he is "a strong supporter of boroughs."</TE>
<TE>   But there is little enthusiasm among other council members,
Padilla included, for boroughs that would take over powers held by
the council. Attendees at Thursday's meeting said Padilla was cold to
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, who led efforts to keep the Greuel and Hertzberg
proposals off the ballot, said Thursday that he still has questions
about how a borough system would work.</TE>
<TE>   "What is going to be the relationship between boroughs and
neighborhood councils if both are made part of the future?" Padilla
asked. "Who knows? But it's going to be part of this ongoing
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, four people who sought council seats in the proposed
Valley city have filed papers to run for the Los Angeles City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Roy Garcia filed for the 6th District seat held by Ruth
Galanter, who is stepping down because of term limits. In the 12th
District, where term limits are forcing out Councilman Hal Bernson,
Armineh Safarian Chelebian, Ken Aslan and former Assemblywoman Paula
Boland filed papers.</TE>

<HD>GOP Talks Up Carona for State Ticket in '06</HD>
<DH>After helping Schwarzenegger get Prop. 49 passed, the O.C.
sheriff is touted for No. 2 spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Orange County Republicans gathered on election night in the
festooned ballroom of an Irvine hotel, arguably the most popular face
of the local GOP wasn't there.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Mike Carona opted to spend the evening at a Boyle Heights
gym, where he joined actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in celebrating the
passage of Proposition 49, a statewide funding plan for after-school
programs.</LD>
<LD>   It could prove to be a prescient pairing. As Republicans
contemplate the prospect of Schwarzenegger seeking the governorship
of California in 2006, Carona's name is increasingly being invoked as
the leading GOP candidate for lieutenant governor.</LD>
<TE>   Such a ticket would match Hollywood's famous action hero with the
lawman that CNN's Larry King crowned a "genuine American hero" for
his handling of the Samantha Runnion kidnap-murder case this past
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised to see [Carona] on the statewide ballot
in four years," said Rob Stutsman, spokesman for the California
Republican Party. "He has the type of persona that the Republican
Party needs to help communicate with modern voters, particularly
women. He's the antithesis of the angry white male that dogged the
party's image in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, who hasn't declared whether he will run, worked
with Carona during the Proposition 49 campaign. Carona appeared with
the actor in television commercials supporting the ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has failed to produce a winning statewide candidate
for nearly three decades, and some experts say Carona faces an uphill
battle. While he might run as a team with Schwarzenegger, California
elects its governor and lieutenant governor separately.</TE>
<TE>   Carona is mum about plans for higher office, but his supporters
are quick to offer why he would be a perfect candidate: He is a
conservative who works well with Democrats; he is a law-and-order man
who believes rehabilitation works better than jail for criminal
addicts; and he drew praise from as high as President Bush for
handling the Runnion case.</TE>
<TE>   Carona was attending a conference Thursday and couldn't be reached
for comment. But Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo, who ran Carona's
campaigns in 1998 and this year, acknowledged the interest in a
Carona candidacy. "He's about as good as it gets as a candidate,"
Jaramillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Carona was little-known outside Orange County until he took to the
national airwaves for a tense week this summer after the 5-year-old
Stanton girl was kidnapped. He won high marks for his direct appeals
to the public and was a frequent guest on network news shows.</TE>
<TE>   That exposure translated into clout in Tuesday's election.</TE>
<TE>   No other local Republican this year delivered as much endorsement
wattage, said Allan Hoffenblum, who produces one of the state's most
popular GOP slate cards. With little room on the cards for messages,
80% of Orange County Republican candidates wanted the space used to
tout endorsements from Carona, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen that kind of popularity before," said Hoffenblum,
a political analyst from Los Angeles. "I was amazed. Obviously, he
was the most sought-after endorsement for any Republican running in
Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Still, most of those talking are quick to offer that four years is
a long way away. And even some of the first cheerleaders for
Schwarzenegger's prospects aren't endorsing anyone yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's got a lot of appeal, [and] Arnold's got a lot of appeal
too," said Larry Higby, head of Republicans for a New Majority, an
Orange County group trying to broaden the party's appeal in
California. Schwarzenegger was the group's featured guest at its
March gala anniversary party in Monarch Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "[Carona] believes in broadening the party, in inclusiveness and
in reaching out to the community," said Higby, president of Apria
Health Care in Costa Mesa. "That's one of the main things we stand
for. Without efforts like that, it's going to be difficult for any
Republican to be elected."</TE>
<TE>   Carona's work with Proposition 49 demonstrated his commitment to
larger issues outside Orange County and law enforcement, said George
Gorton, who ran the campaign for Schwarzenegger. "He's considered one
of our key supporters, and we were delighted to have him. Arnold
thinks highly of him. Since we don't know if [Schwarzenegger] will be
running, I can't say more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic activist Wylie Aitken said Carona would have the same
problem that anyone running from Orange County has faced when seeking
a statewide office: the image as a conservative bastion.</TE>
<TE>   While that might help in the primary, local nominees have been
repeatedly passed over by voters in general elections.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an image of Orange County that tends to be an anchor on
both Democrats and Republicans," Aitken said. "Neither gets a boost
from the famous 10% [of undeclared voters] that decides elections.
Certainly Mike has the ability to transcend that."</TE>

<HD>Clinton Was Key to Davis Strategy</HD>
<DH>Governor's attack ads were designed to weaken Richard
Riordan in the primary but resulted in Bill Simon Jr. winning the GOP
nomination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Working behind the scenes, former President Clinton played a key role
in the California governor's race, helping persuade Gov. Gray Davis
to launch a devastatingly effective series of ads during the
Republican primary.</LD>
<LD>   According to campaign insiders, it was Clinton who ultimately got
Davis to launch the preemptive advertising blitz that helped torpedo
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in the March race.</LD>
<LD>   "We were out on a limb," said one Davis consultant, who described
an internal debate over the unconventional attack that aides were
urging on Davis. The governor "needed some reassurance" and got it
from Clinton during a series of discussions that culminated in a
conference call in mid-January, the consultant said.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, Riordan was pummeling Democrat Davis and looked to be
his most dangerous opponent in the general election. "You can't sit
there and take it," Clinton told the governor, according to two other
people who participated in the 40-minute strategy session.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton "was crucial in getting Gray to the point where he said,
'Yes, we can do it,' " one Davis strategist said. "Gray was initially
opposed, kind of hemming and hawing."</TE>
<TE>   About two weeks after the discussion, the governor launched the
first attack ad in a $10-million wave that ultimately sank Riordan's
candidacy. The original notion was simply to soften Riordan up for
the general election. The strategy ended up working better than
anyone expected, delivering Davis his preferred Republican opponent:
Los Angeles businessman Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a political neophyte who stumbled through his first run for
public office, lost to Davis this week, 47% to 42%.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach Clinton on Wednesday were unsuccessful. The
governor's chief strategist, Garry South, would say only that Davis
and Clinton "talk regularly."</TE>
<TE>   "Clinton is a political junkie," South said. "He's also very
knowledgeable about California politics."</TE>
<TE>   The former president has emerged as a sort of consultant-in-chief
for Democrats across the country. He talks regularly with several
potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, and is a key advisor to
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New
York.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Clinton's role went beyond urging Davis to run ads
against Riordan; it also included suggestions about what those
television spots might say.</TE>
<TE>   The president used a similar attack strategy during his 1996
reelection campaign, when he broadcast ads that helped shape the race
and negatively define his Republican opponent, then-Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole, before Dole could afford much advertising of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Now gone from office -- but not the political scene -- Clinton
took a keen interest in the California race, according to Davis
aides, and talked general strategy as well as diving into finer
points of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he helped conceive one of the ads that Davis ran in
the primary against Riordan, a spot that accused the former Los
Angeles mayor of gouging Northern California in the emergency sale of
electricity from the city's Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   "Clinton said, 'Man, you can nail him on energy,' " said a
consultant involved in discussions between Davis and the former
president, adding that Clinton's counsel convinced Davis that "you
could really hurt this guy."</TE>
<TE>   "That gave Gray even more confidence" in the risky primary
strategy, the consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   The president's intervention was noteworthy given his warm
relations with Riordan. The moderate former mayor visited the White
House while in office and even crossed party lines to endorse
Clinton's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The president returned the favor by lending important
behind-the-scenes help to Riordan in his 1997 reelection effort.</TE>
<TE>   Just before election day in that race, Clinton arranged for
Riordan to participate in a White House news conference announcing
the award of transportation money to Los Angeles; Clinton hosted the
event, giving Riordan a chance to share his spotlight at the expense
of fellow Democrat Tom Hayden, Riordan's rival in the mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the two always seemed to hit it off personally when
they spent time together. Riordan stayed at the White House during
the Clinton years and often spoke of his warm feelings toward the
president.</TE>
<TE>   "Clinton was a little conflicted," said a Davis campaign insider.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows Riordan pretty well. But he's also an avid Democrat. He
didn't want to lose the governorship of California to any Republican
-- even if it were Dick Riordan."</TE>

<HD>Can Bratton's System Work in L.A.?</HD>
<DH>Police chief targeted crime hot spots in N.Y. He is
expected to reform similar LAPD system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEDFORD-STUYVESANT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The man in the leather jacket with the miniature assault rifle
dangling from a chain around his neck had no doubt who sparked the
recent renewal of this Brooklyn suburb.</LD>
<LD>   "Giuliani tried to take credit," he says. "But Bratton's The Man."</LD>
<LD>   Six years after William J. Bratton, L.A.'s new police chief, got
booted as New York's top cop by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, he is
still revered here by people like Caesar Calderone, a former
corrections officer who now runs a security business.</LD>
<TE>   "If he runs for president, I'll hand out fliers for him,"
Calderone says, interrupting a midday chat with two friends outside a
row of freshly painted brownstones. The neighborhood had been
blighted by vacant storefronts and street crime since the riots of
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has promised to deliver in Los Angeles the police reforms
that he credits for a renaissance of public safety in New York.</TE>
<TE>   His primary tool is a crime-fighting program called Compstat,
which he started when he headed the New York Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Compstat uses computer mapping to identify crime hot spots and
then requires precinct commanders to figure out a solution. Far from
just computer wizardry, police bosses use weekly crime figures to
pressure police managers for results. Promotions or stalled careers
are often determined by how well precinct commanders in the NYPD
respond to spikes in crime.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton boasts that Compstat has revolutionized policing and is
responsible, in significant measure, for the rapid drop in violent
crime over the last half-dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   Although many criminologists attribute falling crime to such
broader social trends as the retreat of the crack epidemic, Bratton's
system has been adopted by dozens of police departments across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   New York has had three new commissioners since Bratton left the
post in 1996, but the top brass in the NYPD say they still practice
Compstat in largely the same way Bratton and his chief strategist,
the late Jack Maple, set it up.</TE>
<TE>   "Compstat is the reason that crime will not, will not, go up in
New York City again," Bratton said. "There will be spikes, peaks here
and there, but overall crime in New York City, you will not see it go
up. It's gone down for 12 straight years. It's going to continue to
go down in that city, and Compstat is the engine driving it."</TE>
<TE>   The celebrated renaissance of Manhattan across the East River has
spawned a wave of tourism to trendy new spots like the restaurants on
Greenwich Street in TriBeCa.</TE>
<TE>   Less heralded is the impact of the city's aggressive policing on
such depressed areas as Bedford-Stuyvesant, the largely black and
Latino suburb in Brooklyn that is still no tourist attraction but now
has a thriving commercial district.</TE>
<TE>   From the postman walking his route to store owners under the dank
shadow of the Broadway elevated train, people say they feel safer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very tough before," said Persio Genao from behind the
counter of his cramped convenience store and grill.</TE>
<TE>   For years, he said, drug dealers, drunks and thugs made a gantlet
for his customers on the street right outside his store.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a lot more safe," Genao said. "No question about that."</TE>
<TE>   "You say, 'I'm going to call the police,' most of the time they
go," brother and co-owner Jose Genao pitched in.</TE>
<TE>   There may still be a lively debate over who got rid of the bums,
the panhandlers, the muggers, the drug dealers and the prostitutes.
The Genao brothers vote for Giuliani, who they said stood up to
doubters.</TE>
<TE>   But many merchants said police protection improved dramatically
starting with Bratton and that it has stayed that way.</TE>
<TE>   "The drug guys come out later in the afternoon," said Elliott
Polinsky, third-generation owner of Gates Lumber. "They see a cop,
they walk the other way as opposed to they see a cop, they spit on
them."</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the Compstat program is the weekly crime-fighting
session conducted by the department bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Precinct commanders are selectively called to the Compstat meeting
and find themselves being grilled by Chief of Department Joseph
Esposito and Deputy Commissioner Garry F. McCarthy. Esposito is the
highest ranking uniformed officer, responsible for all operations.
McCarthy, a crew-cut 21-year NYPD veteran, is on a leave of absence
to fill the civilian post responsible for crime reduction. Compstat
is his No. 1 focus.</TE>
<TE>   Both men report directly to Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, the
department's top official. McCarthy said that relationship is
essential.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't blast someone who outranks me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Each week McCarthy reviews a book of crime stats before deciding
which precinct commanders to summon. He sends detectives into the
precincts to scout for such quality-of-life issues as prostitution
and vagrancy. He and Esposito then press the commanders to explain
how they will address the problems and why they haven't already done
so.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy and others said the confrontational nature of weekly
Compstat meetings has mellowed since the regime of Maple and then
Chief of Department Louis Anemone. But commanders are still held
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hold somebody responsible without berating them,"
McCarthy said. "You can ask tough questions without personalizing."</TE>
<TE>   In its early days, Compstat derailed careers. Bratton said he
dismissed more than half of his precinct commanders because they
didn't boldly attack crime. Other officers, including McCarthy, shot
up the ranks because they did.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy said his defining triumph as a precinct commander was the
quick bust of a convenience store robber who hit three stores in two
days.</TE>
<TE>   He put all his patrol officers on plainclothes surveillance duty
at 26 potential targets. Before Compstat, McCarthy said, he wouldn't
have had the authority to put his whole precinct in plain clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Plainclothes cops were perceived as a corruption hazard,"
McCarthy said. He said he would have had to file a request that would
have bounced around for a month.</TE>
<TE>   A crackdown on "quality of life" crimes is a hallmark of the
system that Bratton has vowed to bring to Los Angeles. The practice
at first raised protests from civil liberties groups that contend it
contributed to police abuses, including the torture in a police
station of Abner Louima, an offense committed after Bratton left.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when confronted about the increase in the number of citizen
complaints, Bratton responded that 5,000 complaints was a reasonable
trade-off for the city's plummeting crime rate, said Norman Siegel,
former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union and one of
Bratton's most prominent critics.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, now in private civil rights practice, said that despite
his past criticisms, he admires Bratton because he became more
sensitive during his 27 months as police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   More than other commissioners, he said, Bratton listened.</TE>
<TE>   In an unprecedented meeting, Siegel said, "Bratton called me and
came to our turf to talk to us about some of his issues."</TE>
<TE>   Whether police work by itself can substantially change crime
trends is a question that bedevils academics and criminologists,
despite a large body of research on the dramatic decreases in violent
crime during the 1990s in America's large cities.</TE>
<TE>   Some contend that police reforms, including Compstat, have little
measurable effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The data do not support a strong argument for Compstat causing,
contributing to or accelerating the decline in homicides in New York
City or elsewhere," said criminologists John E. Eck and Edward R.
McGuire.</TE>
<TE>   Among the possible contributing factors, say some researchers, are
long-term cycles in illegal drug use, restrictive gun laws dating to
the mid-1980s, expanded police departments and prison systems,
demographic trends and the collective influence of family, community
groups and police.</TE>
<TE>   In Brooklyn, one longtime community leader says Bratton was
successful because he understood that police must work cooperatively
with residents and community groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying under the Bratton administration the idea of community
policing made a difference," said Sharonnie Perry, an aide to a Rep.
Edolphus Towns (D-Brooklyn) and chairwoman of the Brooklyn
neighborhood council.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, despite his reputation for tough talk, improved
community-police relations, she said. One of his biggest legacies is
the civilian review board, which gave police more credibility. The
board reviews complaints about police behavior and can recommend a
punishment to the department.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she said, complaints get an immediate response, and the
police are careful to brief her when there is an unusual occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Bratton, there wasn't a rapport," she said. "The police
that came in thought everybody in Bedford-Stuyvesant was a criminal."</TE>

<HD>Officials Urge EIDC Chief to Step Down</HD>
<DH>Hahn, Yaroslavsky cite probe into Cody Cluff's use of film
agency funds. Others defend him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anita M. Busch and Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
called Thursday for Cody Cluff to step down from the presidency of
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., citing a continuing
criminal investigation into allegations of misuse of funds.</LD>
<LD>   A third member of the EIDC's executive committee, Los Angeles
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, also called for Cluff to step aside to
restore credibility to the agency.</LD>
<LD>   "There are just a lot of questions surrounding his administration
of the EIDC, and until they are resolved, the mayor feels he should
take a leave of absence," said Matt Middlebrook, deputy mayor.</LD>
<TE>   All three said allegations that Cluff misused EIDC funds have put
a "cloud" over the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   "The agency is being tainted every day, and only [Cluff] knows
what else is coming," Yaroslavsky said. "This is Chinese water
torture for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said Cluff should be put on a paid leave of absence.
Greuel agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have discussed and recommended that Cluff either voluntarily
resign or go on an administrative leave," she said. "I know the
importance of the EIDC. We want to make sure we get this entity back
to being a credible organization so the [film] industry can believe
that it is spending money properly and focusing on its mission, which
is keeping productions here."</TE>
<TE>   But other elected officials said no action against Cluff should be
taken until two audits are completed.</TE>
<TE>   "All we have are allegations based on assumptions without facts,"
said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich. "You are innocent until
proven guilty. This is not a fascist court."</TE>
<TE>   Several other elected officials agreed, including City Council
members Ed Reyes, Alex Padilla and Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's lawyer, George Newhouse, said Hahn, Yaroslavsky, and
Greuel have violated their contractual responsibility as corporate
board members to protect the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   "To call for Cody's removal before we have all the facts, before
the audit committee is selected and to jump to conclusions is
regrettable and unwise. It's irresponsible," Newhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating
whether Cluff has misappropriated EIDC funds through lavish
expenditures and political contributions to elected officials,
including many who serve on the agency's board of directors. Neither
Yaroslavsky nor Greuel have received donations from EIDC, although
individual agency staff members have given $5,400 to Greuel's
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the district attorney's investigation spilled into
Pennsylvania, where investigators allege that Cluff gave close to
$47,000 in EIDC funds to the Pittsburgh Film Office and to help
establish a national film advocacy group called FilmUS, both headed
by Dawn Keezer. Investigators have alleged that Cluff had an "an
ongoing, personal relationship" with Keezer. They searched the film
office, Keezer's home and an art gallery where Cluff purchased an
$8,700 painting for his Hollywood office.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations pushed the inquiry to a new level, with
investigators now alleging in a sworn affidavit that Cluff and Keezer
were conspiring to misappropriate EIDC funds and that Cluff was
motivated by his personal relationship with Keezer. They also allege
that FilmUS is not a legitimate organization, and that it was
"created by Cluff and Keezer as a means of collecting funds from the
EIDC and other film offices around the U.S. for their personal use."</TE>
<TE>   Several state film commissioners told The Times on Thursday that
prosecutors misunderstood the role that Cluff and Keezer played.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Rinard, executive director of the Oregon Film and Video
Office and one of 196 members of FilmUS, said the group has been
instrumental in promoting legislation to help keep filming in this
country.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Styer, one of the founding members of FilmUS and the
former head of Maryland's film office, said Cluff and Keezer did not
create the advocacy group. He said fees to establish the group came
"from a large number of film commissions" across the United States,
not just the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Cluff and Keezer were duly elected by the nation's
film commissioners, and that it would have been difficult, if not
impossible, for them to stash money in FilmUS' accounts or withdraw
money without the signature of the treasurer. "The structure [of
FilmUS] makes it impossible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the allegations, Yaroslavsky said he does not intend
to prejudge Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of the EIDC is right, which is to keep the film
industry alive and well, but we need an agency run without a cloud
hanging over its head," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he should make an offer to the board to take a paid leave
of absence or to resign.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the agency function in this environment? Cody is
besieged, and I feel for his predicament," said Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't run the organization and deal with these allegations
simultaneously. The EIDC is not Cody Cluff."</TE>

<HD>Testimony Ends in Trial of Suspect in Clerk's Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testimony concluded Thursday in the trial of a small-time drug dealer
accused of killing a Ventura grocery clerk during a robbery attempt
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Geise, 32, is charged with murder and other counts in
connection with the shooting of Alejandro Alvarez at Ventura's
Central Market in April 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors tried to prove that Geise was one of two masked
gunmen, along with his now-deceased cousin, who stormed the store,
demanded money and began shooting before employees could comply.</LD>
<TE>   But the defense tried to show that another man, Sam Patterson, was
the second shooter. Patterson's father testified Thursday that his
son, who has since died of a drug overdose, told him before his death
that he would probably go to prison for murder. But the father also
said his son denied killing anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Geise's defense attorney has maintained that his client was
"flush" from selling drugs and therefore had no motive for robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Geise's criminal record includes convictions for transporting
drugs, attempted burglary and grand theft.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday morning.</TE>

<HD>HIV Cases on Rise Among Children</HD>
<DH>The county health department finds 18 young people with the
infection this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials have received 18 new reports of
HIV infections among children this year, exceeding the annual total
for each of the last three years.</LD>
<LD>   Although the number represents a setback, none of the new cases is
among babies born this year. Eight of the children were born in 2000
and 2001. Two of them are siblings and their mother declined HIV
testing during her pregnancies because she thought she was not at
risk.</LD>
<LD>   Largely because of aggressive treatment -- including use of the
drug AZT -- 55 virus-free babies were born this year to HIV-positive
mothers, said Dr. Toni Frederick, chief epidemiologist with the
county's pediatric HIV project.</LD>
<TE>   Still, health experts reiterated an urgent plea issued in February
-- after receiving seven reports of HIV in children -- that pregnant
women be tested and treated for the virus that causes AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, county officials received seven case reports in all
of last year, 14 in 2000 and 11 in 1999. Thirty-two HIV cases among
children were reported in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A new finger-prick HIV test, approved by the federal government
Thursday, could help. It provides results within 20 minutes, unlike
current products that sometimes take days to process.</TE>
<TE>   By taking anti-AIDS drugs during pregnancy and delivery, giving
medication to their babies and avoiding breast-feeding after birth,
HIV-positive women can cut the chances of passing the virus to
newborns to less than 1%.</TE>
<TE>   If untreated, a woman has a 20% to 25% chance of transmitting HIV
to her unborn child.</TE>
<TE>   The newly reported cases in Los Angeles County have renewed a
debate over whether California ought to make HIV testing of pregnant
women a regular part of prenatal care, unless women refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "We committed those 18 children in Los Angeles County this year to
death because nobody was prepared to step up and say, 'We're
interested in protecting the children,' " said outgoing Assemblyman
Rod Wright (D-Los Angeles), who sponsored a bill that would have
mandated such testing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis vetoed the bill this fall, saying the "current universal
voluntary system seems to be working well."</TE>
<TE>   "I support the goal of more testing, but I believe this bill
represents a fundamental shift from voluntary testing toward a
mandatory system, which may reduce an at-risk woman's willingness to
receive prenatal care," the governor wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials noted some peculiarities among the newly reported
cases in Los Angeles County. Three children were born outside the
United States, and three more moved to Los Angeles from other cities
where they had been diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers of two children tested negative for HIV during their
pregnancies, meaning they had been infected too recently for the
virus to show up or were infected after being tested.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest pediatric case reported this year was a boy in his late
teens who may have contracted the disease from a blood transfusion.
Also, officials learned of a preteen girl's infection only after the
child's mother began showing symptoms of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "The child went 10 years without having anything that a physician
picked up" as being indicative of HIV, Frederick said. "We see that
they can live asymptomatically for a number of years without coming
to medical attention."</TE>
<TE>   Frederick said the new cases show that doctors must not become
complacent about pediatric HIV cases. "The medical world needs to be
aware that it's still something that needs to be on their radar
screen for both children and mothers, and really for fathers," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Office of AIDS Programs and Policy has created an
initiative, called promotoras, in which Latino and black women
volunteer to discuss HIV with friends and neighbors at the grocery
store, self-service laundry, beauty salon and other gathering spots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a model based on peer education, from a woman to another
woman," said Armida Ayala, a researcher in charge of the program.
"Our main theme is to get women into prenatal care so they get tested
for HIV."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, 83 HIV-positive women were treated with the medication
AZT during labor and delivery, and none of their babies was infected.
All of the six infected babies born in 2001 had mothers who did not
receive treatment.</TE>

<HD>2 Hurt as Small Plane Crashes at John Wayne</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon and Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A single-engine plane crash-landed at John Wayne Airport on Thursday
afternoon, injuring the pilot and a passenger and closing a runway
for more than two hours.</LD>
<LD>   The V-tailed Beech Bonanza crashed about 1:45 p.m. north of the
airport's two runways, within sight of the San Diego Freeway. Airport
rescue workers doused the plane with fire-suppressing foam and pulled
the two people from the crumpled plane, airport officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot and plane's owner, Timothy E. Kjenstad, and his
unidentified female passenger were taken by ambulance to Western
Medical Center-Santa Ana and listed in moderate condition Thursday
evening. Kjenstad, a firefighter from Henderson, Nev., suffered cuts
to his face, and the passenger had fractures to her ankle and wrist,
said hospital spokeswoman Sonoma Van Brunt. "They are awake and up
and talking ... which is good news," Van Brunt said.</LD>
<TE>   Commercial aircraft continued to take off and land on the
airport's long runway without disruption Thursday afternoon. However,
airport officials temporarily closed the short runway used by general
aviation aircraft to inspect it for debris, said Ann McCarley, an
airport spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   McCarley said the crash was being investigated by the Federal
Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board,
which authorized airport officials to move the significantly damaged
aircraft to the west area of the airport.</TE>
<TE>   A witness said the plane was "coming in low" when it crash-landed
in a dirt patch short of the runway.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Donaldson, manager of the Henderson Executive Airport in
Nevada, confirmed that the 47-year-old F35 Beech Bonanza is based
there but said he did not know Kjenstad. Airport workers saw Kjenstad
leave Wednesday but had not seen him since, and they did not know his
flight plan, Donaldson said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Scott Martelle contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Will Conan the Republican Come to the State's Rescue?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The evidence has never been more clear, my fellow Californians. We
are out of step with the rest of the country, and headed deep into
the wilderness of the American fringe.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, being such nutball contrarians is going to cost us,
and there may be only one man who can save us from getting our ears
boxed.</LD>
<LD>   I'm talking about the last-ditch hope for California -- Conan the
Republican. I'll get to him in a minute, but first let me give you
the bad news about where we stand.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the nation marched single file to the right on
election day, handing Congress over to Republicans in a ringing
endorsement of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Not us.</TE>
<TE>   We even added a Democrat to our lopsided congressional delegation,
running the count to 33-20, and earning more contempt from those who
control the nation's purse strings.</TE>
<TE>   One White House advisor, surveying the landscape for my colleague
Mark Barabak, had this to say about California:</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the state is such a sinkhole for money."</TE>
<TE>   He might as well have told us to drop dead.</TE>
<TE>   Say what they will about us, but I still can't figure out
precisely what stirred the rest of the republic to pat the president
on the back.</TE>
<TE>   The economy?</TE>
<TE>   No, it's in the tank.</TE>
<TE>   The call to war?</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't be that. When you look past the first question in every
poll, most Americans have doubts about the mission and fears about
the costs.</TE>
<TE>   The federal surplus?</TE>
<TE>   Whoops.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. energy policy?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's it. Environmentalists have been spotted leaping from
bridges, oil barons are lighting cigars, and musk oxen are fleeing
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ahead of the drilling rigs.</TE>
<TE>   So exactly how out of step are we in loopy California, which
established landmark tailpipe emissions controls while the White
House was saying no to the Kyoto Protocol?</TE>
<TE>   We elected nothing but Democrats to statewide office Tuesday, and
if the one race in which they're still counting votes falls into
line, it'll be the first time since 1946 that either party pitched a
shutout.</TE>
<TE>   It gets even crazier.</TE>
<TE>   When Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) greeted the Republican sweep with
the rally cry "Let's roll," San Franciscans thought he meant joints.</TE>
<TE>   That city gave a 2-1 thumbs up to a medical marijuana study in
foolish defiance of federal prohibitions, which means San Francisco
may soon go into the pot-growing business. If so, they'd better rearm
the Presidio in case of a visit from the CIA's Predator aircraft,
which is ready to go after clearing out a weed patch in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   California needs help, and we need it fast.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one guy who can save us from scorn and ridicule and
get us back in step with the rest of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   Who else can muscle our share of pork out of Congress?</TE>
<TE>   Who else in the entire state can call the White House and get past
voicemail?</TE>
<TE>   The biggest winner Tuesday in California wasn't the governor or
any other Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   It was Ahhhhnold.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Terminator was the force behind Proposition 49, the winning
initiative that will finance after-school programs. Proposition 49
was not a whim for Schwarzenegger. Trust me, it was part of a
calculated plan to launch a political career.</TE>
<TE>   This tells us, among other things, that Schwarzenegger is no
idiot. The man has murdered something like 275 people in the movies,
so he needed a warm and fuzzy cause to redeem himself after so much
gratuitous bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   He apparently couldn't think of a pro-grandmothers initiative or a
pro-puppies proposition. So instead he tossed in $1 million of his
own and championed the pro-kids Prop. 49, which, by the way, will
burgle up to $550 million from the state general fund without the
say-so of legislators or the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine cameras," his gloating political advisor said of the TV news
hacks who swarmed like flies at the Prop. 49 victory celebration. My
colleague Carla Hall noted that Schwarzenegger's makeup artist was on
hand for touch-ups.</TE>
<TE>   It was no ordinary photo op. It was the unofficial beginning of
his campaign for governor in 2006, or perhaps for U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I can explain how a puffed-up immigrant who made a
fortune killing people on screen, has virtually no experience and no
known political positions, can be the brightest -- and only -- hope
for the state GOP.</TE>
<TE>   But it's crazy enough to make sense, and we can't wait four years
for him to throw himself in front of the train. Schwarzenegger
strikes me as a shoot-now-ask-questions-later guy, sort of like
President Bush. Let somebody else worry about the details.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Arnold Schwarzenegger is bright, ambitious, focused, able
to take direction, and clearly he has the fire in the belly," says
Arnie Steinberg, a Republican political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Democrat Rob "Meathead" Reiner, of "All in the Family"
fame, might be standing in Arnold's way down the road.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the country can make fun of us all they want, but I
think they envy all the fun we're having. Even our shoplifters are
movie stars.</TE>

<LD>A 71-year-old man was found dead early Thursday in a small travel
trailer that was gutted by fire in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man apparently fell asleep while smoking, causing
the 11:20 p.m. blaze at Orangeland Recreational Vehicle Park at 1600
W. Struck Ave. Damage was set at $15,000.</LD>
<LD>   "Apparently he has burn scars from neighbors putting out fires on
his chest in the past," said Orange police Lt. John Whiteley.
"They're pretty sure it was accidental. Apparently, he tried to get
out and was overcome by flames."</LD>

girl and robbed the pair, has been arrested, authorities said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Hillinger was arrested Oct. 16 -- some 20 months after the
alleged crime, said Jim Amormino of the Orange County Sheriff's

<HD>Panel Urges Release of Convicted Murderer</HD>
<DH>Parole unit says it found no evidence that the woman
plotted the 1981 slaying of her abuser. Davis rejected freedom for
her in June.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state parole panel Thursday said a battered woman from Azusa
imprisoned in the killing of her abuser 21 years ago is not a danger
to society and deserves to be freed.</LD>
<LD>   If the decision survives an internal review by the Board of Prison
Terms, as expected, inmate Maria Suarez will find her fate in the
hands of Gov. Gray Davis -- who has already rejected her parole once.</LD>
<LD>   Suarez suffered "an extreme amount of abuse" during her five-year
relationship with Anselmo Covarrubias, including violent rapes and
beatings, parole Commissioner Al Angele said after a hearing at the
women's prison in Corona.</LD>
<TE>   Angele said that despite such abuse and Suarez's conviction for
first-degree murder, the parole board had found no evidence that she
conspired to have Covarrubias killed.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's action marks the second time that Suarez, 42, has been
cleared for release by parole commissioners who found she suffered
from battered women's syndrome at the time of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reversed the first parole grant in June. While conceding
that Suarez had been abused, he said there were conflicting reports
about whether she had solicited the murder.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a Davis spokesman said that, in denying Suarez
parole, the governor had also asked the board to investigate and
clarify inconsistencies about her role in the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this was a parole matter that the governor thought
warranted additional review," deputy press secretary Byron Tucker
said. "When the case is forwarded to him this time, he will look at
the new data and make an informed decision."</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Suarez expressed gratitude and said her main
goal was to be reunited with her family, a parole board spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she could not even describe how happy she was, and that
the most difficult part had been knowing how much hurt this had
caused her mother," spokesman Bill Sessa said.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Suarez's relatives -- including her mother and
sisters -- gathered outside the California Institution for Women
during the hearing, holding a banner that read, "Justice for Maria."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez's niece Patricia Valencia of Los Angeles said in an
interview that family members are "very, very hopeful that this time
we may truly be close to freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez's case is one of dozens being reevaluated by the parole
board under a relatively new state law. The law requires that certain
murder cases be reviewed to see whether battered women's syndrome may
have played a role in the crime -- and whether, as a result, parole
for the convict is deserved.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez was 16 when she moved north from Mexico to live with a
sister in Duarte. While walking in her neighborhood a few months
later, Suarez was approached by a woman who offered her work as a
housekeeper. She wound up in the home of Covarrubias, who allegedly
paid a $200 "finder's fee" for her.</TE>
<TE>   Covarrubias was believed by neighbors to be a brujo, or warlock,
and over the next five years, he raped, beat and emotionally abused
Suarez, according to parole board investigators. Reared in a rural
part of Mexico where superstition held sway, Suarez believed
Covarrubias when he threatened to use witchcraft to kill her family
if she told them about the abuse, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her arrest, authorities said Suarez conspired with
a neighbor, Rene Soto, who killed Covarrubias in August 1981 by
hitting him with a wooden table leg. Soto and Suarez, who washed and
hid the weapon, were convicted of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Soto and his wife initially implicated Suarez in the crime, but
more recently told investigators she was not involved. Soto's
Spanish-speaking wife said she thought a translation error had
mistakenly led authorities to believe she had told them Suarez was
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators for the parole board said Suarez's actions stemmed
from her status as a battered woman. Testimony about battered women's
syndrome was not presented at her trial, because such input was not
allowed in court until 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office opposed parole,
arguing that Suarez had conspired to murder Covarrubias and had not
adequately accepted responsibility for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Among Suarez's supporters are the now-retired sheriff's homicide
detective who arrested her, and her former attorney, who was later
disbarred and says he botched the case and has been haunted by it for
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Prison Terms, appointed by the governor, has approved
parole for 150 convicted murderers since Davis was first elected.
Davis has approved freedom for two, both battered women who killed
their abusers.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker said the governor would continue to make public safety his
foremost goal in evaluating which murder convicts are rehabilitated
and should go free. Political analysts said Davis might soften up a
bit on parole in his second term.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he's not running for president, which means he's no
longer seeking endorsements and funds from police groups," said
Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for the Study of Politics
and Media at Cal State Sacramento. "So one would hope he would look
at these cases on an individual basis and make a humane judgment."</TE>

<LD>From the outside, the greeting card appears to be an invitation to a
cocktail party or a grand opening. The classy navy-blue design on the
cover is set off against an equally classy corporate logo of the
Winthrop Couchot law firm in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The message inside, however, surprised me: "Winthrop Couchot
Professional Corp. is pleased to announce that it is representing
Classic Limousines Inc., in its Chapter 11 reorganization
proceedings. Classic Limousines is a worldwide leader in the
manufacture and sale of luxury-class limousines and customized
vehicles."</LD>
<LD>   The card goes on to give a synopsis of the Fountain Valley-based
company and then identifies the two Winthrop Couchot attorneys
handling the bankruptcy proceeding.</LD>
<TE>   There's no shame in declaring Chapter 11. So far this year, 378
companies have filed in federal court from California's central
district. Companies large and small use the reorganization window to
right themselves.</TE>
<TE>   I just never thought of it as greeting-card material, along the
lines of "Join Us in Celebrating the Birth of Our Baby!" or "Mr. and
Mrs. Harold Smith Are Proud to Announce the Marriage of Their
Daughter Ann to Mr. James Fielding."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine Brian Rauls' surprise. He's the chief financial officer of
the limousine company and didn't know of the card's existence until I
read it to him. He didn't seem upset but didn't want to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   Garrick Hollander, one of the lawyers handling the case, said the
card is a cousin of a method used by firms such as Wall Street
investment companies to trumpet their successes.</TE>
<TE>   For a law firm like Winthrop Couchot, he says, the card is a way
of advertising itself and letting interested parties know of a
Chapter 11 situation. And by openly acknowledging a bankruptcy, it
may help lessen what some still consider a stigma, he says.</TE>
<TE>   While a generational divide still exists over white-collar
advertising, Hollander notes, today's legal world is more dog-eat-dog
than ever. Throughout corporate America, he says, "marketing is a big
issue, and you've got to get your name out there."</TE>
<TE>   I think they're on to something. Why should clients and lawyers be
so self-conscious about such a big moment in their lives?</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the public acknowledgment should expand beyond the
relatively mundane world of corporate law. The untapped world of
criminal law beckons.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the possibilities ...</TE>
<TE>   "The firm of Musgrave &amp; Sims is pleased to announce its
representation of Lawrence "Knuckles" Mulcahy, a long-standing civic
leader in our community currently embroiled in ongoing unpleasantness
with the federal government over racketeering charges."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Have you heard of the kidnap charges against Morton Spires? The
firm of Trundle &amp; Evers proudly invites you to attend a daylong
meet-and-greet session with Mr. Spires on Dec. 3, at which he will
proclaim his innocence and answer questions. Cookies provided."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Fenster Bros. will bullishly defend Richard Roarke against
charges of animal cruelty. Mr. Roarke and Randy, his pet Afghan and
the subject of the criminal charge, will be available this Saturday
and Sunday from noon to 3 p.m. Photo opportunities as time permits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Guilty? Sadly, yes. That's why Paulson &amp; Paulson will be offering
a plea-bargain at the upcoming trial of its client, Mr. Ralph
Godfrey. While proudly representing Mr. Godfrey, the firm realizes he
made certain mistakes that no civilized man should make. P.S.: The
firm gladly takes on innocent clients too."</TE>

<HD>Rubin's Lawyers Seek Probe Into Fall</HD>
<DH>Faulting the FBI's findings, attorneys for the Jewish
Defense League leader press for an independent investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusing the FBI of bias, Irv Rubin's lawyers called Thursday for an
independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the
Jewish Defense League leader's headlong plunge from a balcony at a
federal detention center earlier this week.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to federal prosecutors calling for appointment of an
independent investigative team, lawyers Bryan Altman and Peter Morris
also asked for copies of any videotapes that might have captured what
happened before Rubin went over the rail. The attorneys said the FBI
was biased against their client.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials said there were no video cameras on the tier
outside Rubin's cell.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin, who was awaiting trial on charges of plotting to bomb a
mosque and a congressman's office, tried to slash himself with a
disposable razor and then dove 18 feet over a railing after being
called out of his cell Monday, according to prison officials.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which was called in to investigate the incident, said it
had interviewed more than 15 guards and inmates who corroborated the
account.</TE>
<TE>   Matt McLaughlin, an FBI spokesman, said he would not respond to
the charge of FBI bias. "About all we can say is that we have
conducted a thorough investigation, the results of which show that
Mr. Rubin attempted to commit suicide," McLaughlin said. "There is
simply no information that this investigation has developed to
contradict that."</TE>
<TE>   Morris said that Rubin is a "devoted family man" and would have
left behind a note to his wife and two sons if he had been
contemplating suicide. No such note was found.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin remained in a coma Thursday at County-USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office had no immediate response to the
request for an independent probe.</TE>

<HD>Finally, a Home Field of Their Own</HD>
<DH>After 44 years, Salesian High in Boyle Heights has a
football stadium, thanks to a big gift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega  and Mike Hiserman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, they've looked at it, long and wistfully, as they trudged
past on the way from the locker room to the collection of dust and
rock that is their practice field.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh paint. New goal posts. A big, bright scoreboard. Imagine.</LD>
<LD>   An opening night with lush, virgin grass under their cleats and
bleachers crowded with friends and family, some standing as they
watch from one of the plazas overlooking the new stadium. Their new
stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Football heaven, smack in the middle of gritty, crime-ridden but
still-hopeful Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight will finally be one of dreams for the football players of
Salesian High.</TE>
<TE>   In its 44-year history, the tiny, all-boys Catholic school has
never played a game on its own campus, a streak that will come to an
end about 7:30 p.m., when they are scheduled to kick off against a
team from Daniel Murphy High.</TE>
<TE>   "As freshmen, we were told that we would have a football field in
a year or so. But there were a lot of former players who said they
heard the same thing years ago," said Aurelio Covarrubias, a senior
who is one of the team's quarterbacks. "I still couldn't believe it
was happening when they first started [construction]. But now ...
it's real."</TE>
<TE>   For that, Salesian can thank John and Dorothy Shea, who have
contributed $7 million toward a $9.2-million construction project
that includes the 1,350-seat lighted football and soccer stadium,
plus a three-level athletic building that has a gymnasium, two locker
rooms, a weight room, a physical therapy and training center, and
coaches' offices. Refurbishing a multipurpose wing that is home to
the school's thrice-weekly lifeblood -- bingo -- and creating
concrete verandas as community gathering places completed the
endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheas, who live in Pasadena, do not have a direct connection
to Salesian, but they have a decade-long record of philanthropy at
urban Catholic schools.</TE>
<TE>   The J.F. Shea Co., a Walnut-based construction firm that John owns
with his cousins, Edmund and Peter Shea, built a library, cafeteria,
multipurpose center, gymnasium and football field at Verbum Dei High
in Watts in the mid-1990s. In 1998, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony inducted
John and Dorothy into papal knighthood, the highest recognition the
church can bestow on a layperson.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always felt that the best way to help society is to help
the inner city," John Shea said, "because the inner city is where
there are the most problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Eastside neighborhood that is home to Salesian certainly
qualifies. The area is gang-infested and notorious for crime. Most
homes and businesses have bars on their doors and windows. Every
dwelling, it seems, is subject to graffiti -- and not just on walls;
windows too.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street from the school's main office on an afternoon
this week, four young men loitered on the porch of a home, one
smoking from a pipe and another taking the last swig from a bottle
before lobbing it toward bustling Soto Street.</TE>
<TE>   The school, with high fences and locked gates, is a sanctuary not
entirely isolated from trouble. When a new brick retaining wall went
up on the south side of the football stadium, it was tagged with
graffiti on the first day.</TE>
<TE>   "It was painted over right away and it hasn't been tagged again,"
Lalo Mendoza, Salesian's football coach and athletic director, said
this week. "Hopefully, that's a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Salesian's enrollment, which reached a high of nearly 1,000 in the
late 1970s, has dropped to less than one-third of that in recent
years as annual tuition and the cost of books climbed to about
$4,400.</TE>
<TE>   It is hoped the new athletic facilities will rejuvenate interest
in the community and perhaps lead to an increase in enrollment
"because it's such a good school and they do such a good job with the
students," Dorothy Shea said.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said he is aware of about half a dozen eighth-graders who
say they want to come to Salesian next year -- up from the usual
zero.</TE>
<TE>   The football field and gymnasium, which look "like a cathedral" to
Mendoza, should help the school attract athletes. As for the current
crop, they have endured a lot.</TE>
<TE>   The school has never had a regulation-size football field, and its
old gym was demolished because it didn't comply with the city
building code.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to practice on or near the campus last year because of the
construction, members of the football team scrambled to cars after
school and braved traffic to meet for workouts at the Whittier
Narrows Recreation Area, 10 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "Home" football games have been played at Roosevelt and Los
Angeles Wilson highs, East Los Angeles College and, for the past
several seasons, Downey's St. Matthias High.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been like nomads," said Bob Mendoza, Salesian's plant
manager, Lalo's brother and, until this year, the school's athletic
director. "Even when we were playing home games, we had to get on a
bus to get to the game."</TE>
<TE>   The new field and stadium, part of which is on the site of the
school's old gym, is a source of pride. For so many years, Salesian
players have heard the barbs of opposing players.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd tell us that we weren't a real team and we didn't have a
real program because we didn't have a home field," said Robert
Mauricio, a three-year starter at linebacker for the Mustangs. "They
said we'd always be losers, and if our school cared about us we'd
have a home field."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he added, the players have "something we can call our own and
take pride in."</TE>
<TE>   To appreciate the bright future to which their program appears to
be headed, Salesian football players need look no further than the
ground they stand on most afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   Their practice field at the Boyle Heights Recreation Center, just
down the hill from Salesian's campus, is entirely dirt -- except for
the few tufts of grass that surround leaky sprinkler heads.</TE>
<TE>   But looking up at their school, players now see freshly painted
goal posts and a glimmering three-story structure.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, as the football team breaks in the home turf, there's a
rumor circulating that school officials are bringing in a mariachi
band for the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of excitement about finally playing a home game on
campus after all these years," Covarrubias said. "I think some of the
former players are even more excited than we are. A lot of them have
been stopping by the field in the last few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Munoz, a three-year starter on both the offensive and
defensive lines, said people "in the community are excited about it.
I ran into one of my old coaches on Halloween and he wanted to know
all about the new field."</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the basketball team will make its debut in the new
gymnasium, which inside is trimmed in the school colors of white,
black and Columbia blue, and still smells of fresh paint.</TE>
<TE>   In the lobby, a display case is filled with mementos from the
dedication.</TE>
<TE>   Someday, Coach Mendoza hopes, those pieces will be replaced by
hardware won by Salesian's athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't give us any trophies," Mendoza said. "We have to
fill it ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Stumbles Hurt Breakup Efforts</HD>
<DH>Miscalculations and setbacks undermined Valley, Hollywood
and harbor area campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy,</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years before their breakup bid hit the ballot, San Fernando Valley
secessionists plotted a multi-front revolution that they thought
would see neighborhoods from the harbor to the Hollywood Hills
fighting to break free from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   If other disgruntled areas joined the Valley in the breakup
crusade, the theory went, it would stir enthusiasm citywide for
Valley secession. And by election day, separatists would have enough
support in different quarters of the city to win independence for all
the breakaway areas.</LD>
<LD>   It was a terrible miscalculation -- one that some say may have
helped defeat secession in Tuesday's election.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of kindling grass-roots rebellions throughout the city, a
move to push San Pedro and Wilmington cityhood onto the same ballot
fizzled and a hasty Hollywood secession plan set off a huge backlash,
even among Hollywood voters. Efforts to incite pro-breakup anger in
South-Central and Westchester also flopped.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who served on the Local Agency
Formation Commission that approved secession for a citywide vote,
said the drive to put Hollywood and harbor cityhood plans on the same
ballot as Valley independence was the biggest mistake the
secessionists made.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Hollywood dragged it down," Yaroslavsky said. "If
Hollywood got creamed everywhere, including the Valley, how could it
help the Valley cause?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, election returns show Hollywood residents voted against
the Valley seceding and Valley residents voted against Hollywood
becoming its own city.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem undoubtedly was the timing. Unlike the Valley,
where secession leaders had spent six years cultivating support among
business and homeowner groups, Hollywood cityhood was rushed onto the
ballot in two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley campaign had many leaders and donors, but the Hollywood
bid was largely the work of nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, who
shoveled more than $2.5 million toward the effort.</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of Hollywood, however, many residents and merchants
were taken aback. Several homeowner associations began to protest
their neighborhoods' inclusion in the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a silent, sub rosa takeover, a hostile takeover,"
Hollywood bookstore owner Susan Polifronio said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood campaign, which included billboard model Angelyne as
a city council candidate, was seen by many people as not serious,
even "goofy," in the words of Yaroslavsky. Some observers said that
helped undermine the credibility of Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Another piece of the pro-breakup strategy crumbled when harbor
cityhood failed to qualify for the ballot in May. Despite repeated
attempts to crunch the budget numbers so that the area could stand on
its own, LAFCO finally concluded San Pedro and Wilmington did not
have an adequate tax base to survive financially.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment they had collected enough voter signatures to
launch a cityhood drive in 1998, Valley separatists made no secret of
the fact that they hoped to see as many secession drives as possible
on the same ballot as theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "My crystal ball says that by the time this is on the ballot,
there could be as many as five to 10 areas looking to do the same
thing," Valley secession leader Richard Close said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the harbor area had landed on Tuesday's ballot alongside
Valley and Hollywood secession, some political observers said, it
would have taken a highly coordinated campaign to keep all three
campaigns on track and reach out to other communities for votes.</TE>
<TE>   "They would need to figure out how to pool their resources, how to
recruit high-level, credible candidates that could carry their
message. They never did that," said John Shallman, a political
consultant based in the Valley. "They fooled themselves into
believing [secession] was an American revolution, that if they built
a city, people would come. But people didn't come."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists also assumed that candidates seeking office in the
proposed Valley, Hollywood and harbor cities would generate cash,
publicity and votes for the overall movement.</TE>
<TE>   That idea seemed to be a natural in San Pedro, a working-class
port neighborhood built by generations of Croatian, Portuguese and
Italian fishing families. Harbor secession advocate Andrew Mardesich
promoted a vision of Jeffersonian democracy wherein the campaign
would attract a hundred candidates whose family connections alone
would draw enough votes to win.</TE>
<TE>   But once harbor cityhood failed to make the ballot, the few dozen
supporters who had been gearing up for the campaign drifted away.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling is, 'Well, we're not seceding. Ho hum, life goes on,'
" secessionist Noel Park, a homeowner leader, said after LAFCO
rejected the harbor plan.</TE>
<TE>   That left Hollywood. Some political observers -- as well as voters
-- said there was more rationale for a Valley city than a Hollywood
municipality. As a vast suburb separated from the rest of Los Angeles
by a mountain range, the Valley is geographically and somewhat
culturally distinct.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Times poll showed that likely voters were highly
skeptical of Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up interview, Carol Hungerford of Harbor City said she
would support Valley cityhood but not the Hollywood measure.</TE>
<TE>   "It came up so quickly," said the 45-year-old drama teacher.
"Hollywood is so smack in the middle of the city, you know, but the
Valley's off on its own, like the harbor. That seems to make more
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky and others said the twin breakup proposals appear to
have made voters nervous by suggesting their city could unravel along
multiple seams all at once.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Close said Thursday he has no regrets about
helping to get Hollywood onto the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it benefited us because it brought more attention to the
fact that we need to reorganize city government," Close said, adding
that La Pietra's hefty campaign contributions also helped.</TE>
<TE>   With the collapse of the secessionists' citywide strategy, support
began to shrink back to the movement's core. Tuesday's election
results show that secession did well only in the West Valley, an
affluent, mostly white area where the breakup drive was born.</TE>
<TE>   A misreading of the political map was not the secessionists' only
stumble. Throughout the campaign, they were battered by setback after
setback as they tried to make their case that smaller cities would be
more responsive to the demands of their residents.</TE>
<TE>   They failed to attract a high-powered field of candidates for the
proposed mayoral and city council seats. They were unable to raise
the millions of dollars needed to fend off a blizzard of
anti-secession television ads.</TE>
<TE>   With little direction or money from the Valley Independence
Committee, more than 100 political amateurs running for seats in the
proposed Valley city tried to mount homespun campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed in the leadership of the Valley
Independence movement," said Frank Sheftel, a candy maker who ran for
the Valley city council. "They did not take advantage of the
candidates like they should have. They alienated a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Added candidate Shaunn Cartwright: "I think every one of us wishes
we had a voodoo doll of the Valley Independence people."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, a Realtor who ran for Valley mayor, said it quickly
became clear to him that he was on his own. Valley secession leaders
refused to share their database of supporters, telling candidates it
was against the law for them to reveal names and phone numbers of
people who favored secession, Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me have to work harder," he said with a weary smile. "I
stopped relying on them to do things for me."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Valley secessionists probably needed candidates such
as Wilson -- a respected former city fire commissioner and
Metropolitan Transportation Authority board member -- more than he
needed them.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they had a raft of well-meaning but inexperienced people
like Don Larson, an artist who ran for a Valley council seat.</TE>
<TE>   "What killed the secession movement is us," Larson said of the
candidates. "Most of us are not qualified. I think it's
embarrassing.... Look, I'm a nice guy, I'm a good guy, but I'm not
qualified to run a city."</TE>

<HD>Shuttered Theater in Moorpark to Reopen With Fewer Screens</HD>
<DH>City Council approves a health club and new film house with
stadium seating to take the place of the Regal in Mission Bell Plaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzie St. John</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Moorpark City Council has paved the way for a health club and
three-screen movie theater to move into the spot left vacant when
Regal Theater shut its doors.</LD>
<LD>   Northern California-based developer Epic Enterprises hopes to open
the theater by mid-December and a Mavericks health club by March 1.</LD>
<LD>   "Our goal is to open the theater in time to show the new 'Lord of
the Rings' movie, which comes out Dec. 18," said Gene Campbell,
general manager of Epic Enterprises. The business also owns three
other Mavericks health clubs, including one in Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   Anticipating the council's favorable vote, which came Wednesday
night, the company began demolishing the inside of the building
earlier this week, Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of jumped the gun but we were pretty confident," he said.
"So we're actually halfway through demolition already."</TE>
<TE>   Discussions began in April for Mavericks to move into the Los
Angeles Avenue shopping center, which features a variety of
restaurants, retail shops and an Albertson's grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in 1996, Regal's eight-screen theater was expected to be
one of the anchors for Mission Bell Plaza, but low ticket sales
forced it to close in January 2001. The shopping center suffered a
second major blow when discount retailer Kmart closed earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Jo-Anne Sheftel, who owns a home decor shop in Mission Bell Plaza,
was enthusiastic about her new neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last theater owners were overly optimistic with eight
screens, but three should work out great," Sheftel said. "With the
growth going on in the city, this is a real good time to do this. I
know people are thrilled that [Mavericks] is moving in, so hopefully
they will support it."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the former theater to be converted from eight
screens to three and feature stadium seating and digital sound.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the 28,000-square-foot building will be
redesigned into a health club with group exercise rooms, sauna and
steam rooms, locker rooms and a child-care center that can be used by
both club members and moviegoers. Outside, a 5,000-square-foot
children's play area and a 12,000-square-foot pool are also planned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual to have a theater and health club combination, but
we think it will work well," Campbell said. "People can check their
kids in at the child-care center; we'll give them a vibrating beeper
in case there's an emergency and they can go enjoy a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, who said the project will cost $2.5 million to $3
million, is shooting for a March 1 opening for the main part of the
health club, with completion of the outdoor heated swimming pool
slated for 60 days later. Future plans also call for a basketball
court and a sand volleyball court.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark High School athletic director Rob Dearborn said he met
recently with Campbell to discuss using the pool for swim and water
polo team practices and meets. The squads currently use the pool at
Westlake High School.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we can start some kind of negotiations soon," Dearborn
said. "[Campbell] is trying very hard to accommodate us, and to go
from nothing with traveling and paying rent to having a pool right
down the street would be wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the city is still dealing with a lawsuit filed by the
property owners in March after Regal closed down. The suit contended
that a 1995 redevelopment deal forced the city to pay about $30,000 a
month until 2006 or as long as the building remained vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark officials countered that they were exempt from the
obligation because the property owners failed to secure the movie
theater equipment as collateral after it closed.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Hugh Riley said a judgment was issued in
favor of the city on July 12. "We won the case, but it's under appeal
so I can't comment any further on it," Riley said.</TE>

<HD>Joining Forces to Tackle High-Tech Crime</HD>
<DH>An interagency team has been launched in L.A. to fight
electronic offenses and cyber terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside a "clean room" more sterile than a hospital's surgery center,
Jimmy Garcia searches day after day for clues to cyber terrorism and
other electronic crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Operating in the 20-by-20-foot enclosure in downtown Los Angeles,
the senior investigator for the district attorney's office inspects
computers and other high-tech equipment.</LD>
<LD>   All the while, air filters purify the environment, keeping it so
clean that particulates far smaller in diameter than a hair are
removed before they can damage a hard drive and make data retrieval
impossible.</LD>
<TE>   A veteran investigator, Garcia is the first member of the new Los
Angeles Electronic Crimes Task Force created by the U.S. Secret
Service. Charter members also include the Sheriff's Department and
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Patterned after a successful Secret Service operation in New York
City, the Los Angeles task force is one of eight across the nation
launched in recent weeks to help counter the threat of high-tech
crimes. The clean room at the Secret Service's downtown L.A. office
is the only law enforcement facility of its kind on the West Coast</TE>
<TE>   The New York office, the largest operation of its kind in the
world, opened six years ago to investigate high-tech crimes ranging
from money laundering to stock fraud, computer hacking and child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The office was in World Trade Center 7 and was destroyed in the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But, in an indication of its importance, the
New York task force was able to set up shop again in two days, after
receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of donated equipment
and services from computer companies, telecommunications firms and
financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We were knocked down. But we were not knocked out," said the task
force's founder, Bob Weaver, deputy special agent in charge of the
Secret Service's New York office.</TE>
<TE>   "Never before in my experience ... had companies rushed in at a
time of crisis to help a government agency that had been damaged,"
said Richard Clarke, the White House special advisor for cyberspace
security.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the success of the New York unit, federal authorities
launched new task force offices, including the one in Los Angeles,
where hundreds of security analysts and law enforcement officials
gathered in late October to herald the opening.</TE>
<TE>   "This," said Brian Nagel, head of the Secret Service's L.A.
office, "is all about enhancing our current partnerships and building
new ones."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the task force is to guard not only against electronic
crimes but also against cyber terrorism that could endanger
everything from banking institutions to military installations.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Service has assigned half a dozen of its Los Angeles
agents to work with various Southern California police and
prosecutorial agencies. With new offices taking up almost an entire
floor of a 7th Street skyscraper, the task force's ranks are expected
to swell with detectives from the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies, private security experts and academics.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is everyone working together," said agent J.
Keith Helton, a special assistant to Nagel, "because no one can do
this alone."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Helton said, the task force has a simple philosophy:
"Everyone checks their egos at the door." Even the group's logo, of
the downtown skyline, lacks the emblem of any law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   That is more than mere symbolism, said Agent Don Masters, another
special assistant to Nagel and supervisor of the task force. Law
enforcement's ability to prevent cyber terrorism and investigate
electronic crimes hinges on interagency cooperation, he said.
Depending on the crimes uncovered, prosecutions will be conducted by
county or federal attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The importance -- and intricacy -- of such work is hard to
exaggerate, according to law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sheriff Lee Baca, when the task force was launched:
"High-tech investigations require an incredible knowledge. None of us
10 years ago would have ever imagined we would have to take apart
computers ... to prosecute some pretty sophisticated criminals."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Iden, who heads the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said that
last year, 150 million Americans -- and 500 million people worldwide
-- used the Internet. "As we become increasingly reliant on computers
and the Internet," he said, "we become increasingly vulnerable to
criminals, terrorists and foreign enemies who would steal money or
proprietary information, attack a vital infrastructure or engage in
information warfare -- and these crimes can be committed without ever
setting foot on U.S. soil."</TE>
<TE>   He said a recent survey found that 90% of businesses had reported
computer intrusions in the preceding year and that 80% of those
companies had suffered financial losses.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has also seen a significant emerging problem with
electronic identity theft followed by fraud and even extortion. In
one case, Iden said, dozens of "cyber criminals" conspired to steal
data from computers in American businesses, then defrauded the
companies of more than $100 million. Among their uses of the data was
extortion by threatening to release the stolen data on the Internet.
Several arrests have been made in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office has been actively involved in
prosecuting cyber criminals since "the Internet became a household
word," said U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang, chief federal prosecutor in Los
Angeles. Hers is one of 13 U.S. attorney's offices in the nation with
a specialized team of prosecutors, Yang said. This computer crimes
section focuses on Internet fraud, computer intrusions and cyber
terrorism and such offenses against intellectual property as software
piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop the Secret Service is launching the new task
forces in San Francisco; Las Vegas; Chicago; Boston; Miami;
Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte, N.C.; in addition to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to keep our community and nation safe," Nagel said.
"This task force is about sharing information and resources in an
effort to enhance our strengths and minimize our weaknesses against
those who would do us harm."</TE>

<HD>Funds OKd for Palmdale Transit Facility</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anticipating more planes, trains and automobiles in the rapidly
growing Antelope Valley, the California Transportation Commission
approved $2.9 million Thursday toward the construction of a 26-acre
transit center in Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   The Palmdale Transportation Center, scheduled to open in early
2004, will include a new Metrolink station as well as a transfer bay
for local and commuter buses, officials said. The facility, to be
located within two miles of Palmdale Airport, is expected to ease
transit to and from the airfield when it resumes commercial service.</LD>
<LD>   "The combination of air, auto, rail and bus coming together in one
place is critical for the movement of people in this growing
community," said Bill Budlong, executive director of Antelope Valley
Transit Authority.</LD>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley's population of about 300,000 will more than
double in the next 25 years, according to projections by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale, which has more than 100,000 residents, has not had a
Metrolink station since a temporary stop -- opened in the wake of the
1994 Northridge earthquake -- shut down several years ago. The
nearest stations are in Lancaster and Acton, both several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Airport has not had any commercial flights since United
Express discontinued its service there in April 1998, citing a lack
of business. But city officials say they have been working with the
airfield's owner, Los Angeles World Airports, to lure airlines back.</TE>
<TE>   Future plans for the transit center will include a fixed-guideway
tram to the airport, said Leon Swain, deputy director of public works
for Palmdale. The Metrolink stop, along a rail line that runs to
Santa Clarita as well as the San Fernando Valley, will also help draw
passengers from those regions, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the center include bicycle trails and 500 parking
spaces, which city officials anticipate may not be enough. Officials
say they are working on obtaining funding for more parking in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan Ikhrata, director of planning and policy for the
association, said the new transit center will help reduce overall
congestion in the region by making public transportation more
attractive, while promoting commercial development in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The center's total cost will be $7.95 million. About $5.5 million,
including the grant that the commission approved Thursday, will be
provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Other funding
will come from Palmdale and the Antelope Valley Transit Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in the Antelope Valley say such a transit hub is long
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   Nightmarish commuting "is the price one pays for living in that
area," said Lloyd Brown, chairman of the commuter advisory committee
for the Antelope Valley authority.</TE>

<HD>57 Years Later, Hero Gets Medals</HD>
<DH>David M. Gonzales is posthumously awarded eight decorations
at a Veterans Day ceremony in Sylmar. Son accepts the honors.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A mistake made 57 years ago was corrected Thursday when World War II
hero David M. Gonzales was posthumously awarded eight medals and
badges at a Veterans Day program at Los Angeles Mission College in
Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   The Army veteran's son, David V. Gonzales, stood solemnly as Rep.
Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) handed him his father's Bronze
Star medal for service in the Philippines and a Purple Heart medal to
replace the one stolen from the Gonzales' Sylmar home seven years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   He also received a frame containing other awards his late father
earned, but that the family never received: the World War II Victory
Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Expert Rifle Badge, World War II
Honorable Service lapel button, Army Good Conduct Medal, Philippine
Liberation Ribbon and the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two
Bronze Service Stars.</LD>
<TE>   Berman then pinned on the younger Gonzales a Gold Star lapel
button, something the family should have received after Gonzales was
killed on April 25, 1945, as he tried to rescue five comrades after a
bombing in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   "When America no longer produces someone like David M. Gonzales,
America ceases to exist as a beacon of liberty and freedom for the
rest of the world," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a moment to compose himself, David V. Gonzales, 58, told
the gathering of 200, "I wasn't expecting this ... I hope the young
kids here will never forget the thousands and thousands of men who
have fought for our freedom and the men and women who have died for
our freedom."</TE>
<TE>   His father had earlier been posthumously awarded the Purple Heart
and Medal of Honor, the only one given to a Los Angeles County
resident during World War II. Three area facilities also bear his
father's name: a Pacoima park, a county probation camp in Calabasas
and an Army recruiting center in San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   Until Thursday, the family had been unaware Gonzales had earned
the other awards.</TE>
<TE>   The error was uncovered when Berman's office was investigating
another mistake regarding Gonzales. In the late 1990s, veterans'
groups and others had told the Gonzales family that the photograph on
the Pentagon's Hispanic Medal of Honor Recipients display was not
that of Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Flores, a Marine Corps veteran and Berman's director of
communications and community relations, investigated and confirmed
the photo was not of Gonzales. But while checking, Flores realized
that Gonzales' service entitled him to medals that the family had
never received.</TE>
<TE>   "Through my experience helping other vets track down their medals,
I knew that he deserved more," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's program commemorating the service of America's
military, elected officials praised Gonzales for his ultimate
sacrifice. "He was a regular guy with family back home, yet he stood
up in the line of fire to save the lives of people so they could
continue to fight for our freedom," Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
(D-Panorama City) said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, David V. Gonzales' wife, Beatrice, addressed the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband is really speechless and choked up," she said. "We are
so deeply touched and so grateful. This is something we'll cherish
for the rest of our lives."</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists File Lawsuit to Block 'Water Banking'
Plan</HD>
<DH>Critics say program, which would store supplies for times
of drought, will spur more development in Santa Clarita Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming that a new "water banking" system violates state law,
environmentalists have sued to halt a Santa Clarita Valley water
agency's 10-year storage program that they fear will fuel more
development in the fast-growing region and harm the Santa Clara
River.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland-based California Water Network and the local Friends of
the Santa Clara River filed the lawsuit in Ventura County Superior
Court on Monday, saying the Castaic Lake Water Agency failed to
conduct a full environmental review for its plan to store imported
state water at a site in Kern County.</LD>
<LD>   The agency sells water from the California Aqueduct to local users
to help supplement their water supplies.</LD>
<TE>   The plaintiffs contend that a thorough review is necessary to
assess the impact that future development would have on the river,
which courses through Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They believe
the water agency is overstating the amount of state water that would
be available to the Santa Clarita Valley in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   They also charge that the transfer and storage program gives a
false impression that enough water is available to sustain future
growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The storage of this water would be used to support a plan that
under-projects the growth that can be expected, and overestimates the
amount of water provided," said Stephan Volker, an attorney for the
California Water Network. "It's a sharp conflict: There's too much
growth and not enough water."</TE>
<TE>   But water officials say the stored water would only be sufficient
to accommodate existing homes because of the limited 10-year program.
They say the plan was approved in October as an "insurance policy"
against dry years, when the state may curtail the full amount of
aqueduct water the region is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the Castaic Lake Water Agency would direct
the transfer of 24,000 acre-feet of its unused allotment of state
water from the aqueduct to ground water storage facilities in Kern
County. An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, enough water to supply two
average-size families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The agency currently provides water directly or through other
agencies to more than 3,000 customers in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou Cotton, a spokeswoman for the agency, said
environmentalists are using the water storage issue to try to scare
homeowners into supporting anti-growth positions. She said their
actions could lead to a future water shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't get this water stored and there's a dry year next
year, we might have to employ water conservation on the people who
live here now," Cotton said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have been fighting for years to stop or curb a
number of large-scale developments in the Santa Clarita Valley,
including the 21,600-home Newhall Ranch project.</TE>
<TE>   A judge has temporarily blocked that project until the developer
can prove it has sufficient water supplies to support the project
during drought years.</TE>
<TE>   Activists fear that if there isn't enough state water for the new
homes during a statewide drought, local officials will be tempted to
overuse surface and ground water resources from the Santa Clara
River, thereby harming wildlife, the environment and the local
agricultural industry.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the Santa Clara River plan to stage a rally in Santa
Clarita on Saturday to protest the water storage plan.</TE>

<HD>Rainstorm Brings Relief to Parched County</HD>
<DH>Long dry spell ends with up to 1 1/2 inches of moisture
expected by Saturday. Farmers are relieved, but wildfire threat
continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly Wolcott and Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pacific storm delivered Ventura County's first significant rainfall
of the season Thursday, providing relief to farmers and gardeners
after the driest year on record.</LD>
<LD>   Before the storm, which had dropped more than an inch of
precipitation in the mountains above Ojai by 9 p.m., the last
measurable rain had fallen in May. Despite the typical traffic
mishaps that occur during inclement weather, many residents
appreciated a break from the sunshine Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I smelled it in the air when I woke up this morning, and I hope
it doesn't stop for a while," said a smiling Summer Twigg, an Oak
View resident who was walking in downtown Ventura with her 3-year-old
son, Corgan.</LD>
<TE>   Forecasters predict the storm will drop up to 1 1/2 inches of rain
on the county by the time it wanes Saturday afternoon. Temperatures
are expected to range from the low- to mid-50s to the 60s through
Saturday, according to the National Weather Service office in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Though the rain should be light to moderate, the weather service
has issued a surf advisory, warning surfers and coastal homeowners
that waves could reach 8 to 12 feet today and possibly cause flooding
in low-lying areas of west-facing beaches.</TE>
<TE>   As of 9 p.m. Thursday, 0.75 of an inch of rain had fallen in Ojai,
0.5 of an inch in Ventura and Oxnard and 0.25 in Thousand Oaks and
Simi Valley, according to the weather service.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Schaeffer, an agricultural meteorologist who contracts with
local farmers, said the storm is a start in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   If half an inch of rain falls, Schaeffer said, it should allow
growers to put off irrigation for another two weeks. "Most farming
operations will welcome the rain at this point," he said. "This will
settle the dust and knock fire danger back further."</TE>
<TE>   However, Schaeffer expects that this may be the last decent
precipitation until later in the rain season, perhaps until late
December or January.</TE>
<TE>   The slow start for the rain season will likely postpone the
conclusion of this year's fire season, which usually ends about Nov.
15.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help, but until we get 3 or 4 inches it probably won't
make a significant difference," said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the
Ventura County Fire Department. "The hills have been so dry that it
will take a lot for them to recover."</TE>
<TE>   The last time a measurable amount of rain fell in Ventura County
was May 20 and 21, when slightly less than 0.10 of an inch was
recorded, officials said. The last heavy rain was in January.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see the rain again," said Jayme Laber, the county's
senior hydrologist. "It's not a big one but it will help keep the
dust down."</TE>
<TE>   According to Laber, the last rainfall season, which ended Sept.
30, was one of the most dismal on record. For example, only 6.4
inches of rain was recorded at the Ventura County Government Center.
The seasonal average for that location is 16 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Although experts predict that the season's rainfall totals will be
nowhere near the deluge levels reached during the El Nino winter of
1997 and `98, a calmer El Nino already has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   In July, federal climate forecasters declared that El Nino had
officially returned--although in a weakened state. This season's El
Nino, which officials have said is headed toward California, could
mean above-average rainfall and slightly warmer ocean waters.</TE>
<TE>   Rain or no rain, the transitional living facility at Camarillo
Airport always remains full, but director Diana Vogelbaum said the
wet weather had prompted dozens more people to inquire about
openings.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definitely more people calling than usual," said
Vogelbaum, who heads the 5-year-old RAIN Shelter, short for
River-dwellers Aid Innercity Network.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a Simi Valley emergency shelter that stays open from
November through March, the county's homeless will have no beds until
Dec. 1, the official opening day of so-called winter warming
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   With light water drops bouncing off their jerseys and cleats
squishing in the grass, Ventura High School's varsity football team,
the Cougars, held afternoon practice Thursday to prepare for a road
game tonight against Santa Barbara High. "I love the rain," said
Ventura High's athletic director, Phil McCune. "It's like liquid
sunshine."</TE>
<TE>   The night game against the Dons in Santa Barbara will be played in
the rain, regardless of how heavy it might be. Only flooding and
electrical storms stop play, McCune said.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, county drivers didn't slow down for the precipitation.
During a three-hour period Thursday morning when the rain started,
the California Highway Patrol handled nearly 20 crashes--twice the
normal amount for that time of day.</TE>
<TE>   No major injuries were reported, but five incidents involved minor
injuries, CHP Officer Steve Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   "The rainy weather always causes an increase in collisions," said
Reid. Besides fender-benders, another downside to the return of rain
is the resulting storm runoff, which will likely increase bacteria in
water along Ventura County's 42 miles of coast, according to Richard
Hauge, coordinator of the county's ocean water quality monitoring
program.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past few months, we've had really good water quality,"
said Hauge, adding that local beaches will likely be posted as
unclean if more than one-quarter of an inch of rain falls this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   People are warned to avoid contact with runoff for 72 hours
following a storm in order to protect themselves against illnesses
including eye and skin irritation; ear, nose and throat problems;
rashes; nausea; vomiting; gastrointestinal upset; and respiratory
difficulty.</TE>

<HD>This Time, It's a Whole New Fight</HD>
<DH>Sophisticated aircraft would be the decisive force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edward N. Luttwak</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council seems poised to come to an agreement on
weapons inspections in Iraq that the Bush administration is willing
to accept.</LD>
<LD>   That should rule out war, yet war is still possible -- even
probable -- because Saddam Hussein has previously thrown away
opportunities to avoid disaster, and he will probably do so again.</LD>
<LD>   He may, for example, have misinterpreted the prolonged Security
Council debate, seeing it as evidence of a lack of determination on
the part of the Bush administration, instead of what it was: an
obligatory pause before the U.S. elections, during which the French
and Russians enjoyed the illusion of Great Power equality by
resisting the United States.</LD>
<TE>   War will be avoided only in the unlikely event that Hussein allows
inspectors to operate freely.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing is certain: If there is a war, it will not resemble
the Gulf War of 1991.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no ponderous accumulation of forces over many
months. There is no intention of fighting set-piece battles to reach
Baghdad step by step. A large army, with about half a million troops
as in 1991, would of course require the use of Saudi entry ports and
military bases, which the Saudi rulers keep saying they will not
offer and which the U.S. no longer even seeks to use.</TE>
<TE>   Last time, the very purpose of the buildup was to defend Saudi
Arabia as well as to expel the Iraqis from Kuwait. This time a war
would be fought in the full knowledge that it might undermine the
Saudi ruling family, once viewed by President Bush senior as the
guarantor of stability but now considered by his son as the financier
of Islamist extremism all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   What has changed since 1991 is the envisaged role of air power.
Instead of merely preparing the battlefield for an essentially
conventional war, it is to be the decisive instrument of victory, not
alone but in combination with agile ground forces of two kinds.</TE>
<TE>   One would be conventional, with tanks, armored combat carriers and
self-propelled artillery, just as in 1991. But it would be a much
smaller force, with two or at most three divisions and a British
brigade, about 60,000 combat troops in all. Their mission would be to
drive straight up the road from Kuwait to Baghdad, destroying any
blocking forces in their path.</TE>
<TE>   No serious analyst takes seriously Hussein's threat of defending
the Iraqi capital street by street and house by house. For one thing,
there are now at least 1.5 million Kurds and Turkomans and well over
1 million Shiites in Baghdad, many of whom have lost family members
to Hussein's bloody campaigns of repression. The Sunni Arabs too have
suffered under a most brutal regime.</TE>
<TE>   Once U.S. and British forces arrive on the edge of the city, the
people of Baghdad are far more likely to turn against their
oppressors than to fight the troops who would free them at last. The
most likely scenario would be an explosive uprising, with man-hunts
for Baath Party activists and secret police and mobs converging on
the palaces and headquarters of the regime to besiege Hussein's
beleaguered palace guards, clansmen and inner-core security units.</TE>
<TE>   The second U.S.-British force would be needed to patrol and secure
urban areas. For that and to ensure against the unlikely event of
serious combat on the edges of Baghdad, as many as 25,000 troops
would be airlifted into the desert to the west of the city, ready to
converge with the armored columns driving up from the south. Both
forces, along with their operational headquarters and land-based air
support, would operate from bases that are definitely available and
indeed already in use in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman and the island of Diego Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The key, of course, is the advance of air power since 1991. Then,
only a fraction of the combat aircraft involved -- fewer than 150 out
of 2,000 -- could routinely deliver precision weapons. Today, all are
equipped for precision bombardment and should thus be able to destroy
seven times as many targets each day and night with a much smaller
force of land-based and sea-based fighter-bombers as well as a few
B-2 bombers flying from Diego Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons for opposing a war against Hussein. But the
notion that it would be reckless and full of military risks is not
supported by the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   No war is easy and no war is exempt from uncertainty, but a swift
victory is the much more likely outcome, leaving the U.S. and the
world with the new problems of a post-Hussein Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Follow WWII's Torch Into Iraq</HD>
<DH>Allied invasion of North Africa 60 years ago resonates
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Satloff</AU>
<BD>Robert Satloff is the director of policy and strategic
planning at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the chance of war with Iraq grows, we should pause today to recall
the 60th anniversary of Operation Torch, the American-British
invasion of North Africa during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Torch, the momentum began to swing against Nazi Germany,
an evil regime that used what we now call "weapons of mass
destruction" to kill millions.</LD>
<LD>   Three lessons from Torch have special resonance today:</LD>
<TE>   * We need clear war aims, which Washington and London lacked in
November 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Torch's military victory, the Allies opted against
demanding surrender from Vichy France. Instead, they allowed the
regime to keep control of North Africa as long as Allied troops were
permitted free movement through the region.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents contended that this deal hastened the war's end. Yet it
also gave Vichy license to increase the persecution of Jews, even
after "liberation." Not until the summer of 1943 were all Jews
finally freed from Vichy slave labor camps in North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The Allies, however, learned their lesson. Two months after Torch,
President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for
the first time decreed their war aim to be "unconditional surrender."</TE>
<TE>   In any war with Iraq, an opportunity to negotiate is likely to
emerge, perhaps with a high-ranking Iraqi general or maybe a cousin
from a marginally less bloodthirsty branch of Saddam Hussein's
family. He will promise stability, forswear aggression, promise to
respect any future Israeli-Palestinian peace and commit to weapons
inspections. And he will hint broadly at pumping lots and lots of
oil.</TE>
<TE>   For many, this would be as good as it could possibly get.</TE>
<TE>   Yet just as Roosevelt and Churchill eventually opted for clarity
over expediency, so too must we fight the urge for a simple solution
to today's Iraq problem. While such a deal might provide a smooth
"exit strategy" for U.S. troops, it would almost surely come back to
haunt us and might even necessitate another foray into Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Without the full removal of Hussein's clique and his party, we
will have bought merely time, not peace or security.</TE>
<TE>   * A small band of partisans can contribute much.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, on the evening before the Allies' arrival, 377 members of
the Algerian underground, more than 300 of them Jews, spread out
across Algiers in one of the war's greatest exploits in sabotage.
Armed only with knives, hunting rifles and World War I relics, they
cut phone lines, intercepted telegraph messages and even forcibly
detained senior Vichy commanders to ease the entry of Allied troops.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to their courage and cunning, many American and British
lives were saved. In cruel irony, many leaders of the Jewish
underground were soon imprisoned by Vichy, with little protest from
their Allied "liberators."</TE>
<TE>   In today's Iraq debate, many experts disparage the possible
contribution that opposition forces could make to the war effort.
This view is often offered by alumni of past ignoble episodes of U.S.
failure to keep promises to anti-Hussein Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   These analysts fail to take into account the connection between
U.S. resolve and the opposition's prowess.</TE>
<TE>   In Torch, when the Algerian resistance learned that the Allies
were truly committed to the battle against Vichy, they performed
remarkable deeds of heroism.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, resistance fighters exude skepticism because they have no
confidence in Washington's resolve. Convince them that the U.S. will
fight a war to end Hussein's regime and they too might perform
remarkable deeds.</TE>
<TE>   * We must remember to fight for people, not just interests.</TE>
<TE>   One week after the Torch landings, when it was apparent that
Washington was doing nothing to ease Vichy's persecution of local
Jews, a number of U.S. Jewish soldiers organized an ad hoc protest
group and called on Roosevelt's personal envoy in Algiers to ask why
the U.S. government wasn't helping the Jews. They were rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   How brave those soldiers were. This was 1942, after all, just days
after the first American shots against an enemy heretofore thought
invincible and on behalf of coreligionists who spoke a different
language and followed different customs.</TE>
<TE>   Let us honor the memory of the Algiers protesters by resolving
that brave American Muslim soldiers never have cause to ask why we
failed to translate victory over Iraq into a victory for the people
of Iraq.</TE>

<HD>In Ashes of Secession Bid, New Clout for Valley</HD>
<DH>With the status quo jolted, a way toward change has been
opened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Raphael J. Sonenshein</AU>
<BD>Raphael J. Sonenshein, a political scientist at Cal
State Fullerton and the 2001-2002 Haynes Foundation Fellow, was the
executive director of the L.A. Appointed Charter Reform Commission.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the defeat of secession in Tuesday's election, some will say
that the Valley secession movement failed. But movements fail only
when they make no impact. By that standard, the Valley secession
movement has been a success.</LD>
<LD>   It has shaken the comfortable certitude of Los Angeles city
government to its roots. It has set off the most explosive period of
self-criticism and reform in Los Angeles government since the
Progressive era of the 1920s.</LD>
<LD>   Shocked by the challenge of secession, city leaders initiated a
process of charter reform in 1997 that led to the first comprehensive
revision of the charter since 1925.</LD>
<TE>   Charter reform created neighborhood councils and area planning
commissions, innovations that pushed Los Angeles to the forefront of
urban reform. The new charter established an advisory citizens
commission on redistricting that led the City Council to realign
council seats to augment Valley influence and to move one seat from
the Westside to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists may choose to go back to the drawing board and
design a new campaign. Alternatively, Valley residents can take a
riskier path: Reexamine the assumption that the Valley does not have
power within the city of Los Angeles. This would be a difficult axiom
to give up because the powerlessness of the Valley is central to the
secession argument.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Republicans decline as a share of voters citywide, and
while the Valley now has a Democratic voting majority, the Valley
still offers a major bloc of moderate voters that is critical in city
elections.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley, with more than 40% of the city's registered voters,
was pivotal to the elections of Richard Riordan and James K. Hahn in
their mayoral contests. Latinos in the East Valley represent the
fastest-growing population in the city. Jewish residents in the
southern portion of the Valley, though largely Democratic, are more
ideologically moderate than Westside Jewish voters. The West Valley
continues to be a highly mobilized base for Los Angeles conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley now takes stock of its own power and uses it to get
community improvements through the political process and through the
reformed structures that the secession movement helped create -- and
pushes for additional structural reforms -- its effect will be
profound.</TE>
<TE>   But first, Valley residents must develop their agenda. What sort
of community or communities would be most desirable? How would the
balance between growth and slow-growth be drawn? What sort of
commercial development is wanted, and where?</TE>
<TE>   Raising these issues will undoubtedly accentuate divisions within
the Valley, including those between more affluent areas and the
growing and upwardly mobile Latino community in the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Out of such a discussion, however, a coherent set of demands may
well emerge, even if they are not identical in each part of the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As Valley residents give voice to their specific demands, they
will find that the same politicians who opposed secession can be
formidable allies at moving the government.</TE>
<TE>   The example of Staten Island in New York may be helpful. In 1993,
Staten Island voters passed an advisory secession measure with more
than 65% of the vote on the island. But then Staten Islanders used
their voting power to resolve their most contentious demands. The
political process worked and secession sentiment declined.</TE>
<TE>   The most important element of Valley power will be coalition
building. Secession could not win without alliances over the hill;
neither can Valley power succeed without coalitions.</TE>
<TE>   A lesson can be drawn from L.A. history. African Americans, only
18% of the population in 1970, united around an agenda of social
change and forged alliances with white liberals, particularly Jews,
to achieve much of it. In so doing, they made Los Angeles a better
city by opening it up to the diversity of its population.</TE>
<TE>   A Valley movement, disciplined by politics, can continue the work
of opening Los Angeles to its diversity of place.</TE>

<HD>State Republicans See Light in 2006</HD>
<DH>Despite losses, slim margins bolster hopes of California
GOP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shawn Steel</AU>
<BD>Shawn Steel is chairman of the California Republican
Party.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the midterm election was a national triumph for the Republican
Party, in California it played out as a tragedy. Bill Simon lost the
opportunity to defeat one of the most unpopular governors in state
history, and the Democrats swept all statewide offices (except in the
still too-close-to-call controller's race).</LD>
<LD>   It's important to put the results in perspective. The massive
Democratic campaign war chests in California dwarfed those of their
Republican opponents. Only the Simon campaign amassed a significant
treasury to sustain an effective TV campaign in the final weeks.
Consequently, voters were drenched with Democrat ads but just lightly
spritzed with Republican spots.</LD>
<LD>   Given that disparity, the narrowness of the Democrat margin in
most of the statewide partisan races is astonishing. Only Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer broke 50%.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis himself can take cold comfort from his win. His
$70-million campaign netted him just 47% of the vote -- less than he
received in 1998 and only five points ahead of Simon. Further, he
remains deeply unpopular, a termed-out lame duck who faces a hostile
Democratic Legislature and statewide officials with no loyalty to
him.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Democratic sweep occurred primarily because of the
fund-raising advantage, not the fantasy advanced by liberal pundits
that California has morphed into a Democratic bastion. It's also
worth noting that, despite being massively outspent, Republicans
gained a state Senate seat and two Assembly seats, and they may yet
pick up a third.</TE>
<TE>   The usual suspects in the media and the Republican Party are
resuscitating an equally false notion that Simon lost because he was
"too conservative" for California. It's a variation on the canard
that the Republican Party must move left to be viable in California
-- a nostrum dispelled by looking at the election results.</TE>
<TE>   For example, take the fates of Bruce McPherson and Tom McClintock,
the most liberal and most conservative members, respectively, of the
GOP ticket. McPherson perfectly fits the theoretical profile of the
ideal GOP statewide candidate: pro-choice, strong moderate
credentials, fawning press coverage, a comparably well-funded
campaign and a compelling personal story. Yet he lost to gaffe-prone
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante by nine points. In stark contrast, the
conservative McClintock, the GOP's nominee for controller, received
more votes than any other statewide Republican candidate -- and may
yet eke out a victory despite having been vastly outspent by the
multimillionaire entrepreneur Steve Westly, whose ads attacking
McClintock's pro-life stance had little effect.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have reason to be hopeful. The relatively strong
showing by GOP candidates will lead President Bush to vigorously
contest California, and the surprising GOP gains in Congress are a
testament to his campaign prowess. Several U.S. representatives who
would make attractive candidates are seriously considering
challenging U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in her bid for a third term in
2004, and an active Bush campaign would be a huge boost to whoever
wins the nomination. Beyond that, 2006 offers the prospect of the
governorship and half the constitutional offices opening up because
of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Republicans must mount a credible ground game if
they are to prevail. While the Democrats deploy an army of thousands
of paid workers every election, Republicans respond with just a few
platoons. Fielding a comparable force would be very expensive, but
the price is well worth the extra three to five points in the polls
it would produce.</TE>
<TE>   Four years is a long time in politics. California Democrats were
prostrate in 1994 and triumphant in 1998. The pendulum can easily
swing back in the GOP's direction, especially with a popular
president giving it a push.</TE>

now says it has no plans to release the statement at all. What an
unwise step by church leaders who have been promising a new era of
openness.</LD>
<LD>   Normally, the archdiocese discloses its finances each March in its
weekly newspaper, the Tidings. But "rapidly changing financial
conditions" and the sexual abuse crisis made the financial report
"not relevant to current conditions," church officials said in a
statement released Sunday. On the contrary, it has never been more
important for the archdiocese to be frank with its parishioners --
the people who keep the money flowing into its treasury. Molestations
and recent budget cutbacks have shaken people's confidence. Several
priests confronted Cardinal Roger M. Mahony with allegations that
expenses for cathedral luxuries were the reason behind the
elimination and retrenchment of several ministries that serve the
poor. Church officials deny it, but they're not coming out with the
full numbers. Nor are they releasing information on their legal
expenses for sex abuse claims.</LD>
<TE>   The 5 million Catholics in the L.A. Archdiocese have a right to
know what's happening with their donations. And everyone else has a
right to be curious about how this huge, troubled, usually generous
institution that just plopped a cathedral in downtown L.A. is doing
on the money front.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese says its staff has been so busy working on the
cathedral opening and the molestation crisis that it had no time to
publish the 2000-2001 figures. Yet church officials presented the
report at five meetings of pastors in January and February. How much
more work could it have been to write it up for public viewing?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, church leaders plan to include some comparison figures
from that year in their report for fiscal 2001-2002. It should be
available in a few months, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Contrast that with the Diocese of Orange, which has released the
full figures for both years. Yes, the diocese is one-fifth the size
and can move faster, but just like the archdiocese, it has been
reeling from molestation suits and two years of stock market losses.
The diocese is delaying a fund-raising campaign for its own cathedral
in an attempt to avoid draconian cuts in programs. Some people
disagree with how the diocese has used its money, but at least
they've been given the figures to arrive at informed opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Back in June, Francis J. Butler, president of a coalition of
foundations that give to Catholic causes, called for "clear and
transparent financial reporting" by the Roman Catholic Church
nationwide. Otherwise, he said, donors will wonder whether their
contributions are going toward the intended church work. The Los
Angeles Archdiocese shouldn't give donors more reason to wonder.</TE>

<LD>Since it's the threat of obscurantism we're hoping to thwart, let's
be blunt: The Bush administration's plan to strip the Government
Printing Office's authority is a threat to democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels wants to
transfer control of information management from the printing office
to individual Cabinet agencies. That would spell the end of the
current system, in place since the Jeffersonian era, which requires
executive branch agencies to send their documents and reports to
neutral librarians, who then make them available to the public both
online and in 1,300 public reading rooms nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Daniels would replace that system with a more secretive one in
which individual agencies would manage -- and possibly sanitize --
their own electronic databases.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, a federal agency such as the Pentagon can't delete an
embarrassing passage from a historical document without first going
through the hassle of asking each reading room to obscure the passage
with a black marker.</TE>
<TE>   If Daniels gets his way, all an agency will have to do is call up
the document in Microsoft Word and quietly hit Control X to delete
the passage for eternity.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels says he's only trying to save taxpayer money. Giving
Cabinet-level agencies the ability to select printing services on the
basis of "quality, cost and time of delivery," he wrote, could save
up to $70 million a year. That's a dubious claim, however, because
the printing office already sends nearly two-thirds of its work to
the private contractor with the lowest bid.</TE>
<TE>   As library experts have recently pointed out, privatization might
or might not save money, but it certainly would diminish the public's
access to information needed to make informed decisions.</TE>
<TE>   As Barbara Quint, Information Today's usually dispassionate
columnist, fumed in September, Daniel's current push "threatens to
gut federal document dissemination -- and fast."</TE>
<TE>   In his 1644 pamphlet "Areopagitica," the English poet John Milton
(reacting to how the Catholic Church had arrested and silenced
Galileo simply because the astronomer's views on the universe
conflicted with its doctrines) warned that citizens who didn't know
what their government was doing couldn't hold it accountable.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 18th century the words of an American lawyer, Patrick
Henry, helped persuade Congress to pass legislation protecting the
public's right to know. "The liberties of a people never were, nor
ever will be, secure," Henry said, "when the transactions of their
rulers may be concealed from them."</TE>
<TE>   In deciding whether to keep the library system that works to keep
executive branch agencies honest, Congress has a choice: trust the
upstarts in the Bush administration or heed the wisdom that has
guided the country for more than two centuries.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles voters have given local school planners one last chance
to prove they aren't incompetent. With passage Tuesday of statewide
Proposition 47 and local Measure K, Los Angeles Unified School
District officials will be able to get their hands on billions of
dollars to build new schools and upgrade old ones.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the board got hold of so much construction money was
1997, when voters passed the $2.4-billion Proposition BB. As every
student dodging spitballs in a classroom stuffed with 40 other kids
can attest, district bureaucrats flubbed that windfall badly --
wasting money, tolerating delays and resisting the oversight that
bond drafters tried to impose. This time district officials have no
choice but to spend every penny as if it's the last one they'll have
-- for it may well be.</LD>
<LD>   Take hope, kids. After the worst of the Proposition BB bungling
came to light, the school board hired a new superintendent, Roy
Romer, who brought in a team of hard-knuckled construction managers
-- folks who should have been on the job years ago. They review each
project monthly, unkinking paperwork bottlenecks and dogging
contractors who swore they'd have the drywall up by last week.</LD>
<TE>   Before Measure K passed, the district had 80 new schools going,
among the last of the BB projects. Five of those 80 have already
opened their doors -- a good sign.</TE>
<TE>   Measure K adds more than $3.3 billion to build as many as 120 more
schools and fix up 79 others. Proposition 47, worth $13 billion, has
a large pot set aside with the LAUSD's name on it.</TE>
<TE>   Gambling that both would pass, district officials bought up
hundreds of acres, much of the land in dense urban neighborhoods
where children scramble for a seat in the classroom or ride a bus to
a slightly less crowded school. So far, the district's bet looks like
a smart one -- and a bold departure from its past fear of angering
residents by forcing them to sell their homes or by building a school
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   After years of kissing off one bond measure after the next, voters
in Los Angeles and other districts are now ponying up big bucks to
build better schools. Measures similar to K, requiring 55% approval,
passed in Norwalk, Hermosa Beach, Downey and elsewhere -- though
Santa Monica's fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote
required there. Even many voters without children and those whose
kids have graduated apparently recognize that communities cannot long
prosper without strong schools. In return for that generosity, school
officials -- particularly those in Los Angeles -- have to deliver. No
delays, no bungling, no excuses.</TE>

<LD>A longtime annoyance reached critical mass the other night when three
times in that one evening I heard intelligent people on PBS declare
that something actually happened when, in fact, it hadn't. One man
proclaimed, "I was literally blown away" by some news. Unless that
news reached him during a tornado, I'm willing to bet he maintained
his balance.</LD>
<LD>   A historian stated that Thomas Jefferson was "literally swept
away" by a woman in Paris. Unless that charmer was wielding a broom,
Jefferson stayed put. Finally, a man who had not been on a polar
expedition announced that he was "literally frozen with fear."</LD>
<LD>   If these people had omitted the word "literally," they would have
been speaking figuratively, metaphorically. By adding that word, they
are negating its meaning. Don't even get me started on "notorious"
versus "famous."</LD>

<LD>   Why bother with a trial? The thought of doing time for your crime
is suppose to be a deterrent to crime. But that is only the case if
jail time is applied. Granted, three years (the max) sounds like a

<LD>In "One Less Thing to Fret Over" (editorial, Nov. 4), you point out
the continuing dissemination of that Internet urban-legend e-mail
that continues to spread the ridiculous fear that deodorant and
antiperspirant use causes cancer. This is just one of thousands of
examples of Internet misinformation. The Internet is full of these
apocryphal myths and untruths. They are continually passed on by
well-intentioned folks who are themselves probably interested in
truth but who neglect to use any of the easily accessed sources to
verify or discount these stories before they pass them on themselves.</LD>
<LD>   There are three Web sites that can easily be used for verifying
stories: www.truthorfiction .com, www.snopes2.com or www
.hoaxbusters.org. Each of these sites provides search engines that
are easy to use. Entering a couple of key words from the e-mail in
question will usually bring up all the information one needs to
determine whether there is any truth in the story and whether it
should be passed on or trashed. If everyone out there simply took the
three or four minutes required to check out these things before
passing them on, the Internet might actually become the reliable
source of information that it could be -- instead of the quagmire of
lies and misinformation that it is today.</LD>

<LD>"A Diet for Ailing Airlines" (editorial, Nov. 4) and "Uncertainty
Shadows Starlight" (Nov. 3) both ignore the fact that subsidies have
been a major part of transportation in the U.S. for most of our
history. They are nothing new and are necessary in many cases to
ensure needed service to the public.</LD>
<LD>   A leading airline publication recently characterized its industry
as one of the worst investments in the history of U.S.
transportation. The picture would be even more dismal if the carriers
had to pay (like railroads) the real infrastructure costs of their
operating environment (airports, air traffic control systems, etc.).
Indeed, the airlines' current financial crunch is worsened by
security costs, something they now want the government to pay for.</LD>
<LD>   As for Amtrak's Coast Starlight -- explain why it is booked to
capacity much of the year, the huge numbers of people who ride it and
the fact that it serves many communities that are not privileged to
low end-to-end airfares. The Starlight, by the way, does not serve
Monterey.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial mentioned that airlines should shed excess cost
before being granted a government bailout. You suggested that using
bankruptcy to knock well-paid pilots into a lower tax bracket might
make some envious souls feel better.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder how those "envious souls" would feel if they knew United
Airlines' new CEO, Glenn Tilton, is receiving a $3-million bonus. In
these days of a bad economy and millions of layoffs, it seems
excessive for any company, and especially one that is facing
bankruptcy, to be awarding its CEO a $3-million bonus.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Egypt, a Bastion of Learning Rises From the Ashes of History,"
Nov. 5: President Hosni Mubarak is quoted as saying that rebuilding
the new Alexandria library is "a call to terminate violence, tension
and all sorts of terrorism." This is hypocritical in view of the
presentation during Ramadan of the TV miniseries based on the
fraudulent "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," showing that Jews
are in a conspiracy to take over the world. This is being done at a
time when most Egyptians will be home, which will garner a huge
audience for this spurious presentation and will promote more
anti-Semitism. Programming of this kind is only on the air with the
authorization of the government. And this is a government that
receives billions from the U.S., even though it also promotes
anti-Americanism.</LD>

<LD>African American leaders called on new LAPD Chief William J. Bratton
on Thursday to appoint black commanders to high-ranking positions to
ensure that the department does not "go backwards" in efforts to
diversify, said Los Angeles Urban League President John Mack.</LD>
<LD>   None of the members of the new chief's transition team are African
American, and two of the department's highest-ranking black officers,
Deputy Chief Willie L. Pannell and Assistant Chief Julius Isaac
Davis, have said they will retire.</LD>
<LD>   After meeting with Urban League members Thursday, Bratton made no
specific pledge but said that "an appreciation of diversity" would
factor into his selections.</LD>

<HD>Schwarzenegger- Carona: GOP's Dream Ticket?</HD>
<DH>While the actor hasn't declared himself for '06, the Orange
County sheriff is being talked up as a candidate for lieutenant
governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Orange County Republicans gathered on election night in the
festooned ballroom of an Irvine hotel, arguably the most popular face
of the local GOP wasn't there.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Mike Carona opted to spend the evening at a Boyle Heights
gym, where he joined actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in celebrating the
passage of Proposition 49, a statewide funding plan for after-school
programs.</LD>
<LD>   It could prove to be a prescient pairing. As Republicans
contemplate the prospect of Schwarzenegger seeking the governorship
of California in 2006, Carona's name is increasingly being invoked as
the leading GOP candidate for lieutenant governor.</LD>
<TE>   Such a ticket would match the movie action hero with the lawman
that CNN's Larry King crowned a "genuine American hero" for his
handling of the Samantha Runnion kidnap-murder case last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised to see [Carona] on the statewide ballot
in four years," said Rob Stutsman, spokesman for the state party. "He
has the type of persona that the Republican Party needs to help
communicate with modern voters, particularly women. He's the
antithesis of the angry white male that dogged the party's image in
the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, who hasn't declared whether he will run, worked
with Carona during the Proposition 49 campaign and the two appeared
together in TV ads supporting the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has failed to produce a winning statewide candidate
for nearly three decades, and some experts say Carona faces an uphill
battle. While he might run as a team with Schwarzenegger, California
elects its governor and lieutenant governor separately.</TE>
<TE>   Carona is mum about plans for higher office, but supporters are
quick to offer why he would be a perfect candidate: He is a
conservative who works well with Democrats; he is a law-and-order man
who believes rehabilitation works better than jail for criminal
addicts; and he drew praise from as high as President Bush on the
Runnion case.</TE>
<TE>   Carona, who was attending a conference Thursday and couldn't be
reached for comment, was little-known outside Orange County until he
took to the national airwaves for a tense week this summer after the
5-year-old Stanton girl was kidnapped. He won high marks for his
direct appeals to the public and was a frequent guest on network news
shows.</TE>
<TE>   That exposure translated into clout in Tuesday's election.</TE>
<TE>   No other local Republican this year delivered as much endorsement
wattage, said Allan Hoffenblum, who produces one of the state's most
popular GOP slate cards.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most of those talking are quick to offer that four years is
a long way away. And even some of the first boosters for
Schwarzenegger's prospects aren't endorsing anyone outright yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's got a lot of appeal, [and] Arnold's got a lot of appeal
too," said Larry Higby, head of Republicans for a New Majority, an
Orange County group trying to broaden the party's appeal in
California.</TE>
<TE>   "[Carona] believes in broadening the party, in inclusiveness and
in reaching out to the community," said Higby, president of Apria
Health Care in Costa Mesa. "Without efforts like that, it's going to
be difficult for any Republican to be elected."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Democratic activist Wylie Aitken said Carona would have
the same problem that anyone running from Orange County has faced
when seeking a statewide office: The image as a conservative bastion.</TE>
<TE>   While that might help in the primary, local nominees have been
repeatedly passed over by voters in general elections.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an image of Orange County that tends to be an anchor on
both Democrats and Republicans," Aitken said. "Neither gets a boost
from the famous 10% [of undeclared voters] that decides elections.
Certainly Mike has the ability to transcend that."</TE>

Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona incorrectly described Larry Higby
as president of Apria Health Care in Costa Mesa. He's chief executive
of Apria Healthcare Group Inc. in Lake Forest. The story also

Department of Education also is not aggressive enough in pushing
school districts to check on charters, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, the state may have allowed school districts to
charge the government twice for overseeing charters, an allegation
the districts deny.</LD>
<TE>   School districts receive up to 3% of charters' state funding as a
fee for administrative oversight and facility use. But the audit
found that the four school districts were reimbursed for charter
oversight costs under a separate state program.</TE>
<TE>   The districts said they only seek reimbursement for excess
oversight costs that are not covered by their percentage fees.</TE>
<TE>   "Oversight at all levels could be stronger to ensure charter
schools' accountability," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Charters are public schools that receive taxpayer money but, to
encourage innovation, are free from some regulations. California has
more than 400 such schools, serving about 166,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   All four districts reacted with unusual bitterness, in written
critiques so detailed they took up half of the final report. San
Diego, a district that has been praised by top state officials for
setting high standards for charter schools, termed the report
"fundamentally flawed" because it misunderstood the very independent
nature of charters.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obvious that the goals of the audit were intended to
support preconceived notions rather than to objectively discover how
well districts oversaw charter schools," wrote Grace Arnold, who
handles charter school issues for L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   The report comes down firmly on the side of teachers unions and
charter critics in recommending more regulation of charter schools.
Citing the report, Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno), who
sponsored a new law restricting charters' locations, called Thursday
for oversight hearings and new legislation next year.</TE>
<TE>   But the state's charter school operators say that three major
reform bills passed over the last four years are already robbing the
movement of its essential appeal -- freedom.</TE>
<TE>   David Patterson, director of governmental relations for the
California Network of Educational Charters, which represents about
70% of the state's charters, pointed out that the report was limited
to four districts and documented no serious problems in schools
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a need for new legislation," he said, "this report
does not warrant [it]."</TE>

<LD>A Corona police officer was shot three times by a wanted felon in an
alley Thursday night and was undergoing surgery at Riverside
Community Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The officer exchanged fire with the man, who also was hit and
hospitalized. The attacker, whose name wasn't released, was
identified only as a parolee. He was undergoing surgery at another
hospital. Neither man's condition was known, but Sgt. Jerry Rodriguez
said of his colleague, "It sounds like he's going to make it."</LD>
<LD>   The attack occurred at 7:47 p.m. behind a commercial building and
apartment complex. The officer and his partner had gone to the block
on a tip that the felon, wanted for a weapons violation, was in the
area. As they approached the man to make an arrest near 6th and Smith
streets, shots were fired, police said, and the officer was hit twice
in the abdomen and once in the shoulder.</LD>

<HD>Millions Feel the Sting of Hunger</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Cardenas, a 68-year-old veteran of the Korean War, lives on
Social Security and a small military pension. But the Venice resident
cannot afford to buy meat and fresh vegetables to feed himself.</LD>
<LD>   Ethel Selvester, a 78-year-old former nun, social worker and
attorney, was able to pay for meals only by falling three months
behind in her rent.</LD>
<LD>   They are among the 2.2 million low- to middle-income adults in
California who struggle to keep food on the table, according to a new
statewide study released this week by UCLA and the nonprofit
California Food Policy Advocates.</LD>
<TE>   According to the study, more than 28% of low-income residents say
they cannot afford a nutritious diet and a third of them experience
actual pangs of hunger. Despite its wealth, California ranked 12th
among the states in measures of the worst food insecurity, according
to a separate study using U.S. Agriculture Department data.</TE>
<TE>   Selvester never dreamed she would wind up so poor that she'd have
to worry about having enough to eat in her old age. An articulate
woman who enrolled in law school at the age of 46, she worked for
social causes and later did bankruptcy cases but was self-employed
without a pension.</TE>
<TE>   She now lives on $770 monthly in Social Security payments and
disability benefits for health problems. She gets a bag of free
groceries each week from a food pantry at St. Joseph Center in
Venice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made the difference between a decent meal," Selvester said.
"I've been able to have meat and chicken and a balanced diet."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the poorest Californians who are hurting: More than
half of adults who lacked sufficient food had jobs; 14% were retired
elderly people on fixed incomes; 42% were low-income single adults
with children; and 29% were low-income pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   Food insecurity is highest in the Central Valley, one of the most
abundant agricultural regions in the world, the study found.
Forty-one percent of low-income adults in Tulare County and nearly
36% of such adults in Fresno County reported they lacked sufficient
food.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, more than 30% of low-income adults --
representing an estimated 777,000 people -- lack enough food or
experience actual hunger.</TE>
<TE>   Rural Northern California counties such as Shasta (35%), Napa
(31%) and Solano (30%) also reported high levels of food need.</TE>
<TE>   George Manalo-LeClair, director of legislation and policy for Food
Policy Advocates and a co-author of the study, said the report "gives
us a good picture of hunger, particularly of local hunger, and shows
that it exists in every community in California."</TE>
<TE>   The study is the largest statewide examination of hunger ever
performed, its authors say, and was conducted as part of UCLA's
California health interview survey. More than 55,000 adults drawn
from every county were randomly telephoned and interviewed between
November 2000 and September 2001. The data were derived from
households with incomes below 200% of the poverty level, which would
be about $17,720 for one person or $36,200 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   The study cites the link between hunger, heightened susceptibility
to disease and related societal costs of medical and mental health
care.</TE>
<TE>   Children living in households without sufficient food, for
example, tend to experience more school absences, suspensions and
poor mental development. Adolescents in those households have higher
rates of depression and are twice as likely to have seen a
psychiatrist, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences are way beyond our conception of people going
hungry, to encompass such things as the social functioning of
children and medical costs," said study co-author Gail G. Harrison, a
UCLA professor in the School of Public Health. She spoke this week at
a Santa Monica conference sponsored by the nonprofit group Mazon,
where the study was released.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also uncovered wide disparities in the use of federal
food assistance programs. Among study participants who experienced
hunger, more than 80% do not receive food stamps, even though they
are eligible by earning below 130% of the federal poverty level.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates have long complained that the process of applying for
food stamps -- which provide recipients with an average of $78
monthly worth of food supplies -- is too complicated and discourages
many.</TE>
<TE>   There is a huge economic impact. According to Food Policy
Advocates, increasing the rate of food stamp participation in Los
Angeles County from the current 45% of those eligible to 83% would
generate an additional $38 million in monthly food benefits.</TE>
<TE>   California's program has been particularly error-prone and state
auditors are examining the requirement that applicants be
finger-imaged to determine its cost-effectiveness. Additionally, many
people do not realize that their families are eligible for food
stamps or cannot take time off from work to complete the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   The latter is a particular hindrance for seasonal workers in rural
counties because of the nature of their jobs and the long distances
they often must travel to get to government offices, said Mandy
Mahaney, communications director for FoodLink, a Tulare County food
bank.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't work, they don't get a paycheck, and if they need
to take time off to go to the food stamp office, to do monthly
reporting or to do an interview, they risk losing money," Mahaney
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Wagstaff, deputy director of California's welfare-to-work
division, acknowledged low food stamp usage is a serious issue. He
said the state is working to reduce the paperwork required and
improve outreach efforts. He said enrollment of eligible residents
this year and next is projected to rise by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "The UCLA data is based on 2001 figures, and a lot things have
happened since then," Wagstaff said.</TE>
<TE>   But for people like Selvester and Cardenas, who do not qualify for
food stamps, securing their next meal remains a primary concern.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas receives $950 each month, but half of the money goes for
rent on the one-bedroom apartment he shares with another man. Before
finding his current home, he spent more than a year in homeless
shelters, where the meals were free.</TE>
<TE>   Like Selvester, he gets a free bag of food each week at St.
Joseph. He is also on a waiting list for a Section 8 housing voucher.</TE>
<TE>   "The program here helps quite a bit, but I'm still barely making
ends meet," said Cardenas, who spent eight years in the Air Force. "I
have friends in their 70s and 80s who are still working because they
don't want to go through what I've gone through, being homeless
without enough to eat."</TE>

<HD>Matel Dawson Jr., 81; Gave $1.3 Million to Schools on
Forklift Driver's Income</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matel Dawson Jr., a forklift operator with an eighth-grade education
who became a major philanthropist in the later years of his life, has
died at home in Detroit. The cause of death was not immediately
known.</LD>
<LD>   Before his death Saturday at age 81, he had donated $1.3 million
to higher education, including about $650,000 to Wayne State
University, where he was given an honorary doctorate in humane
letters in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's youth are our future, and education is the best
investment I can make," he once explained.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Wayne State, Dawson contributed regularly to
several community colleges and state universities, a local library,
his Christian church, the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund.
His 1994 gift of $50,000 to the latter broke all records, including
those he himself had set. At the time he made the gift, his annual
salary was $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's formula for accumulating cash was decidedly low-tech. He
never took vacations. "Work is more enjoyable," he told The Times
from his forklift at age 78. He worked overtime, enough to add about
$40,000 per year to his income. He drove a 1985 Ford Escort well into
the '90s, and he lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Detroit's
no-frills neighborhood of Highland Park.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he once admitted having invested well.</TE>
<TE>   A beefy man with a fondness for barbecued short ribs and catfish,
he went by the nickname "Mat" and was known for his laughing eyes and
a smile that transformed the lower half of his face.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson was born in Shreveport, La., one of seven children whose
father was a groundskeeper and later a hospital cook. His mother, who
took in laundry to help support the family, taught him the value of
thrift. He described her as "a saving woman -- even if it was just
two or three dollars, my mother would say, 'Save.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dawson moved to Detroit in 1940 because two uncles could help him
get a job at the Ford Motor Co., where he worked until retiring more
than 60 years later.</TE>
<TE>   He married in 1942 and divorced after 34 years. He was the father
of one girl. "One is more than enough," he once said.</TE>
<TE>   But if Dawson was not a family man at heart, he was committed to
making a better life for younger generations.</TE>
<TE>   One scholarship student at Wayne State, who met him while she was
completing her education in fashion merchandising with his financial
support, said she got to know Dawson at an honorary dinner for him
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he would be a money machine who wouldn't miss the
money," the student, Sonia Taggert, said of her blue-collar
benefactor. "Then I found out where he worked, what he did. It
motivated me to do better."</TE>
<TE>   For his extraordinary philanthropy, Dawson was showered with
titles and awards, including "Michiganian of the Year" in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He was a guest on Oprah Winfrey's show and "The Nightly News" with
Tom Brokaw. He met then-President Clinton at the White House. But it
was a trip to New York City where he met Bill Cosby that he boasted
about in a recent news magazine interview.</TE>
<TE>   "He put his arms around me and said, 'Where'd you get all that
money?' " Dawson recalled of the TV star. "I said, 'I'm tryin' to
catch up with you!' "</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Dawson ordered a customized crypt from India and
decided how his epitaph should read: "Mat Dawson Jr. -- Gone but Not
Forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Dawson is survived by his daughter and one grandchild.</TE>

would never be forgotten. But it wasn't until Thursday that they
finally remembered one of that war's heroes.</LD>
<LD>   East Los Angeles resident Daniel Montoya Sr. was belatedly awarded
a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Combat Infantry Badge and four other
Army medals for his harrowing experience chasing Nazis and helping
liberate Jewish concentration camps in 1945.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes recognition is a long time coming," Army Brig. Gen.
Richard Pierce said as he pinned the Purple Heart on the 81-year-old
Montoya, a retired contractor.</LD>
<TE>   "Better late than never!" shouted someone in the crowd of 300 that
gave Montoya a standing ovation during a Veterans Day observance at
the VA Medical Center in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya operated a Browning automatic rifle with the fast-moving
71st Infantry Division. The unit pushed 800 miles through France,
Germany and Austria during the hectic final two months of the war,
battling Nazis daily and liberating more than 80 small concentration
camps along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Military leaders were so appalled by the horrors soldiers
discovered that they published a 30-page booklet for all 15,700 men
in the division. They wrote that they wanted to record "the damning
evidence" found in one of the larger camps -- Gunskirchen Lager --
"in the hope that the lessons learned in Germany will not soon be
forgotten by the democratic nations or the individual men."</TE>
<TE>   But the 71st Division moved so quickly that its paperwork couldn't
keep up with Montoya, who was wounded three times. He was hit by
shrapnel from a German mortar, grazed by a bullet, and he broke a
foot as he dodged machine-gun fire.</TE>
<TE>   "My earliest recollection of my father was when I was about 2 and
he winked at me and I tried to wink back and noticed the lump on his
chin," said Montoya's son, Daniel Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it was shrapnel and changed the subject. I hounded him
about it for years, and then I noticed a straight-line graze wound
behind his knee. He finally told me they were from combat."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Montoya, a 43-year-old San Diego pharmacist, decided
to track down his father's military medals after seeing a wartime
photograph of children who had been rescued from a concentration camp
by the 71st Division.</TE>
<TE>   It took two years to reconstruct missing Army records using old
military "morning reports" containing notations of injuries suffered
by the unit's soldiers with the help of Rep. Grace F. Napolitano
(D-Norwalk).</TE>
<TE>   The 71st Division's official unit history, published in 1946,
omitted Montoya's name from the list of those receiving medals. But
it contained a heartbreaking description of the liberation of 15,000
Jewish prisoners from the Gunskirchen Lager concentration camp four
days before the war's end.</TE>
<TE>   In the woods outside the camp, Americans found "unburied piles of
starved dead, mass death from starvation, thirst and methodical
torture ... pictures or written word cannot convey the wordless
horror ... ," stated the postwar account.</TE>
<TE>   The booklet, "The Seventy First Came to Gunskirchen Lager," was
printed quickly after the camp's liberation. It contained graphic
photographs and first-person accounts of what Americans found in an
Austrian pine forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Row upon row of living skeletons, jammed so closely together that
it was impossible for some to turn over, even if they could have
generated enough strength to do so, met our eyes," recounted Maj.
Cameron Coffman of Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "A little girl, doubled with the gnawing pains of starvation,
cried pitifully for help. A Jewish rabbi tripped over a dead body as
he scurried toward me with strength he must have been saving for the
arrival of the American forces. He kissed the back of my gloved hand
and clutched my sleeve with a talon-like grip as he lifted his face
toward heaven. I could not understand what he said, but it was a
prayer. I did not have to understand his spoken word."</TE>
<TE>   Montoya, who was being treated for his broken foot, was spared
that scene. "I heard all about it. I wouldn't have wanted to see it.
But I would have done everything I could to help those people," he
said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   So it is no wonder that the 71st Division Assn. includes an
unusual civilian component: grateful Gunskirchen survivors who have
never forgotten their liberators and have joined as members.</TE>
<TE>   "The 71st Division saved our lives," said one of them: retired
Beverly Hills glazing contractor Bill Gordon, 81. He spent three
years in Nazi concentration camps and was one of those found starving
in Gunskirchen Lager.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was disappointed Thursday to learn that he had not heard
about Montoya's ceremony in time to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened there will never be forgotten. I am glad he was not
forgotten. I would like to shake his hand," he said.</TE>

<HD>Billy Mitchell, 71; Lead Singer With the Clovers, a Top
1950s R&amp;B Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Mitchell, a former singer with the rhythm-and-blues group the
Clovers, who was best known for his rollicking rendition of "Love
Potion No. 9," died Tuesday at a hospital in Washington, D.C., after
several strokes. He had colon cancer. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   The Clovers were one of the biggest acts in that early era of R&amp;B
and bridged the period between smoother pop groups such as the Ink
Spots and the rise of rock-and-rollers, said Howell Begle, founder of
the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1950s, the Clovers were a powerhouse on
rhythm-and-blues charts and helped transform Atlantic Records into
one of the major R&amp;B recording studios.</LD>
<TE>   The group had more than a dozen top-10 recordings, including
"Don't You Know I Love You," "One Mint Julep," "Fool, Fool, Fool" and
"Ting-A-Ling."</TE>
<TE>   With the noted Bill Harris on guitar, the Clovers' sound had a
vibrant, bluesy harmony and a relaxed, shuffling rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Times music critic Robert Hilburn, reviewing a reissue of
the band's work, called the Clovers "one of the most appealing of all
the early R&amp;B groups."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, a tenor, joined the Clovers in 1953 and soon was
alternating lead vocals with John "Buddy" Bailey and Charles White.</TE>
<TE>   With a more "gutbucket" blues feel than balladeer Bailey, Mitchell
sang the lead on such songs as the sly, witty "Your Cash Ain't
Nothin' But Trash" and "Down in the Alley."</TE>
<TE>   The Clovers continued making R&amp;B hits throughout the decade,
including "Devil or Angel," "Blue Velvet" and "Love, Love, Love."</TE>
<TE>   The band appeared in such top-flight performance halls as the
Apollo Theater in Harlem and on an Alan Freed television special in
1957.</TE>
<TE>   The group's last hit was Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's "Love
Potion No. 9," which was a crossover sensation on the pop and R&amp;B
charts. Mitchell sang lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Clovers split up about a year later as individual members
pursued recording opportunities and as the music labels cultivated
younger doo-wop and rock groups.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell tried to extend his singing career, recording with
Clovers member Harold "Hal" Lucas songs such as "The Bootie Green,"
which plugged into the twist dance craze.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts didn't equal his earlier successes, and Mitchell
sought a more stable job in Washington, where he lived at his death.</TE>
<TE>   He did stockroom work for St. Elizabeths Hospital until he retired
in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he stopped singing, he said that was it," Harold Winley, who
sang bass in the group, said Wednesday. "He said he wouldn't do it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   They reunited, however, in 1988 at a Rhythm and Blues Foundation
benefit in Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The Clovers said they never saw much money from their work in the
1950s, and several members said they thought that they had been
mismanaged.</TE>
<TE>   William Joseph Mitchell was a native Washingtonian. He left high
school, with his mother's permission, at age 17 to sing
professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Among those he worked with was a blues band led by Joe Morris, a
former trumpeter with Lionel Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Mitchell joined the Clovers, the group was
well-established.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas had formed the group in 1946 with friends at Armstrong High
School, and they sang at area clubs before Atlantic signed them.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthrough recording was "Don't You Know I Love You" in
1951.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell served in the Army during the Korean War and was hired as
a replacement for Bailey, who had been called away for military duty.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow singer Matthew McQuater told a reporter in 1997 that it was
obvious why Mitchell was kept in the band even after Bailey returned:</TE>
<TE>   "Cause he was a singin' fool!"</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include Mitchell's wife of 48 years, Helen Gibbs
Mitchell, of Washington, D.C.; five children; 11 grandchildren; and
five great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Objection! How Can the Jurors Get Their 15 Minutes of Fame,
Your Honor?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't know about you, but I thought that Judge Elden S. Fox's
sentencing in the Winona Ryder case was surprisingly harsh. I mean
his sentencing of the jurors. He told them they couldn't discuss the
trial for compensation for 90 days, adding, "Essentially, Jerry
Springer and Oprah Winfrey are off limits...."</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if Larry King's feelings were hurt that he wasn't
included in the judge's admonition.</LD>
<LD>   Highs and lows: I see where KCBS weatherman Byron Miranda is
introducing a feature in which he'll give a thermometer to a
different child each week and have the kid call in the neighborhood
temperature for five days. Cute. But it would be more fun if the
youngsters competed against Miranda at weather casting.</LD>
<TE>   Some years ago, a student named Jennifer Strona entered a science
fair with a project titled, "Can I Forecast the Weather as Accurately
as TV's Weatherman Fritz Coleman?" Coleman won, barely. He came
closer to guessing the correct barometric pressure, temperature and
air quality on six days, while Jennifer was victorious on five. They
tied on three other occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Coleman was stuck with KNBC's existing equipment.
Jennifer had the benefit of a brand new do-it-yourself meteorological
kit (cost: $25).</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's curious properties (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house that has been deprived of its vigor, unless the agent
meant to say "immaculate" (Steve Brandman).</TE>
<TE>   * A million-plus-dollars joint that should have better views at
that price (from Phil Gutierrez).</TE>
<TE>   Fish story: "I guess El Segundo is getting a bit more
cosmopolitan," wrote Tom Russ. He was referring to a police report in
the El Segundo Herald about a car being pelted with sushi.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of strange food crimes: The Huntington Beach Independent
said that a resident "ran outside and saw beans and food containers
in his yard that may have been blown up by fireworks."</TE>
<TE>   Back to vehicular offenses: Bob Bartley of Arcadia came upon a
headline indicating that a couple of unfortunate souls had been roped
to a car (see accompanying). Luckily, it was referring to the Buick
Open golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Translation, please: Jim, Laurel and Andrew Howat of Long Beach
bought a model plane that was made overseas and were intrigued to
find out that it had a sense of humor (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: During a discussion of TV/radio gaffes on the
ronfineman.com media Web site, Russell Kishi recalled the time an
announcer meant to remind fans to listen to an Angel game being
broadcast by Buddy Blattner and Don Wells. Only he said Buddy
Blattner and "Orson Welles."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alfonso Martinez Dominguez, 81, a former mayor of Mexico City, died
Wednesday of heart and kidney failure at a hospital in Monterrey,
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez, whose testimony was considered a key part of the
government probe into the deaths of student protesters in 1971, which
occurred during his term, also served as governor of Nuevo Leon from
1979-85.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after he was hospitalized in July, government prosecutors
visited Martinez to question him about his alleged role in a June
1971 incident in which security forces in civilian clothes beat and
shot at student demonstrators in Mexico City, leaving an estimated 30
protesters dead.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez denied any involvement and said the security forces
involved were under the control of then-President Luis Echeverria,
who also is under investigation in connection with both the 1971
incident and a larger student massacre in 1968. Echeverria also has
denied responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox named a special prosecutor last year.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Monterrey, Martinez graduated from Franco-Mexican College.
He became a leading figure in the conservative wing of PRI, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had ruled Mexico for 71
years until Fox was elected in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Stan Burns, 79; Comedy Writer for Top 1950s-'70s Variety
Shows</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stan Burns, 79, an Emmy-winning comedy writer for the top variety
shows of the 1950s through the '70s -- including "The Steve Allen
Show," "The Flip Wilson Show," "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"
and "The Carol Burnett Show" -- died Tuesday of heart failure at the
Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund retirement home in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   As a member of the Burnett show writing staff, Burns won a 1971-72
Emmy for outstanding writing achievement in variety or music
programs.</LD>
<LD>   In New York in the 1950s, he wrote for "Broadway Open House,"
starring Jerry Lester; the original "Tonight Show," starring Steve
Allen; and "The Steve Allen Show."</LD>
<TE>   He teamed with his longtime writing partner, Mike Marmer, in the
early '60s to work on variety shows and sitcoms, including "Get
Smart," "F-Troop" and "Gilligan's Island." Burns and Marmer, who died
earlier this year, worked together through the 1970s on various
shows, including "The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts."</TE>
<TE>   Burns and Marmer created, produced and wrote the Saturday morning
children's show "Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp," which ran on ABC from
1970 to 1972. The show has been described as " 'Get Smart' with fur
and psychedelic music."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Burns joined the Marines after graduating
from high school and served in the South Pacific during World War II.
He broke into comedy writing after the war, first on radio.</TE>
<TE>   He co-wrote, with Mel Weinstein, "The Book of Jewish World
Records," a parody of the Guinness Book of Records, published in
1978. He also co-wrote the 1981 movie "Charlie Chan and the Curse of
the Dragon Queen."</TE>

<HD>Lee Katzin, 67; Directed Feature Films, Hundreds of TV
Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee H. Katzin, 67, who directed scores of TV movies and feature
films, including "Le Mans," starring Steve McQueen, died of cancer
Oct. 30 at his home in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Detroit, Katzin earned a bachelor's degree in clinical
psychology from Harvard University in 1957. He started his career in
Hollywood in the late 1950s as an assistant television director
before working his way up to director in 1965.</LD>
<LD>   He directed hundreds of episodes of TV series such as "The Wild
Wild West," "The Rat Patrol," "Mannix," "In the Heat of the Night,"
"Miami Vice" and "Walker, Texas Ranger." He earned an Emmy nomination
for a "Mission: Impossible" segment titled "The Killing." He also
directed TV pilots for "Hondo," "The Mod Squad" and "Storefront
Lawyers."</LD>
<TE>   Katzin had directed only a couple of feature films, including
"Along Came a Spider" and "Heaven With a Gun," when he took over as

<HD>Annelisa Kilbourn, 35; Studied Ebola Virus' Effects on

<LD>Annelisa M. Kilbourn, 35, a veterinarian and wildlife expert who
found that gorillas are vulnerable to the Ebola virus, died in a
plane crash Saturday in the Central African nation of Gabon.</LD>
<LD>   A British citizen who was born in Zurich, Switzerland, Kilbourn
studied ecology and environmental biology at the University of
Connecticut, graduating in 1990. She earned a degree in veterinary
medicine at Tufts University in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   She was working for the Wildlife Conservation Society's field
veterinary program when an Ebola epidemic swept across Northern Gabon
and Congo last year, killing humans and at least 30 gorillas.</LD>
<TE>   Her discovery that Ebola was killing gorillas has major
implications for the preservation of Africa's primates and for
understanding how hunting and eating infected primates may spread the
disease. Ebola and predatory hunting are believed to be the primary
threats to wild gorillas.</TE>
<TE>   Kilbourn helped train local personnel to take biological samples
and make observations for an ongoing study of gorilla health. She
also worked in Borneo, where she studied Sumatran rhinos; and in
Malaysia, where she focused on orangutans trapped by agricultural
development in the rain forest.</TE>

<HD>Fences Go Up as Pig Eradication Plan Begins on Santa Cruz
Island</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four years of intense planning, the controversial effort to
eradicate up to 4,000 destructive wild pigs on Santa Cruz Island has
officially begun.</LD>
<LD>   Lines of fencing are being thrown up across the rugged island,
beginning the slow encirclement of the swine. Once the pigs are
trapped inside the fences, they will be stalked and shot by contract
hunters.</LD>
<LD>   "I am just thrilled to have it underway," said Lynn Lozier, Santa
Cruz Island project director for the Nature Conservancy. "This is the
first tangible piece of restoring the island to its original
condition. The presence of the pigs [is] central to all the problems
we face on the island."</LD>
<TE>   The $2.1-million fencing operation, which began last month, is
scheduled to take five to seven years to complete. The island will be
divided into five zones, each about 15,000 acres. Every year, a new
zone will be fenced off and hunted until the pigs within it are gone.</TE>
<TE>   "This technique has been used successfully all over the world,"
said Erik Aschehoug, a Nature Conservancy biologist. The first zone
should be fenced by December, and hunting will begin in late spring,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists and wildlife officials say the pigs are the biggest
impediment to the massive ecological restoration effort being
conducted on the island.</TE>
<TE>   The pigs dig deep holes, strip bark from rare trees and uproot
Chumash artifacts. Worse, they attract non-native golden eagles,
which dine on feral piglets and also have a taste for the endangered
island fox. The eagles nearly ate the foxes into extinction before
most of the foxes were rounded up and put in kennels, where they will
remain until the eagles are gone.</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent we have been treating the symptoms," Lozier said.
"We can continue to do that, to keep the island from getting sicker.
But this project is exciting because we are moving toward a more
self-sustaining balance on the island."</TE>
<TE>   At 90 square miles, Santa Cruz is the largest of the eight Channel
Islands. The Nature Conservancy, which owns about 75% of the island,
and Channel Islands National Park, which owns the rest, are
cooperating on the pig project. The first fences are going up on
Nature Conservancy land.</TE>
<TE>   The pigs, which weigh up to 150 pounds and are armed with sharp
tusks, were brought to the island in the 1850s by a Santa Barbara
farmer. After escaping, they survived largely by digging up and
eating fennel bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   From 1990 to 1993, the park service killed about 1,100 wild pigs
on Santa Rosa Island, also part of Channel Islands National Park. A
similar anti-swine effort is underway on Santa Catalina Island, which
put up 17 miles of pig-proof fencing in 1999. Biologists there expect
the pigs to be gone within two years. In the Galapagos Islands off
Ecuador, biologists are also trying to get rid of pigs to save the
native flora and fauna.</TE>
<TE>   But the porcine marauders have their defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not arguing that they don't need to do something about the
pigs, we are arguing with their methods," said Stephanie Boyles,
wildlife biologist with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
"The animals are totally innocent here. There is no reason their
numbers can't be brought down in a more humane and progressive way.
The park service is rushing this.''</TE>
<TE>   PETA has suggested shooting the pigs with contraceptive darts to
eradicate them over time. The group also proposed trapping and
euthanizing them. "Even a shot in the head is better than what they
have planned," Boyles said. "It will be a terrifying experience for
the animals. They have demonized these animals. No animal is evil.
They are making do with what they have on an island they can't
leave."</TE>
<TE>   Aschehoug said rounding up thousands of pigs and administering
contraceptives would be nearly impossible. As for euthanasia, he
said, capturing all the pigs and giving them injections would be more
stressful for them than shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not interested in killing pigs but in restoring an
island," he said. "Unfortunately, the pigs are in the way."</TE>

<HD>PUC Votes to Keep Record Power Rate Hikes</HD>
<DH>Angering activists, the regulator also will allow the use
of extra ratepayer payments to restore utilities' financial health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's chief utility regulator Thursday decided to indefinitely
keep in place the record electricity rate increases approved during
the energy crisis and lifted restrictions on use of the extra
billions of dollars collected by the utilities since then.</LD>
<LD>   Angering consumer advocates, the California Public Utilities
Commission voted unanimously to use the ratepayer money, if
necessary, to help fully restore the financial health of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</LD>
<LD>   The commission said the step was necessary for the companies to
secure adequate electricity supplies for customers at reasonable
rates.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an unfortunate step [designed to] continue the
stabilization of our energy market," said PUC President Loretta M.
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   In a long-awaited decision, the PUC also ordered many large
industrial and commercial customers who use private energy providers
to begin paying for power obtained by utilities and the state on
their behalf. But Lynch and a fellow commissioner dissented, saying
that big users were getting terms that amount to a subsidy by
ordinary ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, when the PUC adopted surcharges that boosted
average rates 30%, the commission said consumers would see lower
bills and rebates when electricity prices fell. At the time, the
commission earmarked money from the rate hike for electricity the
state purchased on behalf of utilities that were losing money in the
runaway energy market.</TE>
<TE>   Although wholesale prices have plunged and the utilities have been
collecting many millions of dollars more per month than their costs,
the PUC now has other plans for the money -- projected at $2.7
billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   The commission wants to help the utilities out of a financial
morass and to extricate itself from litigation by the utilities. In
settling a lawsuit by Edison, the PUC permitted the company to use
more than $3 billion in ratepayer money to pay debts incurred before
the rate increase. As part of its plan to help PG&amp;E out of
bankruptcy, the PUC wants to use $4.7 billion of customer money.</TE>
<TE>   "In each case, [helping the companies regain financial health] may
require use of some or all of the surcharge revenues," the PUC said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recently ordered the utilities to resume purchasing
power for their customers, which would get the state out of the
power-buying business.</TE>
<TE>   But the utilities objected, saying that they needed an
investment-grade rating from Wall Street to get the best price for
power. The PUC's action Thursday stated that the commission shared
that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Florio, senior staff attorney for the Utility Reform Network,
said the PUC "bailout" would cost ratepayers billons. "Enron plays
and we pay," said Florio. "We know the market was gamed, we know
rates went up due to criminal conduct, yet the bill keeps getting
passed on to small customers."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates decried the commission's decision on "exit
fees" for so-called direct access customers, who purchase power
directly from energy providers rather than through utilities.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the exodus of big electricity users from utilities raised
fears that a shrinking pool of customers would be left to shoulder
costs such as the long-term contracts signed by the state Department
of Water Resources. The PUC suspended enrollment with direct-access
providers, who account for 13% of the power load.</TE>
<TE>   The panel decided that the customers that enrolled between
February 2001 and Sept. 20, 2001 -- ranging from factories, hospitals
and farms to major public schools -- would have to pay back enough so
that remaining utility customers would not be harmed by their
departure.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC voted 3 to 2 on Thursday to cap the payment at 2.7 cents a
kilowatt hour, amounting to about $500 million a year in payments to
utility customers. The payments start in January, and the amount will
be reviewed periodically.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Jeff Brown said the money owed by these big customers
amounts to a loan with interest of 4%. "It is a giant step forward to
start collecting to relieve the burden on bundled-service customers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the decision balances two things: the desire of big
customers to continue with direct access, and the protection of small
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum, which represents energy providers, said the PUC decision is
"CPR for direct access and breathes life into an element of
deregulation that was floundering."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said direct access will save customers money despite the
exit fees, which he estimated would total several billion dollars
over the next 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   PUC Commissioner Carl Wood attacked the decision as an attempt to
preserve one of the vestiges of the state's failed deregulation plan.
"This is a forced loan that we are imposing on [utility] customers,"
he said. "It might even result in a necessity to raise rates."</TE>
<TE>   Wood proposed an alternate that he said would provide for
immediate recovery of almost $1 billion from those big users in 2001
and 2002. But it lost.</TE>

<HD>Rain Pounds Northern California, Triggers Accidents in
Southland</HD>
<DH>A big-rig crash on the Long Beach Freeway kills one, while
the Bay Area is hit by power outages, wind damage. More rain is
forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first storm of the season pounded Northern California on Thursday
and drifted slowly southeast over Southern California, where rain is
expected to continue off and on until Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   As rain fell in Paramount late Thursday night, a southbound big
rig overturned on the Long Beach Freeway and slid through the center
divider. At least one person was killed.</LD>
<LD>   In Sun Valley, an MTA bus collided with a car at San Fernando Road
and Tuxford Street, sending six people on the bus to hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the storm knocked out power to nearly 360,000
homes and prompted closure of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge when
high winds began blowing construction debris into trucks. The storm
also caused a blackout on the San Francisco Bay Bridge for several
hours, but the darkened span stayed open.</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco International Airport, high winds kept planes off
the runways for nearly two hours and knocked down a cargo building,
sending six employees running for the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a can opener went through it," said Mike Towle,
the airport duty manager. "It's a bad storm. Heavy rain.
Thunderstorms, lightening. Extreme wind."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in San Francisco, acrobats and dancers in the Cirque du
Soleil canceled their opening night after their tent collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Gusts of up to 60 mph also whipped through the Sierra Nevada and
the Reno area, with wind speeds expected to hit 100 mph in some
places in the upper Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The storm could bring up to three inches of rain to the
moisture-starved Angeles National Forest, closed since September
because of extreme fire danger.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said the forest won't reopen until at least next
week after scientists have had time to assess the moisture level and
make sure the fire danger has eased.</TE>
<TE>   "No hiking this weekend," Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Wright
said. "It will all depend on the amount of rain we get."</TE>
<TE>   Wright said some foothill cities were passing out sandbags to
residents concerned about mudslides on recently burned hillsides. But
right now, weather officials say, the danger of such slides is
minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously need the rain from the standpoint of that fire
danger," Wright said. "But we hope it's a gentle rain, because we do
have the fire aftermath conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Seto at the National Weather Service said this storm, the
first significant rainfall for Southern California since January,
would be a "light, tapering rain."</TE>
<TE>   "But it is going to rain," he said. "It's going to be one of those
soaking rains."</TE>
<TE>   Coastal and valley areas of Southern California are expected to
get between half an inch and 1 1/2 inches of rain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waves at Los Angeles-area beaches could reach 6 to 8 feet today,
with some rolling in at up to 12 feet. West-facing beaches north of
Point Conception near San Luis Obispo could see white caps of 15 to
20 feet, Seto said.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, skies will be clear, but another low-pressure area is
building in the Pacific and could bring more moisture the following
weekend, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's good news for Los Angeles, which last year experienced its
driest year since record-keeping began in 1877.</TE>
<TE>   Ski resorts rejoiced at the storm. Mammoth Mountain opened, and
Boreal in the Sierra near Lake Tahoe announced that it might be able
to open its higher lifts Saturday.</TE>

<LD>Don Rose, a former chairman of the Los Angeles County Democratic
Central Committee who made an unsuccessful bid for California
secretary of state in 1962, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Rose died of natural causes Oct. 14 at his home in Laguna Beach,
said his son, Donald C. Rose of Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Rosedale, Kan., in 1908, the elder Rose received a
bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Kansas.</LD>
<TE>   After moving to New York in the early 1930s, he became display
department manager for Bloomingdale's in New York City, which
provided the setting for his novel "Big Store," which was published
in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Deferred from military service during World War II because he had
two children, Rose became involved in local Democratic politics in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., after the war, along with his wife, Roma.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, the family moved to California, where Rose worked in
management at Macy's in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1950s, he had become a real estate executive involved
in the development of the Lakewood Center.</TE>
<TE>   Resuming his involvement in Democratic politics in California in
the late '40s, Rose managed a congressional campaign in 1950 and
became a member of the executive committee of the Democratic State
Central Committee.</TE>
<TE>   He was first elected chairman of the Los Angeles County Central
Committee in 1954 and served for eight years. In 1961, he became
chief of staff to Lt. Gov. Glenn Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   After his unsuccessful run for secretary of state in 1962, Rose
was postmaster of Laguna Beach and Laguna Niguel from 1965 to 1973.</TE>
<TE>   He was active on the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce
beautification committee, as well as in the Greenbelt and Village
Laguna civic organizations.</TE>

<HD>Unanimity on Ryder Verdict Was Quick</HD>
<DH>Juror says grand theft, vandalism conviction was swift but
burglary acquittal took longer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors who convicted actress Winona Ryder on Wednesday reached a
unanimous verdict on felony grand theft and vandalism charges after
quickly deciding that the shoplifting case was open and shut,
according to a member of the jury.</LD>
<LD>   "They caught her outside the door with the merchandise and some of
it was vandalized," said juror Walter Fox, a Beverly Hills
obstetrician-gynecologist.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, who spoke to The Times the day after the verdicts were
announced, said the most compelling witness was Saks Fifth Avenue
security guard Colleen Rainey, who testified that she stopped Ryder
after the Oscar-nominated film star left the department store in
December with $5,560 of merchandise that she hadn't paid for.</LD>
<TE>   Several other jurors, including Hollywood producer Peter Guber,
have refused to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   As they deliberated for five hours Tuesday, the jurors decided it
was not necessary to review two store surveillance tapes that tracked
Ryder's movements through Saks.</TE>
<TE>   "While they were helpful, they were not critical," Fox said. "The
only thing that was important was the end result."</TE>
<TE>   The jurors decided that Ryder looked suspicious on the video when
she stuffed socks and accessories into a hat and when she selected
clothes and put them beneath a garment bag draped over her arm.
Several also raised questions about why Ryder went into dressing
rooms but never tried anything on.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, 74, said that he and his fellow jurors were not overcome by
Ryder's celebrity status, but that they were entertained by her
facial expressions as she watched herself on the tapes.</TE>
<TE>   "She made wonderfully dramatic faces," Fox said. "She looked
shocked. She sees herself walking out the door with all this junk and
she's shocked? Gimme a break."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder was convicted of the felony charges on Wednesday after a
weeklong trial in Beverly Hills. She was acquitted of a burglary
charge. Ryder, who has no prior convictions, could face a three-year
prison term, but prosecutors said they don't plan to ask for time
behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle argued to jurors that Ryder went
into Saks equipped to shoplift, with scissors to cut sensor tags and
bags to conceal the merchandise. But defense attorney Mark Geragos
insisted that Ryder was set up by Saks employees and that she didn't
steal anything. She purchased $3,700 in merchandise the same day she
was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the jurors got along well during the weeklong trial and
decided on the grand theft and vandalism charges within hours of
beginning deliberations. They took about five straw votes in total on
the three charges. The first vote was not unanimous on any of the
charges, Fox said. But after some discussion, they all agreed that
Ryder was guilty of vandalism and grand theft.</TE>
<TE>   But the burglary charge was harder to decide because of a
provision that intent to steal was necessary to prove guilt. On
Tuesday afternoon, the jurors had voted 11-1 in favor of acquitting
the actress on that charge. But not wanting to pressure the 12th
juror into a decision, they decided to break for the day. They
resumed deliberations at 10:10 Wednesday morning, took one last vote
and it was unanimous for acquittal on the burglary charge.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not peer into [Ryder's] mind to know what her intent was
when she entered the store," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Geragos had an uphill battle. "He attempted to obfuscate
what we all knew by attacking the witnesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the jurors were sophisticated and couldn't be tricked, he
added. "This was not a group of idiots."</TE>
<TE>   Fox said jurors did not believe testimony of the main defense
witness, Michael Shoar, who said that a Saks security manager told
him he was going to make up evidence to ensure Ryder's conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Shoar, a former Saks employee, admitted during cross-examination
that he was suing the department store and had staged a protest in
front of the Beverly Hills branch.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of the trial, said first-time juror Fox, was when he
and his fellow jurors walked into the packed courtroom with the
verdicts in hand and there was complete silence, as everyone waited
to hear the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Fox said that he thought too much was made about the
case and that he was surprised by the media requests he had received
to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a definite dearth of news if people want to talk to me,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the case should have been resolved without a jury trial.
"I do believe that this was much ado about nothing," he said.
"Nevertheless, justice is justice."</TE>

<LD>An appellate court here has denied a request by environmental groups
to block construction of the new UC Merced campus.</LD>
<LD>   The 5th District Court of Appeal on Wednesday denied a request for
a stay from the San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center, Protect Our Water
and the Central Valley Safe Environment Network. The groups hoped the
court would temporarily halt construction after a Merced County
Superior Court judge said last month that plans for the campus met
state environmental requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental groups claim university officials did not adequately
evaluate the campus' impact on air pollution, water quality and
surrounding areas.</LD>

<LD>One of the nastiest county campaigns in recent memory remained too
close to call Thursday, as a Superior Court judge clung to a margin
of less than 3,000 votes over the incumbent in the race for district
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   With all but late absentee ballots remaining, Judge Bonnie Dumanis
had 259,445 votes versus 256,531 for Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst.
Election officials began counting about 80,000 absentee ballots
Thursday and were not expected to finish until next week.</LD>

<HD>Officials Concede L.A.'s Copy Falls Short</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like dozens of other police departments across America, the Los
Angeles Police Department got wind of New York's Compstat anti-crime
program and copied it.</LD>
<LD>   But Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said the copy
falls far short of the original, which he created eight years ago.</LD>
<LD>   As practiced in Los Angeles, he said, it has "evolved into a bunch
of people sitting around the table shooting the breeze."</LD>
<TE>   Two commanders who have been responsible for Los Angeles' program,
called FASTRAC, said they thought it had been successful in focusing
commanders on crime reduction. But they acknowledged that FASTRAC
lacks the harsh accountability that marks the New York system.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Jim McDonnell, Bratton's transition team leader and
currently head of FASTRAC, said the top brass put the program's
meetings into the hands of bureau commanders, each of whom oversees
four or five of the city's 18 patrol divisions. The idea was that
they would be more familiar with local problems in the city's vast
expanse.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is we tried to make it more user-friendly," McDonnell
said. "But it's hard to audit your own command."</TE>
<TE>   The style of the Los Angeles program was evident in a recent
meeting conducted by North Hollywood Division commander Capt. Bruce
E. Crosley as he prepared for his appearance at a bureau meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to computer-generated maps, his lead officers briefed
him on crimes in the first 12 days of October. They included five
homicides, a rash of Saturn car thefts and a resurgence of homeless
people at North Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Crosley listened and occasionally interjected a suggestion. Wasn't
there a convicted Saturn thief whose prison term could be up, he
asked. The man got out in September, one of the officers said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'd want to talk to him," Crosley said.</TE>
<TE>   The tone was collegial.</TE>
<TE>   There was little discussion of strategy, however, how to counter
the gang violence behind most of the murders or how to crack a ring
of Lexus thieves who were parking hot cars in North Hollywood for a
day or two to test whether they were equipped with anti-theft
transmitters. Others who might have contributed, such as
representatives of the gang and narcotics details, were not present.</TE>
<TE>   The officers knew what Crosley expected to be done, Det. Margaret
Moss said afterward. They also knew that Crosley would expect
results.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Moss said, officers would sweep the North Hollywood
Park area warning people that they could not stay overnight or leave
their cars parked there for more than 72 hours. Enforcement would
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the meeting illustrates some of the weaknesses of
the LAPD's version of Compstat, said Greg Berg, the retired LAPD
deputy chief who set the system up.</TE>
<TE>   "They tended to be sessions where people just informed each other
about the crimes," said Berg, now director of community and safety
services for Cerritos. "Because we don't want to insult each other,
they tend not to ask the hard questions."</TE>
<TE>   Berg said he was "blown away" when he first observed the meetings
in New York, because field commanders were being questioned about
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "In LAPD at that point, no one asked commanders about crime
problems," Berg said. "Not one time did my boss ever ask me about a
homicide. Any internal management issues was what you were called on
the carpet about, but not crime."</TE>
<TE>   Berg said he expects Bratton to restructure the chain of command
so that meetings are conducted by high-level commanders who can order
that such units as gang and narcotics cooperate with patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he sees obstacles to implementing the key element of the
New York program -- throwing massive resources on crime clusters --
in Los Angeles. Such resources would be hard to muster in a division
covering 45 square miles, he said. New York has more than four times
as many officers as Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The severity of the officer shortage was apparent at the
night-shift roll call at North Hollywood station last week. A watch
commander addressed a dozen officers who would soon head out on
patrol, each with five calls waiting.</TE>
<TE>   They discussed the Lexus thefts, but didn't plan any specific
enforcement. They could, for example, have set up a surveillance, and
then followed the car after the thieves came back to reclaim it. But
there would be no one to do such a surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "LAPD is just spread so thinly," Berg said.</TE>

<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Miami by 8 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Miami update: The undefeated defending national champions are in
an unusual position at No. 2 in the Associated Press poll, despite a
30-game winning streak. Pulling away from Rutgers with a 28-0 fourth
quarter for a 42-17 victory didn't impress many.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee update: The Volunteers have their problems, ending a
two-game losing streak with an 18-10 victory over South Carolina last
week. Tailbacks Jabari Davis and Cedric Houston will be the latest to
test Miami's once-vaunted run defense.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Time for Miami to stop dallying. Bad habits create
upsets, and nobody's going to let the Hurricanes waltz back into the
BCS title game just because they won last year.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. Nap time is over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 3 OHIO STATE (10-0)</TE>
<TE>   at PURDUE (4-5)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN Gameplan</TE>
<TE>   Line: Ohio State by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State update: The Buckeyes -- one of four remaining unbeatens
-- are seeking the fourth 11-0 start in school history. The others
were in 1975, '79 and '95. They have never won more than 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue update: The Boilermakers -- not Ohio State or Iowa -- have
the Big Ten's top-ranked offense, averaging 449.3 yards a game,
though they're only fifth in scoring offense at 29.7 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Iowa, the only other unbeaten team in Big Ten
conference games, is hoping for a Buckeye slip-up.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Ohio State. Tailback Maurice Clarett gets all the
publicity, but the Buckeye defense leads the Big Ten in total
defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 10 USC (6-2)</TE>
<TE>   at STANFORD (2-6)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 16 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: Carson Palmer completes 62% of his passes against
ordinary competition, and Stanford ranks last in the league in
defense. It's too late for a real Heisman campaign, but a
Heisman-worthy game is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford update: The Cardinal has held only one opponent --
Arizona -- to fewer than 26 points. Six times in eight games,
Stanford has given up more than 30. This is looking like one of those
games.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: You won't be falling asleep during the Carson Show
against Stanford's weak defense.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. An upset doesn't seem possible, even though USC has
lost three in a row to Stanford.</TE>

<TE>   NO. 15 OREGON (7-2)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 5 WASHINGTON STATE (8-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Washington State by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon update: The Ducks have been a disappointment, and had lost
two games in a row before a 41-14 victory over lowly Stanford.
Running back Onterrio Smith didn't play in that game because of a
minor injury but is expected to play against Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: The Cougars are in first place in the
Pac-10 and a surprising fifth in the BCS standings, with their only
loss to unbeaten Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The Cougars went 67 years between Rose Bowls. Now they
might be back after only four.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Washington State. Oregon is 3-1 in Pullman since 1996
and won there in 2000 and 2001. This says the streak stops here.</TE>

<TE>   Line: Kansas State by 12 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State update: To reach the Big 12 title game, the Cyclones
must beat Kansas State and Colorado. Seneca Wallace didn't do much in
losses to Oklahoma and Texas, but he set a school record with 493
total yards against Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State update: The Wildcats' only losses are to Colorado and
Texas -- and they haven't lost to Iowa State since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Kansas State, Iowa State and Colorado are all vying
for the chance to face likely South Division champion Oklahoma in the
Big 12 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Kansas State. Wallace is scintillating against lesser
competition but doesn't come through against the big boys.</TE>

<TE>   Line: UCLA by 11.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: Tyler Ebell needs to average only 88.7 yards in
UCLA's final three games to become only the third freshman in Pac-10
history to rush for 1,000 yards, joining Stanford's Darrin Nelson and
Oregon State's Ken Simonton.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona update: Receiver Bobby Wade has had 100-yard games in his
last 12 outings and leads the Pac-10 in receiving and receiving
yardage.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's fun to watch the Bruins' bunch of freshmen
survive when they shouldn't be able to.</TE>

<HD>Confident Zito Knows His Career Is Young</HD>
<DH>Oakland left-hander is looking down the line after beating
out Martinez, Lowe for first Cy Young Award.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notified Thursday that he had won the American League's Cy Young
Award, Oakland A's left-hander Barry Zito said it was "mind-blowing"
to be mentioned in the same sentence as one of the "greatest pitchers
of the era."</LD>
<LD>   He referred to Boston Red Sox right-hander Pedro Martinez,
runner-up in close voting by a committee of the Baseball Writers
Assn. of America.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Zito also said he hopes to blow right by three-time Cy
Young winner Martinez and ultimately catch Roger Clemens, the
record-holder with six awards.</LD>
<TE>   "My dad always told me to dream big and dream always," the former
USC standout said in a conference call with reporters. "I have big
aspirations of what I want to achieve in this game and I have a lot
of confidence in myself, and when I say I'm shooting for Clemens'
record, I don't mean it from an arrogant point of view.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I want to do and what I think I'm capable of doing, and
so I'm honored and happy to have won the first one at 24, because
achieving the first of anything, like being selected to the All-Star
game, is often the hardest. I mean, having done it once, you're more
established."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing automatic about the Cy Young vote.</TE>
<TE>   Zito, who led the league in victories with a 23-5 record and was
third in earned-run average at 2.75, received 114 points based on 17
first-place votes, nine second-place votes and two third-place votes
from the 28-member committee.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who had a 20-4 record and led the league in ERA at 2.26,
strikeouts with 239, and lowest opponents' batting average, .198,
received 96 points based on 11 first-place votes, 12 second-place
votes and five third-place votes. His Boston teammate, Derek Lowe
(21-8, 2.58 ERA), was third with 41 points. Angel left-hander Jarrod
Washburn (18-6, 3.15) received one third-place vote and finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Zito said that his leading the league in wins hadn't made him
overconfident about winning the award. He pointed out that teammates
Tim Hudson in 2000 and Mark Mulder in 2001 had each led the league,
or tied for the lead, only to finish second in Cy Young voting and
they had needled him in spring training that it was his turn to be
the Cy Young runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," he said with a laugh, "one or the other in their
scenario expected to win it."</TE>
<TE>   The award merely underscores the curveballing Zito's emergence as
one of baseball's dominant pitchers. His 47-17 major league record
translates to a .734 win percentage, the best since 1990 among
pitchers with 50 or more decisions. He was 13-1 after A's losses this
year, establishing his credentials as a stopper, and led the league
by holding opponents to a .185 batting average with runners in
scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   To an extent, Zito said, he has been thinking about the Cy Young
since he was a youngster taking backyard lessons from Randy Jones,
the San Diego Padres' 1976 Cy Young winner, and being awed by
glimpses of the award when Jones wasn't "spitting tobacco juice on my
shoes, Nike high-tops that we couldn't afford."</TE>
<TE>   The Zitos really couldn't afford the $50 lessons, but they taught
the young left-hander how to hone his mechanics throwing socks at a
full-length mirror and, "from a mental standpoint," he said, "never
to give in."</TE>
<TE>   Mentally, Zito brings a lot to the party.</TE>
<TE>   He is taking acting lessons and plays acoustic guitar well enough
to sit in with his sister Sally's band, sharpening his playing in his
digital studio.</TE>
<TE>   On the pitching front, he has now swept postseason honors, having
previously won the Sporting News, Baseball Weekly, Players Choice and
Major League Alumni Assn. top AL awards.</TE>
<TE>   He also received a $100,000 bonus for winning the Cy Young.
Martinez received a $500,000 bonus for finishing second, illustrating
that Zito's goal may be to catch Clemens but -- in more ways than one
-- he still has a ways to go before catching Martinez.</TE>

<HD>Bavasi May Interview With Orioles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Baltimore Orioles received permission Thursday night to interview
Bill Bavasi, the Dodgers' director of player development, for the
Orioles' general manager job. Bavasi said he plans to discuss the
opportunity with his family before responding to Baltimore's request
by today.</LD>
<LD>   As the Angels' farm director in the early 1990s and their general
manager from 1994-99, Bavasi was responsible for drafting and
developing many of the core players on the team that won the World
Series over the San Francisco Giants last month.</LD>
<LD>   Unwilling to yield to former Angel President Tony Tavares' demand
to break up that nucleus of players -- which underachieved during an
abysmal 1999 season -- Bavasi resigned by mutual consent in late
September 1999 and took a job in the Dodgers' front office.</LD>
<TE>   Bavasi would be the eighth candidate to replace current Oriole GM
Syd Thrift, who is expected to be bumped to a scouting position. Mike
Flanagan, an Oriole broadcaster and a former Cy Young Award-winning
pitcher for the team, is considered the leading candidate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers agreed to terms on a minor league contract with first
baseman Larry Barnes, a former Angel who, if he makes the team, could
push Eric Karros for playing time.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, 28, batted .314 with 20 home runs and 95 runs batted in
for triple-A Salt Lake in 2002. A left-handed batter and a smooth
defensive player, Barnes appeared in 14 games for the Angels, hitting
one homer and knocking in two runs.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners signed designated hitter Edgar Martinez to a
one-year contract, a day after declining a $10-million option on him.
Martinez will make about $4 million next season, plus the $1-million
buyout from his previous deal.... Cub General Manager Jim Hendry
called Dusty Baker, one day after the San Francisco Giants announced
Baker wouldn't be returning as their manager, and set up a meeting
for Monday or Tuesday of next week.</TE>

<LD>Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier was a member of the last
winless NFL team, the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember a speech our coach, John McKay, was giving us at one
point in the season," he told the New Yorker. "He was emphasizing
that games were lost in the trenches by failing to block and tackle
on the front lines.</LD>
<LD>   "And as he was talking he noticed a lineman asleep in the back. He
called his name, woke him up and asked, 'Where are most games lost?'
And the lineman says, 'Right here in Tampa, sir.' "</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the Pacific 10 record for
consecutive football games without being shut out?</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad idea: A Czech soccer team is playing so poorly that it
has ordered its players to pay for fans' tickets for Saturday's home
game against Sparta Prague. Sigma Olomouc, with a 2-5-5 record, ranks
13th in the 16-team Czech League.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are priced at $1.70, meaning that a sellout at 12,119-seat
Andruv Stadium would cost the players a collective $20,000. The
average Czech earns $5,900 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Just wondering: Could such a policy be implemented against lousy
teams in the NBA or NFL?</TE>
<TE>   Unusual punishment: Bill Lankhof of the Toronto Sun on the Maple
Leafs' 3-7-2 start: "[Coach Pat] Quinn says this isn't a good time to
make a trade. He's right. If the fans have to watch hockey this
horrible all year, then the players should have to stay and watch it
too. It's only fair."</TE>
<TE>   Qualifications: Comedian Billy Crystal, speaking to the U.S.
Olympic Committee, offered up some reasons why New York is the
perfect city to host the 2012 Summer Games. For instance: "All the
foreigners are already there and the Mets are helping out with drug
testing."</TE>
<TE>   Always works: David Letterman on New York beating out San
Francisco to become the bid city for the 2012 Games: "We convinced
the Olympic Committee the old-fashioned way -- with hookers and
cash."</TE>
<TE>   Say again? Promoter Don King on boxing's rating system: "When we
started, it was based on lies. It's changing now. There are no
secrets in the business. You've got to come with the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth. It's becoming very confusing."</TE>
<TE>   Yawn: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "Anticipating
the return of Bill Romanowski to Denver is every bit as thrilling as
looking forward to an oil change."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1959, Elgin Baylor of the Minneapolis
Lakers scored 64 points against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA, 246, 1971-1992.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune: "Onetime
Hawks assistant Roger Neilson is one of hockey's great innovators --
Nickname, Capt. Video -- and one of the game's great savants.</TE>
<TE>   "A story: One time he walked into an appliance store looking for a
new video monitor and stopped a salesperson to ask, 'Don't you have
any TVs with a bigger screen than this?' 'Yes, sir, we do,' said the
salesperson. 'This is a microwave oven.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CINCINNATI AT BALTIMORE</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Baltimore by 5 1/2.</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jeff Blake: He got out while the going was good.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The last time the Bengals had a non-losing season (1996;
Cincinnati finished 8-8), Blake was their starting quarterback. The
last time the Bengals scored a point in Baltimore (1998; touchdown
pass to Carl Pickens), Blake was their starting quarterback. Since
then, the Bengals have been shut out three times in Baltimore and the
franchise has sunk deeper into the tank, 1-7 in 2002 after last
week's upset of Houston. Blake, who starts for the Ravens against his
old mates Sunday, told the Baltimore Sun, "I'm not going to laugh at
their situation. I was there at one time, and it's not pretty."</TE>

<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 4 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Rodney Peete, Dale Carter return. Will any of it
matter?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Carolina football fans have been reminiscing about the good
old days, September 2002, when Peete was at the helm and the Panthers
were 3-0. Then Peete got hurt and the schedule turned tough and
before they knew it, the Panthers were starting Randy Fasani and
their record was 3-5. Peete returns Sunday, as does Saint cornerback
Carter, back off suspension for violating the league's
substance-abuse policy. Carter can use the payday. On Feb. 15, he
filed for Chapter 7, claiming nearly $5 million in debts and about $1
million in assets. Sounds a lot like the Panther offense.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Panthers Lose Sixth; Chapter 7 Coming Next
Week"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 10.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: First place versus second place. No kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Most Valuable Body Part, Detroit Lions? General Manager Matt
Millen's mouth. Since Millen disparaged his team with his "devout
coward" line, the Lions are 2-1 (thanks so much, Dallas Cowboys).
MVBP, Green Bay Packers? Brett Favre's left knee, of course. Wrapped
in a brace, Favre's sprained knee passed its first test, Monday's
24-10 victory over Miami, which improved the Packers' record to 7-1.
Green Bay is four games ahead of 3-5 Detroit, the best of what's left
in the NFC North, and soon to be five. Detroit has not beaten the
Packers in Green Bay since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "In NFC North Footrace, Favre Now Lapping the
Field"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   N.Y. GIANTS AT MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: When we were kings, 22 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: January 2000: The Giants play host to the Vikings in the NFC
championship game. Lousy game -- Giants won, 41-0; Randy Moss took
every play off after the first quarter; crazed Giant fans lulled into
thinking Kerry Collins was the next Y.A. Tittle. Since that
crystalline moment, the Giants are 11-14 (counting the ensuing Super
Bowl embarrassment) and the Vikings are 7-17. Things are so bad in
Minnesota, Coach Mike Tice is considering benching Daunte Culpepper
in favor of, yes, Todd Bouman. In New York, a dire Amani Toomer has
"guaranteed" the Giants will make the playoffs. Sad, sad times.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "For Old Times' Sake, Vikings Say 'No Moss!'
Again"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS AT PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 9.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Paging Norm Bulaich.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tony Dungy returns to Philadelphia ... Tampa Bay fans can
tell you which way this one's headed. Dungy went 0-2 in his last two
trips to the Vet, both playoff games, getting outscored, 52-12. This
is why Jon Gruden now coaches the Buccaneers and Dungy arrives in
Philadelphia with an empty stable of Colt running backs. Edgerrin
James and Ricky Williams are sidelined with hamstring injuries.
Dominic Rhodes is out for the season. Dungy is down to fourth-string
rookie James Mungro, who had 60 yards in an otherwise depressing loss
to Tennessee. But that's nothing compared to Sunday's forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "All Things Considered, Dungy Would Rather Have
Had an Open Date"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTA AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Tale of two 5-3 teams, tale of three quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Atlanta and Pittsburgh enter this one with identical
records. No one would have called it back in September, but that was
long before Tommy Maddox and the Steelers resurrected each another --
and before Kordell Stewart was playing the role of Michael Vick on
the Steeler scout team. Vick has re-energized the Falcons, who are
4-0 after a 1-3 start. Pittsburgh is 4-1 since Maddox replaced

do you expect from the what-have-you-done-lately NFL (stands for Not
For Long)? The Chargers were looking pretty good until last week's
44-13 home loss to the Jets. The Rams were 0-5 and out to sea until
Bulger began giving the ball to Marshall Faulk and -- shocker! -- St.
Louis won three in a row. Two teams meet at the crossroads in St.

<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 10.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Houston Oiler Memorial Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: A shame it had to happen like this. Houston's Oilers were
one of four teams swept away in the NFL's Great Carpetbagger Exodus
of '95-'97, during which a league once proud of its franchise
stability suddenly looked as shaky as the Texan offensive line. The
Oilers moved to Tennessee and became the Titans, leaving Houston
vacant and desperate to do anything to outbid Los Angeles for the
next expansion team. And it did. Had the Oilers stayed put, who knows
what would have happened? David Carr might still be getting pounded
every game. But at least he'd be getting hurt in L.A.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Arizona by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The thrill is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Trying to drum up interest in a town that would rather watch
the Suns/the Sun Devils/the sun set than watch the local NFL team,
the Cardinals began shrieking two weeks ago, "Hey everybody! We're
4-2 in a soft division! Look at us go!" And go they did, down the
tubes against NFC West rivals San Francisco and St. Louis and back to
4-4 and scraping to sell more than 28,000 advance tickets to Sunday's
why-bother against Seattle. Look, would a quarterback controversy
help? Figuring it was worth a try, the Cardinals had rookie Josh
McCown trading practice snaps with Jake Plummer this week.</TE>

anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: A study in contrasts, if nothing else. Redskin Coach
Spurrier would like you to think he doesn't sweat the details, which
is why he says outlandish things after beating the hapless Seahawks
for his first two-game winning streak as an NFL coach. Such as: "We
put people on notice today that we are a playoff team." And Coughlin
is a tranquil soul at peace with all that surrounds him. The Jaguar
coach has seen his team slump from 3-1 to 3-5, leaving him more
miserable than usual and promising to be "more critical" of his
players and their mistakes.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: A couple of magical fairy tales, once upon a time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The NFL's two biggest surprise stories of 2001 are halfway
through their sequels and, hey, is there a script doctor in the
house? The Super Bowl champion Patriots had slid from 3-0 to 3-4
before reading one too many should've-kept-Bledsoe stories and rising
up to smite the Buffalo Bills, 38-7, to either save the season or buy
themselves one more week's time. The Bears, 13-3 last season, have
lost six in a row -- and are seven points removed from 0-8. Nothing
will end happily for the Bears this year. The Patriots still have
hope, and a soft second-half schedule, beginning right here, right
now.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Joe Montana slept here. And there.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: There hasn't been this much interest in a 49er-Chief
skirmish since Joe Montana faced his old San Francisco teammates in
1994. (Final score: With Montana 24, Without Montana 17.) Trent Green
and the Chiefs are 4-4, but they have the league's most fascinating
offense -- and, in its own way, the most fascinating defense as well.
The 49ers are 6-2 and Terrell Owens is warming up, netting 132 and
191 receiving yards the last two weeks. Both teams are coming off
victories over Oakland -- the Chiefs winning, 20-10, and the 49ers,
23-20. There once was a time when that kind of thing meant something.</TE>

<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: No recruiting in the press box.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Not to say that the Ray Lucas era has the Dolphins panicked
or anything, but for the second time in three weeks, they've gone to
the media looking for a bailout. First the Dolphins signed Cris
Carter away from the HBO round table. Then, they started banging on
the Fox broadcast booth, wondering if Troy Aikman could come out and
play. Aikman has been retired since 2000, which means he hasn't
suffered a concussion since 2000. But the Dolphins are 0-2 under
Lucas and desperate, and Aikman sounds interested. Meanwhile, Dan
Marino works for HBO and is available.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: MNF, Raiders both at 500.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Not a bad matchup for the 500th episode of "Monday Night
Football," even if you can predict the outcome a mile away. The
Raiders are 4-4 after a 4-0 start. The Broncos are 6-2 and the most
(only?) consistent team in the league. The Raiders haven't won in
Denver since they fired Mike Shanahan, who is 7-0 at home against his
former team since becoming Bronco coach. The Broncos are 8-1 in their
last nine home games against the Raiders and 5-2-1 against them on
Monday night. Not much more to say, except: Happy anniversary, Al.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Piatkowski Lauded for His Longevity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Eric Piatkowski will play in his 559th game as a Clipper tonight,
when the team faces the New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   "That shows unbelievable dedication," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "It
is a big deal."</LD>
<LD>   Maybe they should award Piatkowski a medal of valor.</LD>
<TE>   In the franchise's history, only Randy Smith played in more games,
and he never wore a Los Angeles Clipper uniform. Smith toiled for 715
games as a member of the Buffalo Braves and, when the club relocated
in 1978, the San Diego Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Loy Vaught played 558 games in eight seasons as an L.A. Clipper
from 1990-91 to 1997-98. Piatkowski tied Vaught for second on the
all-time Clipper list when he scored 18 points during a 101-99
overtime loss Wednesday to the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been nice for me to stay with one team in one city,"
said Piatkowski, ignoring for a moment the team's 194-434
regular-season record and its 0-3 playoff mark during his nine
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, Piatkowski has scored 4,707 points during a
career that began in 1994. And he scored 16 more during the Clippers'
three-game sweep at the hands of the Utah Jazz in the first round of
the 1997 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think I've made it through the bad times and that
now we're into the good times," he said. "It would have been simple
to take the easy way out, pouting and asking for a trade. I think
I've earned the right to see some of the benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Then, because he has been a Clipper for his entire NBA career, he
paused before adding, "Who knows how things are going to turn out?"</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski, a shooting guard, will become an unrestricted free
agent July 1, as will Michael Olowokandi. Elton Brand, Corey
Maggette, Andre Miller and Lamar Odom are eligible to become
restricted free agents, with the Clippers able to match the offer of
any other team.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski, 32, refuses to think past tonight's game against the
Nets, however.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the Clippers' history of failing to retain talented
players. He recalls the failed negotiations last summer that could
have locked up Brand and Olowokandi to lucrative long-term deals and
eased the anxiety level in the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to happen," Piatkowski said. "I'll keep
those thoughts out of my head until the season is over. It would be
nice to finish my career here [as a Clipper]. If not, I'll just go
someplace else where I'm needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't control if we play as a team. We have the talent to
compete. I feel we're going to win whenever we walk out on the floor.
There were some times when that wasn't the case. I used to walk on
the floor and say, 'Uh, oh.' We just didn't have the talent to
compete. I just hoped it wasn't going to be an embarrassing night.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can come together and play fine. We have Michael and
Elton healthy now. We have a great point guard in Andre Miller. We
have a lot of depth. We're a talented team.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to get down or depressed."</TE>

<HD>Records Fall in Pomona</HD>
<DH>Johnson's run of 6.797 seconds and Anderson's speed of
203.58 mph in pro stock lead way in NHRA qualifying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rain put a damper on Thursday's first round of qualifying for the
Auto Club NHRA Finals, but only after Warren Johnson and Greg
Anderson had set Pomona Raceway track records in pro stock.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, 61, needed only 6.797 seconds' elapsed time to run the
quarter-mile in his Pontiac Grand Am. Jim Yates held the old record
of 6.803, set last February.</LD>
<LD>   "Conditions were as good as I anticipated, given the fact that we
had overcast skies," said the Sugar Hill, Ga., veteran. "After Kurt
[Johnson] ran his 6.80, I felt that we could be at least in that
ballpark. I didn't anticipate a 6.79 but I was pretty confident we
could run as quick as Kurt."</LD>
<TE>   Kurt, Warren's son, is second at 6.806, just ahead of Anderson,
whose top-end speed of 203.58 mph in a Chevy Cavalier broke his own
mark of 203.12, also set last February.</TE>
<TE>   "We've picked up our performance ever since Indy [the U.S.
Nationals in early September], so we really have the potential to run
a lot better when we return here in February for the
Winternationals," the senior Johnson said. "Of course, everybody in
pro stock has the same intention."</TE>
<TE>   Jeg Coughlin Jr., who clinched his second pro stock championship
two weeks ago at Las Vegas, managed only a 6.864 in his Cavalier,
good for 13th position.</TE>
<TE>   John Force took a strong move toward winning his 10th consecutive
funny car championship by taking the provisional No. 1 position with
a run of 4.762 seconds at 324.05 mph in his Castrol Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Pedregon, his teammate and the only driver within reach of
Force, had a disappointing 7.328 run and is in 14th.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised at our time," Force said. "We were ready
to run when it started raining and we made a few little changes
before we came back. The car has a lot of runs in it, but it's a good
hot rod."</TE>
<TE>   As for Pedregon, Force said, "I don't want him qualifying 16th if
I'm No. 1. I don't want to see him next to me [on the starting line]
for the first couple of rounds."</TE>
<TE>   In a sport measured by thousandths of a second, Shawn Greer, of
Stoneville, N.C., and two-time champion Angelle Savoie of Mathews,
La., recorded the exact time, 7.183 seconds, and the same speed,
185.87 mph, in pro stock bike qualifying. Because Greer did his
first, he is the provisional No. 1 qualifier. Both rode Suzukis.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like for that to stand as the top run for the weekend and
the weather could be a factor in that," Greer said. "We've been
steadily improving throughout the season and I think we can give the
rest of the class a run for their money this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Another motorcycle racer, Karen Stoffer, of Minden, Nev., was
hospitalized after she lost control of her bike and crashed in the
sand trap at the end of the shutdown area. She was released later in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   The pro stock and pro stock bike classes completed their
qualifying runs before intermittent rain twice stopped proceedings.
Qualifying will continue with one run today and two Saturday. Final
eliminations will start at 11 a.m. Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Tough Stretch Starts Against Avalanche</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After winning at home for only the second time in six games, the
Mighty Ducks will try improve their position in the Western
Conference with six of their next seven games on the road.</LD>
<LD>   Following a sigh-of-relief, 2-1 victory over last-place Nashville
on Wednesday at the Arrowhead Pond, the Ducks are still ahead of only
Nashville and Edmonton in the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, they face a banged-up Colorado team in Denver, come home
to play Minnesota on Sunday, then have five in a row on the road. The
Avalanche probably will be without defenseman Rob Blake, who left
Wednesday's 5-2 loss to Ottawa with a groin injury, and goalie
Patrick Roy, who has missed two games because of a sore hip.</LD>
<TE>   "We talk about concentrating on our game, our team and just
getting better," defenseman Keith Carney said. "We have to do that
quick. We don't have time to waste. We have to get points."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, that was also the case. The Ducks had a 6-7-1 record
Nov. 6, then went on a nine-game winless streak. "I don't think
anybody wants to be in the same mood," said Petr Sykora, who was with
New Jersey last season. "I don't even know that mood because I wasn't
here last year. But I heard about it. I don't think that the guys are
going let that happen. We are not where we want to be in the
standings, but it takes a long time to get on top."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks beat the Avalanche in overtime Oct. 20 but are winless
in their last five games in Denver (0-3-2). "Right now, we have to
put a bunch of games together where we play our best hockey," Carney

<LD>Defending champion Van Nuys (14-1 overall, 12-0 in league) and West
Valley League champion Woodland Hills Taft (12-0, 10-0) were awarded
the top two seedings in the City Section girls' volleyball playoffs
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sylmar (13-2, 10-2), runner-up to Van Nuys in the Valley Mission
League, was seeded third and Marine League champion San Pedro (11-1,
10-0) fourth in the 16-team tournament, which begins Tuesday. Eastern
League champion L.A. Garfield (14-1, 14-0) was seeded fifth, followed
by West Valley runner-up Granada Hills (11-2, 8-2) and Western League
champion Palisades (13-0, 12-0), a finalist last year. Sunset Six
champion Tujunga Verdugo Hills (11-1, 9-1) was seeded eighth.</LD>
<LD>   *Carson, winner of the last two City Section girls' tennis titles,
was seeded third behind Granada Hills and Palisades.</LD>
<TE>   The Colts (13-0 overall, 10-0 in league) won the Marine League but
it was determined by a committee of representatives and coaches that
West Valley League champion Granada Hills (13-0, 10-0) and Western
League champion Palisades (13-0, 12-0) be seeded first and second,
respectively, based on strength of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills, which lost to Carson in the finals the last two
years, was seeded first unanimously and earned a first-round bye in
the 12-team City tournament, as did Palisades, Carson and No. 4 North
Hollywood (12-1, 6-0), champion of the Sunset Six League.
Fifth-seeded Westchester, No. 6 Reseda Cleveland, No. 7 L.A. Marshall

<TE>   Van Nuys Grant running back Anthony Dickson will play in tonight's
Sunset Six League game against Tujunga Verdugo Hills after getting
injured in each of the Lancers' last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson, who has rushed for 1,133 yards this season, suffered a
hip pointer after one carry in Grant's 25-22 victory last week over
North Hollywood. He injured his left ankle after two carries in the
Lancers' win over Sun Valley Poly the week before.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't ready last weekend," Grant Coach Bill Foster said.
"[Thursday] was the first day he practiced this week but he did some
light running on Wednesday. He's probably 85% to 90%."</TE>
<TE>   Grant is 6-2 overall and leads the Sunset Six with a 3-0 record.
Verdugo Hills is 3-4-1 and 2-1 in league.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we realized we're a true team," Foster said. "We're not
looking to rely on one guy to make a play."</TE>

<LD>A big first quarter made the difference for Orange Lutheran, which
claimed at least a share of the Empire League title with a 56-51
victory over La Palma Kennedy on Thursday night at Anaheim Western
High.</LD>
<LD>   The Lancers (7-2, 4-0) won their seventh consecutive game as they
took advantage of good field position on their first two possessions,
starting at the Kennedy 35-yard line after a 35-yard punt return, and
at the Kennedy eight after an interception, to build a 14-0 lead.</LD>
<LD>   As good as Lutheran was, though, Lancer quarterback Casey Whieldon
was overshadowed by Kennedy junior Robert Becker, who netted zero
yards passing in the first quarter but set or tied four school
single-game passing records. Becker completed 29 of 45 passes for 419
yards, all Kennedy records, and tied another mark with five touchdown
passes.</LD>
<TE>   Lutheran led 42-24 at halftime, largely on the strength of
Whieldon and junior receiver Anthony Vernaglia. The pair connected on
five touchdown passes, four of them in the first half. Vernaglia
finished with six catches for 224 yards and the five touchdown
catches, a school record. Whieldon completed 10 of 19 passes for 320
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy (5-4, 2-2) scored on its first play of the third quarter
after a Lancer fumble gave them the ball at the Lutheran 24. After
Whieldon passed to Vernaglia for the fifth touchdown to make the
score 49-31, Becker passed to Blake Calabrese for a 72-yard scoring
play to make it 49-38. Calabrese caught 10 passes for 263 yards, a
school single-game record for receiving yardage.</TE>
<TE>   After combining for 107 points in three quarters, neither team
scored in the fourth. Lutheran finished with a 586-436 edge in total
offense.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Maddy</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs Sante Fe 21, Whittier La Serna 0 -- Adam Sandoval
rushed for 86 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries and became Santa
Fe's career rushing leader as he led the Chiefs in a Del Rio League
victory at California High in Whittier. Sandoval has 2,091 yards,
eclipsing the mark of 2,049 set by Leon Verstegen from 1972-1973.</TE>
<TE>   Sante Fe (7-2, 4-0), ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section Division
VII poll, scored three touchdowns in a five-minute span during the
second quarter to take control of the game and clinch a tie for the
league title.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Danny Banzet threw touchdown passes of six and 72
yards to Josh Yost and Nathan Kimbrough, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Kimbrough had four receptions for 148 yards and he also had an
interception.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second shutout in four games for Sante Fe, which has
given up only 22 points in four league victories. La Serna is 6-3,
2-2.</TE>

<HD>Basketball Has Been Like Dream for Quinn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When two boys decide to invite a girl to join their basketball team,
it usually means the girl is pretty good.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Wilkes and Fred Washington were first-graders at Westchester
Lutheran School in 1991 when they saw the new girl, Noelle Quinn,
shooting baskets.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately, she was added to their team.</LD>
<TE>   And what a team it became.</TE>
<TE>   "It was called the 'Dream Team,' " Quinn said. "We'd play the
whole school, us against everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Added Wilkes: "Somehow, every recess and lunch, we'd find a way to
win. We dismantled everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Predicting how a 6-year-old might turn out in sports is as
difficult as picking winning lottery ticket numbers. But in this
case, everyone hit the jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Quinn will sign with UCLA, Wilkes with Kansas and
Washington with Stanford, proving that they really were a "dream
team."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn and Washington attend Torrance Bishop Montgomery High and
Wilkes goes to L.A. Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   The three have stayed close friends and marvel how each became a
basketball standout.</TE>
<TE>   "Thinking back on it and where we are now," Quinn said, "that was
the foundation where we started."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the 5-foot-11 Quinn has surpassed the boys in
achievements because of her two-sport focus. She has led the Bishop
Montgomery girls' basketball team to three consecutive Division III
state championships. In volleyball, she has played on two Southern
Section finalist teams. She might be the best two-sport female
athlete in California, although basketball will be her college sport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost amazing to think that [volleyball] is her second
sport because they know she's an All-American basketball player, but
I don't see any reason she can't be an All-American volleyball player
too," Bishop Montgomery volleyball Coach Kim Willeman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the boys haven't fared too badly, either. Washington has
played on two state Division III championship teams and three section
title teams. Wilkes helped Loyola win the Division I-A championship
last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They've gotten a lot better," Quinn said of her former teammates.
"I'm so proud to see everyone doing well."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes and Washington sensed Quinn's uniqueness from an early age
because she is different. She follows in the tradition of her
favorite player, Magic Johnson, in making sure she's always having
fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a passion for me," she said. "I love it so much. On the
basketball court, [Magic] always got his team involved and when it's
his turn, he'll take over a game. He's always entertaining the crowd,
and that's what I like to do."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just on the court where Quinn excels. In the classroom,
she's an A student and could have chosen Stanford as her college. She
has received strong support from her mother, Golden, a sixth-grade
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things inspire me," Quinn said. "My friends inspire me
to do good. My family is always inspiring me. I have little nieces
who I'm a role model for. That inspires me."</TE>
<TE>   In this era of specialization, some assumed Quinn would have
dropped volleyball by now to focus on basketball. But volleyball has
helped her improve skills for basketball, such as jumping. And she
would never think of letting teammates down by quitting a sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she felt she helped build something in volleyball and
wanted to follow through," basketball Coach Lisa Cooper said. "For
her to quit volleyball knowing her team counted on her, that wouldn't
have made her happy."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Quinn averaged 21.9 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.8 steals
and 2.3 blocks. She impressed college recruiters at a prestigious
summer camp. She has been dribbling a basketball since she was 3. She
can rebound, hit three-pointers, drive and make pinpoint passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball has always been there since I can remember," she said.
"It's like a part of me. God wanted me to play basketball. It teaches
you a lot about life. You have to learn to work with other people."</TE>
<TE>   The "Dream Team" won't discuss who'd win a one-on-one game, but
understand that Wilkes and Washington have complete confidence in
Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   "She's still one of the greats," Wilkes said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Washington: "She's like a female [Michael] Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn has every intention of following through with something she
has done since the first grade.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what," she said, "I promise I'll always have a smile."</TE>

<LD>Bettors who love place and show wagers will have two of their
favorite horses running tonight, one of two Friday night cards during
Hollywood Park's autumn meet.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Murphy, a 3-year-old Storm Creek gelding owned by David and
Holly Wilson and trained by Vladimir Cerin, has yet to win as he
makes his 15th start in the fifth, a $43,000 maiden event at one mile
on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Mayor has been popular with the place and show crowd,
having finished second or third seven times. He will be ridden by
Tyler Baze for the first time and is the 4-1 second choice on Russ
Hudak's morning line.</LD>
<TE>   Two races later, El Curioso, a $46,000 optional claimer, will try
for his fourth lifetime win in his 39th start at 5 1/2 furlongs on
the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Red Baron's Barn and trained by Darrell Vienna, the
5-year-old El Gran Senor gelding is 0 for 23 since the beginning of
2001, but has been second or third 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   Winless in nine races on the Hollywood Park turf, El Curioso, 4-1
on the line, has been the runner-up four times and third three times.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Roxelana and Freefourracing, who are a combined
10 for 20, will get together in theninth at Churchill Downs. The
$58,200 optional claimer is at 6 1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jockey Jean-Luc Samyn, who has six wins in 17 mounts at
Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jockey Robby Albarado, who has three wins in 47 mounts
at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Farah Love and Milagra in
the fourth, singling Value Play in the fifth and using Majesterical,
Wheaton One and Restless Warrior in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/4. Money: Previous day/meet

makes his NHL debut.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, 31, had targeted this date for weeks -- it comes eight
weeks to the day since his surgery -- while Cammalleri, 20, was a lot
less certain.</LD>
<TE>   One of the last players cut in training camp, the highly touted
Cammalleri remained with the Kings' American Hockey League team in
Manchester, N.H., while first Derek Armstrong and later Steve Kelly
were recalled by the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri finally got the call Wednesday night. While Kelly was
headed back to Manchester, Cammalleri awoke Thursday at 5 a.m., took
a cab to Boston for a flight to Ottawa and arrived just before
practice, devouring an energy bar before stepping onto the ice at the
Corel Centre.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped that I could go down there and work hard and be back here
soon," Cammalleri said, "so I'm excited about the chance."</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to play on the No. 1 line with Ziggy Palffy and
Adam Deadmarsh. "He's here because we need him," Coach Andy Murray
said. "He's here because we expect him to help us. And if he helps
us, he'll stay."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's return definitely should help. A U.S. Olympian in Salt
Lake City, he and captain Mattias Norstrom were the Kings' top
defensemen last season. "I haven't played a hockey game in six
months, so it's going to be trial by error," he said.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Getting Ready to Play to His Strength</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal has gained four inches on his already massive chest
and biceps, and opposing players have the league commissioner to
thank.</LD>
<LD>   For all of his might, O'Neal has never been a dedicated
weightlifter. Instead, he'd trained on the court, telling trainers
he'd get into basketball shape by playing basketball, and there was
little arguing with who already was the strongest man in the history
of the game.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 seasons of abuse generally ignored by referees, as he has
seen it, O'Neal walked into a weight room going on three months ago,
and has barely been out since. His biceps have increased to 22 1/2
inches. His shoulders are rounded and defined. His chest is thick.</LD>
<TE>   Uh-oh.</TE>
<TE>   "Since David Stern allows the rest of the league to treat me like
a WWF wrestler, then I must look like a WWF wrestler," O'Neal said
Thursday about the NBA commissioner. "For real. I'm the WWF's best
NBA player. I'm going to get real big and real strong. I'll become
the Undertaker of the NBA. You know who that is, right? You ever seen
him?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal intends to practice Sunday and Monday and the team will
determine Tuesday whether he can play that night against the Atlanta
Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   While the Lakers wait on that, Rick Fox returns tonight against
the Washington Wizards. He was suspended for the first six games of
the season because he fought with Sacramento's Doug Christie during
an exhibition game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an expensive $300,000 vacation," said Fox, who watched
Thursday's game on television.</TE>
<TE>   The suspension was without pay.</TE>

12 minutes, scored two points and the next day went to the injured
list for the remainder of his comeback season. Jordan is coming off
the bench for the Wizards, whom many view as a playoff team after
adding Jerry Stackhouse, Larry Hughes and Charles Oakley. Ty Lue and
Kwame Brown also have had strong starts to the season.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Fires, but Lakers Fall Back</HD>
<DH>In Celtics' 98-95 overtime victory, Bryant takes an
astounding 47 shots, misses 30, and scores 41 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant took 47 shots Thursday night and the Lakers were only too
glad he did.</LD>
<LD>   They lost and Bryant took 47 shots and the only question later was
why he hadn't taken a 48th, because maybe that would have fallen and
maybe they wouldn't have lost another game.</LD>
<LD>   They lost to the Boston Celtics, in overtime, 98-95, before a
FleetCenter crowd that first booed Bryant's every touch, and then
gasped, and then covered its eyes. Standing amid a lineup that
wouldn't shoot straight, Bryant made 17 shots and scored 41 points,
most isolated on a wing against Paul Pierce, 18 in a frantic third
quarter that saw the Lakers come back from what once was a 17-point
deficit.</LD>
<TE>   For six games, Bryant's game has lurched from shooter to
facilitator and back, settling finally in a taut second half in which
the Lakers led with a minute left in regulation and again early in
the overtime, only to lose both leads.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Bryant said he did not regret his choices, as he had in
a season opener in which he took 29 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It is what it is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He made eight of 13 attempts in the third quarter, then three of
15 in the fourth. He missed all eight three-point attempts. Only
three Los Angeles Lakers had attempted more shots, including Elgin
Baylor, who took 55 in a game 41 years ago. Bryant's 28 second-half
attempts tied Baylor's record for a half.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's last shot, a heave from the left side to tie the score
with time running out, hit the side of the rim. He grimaced and
walked the length of the court, while confetti fell around him, and
Celtics hugged behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce scored 28 points. Tony Delk had 26. Pierce had scored on a
step-back three-pointer to give the Celtics a 96-93 lead in overtime
and then Bryant had made a 15-foot turn-around. Delk made two free
throws with 9.3 seconds left for a three-point lead, and finally
Bryant stood out on the left side with time dwindling away, having
missed his first seven from that far, and no one doubting he'd shoot
it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a limitation to what you can do," Laker Coach Phil
Jackson said after the rest of the Lakers made 20 of 48 shots. "I was
telling the team that he carried us back into the ballgame. You've
got to stop going to the well all the time. The well will run dry
eventually. Somebody has to start contributing."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson did not disagree that Bryant had little choice. After the
Lakers scored 70 points in Cleveland, they shot 32.5% and scored 35
points in the first half against the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Open teammates are nice and all, but they're fairly useless if
they can't make a jump shot, and so arrived Bryant at the second
half. For the better part of four games, Bryant took the floor,
leaving Shaquille O'Neal on the bench, with the intention of setting
up shots and spit-shining the triangle offense.</TE>
<TE>   After consecutive triple-doubles and a close encounter with a
third, Bryant took back the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight it was really out of necessity," Bryant said. "We were
down 15 points [at halftime]. I think a lot of my teammates were
discouraged and looking for direction to put the ball in the hole. We
weren't shooting the ball very well. It was my job to come out and
instill confidence in everybody else that we could come back and we
can make shots and we can win the game."</TE>
<TE>   It became Bryant's game, without question, and he took it to
Pierce and the Celtics without a second thought. A week and a half
before, he was criticized for taking those 29 shots against the San
Antonio Spurs. This time, he missed 30.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he would have been surprised if 47 shots weren't a
message from Bryant to his teammates, that if they weren't going to
make shots and the team was going to score 70 points again, then he'd
take them all.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Bryant said, shaking his head. "But, for example, when we
played Cleveland, that wasn't the situation. Our confidence was a
little shaky, but it could be regained. Tonight, we came in at
halftime and everybody had their heads down. I told them, 'Don't
worry about it, everybody. We're going to come out in the second
half, everything's going to be all right.' So I started hitting some
shots and getting into a rhythm and everybody else started getting in
rhythm. It was good....</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guys after the game, 'Look, you don't understand, we
came up here, we played without two of our key guys, we were down 17
against a Celtics team that was in the Eastern Conference finals,
playing at full strength, and we came in here and we fought them
hard. We gave ourselves a chance to win the game. We made some mental
errors down the stretch and it cost us the ballgame. Big deal. It's
early in the season. We'll learn from our mental mistakes. Let's move
on. We got another game tomorrow night.' "</TE>

<HD>Nothing Is Fab Now for Michigan</HD>
<DH>Self-punishment for basketball scandal includes removing
banners, probation and repaying NCAA money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Michigan banners from the 1992 and '93 Final Fours are coming
down in dishonor.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade after the beginnings of a booster scandal that
allegedly led to $616,000 in loans and payments to Wolverine players,
Michigan tried to hasten the end of the saga Thursday by announcing
dramatic, self-imposed penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Michigan will ban its men's basketball team from postseason play
in 2003, return $450,000 in NCAA tournament income and forfeit
victories from six seasons in which it used ineligible players. The
university also will put the program on two years' probation and
order the removal of four banners, including those from the 1997
National Invitation Tournament and '98 Big Ten tournament, from
Crisler Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The postseason ban, in reality, is not much of a penalty. With a
team that was 11-18 last season, it probably will mean no more than
turning down an NIT bid.</TE>
<TE>   But expunging the records and lowering the banners recognizing the
so-called "Fab Five" era led by Chris Webber -- the Sacramento King
star who faces perjury charges related to the federal investigation
of booster and convicted gambler Ed Martin -- is a blow to Michigan's
image of itself.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day of great shame for the university," Michigan
President Mary Sue Coleman said at a news conference Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I am determined that nothing like this will ever happen again at
Michigan.... Let me say once again, loud and clear: Integrity is
Michigan's top priority."</TE>
<TE>   The penalties stem from a series of investigations that began in
1996, eventually uncovering ties between Webber, Robert Traylor,
Maurice Taylor and Louis Bullock to Martin, a retired autoworker who
ran an illegal lottery.</TE>
<TE>   Martin pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to launder money,
admitting he took funds from the gambling operation and loaned them
to players and their families beginning while some of the players
were still in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said he gave $280,000 to Webber and his family, as well as
smaller but still significant sums to Traylor ($160,000), Taylor
($105,000) and Bullock ($71,000.)</TE>
<TE>   By imposing significant sanctions, Michigan is seeking to avoid
harsher penalties from the NCAA, which issued a formal letter of
inquiry last month. Michigan is awaiting a hearing with the
infractions committee.</TE>
<TE>   But because Michigan and the NCAA have worked unusually closely in
the investigation and because much of the evidence carries the
authority of federal proceedings, there might be less dispute about
the facts and appropriate penalties than in other cases.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," Athletic Director Bill Martin said. "We trust
that they will look at the sanctions that we have imposed. As
President Coleman said, we looked at this situation in light of other
infraction cases that occurred around the country. The penalties and
sanctions that we imposed on ourselves are consistent with them and
they are very serious. To me, taking down the banners really got to
me this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan probably most wants to avoid scholarship reductions,
because that would affect upcoming seasons and a coach and players
years removed from the violations.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the scholarship issue, but we didn't impose any
scholarship reductions on the program for principally the reason that
the NCAA looks at reduction of scholarships when there has been a
recruitment infraction," Martin said. "This is not a recruitment
infraction; this is an extra-benefit situation."</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Amaker, beginning his second season as coach, said he is
relieved to have at least the beginnings of a resolution. (Michigan
will add two years to the five-year contract Amaker signed last year
to compensate for the two-year probation.)</TE>
<TE>   "Our kids [are] very disappointed and have every right to be,"
Amaker said. "They're also very mature and realize that they came to
the university for a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that there is some clear direction, we feel very good about
it. I think our kids feel some relief, but also some anger and
disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   With the season beginning later this month and recruiting at
stake, Michigan still must await a decision by the NCAA on whether to
accept the penalties or impose additional sanctions. That decision
probably will come in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the last page of the story," Martin said. "But it is
the beginning of the last chapter."</TE>

<HD>Trailblazer Bernstein Hopes for Strong Finish</HD>

<LD>Kenny Bernstein, the most successful combination top-fuel and funny
car driver in drag racing history, probably will make the final pass
of his 32-year career behind the wheel of the Budweiser King top-fuel
dragster sometime Sunday afternoon at Pomona Raceway.</LD>
<LD>   He hopes it will be in the final round of the Auto Club NHRA
Finals. And he hopes it will be against Larry Dixon, Don Prudhomme's
driver, who spoiled Bernstein's hope of winning a seventh National
Hot Rod Assn. championship in his last year. Dixon clinched his first
title two weeks ago in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Bernstein, 58, the only driver to win NHRA championships in both
nitro classes, won four funny car titles from 1985 to '88 and
top-fuel titles in 1996 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   His greatest accomplishment, he believes, is being the first
driver to break the 300-mph barrier in a dragster, which he did with
a 301.70 mph run in 1992 at Gainesville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a real milestone," he said. "I don't think we'll see the
400-mile barrier in my lifetime. I can't even foresee us running much
faster than we are now."</TE>
<TE>   The 300-mph run has become commonplace in both top fuel and funny
cars the last 10 years, but Bernstein is still the leader. He holds
the NHRA record of 332.18 mph set last year at Mohnton, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be my last hurrah, but I've got more things to do before
I bow out," he said. "I want to win another Budweiser Shootout on
Saturday and I want to win my final race on Sunday. Along the way,
I'd like to beat Larry. He and [crew chief] Dick LaHaie have had a
great year. They deserve everything they have accomplished, but it
would be great if I could beat them one last time."</TE>
<TE>   (Trivia note: Bernstein's crew chief, Tim Richards, is LaHaie's
son-in-law. Richards' wife, Kim, crewed her father's NHRA
championship season in 1987, and is now the clutch specialist for
Bernstein's dragster.)</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein is top-seeded in the eight-driver Shootout field, a
bonus event for the season's quickest top qualifiers. Others in the
event, which pays $100,000 to the winner, are Dixon, last year's
winner; Doug Kalitta, Tony Schumacher, Cory McClenathan, Andrew
Cowin, Doug Herbert and Darrell Russell.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein won the Shootout in 1991 and 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens, this is it," Bernstein said as the final hours
of his "Forever Red" retirement tour approached. "I'm turning the
Budweiser King over to [son] Brandon right after Pomona. I'll be
around, taking a hands-on approach with the car, but Brandon will be
behind the wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon, after driving a top-alcohol dragster in 2001, did not
compete this year. Instead, he has worked with the Budweiser King
crew to familiarize himself with the team's operation.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll probably be a lot of emotion when I pull to the starting
line for the first round Sunday. But when we run our last round, no
matter which round it is, we'll be happy to pass the helmet and fire
suit to Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great run."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR</TE>
<TE>   Although Tony Stewart has not won a NASCAR Winston Cup race at
Phoenix International Raceway since 1999, he rates it as one of his
favorite tracks. He has been racing there since 1993 in a variety of
cars.</TE>
<TE>   It could become his all-time favorite if he clinches his first
Winston Cup championship there Sunday in the Checker Auto Parts 500.
With a 112-point lead over old-timer Mark Martin, Stewart could sew
up the title and its $3.75-million payoff by winning Sunday if Martin
finished 26th or worse in the 43-car field.</TE>
<TE>   Or, if he won and Martin finished 13th or worse, all Stewart would
need to become champion would be to start in the season finale Nov.
17 at Homestead, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and his Jack Roush-owned team are still smarting from a
25-point penalty for having an illegal spring in his No. 6 Viagra
Ford after finishing second to Johnny Benson last week in Rockingham,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we got the death sentence for shoplifting," said
Martin, twice before a Winston Cup runner-up. "Everyone in the garage
knows that it was an honest mistake and provided absolutely zero
advantage at the track. This is a pretty steep penalty for what is
essentially a meaningless violation."</TE>
<TE>   Roush has until Wednesday to file an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart first drove a Silver Crown car on the Phoenix Mile in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has run Indy Racing League cars, USAC midgets and
supermodifieds as well as the Home Depot Pontiac in Winston Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I won there in a midget in January 2000," Stewart said. "I ran
against Jason Leffler, Davey Hamilton, Ryan Newman, Dave Steele,
Billy Boat, all the USAC regulars. I drove for Steve Lewis, the same
guy that I won with at Irwindale two years ago on Turkey Night.</TE>
<TE>   "With every division of car that I've run at Phoenix, I've ended
up running a different line. With that, I've learned a lot about that
racetrack and where the sweet spots are. You learn about all the
bumps and where they are on the racetrack. You learn about the spots
that have more grip than other spots, or, depending on how your car
is driving, a place where you can go to change the balance of your
car."</TE>
<TE>   Non-Winged Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   Two-time defending champion Richard Griffin and U.S. Auto Club
Silver Crown champion J.J. Yeley will battle this weekend for the
championship in Ron Shuman's Non-Winged Sprint Car World tour at
Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix. Griffin leads Yeley, 651-613, with
races tonight and Saturday night as part of the Western World
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   It took 2 hours 6 minutes to complete 100 laps in the Oval
Nationals last Saturday night at Perris Auto Speedway, but only
15.934 seconds for Concord's Damion Gardner to lap the half-mile clay
oval in qualifying. It was the first sub-16 second lap at the
6-year-old facility.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Kaeding, who won $30,000 in the Oval Nationals, will be
looking to avenge last year's Western World disappointment. He led
every lap, except the last one. Jeremy Sherman's last-lap pass won
the race.</TE>
<TE>   Perris will hold its final stock car program Saturday night with
five classes of action. The 50-lap Kendoll Classic sprint car race
will end the season on Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Ned Yost, the Milwaukee Brewers' new manager and an avid NASCAR
fan, will wear No. 3 next season in honor of his close friend Dale
Earnhardt, who was killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500....
Lee Hatch, an eight-time Grand National karting champion from Covina,
won a 200-lap Mechanix Wear Speed Truck Challenge last Saturday night
in Las Vegas. Hatch was a wire-to-wire winner to earn
rookie-of-the-year honors with four wins. He also finished only 13
points behind champion Randy Brown of West Covina.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Foyt IV, grandson of the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner,
has passed his Indy Racing League driver's test and has been named to
drive in next year's IRL season as a teammate of Brazilian Airton
Dare. Foyt IV, who won the Indy Racing Infiniti Pro series this year,
lapped Texas Motor Speedway at 215 mph to complete his test.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim and San Diego will become part of the THQ World Supercross
GP championship next year, it was announced by Clear Channel,
operators of the AMA supercross series. The season will open Dec. 7
in Geneva, Switzerland, with another race in Arnhem, Holland, before
coming to the United States. Events are scheduled Jan. 4, Jan. 18 and
Feb. 1 at Edison Field, and Feb. 8 at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>

<HD>Szczerbiak's Back, but Garnett Shines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting Wally Szczerbiak back in the lineup made it that much easier
for Kevin Garnett.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett scored 28 points and tied a career high and franchise
record with 24 rebounds, and Szczerbiak returned from a foot injury
and scored 19 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Milwaukee
Bucks, 114-110, Thursday night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett scored 13 points and had 10 rebounds during a fourth
quarter that featured nine lead changes and four ties.</LD>
<TE>   His biggest rebound came in the final seconds, an offensive board
with the Timberwolves leading, 112-110. Garnett tipped the ball over
to Troy Hudson, who clinched the game by making two free throws with
0.7 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota benefited from Szczerbiak's return. He made six of 13
shots from the field in 35 minutes in his first game since injuring
his left foot Oct. 8 in an exhibition game against the Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Sam Cassell scored 22 of his 32 points in the first
half and Ray Allen added 18 of his 27 in the third quarter.
Milwaukee's Toni Kukoc was ejected with 5:54 remaining in the second
quarter after picking up two quick technical fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 89, Denver 63 -- Chauncey Billups scored 21 points,
including five three-point baskets, to help the Pistons win at
Denver. Billups, who starred at Denver's George Washington High,
keyed a 9-0 run in the third quarter that padded the lead to 58-37.</TE>

<HD>King Pitches His Heavyweights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For his next extravaganza, Don King is offering four fighters for a
series that might lead the survivor to the man he calls the emperor
of boxing -- World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   The fighters include four-time champion Evander Holyfield, top
contender Chris Byrd and World Boxing Assn. champion John Ruiz. The
fourth is Roy Jones Jr., the former middleweight champion and current
light-heavyweight champion who is moving up in weight.</LD>
<LD>   After he knocked out Mike Tyson last June, Lewis declared himself
unimpressed with the credentials of Byrd, the No. 1 contender, and
summarily surrendered the International Boxing Federation
championship. Lewis was convinced by King, and the promoter's
$1-million payoff, that it was the right thing to do.</LD>
<TE>   Armed with a vacant championship, King moved Thursday by matching
Holyfield and Byrd for the IBF title Dec. 14 in Atlantic City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of his heavyweight plan is set for March 1 in Las
Vegas when Jones will fight Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   King rented the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza Hotel in New York for
the announcement, giving notice that this was a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, scheduled to work as a commentator on the telecasts, was
making no promises.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you after I see them box," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   King talked about the two fights as a heavyweight series but
admitted that, for the moment, they are separate entities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying anyone is signed for a unification," he said.
"But we're hopeful."</TE>
<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   Points leader Greg Biffle didn't ease off despite a seemingly safe
lead in the NASCAR Busch series and won the pole for the Bashas'
Supermarkets 200 at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle leads Jason Keller by 212 points entering Saturday's event
at Phoenix International Raceway. Keller wound up fourth on the grid.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle qualified at 132.193 mph. Two-time Busch champion Randy
LaJoie got the outside of the front row after qualifying his
Chevrolet at 132.194. Winston Cup regular Jeff Burton, a five-time
winner for Roush in Busch competition this season, qualified fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Crawford will try to overcome a 68-point championship deficit
entering the next-to-final race of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
season when he starts today's Chevy Silverado 150 race at Phoenix
from the pole position. Crawford, Thursday's final qualifier, posted
an average speed of 128.329 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford qualified four spots ahead of championship leader Mike
Bliss, who'll start fifth in the 150-lap, 150-mile race. NASCAR
Winston Cup Series driver Kevin Harvick qualified third.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Evernham ended his one-year association with Ultra
Motorsports, effectively costing 22-year-old driver Casey Atwood a
permanent Winston Cup ride.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Leffler, who raced on the Winston Cup series last season for
Chip Ganassi and spent all of this year driving in the truck series
for Ultra owner Jim Smith, will drive the team's car this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Evernham had teamed with Smith this season to field the No. 7
Dodge, a partnership primarily designed to give Atwood a ride.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith decided to replace Atwood in the car, beginning with
this weekend's race in Phoenix, so the two car owners ended their
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian father is suing the New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Assn.
in Toronto after his 16-year-old son failed to win the league's
most-valuable- player award.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Croteau is seeking about $200,000 in psychological and
punitive damages from the association. Croteau told the Globe and
Mail newspaper that Steven was so crushed when another player won the
award at a banquet in March that he lost his desire to play. The
league's nine coaches or managers select the MVP, and voting results
are not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Angel Cabrera birdied his last four holes on the way to an
eight-under-par 63 in the first round of the Volvo Masters at
Sotogrande, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera has a four-shot lead over Phillip Price of Wales. Five
players are at 68. Cabrera's round was one shot off the course record
at Valderrama of 62 set by Bernhard Langer in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen shot a 73 and Padraig Harrington shot a 74.</TE>
<TE>   Former Wimbledon junior champion Angelique Widjaja took advantage
of a string of unforced errors to defeat Sandra Kleinova, 6-4, 6-1,
to advance to the quarterfinals of the Volvo Women's Open at Pattaya,
Thailand. Widjaja, 17, next meets Shinobu Asagoe, who defeated
Anastassia Rodionova, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Lina Krasnoroutskaya and
eighth-seeded Silvija Talaja also advanced.</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green men's basketball Coach Dan Dakich, who left for West
Virginia in April only to quit and return to Bowling Green a week
later, has signed a new five-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the deal were not released. The Falcons went 24-9 last
season and played in the NIT for the second time in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Dakich walked away from a $2.5-million deal at West Virginia. He
wouldn't say why he left.</TE>
<TE>   Sailors competing in the America's Cup will be drug-tested for the
first time, race officials announced. New Zealand's Sports Drug
Agency and the International Sailing Federation are close to reaching
an agreement on measures for urine tests for both
performance-enhancing and recreational drugs on the International
Olympic Committee's banned list.</TE>
<TE>   Cup defenders Team New Zealand and eight remaining challenge teams
from six countries have welcomed the move to bring the 151-year-old
sailing event into line with other international sports.</TE>

<HD>Arizona's Boston Has Torn Tendon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pro Bowl wide receiver David Boston of the Arizona Cardinals has a
partially torn tendon in his right knee and probably will undergo
season-ending knee surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Boston is traveling to Dallas for a second opinion from specialist
Dr. James Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI on Wednesday showed two partial tears of the patella. One
was an older tear that apparently was the cause of problems Boston
had this summer and in training camp. The second tear apparently
occurred in the Cardinals' loss at San Francisco on Oct. 27.</LD>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," Boston said. "It's unfortunate that this
injury would happen now. We had eight games left and I wanted to go
out there and make enough plays to get this team to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   If Boston can't come back this season, the Cardinals will have
lost three of their top four wide receivers in the last two weeks.
Bryan Gilmore broke his right leg when he fell on camera equipment in
San Francisco and MarTay Jenkins  broke his right shoulder blade in
Sunday's loss to St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Tony Bryant, a starter with the Oakland Raiders,
will undergo a third MRI exam that will help determine whether he
will play again this season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was carted off the field after injuring his neck during
overtime in Sunday's loss to San Francisco. Bryant didn't practice
this week, and he isn't expected to play in Monday night's game at
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's agent, Peter Shaffer, denied reports that a decision has
already been made to keep the player off the field for the rest of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has rescinded the $5,000 fine on Atlanta Falcon
quarterback Michael Vick for violating its uniform dress code last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was fined because his white socks were rolled down, exposing
red undersocks from ankle to knee, against New Orleans on Oct. 27.
NFL guidelines say the exterior sock must be white at least to the
mid-lower leg.</TE>
<TE>   The league gave Vick a warning Wednesday. Such fines are common
for uniform violations, ranging from untucked jerseys to unlicensed
apparel.</TE>
<TE>   The league also decided to return its $2,500 fine of Vick for
throwing a ball into the stands against New Orleans after he scored a
touchdown and reduced that to a warning.</TE>
<TE>   Vick had appealed both fines after the league disciplined him last
week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saint reserve guard Wally Williams was suspended for
violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and will miss the next
four games. Williams is eligible to return Dec. 2.... Miami Dolphin
quarterback Ray Lucas, nursing a bruised throwing shoulder, took half
of the snaps in practice Thursday and probably will start Sunday
night against the New York Jets.... Green Bay Packer defensive end
Vonnie Holliday underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged
cartilage in his right knee. He's expected to be out of the lineup
for two to five weeks.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis' Win Streak Halted by Columbus</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riding the crest of a nine-game winning streak and returning home
following a three-game trip, St. Louis Blues Coach Joel Quenneville
suspected his team would have a tough time Thursday against the
Columbus Blue Jackets.</LD>
<LD>   He was right.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Cassels scored twice and Ray Whitney added a goal and two
assists as the Blue Jackets beat the Blues, 5-2, Thursday night at
St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   "We said this was a dangerous game coming out," Quenneville said.
"We're coming off as good as I've seen us play. Whether it was a
mental letdown or playing five games in eight days, we weren't as
effective."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis fell one game short of the club record for consecutive
victories set last season. It was the Blues' first loss since they
dropped the season opener to the Ducks. The Blues (9-2-1-0) are off
to their best start in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   After the Blue Jackets got power-play goals from Derrick Walser
and Cassels in the second period to take a 3-1 lead, St. Louis cut it
to 3-2 on Eric Boguniecki's second goal with 6:43 remaining in the
third period before the Blue Jackets pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 1, Philadelphia 0 -- Jamie Langenbrunner scored with
7:43 left and the Devils won at Philadelphia to end the Flyers'
six-game winning streak. Seconds before Langenbrunner's goal, New
Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur stopped Simon Gagne on a two-on-one
breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Minnesota 1 -- Shane Doan scored twice during Phoenix's
three-goal first period and the Coyotes won at Phoenix to hand the
Wild its first road loss. Wild goalie Manny Fernandez lasted only one
period and lost his second consecutive game after a 6-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Boston 1 -- Sergei Fedorov's goal 2:08 into overtime
gave the Red Wings the victory at Detroit. Nicklas Lidstrom, who
assisted on Fedorov's game winner, tied it at 1-1 with 9:43 left in
the third period with a power-play goal. That goal ended the Red
Wings' scoreless streak of 121:36.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 1, Calgary 0 -- Brian Leetch scored 51 seconds
into overtime, off an assist from Mark Messier, to provide the
game-winner at New York and give Dan Blackburn his first NHL shutout.
Blackburn, 19, stopped 26 shots to earn his 13th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, New York Islanders 0 -- Jose Theodore made 42 saves
for his first shutout of the season to lead the Canadiens at
Montreal. Theodore, who entered with a 4.06 goals-against average,
got his 16th career shutout despite Montreal being outshot, 42-21.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Florida 1 -- Jaromir Jagr scored a short-handed goal
at 3:56 of overtime and Olaf Kolzig made 32 saves in his first game
since a five-game absence because of a wrist injury to lead the
Capitals at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, Buffalo 0 -- Jeff O'Neill and Craig Adams scored for
Carolina and Kevin Weekes had 26 saves to record his first shutout as
the Hurricanes won at Raleigh, N.C., extending the Sabres' winless
streak to seven.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Atlanta 0 -- Jocelyn Thibault stopped 17 shots for his
second straight shutout and Tyler Arnason and Mark Bell each had a
goal and two assists for the host Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Nashville 2 -- Marcus Ragnarsson scored with 6:07
remaining in the third period to help the Sharks come back from a
two-goal deficit at San Jose.</TE>

<HD>New System May Provide the Solution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The technology used at Skate Canada to test figure skating's proposed
cumulative scoring system looked like the ultimate video game.</LD>
<LD>   As each skater performed a jump, move or spin, a technical
specialist or "caller" identified it to a computer operator, who
listed it in a column on the left side of the judges' screens. Ranged
horizontally at the bottom was a series of numbers from minus-3 to
plus-3, and each of the 14 judges touched a number to rate the
execution of each element. Judges were later allowed to review
elements they weren't sure about.</LD>
<LD>   The International Skating Union, which rated this second test a
huge success, will try it again next month at the Junior Grand Prix
Finals at The Hague, Netherlands.</LD>
<TE>   Canadian coach Louis Stong, the caller for the pairs competition,
said his doubts were quickly dispelled after seeing the system in
action. He said skaters who falter in the first phase of a
competition and have little chance to win under the current system
will have opportunities to win in the new system by building up
points with a well-balanced and executed second program.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts the kids in the driver's seat," he said. "If they do it,
they get [credit]. It doesn't matter where you skate. You're not
skating against anyone. It used to be, 'Oh my God, I'm skating first
and the judges have to hold back.' Now, it doesn't matter when you
skate....</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful for the integrity of the sport. We don't
want people to be trying jumps they can't do and then be rewarding
them for that. Then everybody would be falling all over the place.
Nor do we want everybody to be too careful. Then it's boring."</TE>
<TE>   Fears that punching in so many numbers would turn judges into
mathematicians were unwarranted, Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie said
after taking part in the test.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to think, 'Is he better than skater 17? Should I
put him between six and seven?' " Lavoie said. "I do the actual job
and the rest takes care of itself."</TE>
<TE>   Before the system is adopted, judges must be educated and judging
criteria must be clearly defined. But ISU consultant Ted Barton
believes the fundamentals are in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraged by the preliminary analysis that indicates the
system has very successfully maintained the general scoring
principles widely accepted in the skating world," he said. "That is,
providing a balanced assessment of the element content of the program
with the quality of execution and the overall performance and
presentation of the program."</TE>
<TE>   Good Skates</TE>
<TE>   Amber Corwin of Hermosa Beach, eighth at this year's U.S. figure
skating championships, will replace the injured Angela Nikodinov at
this weekend's Bofrost Cup Grand Prix event in Gelsenkirchen,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov, troubled by a bad shoulder, still hopes to compete in
the NHK Trophy competition Nov. 28-Dec. 1 in Japan. Michael Weiss,
fifth at Skate America, will compete in Germany under new coach Don
Laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Bofrost Cup will mark the Grand Prix debut of Rena Inoue and
John Baldwin, who were fourth among pairs at the U.S. championships
and can move up in the weak U.S. pair ranks. They live in Santa
Monica and train at Paramount and Aliso Viejo with Coach Jill Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Volley for Money</TE>
<TE>   Volleyball coach Toshi Yoshida had little time to enjoy the
surprising silver medal the U.S. women's team won at the recent world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he returned to Colorado Springs, he had to draft next
year's budget, knowing he won't have money for players to train
together for long periods. Because they can make good money in
Europe, many players compete there and fly back to the U.S. for brief
training sessions. Yoshida didn't have his squad set for the world
championships until a few days before the team left for a tuneup
tournament in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "Money has always been a headache," he said. "The USOC gives us
some grants for the women's program, but sometimes I feel like we
don't get much help. We perform well, so that makes it frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "Our budget for next year is going to be a little better than this
year. It always gets bigger leading to the Olympics. But to keep the
top players together through the season, you need money, and we don't
have it."</TE>
<TE>   Yoshida took over the team in January 2001, after having been an
assistant. He also coached in Sweden and Japan and was an assistant
coach of the U.S. men's team from 1979-82.</TE>
<TE>   The team's next key event is a World Cup competition in Japan next
November, a qualifying meet for the 2004 Athens Games. The top three
teams will win Olympic berths and the others must go through zone
qualifying play.</TE>
<TE>   "The zone qualifier is in December or January," Yoshida said, "and
usually in December or January, the top players play in Italy or some
other place in Europe. We can't compete with the money the
professional teams pay. Money-wise, I have no confidence we can keep
our top players together."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Hermann "the Herminator" Maier expects to miss the World Cup ski
season because of leg injuries that kept him out of the Salt Lake
City Games. Maier, who won two gold medals at Nagano in 1998, was
hurt in a motorcycle accident in August 2001. "At the moment, I can't
ski properly and it will take a long time to get back onto the snow,"
he told reporters in Europe. "Maybe next March, or even later. Things
will never be the same again."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. domestic Alpine ski season begins Wednesday with the
Super Series at Loveland Basin, Colo. There will be two women's giant
slalom races and two men's slalom races.</TE>
<TE>   The first of three fall World Cup long-track speedskating
competitions starts Saturday at Hamar, Norway. Jennifer Rodriguez,
who won bronze in the 1,000 and 1,500 at Salt Lake City, and Derek
Parra of San Bernardino, who won gold in the 1,500 and silver in the
5,000, lead the allround teams. Chris Witty, who won gold in the
1,000 at Salt Lake City, leads the women's sprint team.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Athletics Federations ratified sprinter
Tim Montgomery's 100-meter world record of 9.78 seconds, set Sept. 14
in Paris.</TE>

<HD>Fishing Trip a Success All the Way to the Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Hurricane Kenna spun eastward and slammed into the Mexican
mainland, Andy Cates knew he would have clear motoring to Hurricane
Bank, a high spot rising from an otherwise seemingly bottomless
ocean.</LD>
<LD>   His only real worry was sharks.</LD>
<LD>   Located 1,000 miles south of Point Loma and more than 300 miles
west of Mexico, the seamount is one of the more remote destinations
on the charts of San Diego sportfishing captains. It takes four days
just to get there.</LD>
<TE>   "It's only one spot in the middle of nowhere so it's a real
gamble," said Cates, skipper of the Red Rooster III, which runs from
Lee Palm Sportfishers. "You always have the weather to worry about.
Then the fish have to be there and sharks have to not be there."</TE>
<TE>   For Cates and his 22 passengers, on a 14-day trip that ended
Sunday, the gamble paid off. The weather was good, the sharks were
conspicuously absent and the fish, in this case giant yellowfin tuna
and highly prized wahoo, were there in numbers enough to make the
first long-range trip of the season a notable success.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers boated only 145 tuna and 135 wahoo, but the tuna
were dream size, most weighing 100 pounds or more and seven topping
200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Farrell, a carpenter from Oceanside, brought home 650 pounds
of fillets for the smoker and barbecue, and traded the rest at the
landing for processed tuna.</TE>
<TE>   "We each got 164 cans," said Farrell, who took the trip with Chuck
Forester, a friend from Montana. "I'll be eating tuna salad for quite
a while."</TE>
<TE>   Farrell and Forester were among those boating 200-pounders. Their
fish, weighing 201 and 203 pounds, respectively, were caught on squid
fished under a kite. The jackpot went to Joe Stickles of Tustin,
whose tuna weighed 228 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a downside, it was the arrival midway through the
trip of a commercial purse-seine boat, which made a significant haul
before moving on.</TE>
<TE>   "We scratched for our fish after that," Farrell said. "But they
were all quality fish, weighing more than 100 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cates is among a dozen or so long-range skippers embarking on an
uncertain season. Midway through last season, the Mexican government
banned fishing at the bountiful Revillagigedo Island chain.</TE>
<TE>   An equally remote destination 160 miles east of Hurricane Bank,
the Revillagigedos have long been the mainstay of the highly
specialized fishing boats, which were designed to offer passenger
comfort for weeks on end.</TE>
<TE>   Vessels were built almost specifically to fish the Revillagigedos,
which are within a biosphere reserve and were closed to fishing last
year after a push by environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the fleet's representatives continue to argue that it
poses no threat to the resident sea life at the islands and is
interested only in catching migratory tuna and wahoo, the captains
and crews are left with few alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest beyond Hurricane Bank is basically Clipperton
Island," Cates said of the French-owned atoll off the coast of
Central America. "But it's the same gamble and it's another 800 miles
farther away."</TE>
<TE>   Some have added Clipperton to their schedules this season, while
at the same time shortening some of their trips to eight or 10 days
to catch mostly smaller tuna at the banks off southern Baja
California.</TE>
<TE>   The most creative altering of schedules, however, was done by Tim
Ekstrom and Randy Toussaint, owners of the Royal Star.</TE>
<TE>   Their boat, which books out of Fisherman's Landing, is traveling
to Panama in January and will stay through much of February. It has
already sold out its three eight-day trips for 2003 and has added
five for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always felt [Revillagigedo Islands] were on thin ice and
had our sights set on Panama for quite a while," Toussaint said.</TE>
<TE>   The Royal Star will fish the prolific Hannibal Bank but will also
venture offshore to target tuna known to reach nearly 300 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "From what we hear, the offshore fishery there has never really
been tapped," Toussaint said.</TE>
<TE>   As with some of the Revillagigedo Island trips, customers will fly
down and fly back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ten-day trips off Baja can be highly productive but the tuna
usually run smaller. Three boats returned this week from the shorter
excursions with fish averaging 60-90 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The top three fish aboard the Excel weighed 175, 162 and 131
pounds. A 107-pounder was caught aboard the Polaris Supreme; a
97-pounder was put on the Qualifier 105, and a 103-pounder was logged
by the Apollo on a five-day excursion to Guadalupe Island.</TE>
<TE>   Quitting Time</TE>
<TE>   A change in the weather throughout the Eastern Sierra -- from cool
and tolerable to white and wintry -- will effectively bring an end to
the general trout season.</TE>
<TE>   In Mono County, the season was extended by 15 days through Nov. 15
this year to provide a boost for businesses during the lull between
summer and winter.</TE>
<TE>   Business on recent weekends has been fairly brisk, and fishing has
been good, but many concessionaires have pulled their boats and docks
and stopped stocking their shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to stay open hopefully until the 15th, unless the
snow around the lake gets really bad," said Pam Schneider, manager at
Gull Lake on the June Lake Loop. "We have only a minimal amount of
boats available but we can always put more in [the water] if we get
busy."</TE>
<TE>   She was more optimistic than most. John Frederickson, manager at
nearby June Lake, pulled his fleet Wednesday afternoon while eyeing
an ominous darkening of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "We're closing down," he said. "In fact, that's the problem with
this experiment. If we don't get our equipment stored before there's
snow on the ground, it'll be that much more difficult to move it
around."</TE>
<TE>   Top catches on the loop this week included a six-pound brown trout
by Greg Larson of San Pedro at Grant Lake; and a 4 1/2-pound brown
landed by Josh Levasheff of Redondo Beach at Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Fishy Business</TE>
<TE>   Among winners of last week's Los Cabos Billfish Tournament at Cabo
San Lucas, unless they get caught, were three gunmen who made away
with more than $100,000 intended for the winning anglers.</TE>
<TE>   The unmasked bandits reportedly ambushed organizers inside the
office of the hotel association, which has run the tournament since
its inception four years ago. Nobody was seriously hurt and the
association made good on tournament payouts. Authorities are
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Reuben Sanchez, the Los Cabos Hotel Assn. bookkeeper who was
present during the robbery, did not respond to an interview request
made through his office.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the winning team, out of 51 entries, earned
$289,925, thanks largely to a 323-pound blue marlin -- the
tournament's only billfish meeting the 300-pound minimum -- landed by
Yuri Shida of Hidalgo, Texas, aboard the vessel Finish Line. A
Newport Beach team aboard John Pentz's Reel &amp; Deal won $22,250 for
releasing the most marlin -- five.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the tournament paid out $400,000 in cash and prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Blasting Off</TE>
<TE>   Duck hunters could hardly wait to begin another season Saturday.
In fact, some jumped the gun by pulling the trigger before the legal
shooting time of 5:31 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy starts shooting and everyone else figures, 'Well, it must
be time,' and then they all start shooting," said Jim Chakarun,
manager of the Imperial Wildlife Area's popular Wister Unit near
Niland, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   At Wister, wardens issued citations for early shooting, for not
turning in permits and for shooting pintails, a species off-limits
until Nov. 28. Otherwise, things went smoothly there and at most of
the Southland's top public areas.</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 CHRIS DUFRESNE</KH>
<HD>In Right Scenario, USC Is BCS' Eligible Receiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to last weekend's crazy college football news cycle, USC's
odds of snagging one of two, $13-million, at-large bowl championship
series berths went from forget-about-it to, well, maybe.</LD>
<LD>   With four of eight undefeated schools losing, two-loss USC, during
its bye week, jumped from 11th to ninth in the latest BCS standings.</LD>
<LD>   History suggests USC's chances remain single wing and a prayer.
Since the BCS was formed in 1998, the Pac-10 has landed only one
at-large team, Oregon State in 2000, in a major bowl other than the
Rose. And you may remember that fight, Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen
threatening to pull out of the BCS if the Fiesta Bowl did not select
No. 6 Oregon State. The Fiesta Bowl took the eager Beavers and Oregon
State proved it belonged with a thorough thrashing of Notre Dame.</LD>
<TE>   Because of its conference ties and western location, the Fiesta
Bowl has been the Pac-10's only real shot at getting a second team
into a BCS bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been my theme song," Hansen said this week.</TE>
<TE>   That option is out this year, however, because the Fiesta Bowl is
the national title game. That leaves the provincially motivated Sugar
and Orange bowls or, in a longshot twist, maybe the Rose, should
Washington State advance to the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, no Pac-10 team has ever played in the Sugar
Bowl, and only one Pac-10 school, Washington in 1985, has played in
the Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, USC could present an interesting case.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things would have to happen," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Rose Bowl chances dropped Saturday when Washington State
defeated Arizona State. To get to Pasadena, the Trojans need to win
out and Washington State must lose twice.</TE>
<TE>   But what about another BCS game?</TE>
<TE>   The answer in certain scenarios is clear: If the top contenders
win out, one-loss Iowa and Texas, both ranked ahead of USC, would
trump any Trojan at-large claims.</TE>
<TE>   But let's say a second spot pops open and comes down to a choice
between 10-2 Notre Dame or 10-2 USC.</TE>
<TE>   In this scenario, the Trojans would have just defeated the Irish
and would be the higher ranked team in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to beat Notre Dame, I think that would slingshot
them into real contention," Hansen said of USC.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen has already spoken with Sugar and Orange bowl officials
about possible USC scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be cognizant of the fact," Hansen said of the Sugar
and Orange bowls. "If they do nothing but pick on a geographical
basis, that's not fair."</TE>
<TE>   Who said men wearing loud jackets had to be fair?</TE>
<TE>   Even if 10-2 Notre Dame lost to USC, the Irish would still be the
preferred at-large choice because of their blockbuster television
ratings appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Notre Dame is just magic, magic, magic," Hansen said of the
school's bowl power.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen would still make a big push for USC. In 1997, the
conference lobbied the Sugar Bowl on No. 5 UCLA's behalf, offering to
subsidize ticket packages. Instead, the Sugar Bowl took No. 9 Ohio
State.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said the Pac-10 would be willing to offer similar packages
on behalf of USC. Of course, the Trojans are four victories from
being 10-2, so first things first.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   Here is the conference's dream scenario: Ohio State and Washington
State finish first and second in the BCS standings and advance to the
Fiesta Bowl to play for the national title. The Rose Bowl fills the
vacancies with 10-2 USC against 11-1 Iowa, two highly ranked BCS
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (4-5) has lost three consecutive games for the first
time in the Rick Neuheisel era, and six consecutive defeats are not
out of the question, given that the combined record of the Huskies'
last three opponents -- Oregon State, Oregon and Washington State --
is 21-6.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody closes the door and cries tears of self-pity," Neuheisel
said this week. "We just work and keep going and we've all got lots
to be thankful for. It isn't a situation that calls for gloom and
despair."</TE>
<TE>   They ought to hand out two coach-of-the-year awards, one to
California's Jeff Tedford for his work on the field and one to
Washington State's Mike Price for his work behind the scenes. Price
knows his Xs and O's, but his CEO skills have been even more
impressive. Last week, he held the Cougars together through the worst
stretch of the season, a week that included a flu outbreak and the
suspension of two defensive starters.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a month, last week," Price quipped.</TE>
<TE>   In his dual role as "Judge Judy," Price meted out the perfect
punishment for linebacker Ira Davis, who broke teammate Jason David's
cheekbone during a locker-room fight. Price said Davis could rejoin
the team when David's cheekbone healed -- in six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the distractions, Washington State soundly defeated
Arizona State, 44-22, and took sole possession of first place in the
conference.</TE>
<TE>   If that wasn't enough, Price has set up the Cougars' schedule the
way a World Series manager sets up his pitching. Having the foresight
to turn down television revenue and national exposure for the greater
cause, Price said no to playing Alabama or Nebraska in a preseason
game, no to playing Oregon in Seattle this week for a bigger paycheck
and no to a game Nov. 30 at Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   These strategic moves may keep Washington State in the national
title hunt until the bitter BCS end. Now, No. 5 Washington State
(8-1) will play host to Oregon (7-2) this weekend in Pullman. Also,
by opting out of the Hawaii trip, Washington State has a bye before
its Nov. 23 Apple Cup showdown against Washington and a bye on Nov.
30, giving the Cougars an extra week to prepare for its Dec. 7 finale
at UCLA. Both schools agreed to move that game from its original Nov.
16 slot to accommodate ABC.</TE>
<TE>   California plays at Arizona State on Saturday in a game that pits
Tedford against Dirk Koetter, both former offensive coordinators
under Mike Bellotti at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they were in some other conference," Bellotti said, "then
I could really root and feel good for them."</TE>

<HD>Of Her Many Images, Which Is Real Capriati?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Capriati was the pig-tailed pixie and heir to Chris Evert's
tennis goodwill, and we all loved her, didn't we?</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Capriati was the teenage burnout, the accused shoplifter,
the troubled girl in a hotel room with drugs and strangers, and what
a tragic story she had become, and we were disgusted at the
squandering of talent and goodwill, weren't we?</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Capriati was the lost soul, traveling aimlessly on the
tennis circuit, playing the game because she could do nothing else,
and wasn't it sad?</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati was the comeback sports heroine for the ages, a
young woman who had come through all her troubles to win Grand Slam
titles, to be No. 1, to smile girlishly while tennis fans swooned and
gave back their adoration, eager to see the giggly 13-year-old and
not the grown woman who wasn't comfortable talking about her past or
her future, and we were all redeemed, too, weren't we?</TE>
<TE>   And now, what?</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati has come to Staples Center for the Home Depot
WTA Championships as the third-seeded player and owner of the 2002
Australian Open title. She also comes as the winner of only one match
since her upset loss to Amelie Mauresmo in the U.S. Open
quarterfinals. She has lost twice to exandra Stevenson and been
bageled a set in a 6-0, 6-3 loss to Conchita Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   She was nobody's sweetheart when, a day after her beating by
Mauresmo, New York tabloids had photos of Capriati at a nightclub
after she had taken off her blouse and was dancing in her bra while
dangling a cigarette from her fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Already during the Open, Capriati had been hammered when she was
asked for her opinions on Title IX and responded that she had no idea
what Title IX was.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, now 26 and a 12-year veteran of the tour, had her father
and coach, Stefano, hovering in the press room at Staples during
media day this week, keeping track of what his daughter said and how
long she would be forced to endure listening to tough questions about
a WTA fashion show and whether she was tired or not.</TE>
<TE>   And now, who?</TE>
<TE>   Is Capriati the pig-tailed sweetheart, the inspirational architect
of a heartwarming comeback? Or is she the badly spoken, unhappy,
burned-out party girl?</TE>
<TE>   Capriati is neither, of course. Or maybe both.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati didn't ask to navigate teenager-hood on a worldwide
stage, where her every blemish and weight gain was noted and
criticized, where every mumbled answer was used as evidence that
pushing young girls into sports too soon was awful, where every day
brought another match, another city.</TE>
<TE>   After all she had gone through, Capriati still seemed surprised
that her U.S. Open post-loss partying was photographed and published.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I was just out having some fun," she said. "But I didn't
mind the photo. My abs looked pretty flat. And I was only holding the
cigarette for a friend."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati excuses her post-Open results, losses so bad that it
seemed she must be going through the motions, as a natural letdown
after an emotional couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Capriati was almost everybody's comeback athlete of the
year. She won consecutive Grand Slam tournaments at the Australian
and French Open and earned the No. 1 ranking that had been predicted
when Capriati was a 14-year-old semifinalist at the French Open in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   That success, her teary reaction to winning the titles, had
brought to Capriati, for the months from January through May,
unencumbered joy. But when she arrived at Wimbledon and heard nothing
but talk of how she was halfway to sweeping the four Grand Slam
events and creating special history, the joy disappeared. There were
fewer smiles and more tossed rackets and mumbled answers and almost
palpable relief when she lost in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   She is an athlete who seems to revel in the competition until some
notice is taken. She wants to win -- but please, don't watch.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was inevitable that Capriati's life as a tennis sensation
was bound to fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe it is not surprising now that Capriati still needs her
father always nearby, always has a WTA minder making sure no one
wants to ask Jennifer a tough question, and always seems sure that
somebody, everybody, is out to hurt her.</TE>
<TE>   During this year, when she has not beaten Serena or Venus
Williams, has lost three times to Mauresmo, has been involved in an
ugly dispute with Fed Cup captain Billie Jean King, has thrown
rackets and been caught yelling obscenities at umpires, been
photographed in a bra, it seems as if Capriati is finding the
spotlight too hot again.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati beat Silvia Farina Elia, 7-5, 6-1, in the first round
Thursday night. Her hair is rock-star red and she has the bangs and
ponytail of a little girl. Who does Capriati want to be? The rebel,
the waif, the little girl we all loved, the adult with talent and
faults and expectations? Or all of those things? Or none of them? Who
does she want us to see? Who does she want to be?</TE>

<LD>When Julie Krone, at 39, announced last month that she was going to
ride horses again, there were many skeptics, one of whom was the
retired Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer who put her on Colonial Affair
in the Belmont Stakes in 1993, when Krone became the first -- and
still only -- woman to win a Triple Crown race.</LD>
<LD>   She had won 3,546 races -- by far the most by a female jockey --
and was elected into the Racing Hall of Fame in 2000, but Krone still
had been away from the riding part of the game since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish her all the luck, but I wish she'd reconsider," Schulhofer
said. "Jocks that quit and try to come back hardly ever make it. You
can go all the way back to Earl Sande and find that."</LD>
<TE>   But as Laura de Seroux, one of the trainers who has provided
horses for Krone to ride during morning training hours, said, "It
doesn't make any difference what any of us think. Julie's determined
to do this, and nobody's going to talk her out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Krone, who is 4 feet 10 1/2 and weighs about 100 pounds, rode her
first race back at Santa Anita on Nov. 1, finishing fourth. She rode
five more times at Santa Anita, rode once on Wednesday, opening day
at Hollywood Park, and then Thursday, in the last race, she was
aboard Jade Vixen, a 3-year-old maiden filly, for a six-length
victory. It was her first since a three-win day at Lone Star Park on
April 19, 1999, which was also supposed to be the day she ended her
career.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Now that you've won your first race since your return,
do you feel like the monkey's off your back?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: That's a question that I can't really answer, because I
didn't feel there was a monkey up there to begin with. I'm older and
calmer, and I knew I was going to win a race sooner or later. All I'm
trying to do is get some nice horses to ride and establish some
momentum out here.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What will you remember about your first win back?</TE>
<TE>   A: Down the stretch, I just cut the filly loose. I looked up at
the TV board and saw that I had a comfortable lead. I thought to
myself, [trainer Jose DeLima] could have ridden this horse and won,
and he's got one of his arms in a cast [because of a training
accident]. Jose owns the filly with Judy and Don Barber, and I sensed
an omen there. Judy and Don have the same names as my parents.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Jade Vixen was a heavy 9-10 favorite. Were you nervous because
most people expected you to win?</TE>
<TE>   A: Riding a horse favored like that just gives me more confidence,
and when I'm confident, I don't get any performance jitters. I'd be
more nervous if I was riding a horse in a big race and he was 20-1.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you say to people who question your returning after
being away so long?</TE>
<TE>   A: I just love horses -- I always have since I was a little girl
-- and there's nothing that makes me happier than riding them. I've
heard people say that horses aren't very smart, but I don't buy that.
They've got personalities, they've got psyches, and that's another
challenging part about riding, trying to get into those psyches so
you can do your best with them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has riding changed while you've been away?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think so. But getting ready to ride takes more work.
I've been getting on between three and six horses in the mornings,
but so far I haven't been getting that many mounts in the afternoons,
and that means I've got to work harder to keep fit. When I rode in
the East, I'd ride day and night, one track in the afternoon and
another in the evening, and by the end you'd have been in nine to 18
races at both places. Riding like that, you're bound to stay fit.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The race you won Thursday was the only race you rode all day.
What did you do to get ready?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've been running every day and going to the gym a lot.
[Thursday,] I did some wind sprints for about 20 minutes and lifted
some 20-pound dumbbells to strengthen both of my arms.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Although you and your husband, columnist Jay Hovdey of the
Daily Racing Form, live in Carlsbad, you've taken an apartment in
Pasadena, haven't you?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, that's to be closer to the tracks. It's worked out fine,
except I don't have my TV working yet. I can't wait for the cable guy
to get there.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Speaking of TV, when you rode in New York, you were an
occasional guest on the David Letterman show. Heard anything from
Letterman lately?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, but maybe that's because he's in New York and I'm out here.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What adjustments will you have to make to win consistently in
California?</TE>
<TE>   A: They ride more aggressively leaving the gate out here. Much of
the time, you've got to put your horse into the race earlier to have
a chance. But I can do that. That shouldn't be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Who's your agent?</TE>
<TE>   A: Brian Beach, and I'm lucky to have him. He's got Mike Smith,
another New York rider who came out here and, after not hitting it
off right away, has settled in and is doing great. I knew Brian when
he was back East, but he never worked with me. I haven't had that
many agents over the years. I had the same one [Larry "Snake" Cooper]
for 12 years, you know.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A female rider has never made an impact in California. Any
thoughts about that?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'd be the wrong one to ask, since I've never ridden out here
on a regular basis. I'll be just as competitive as I've ever been,
maybe more, and I won't be taking anything for granted. No matter
what you've done anywhere else, you've got to earn your way where you
are.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Any goals?</TE>
<TE>   A: I hadn't thought much about any, but getting to 4,000 wins
would be nice. I was looking at the stats the other day. If I reached
4,000, that would put me among the 50 winningest riders of all time.
That'd be great company to be in, wouldn't it?</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Is Making Plans</HD>
<DH>In drive to land NFL team, Pasadena hires architects and
others to develop ideas for stadium renovations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The same architects who designed Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Cleveland
Browns Stadium and the Arrowhead Pond will help draw up plans for a
completely renovated, NFL-ready Rose Bowl -- even though there's no
guarantee the Pasadena project will happen.</LD>
<LD>   Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn confirmed Thursday that the
architectural firm HOK is one of several entities retained to help
Pasadena in its drive to land an NFL team. Investment banker John
Moag, who is heading the project, has put together a team that also
includes Pasadena-based Parsons, which will work on traffic issues,
and sports-marketing expert Max Muhleman.</LD>
<LD>   Assuming an existing NFL franchise would move to Los Angeles, the
biggest hurdle the Pasadena group faces is funding a massive Rose
Bowl renovation, which could cost about $400 million. Presumably, the
league would help with a loan of up to $150 million, and multiple
Super Bowls also could be used as a financing tool.</LD>
<TE>   "John and his team need to continue to work to determine the
analysis of how much things would cost," Dunn said. "At this point,
they have not put pencil to paper."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the league would
consider awarding a Super Bowl to a significantly renovated Rose
Bowl, whether or not Los Angeles had an NFL team. Of course, there
would be no rebuilding of the Rose Bowl if a pro football term
weren't on the way. Still, the possibility of an L.A. Super Bowl is
news, considering the league has never awarded the game to a city
without a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very encouraged, and a bit impressed that the league is
making that step," said Muhleman, president of Charlotte, N.C.-based
IMG/Muhleman Marketing. "For three years, it seemed to be a contest
between the league and Los Angeles as to who needed the other more. I
think this is a testimony to the fact the league isn't worried about
who goes first in making a compromise."</TE>

<HD>Wounded Duck</HD>
<DH>Steve Rucchin once thought being injured in successive
seasons was hard, then his older brother died</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Rucchin will be with us shortly. He is working through some
issues.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks' morning skate is winding up, but Rucchin is
hardly cooling down. He tosses his gloves to the ice and begins
chopping at them with his stick.</LD>
<LD>   Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!</LD>
<TE>   He is laughing. The big lug of a center is enjoying a moment on
the ice, something of a rarity the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Rusty high-fived me," Rucchin explains. "I don't want the bad
vibes from his gloves getting onto my gloves. I'm not taking any
chances."</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei is amused later.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't tell me about that," Salei says, knowing if there is
anyone who needs to exorcise bad vibes it's Rucchin.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed him a lot the last couple years," Salei says.
"Hopefully, he can stay healthy this year. Everyone is just hoping he
does. I think he's really a big part of our team.</TE>
<TE>   "He said what about me again?"</TE>
<TE>   Thwack!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was no easy way for Rucchin to sum up the last two years. So
he took a deep breath and launched into a story of pain, on the ice
and off. Forming the words seemed a difficult task, more painful even
than being shoved in the path of a whistling puck -- an experience
Rucchin knows all too well.</TE>
<TE>   The injuries, though, were the easy chapters.</TE>
<TE>   An uncalled crosscheck by Ray Bourque sent Rucchin into the path
of Teemu Selanne's slap shot. So ended Rucchin's 2000-01 season, his
face battered, his mind foggy.</TE>
<TE>   Another season, another collision with a puck. Rucchin dived to
block a shot and suffered a broken ankle that later required
insertion of a metal rod. That limited Rucchin to 38 games last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Pain enough for one man.</TE>
<TE>   But then he would go to his family's home near Toronto and see his
older brother Larry, a once robust man whose mere presence commanded
attention. Steve watched as cancer ravaged his brother. Larry died in
June, only a week after his daughter was born.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, the hurt remains.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry was pretty much what held our immediate family together,"
Rucchin said. "He was a big guy, really strong physically and
unbelievably strong mentally. He would walk into the room and be the
center of attention. It was tough to see him get beat down.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of quiet when I was there. There was not much
small talk.... I felt bad eating around him. He was being fed through
a tube."</TE>
<TE>   This is leading to Rucchin's point. He needs to go through this to
get back to his center.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I think about him," Rucchin said. "Not so much about
him, more what he went through, what I witnessed him go through.
That's what I think about every day. When it looks like I'm having a
bad day or I think I'm having a bad day, I look at that and realized
things aren't that bad."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, all it takes is pounding a pair of gloves to find the
joy again.</TE>
<TE>   Thwack!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some things are better.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a period, where I absolutely dreaded finding a message
on my phone, thinking it was going to be something else," Rucchin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some things are a lot better.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing great hockey again, better than ever," right wing
Mike Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin has been the Ducks' most consistent player, even if few
outside Anaheim have noticed. But, then, that's normal for Rucchin,
who was squeezed between Paul Kariya and Selanne for nearly five
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin leads the team with 16 points, 12 on assists. None was
better than the one Thursday. Rucchin flipped a perfect pass to
Kariya, who had slipped behind the Boston Bruin defense. Typically,
the pass was largely forgotten when Kariya scored after displaying an
array of moves.</TE>
<TE>   "He simply does everything for us, from faceoffs to playing
defense to scoring goals," Kariya said. "Losing him was a huge reason
why we played so poorly last year and the year before."</TE>
<TE>   And the year before that.</TE>
<TE>   During a stretch in the 1999-2000 season, Rucchin missed 11 games
with an infected left ankle. The Ducks went 2-7-2 while he was out
and missed the playoffs by five points.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year he was overlooked ... a lot," Kariya said. "Teemu and
I have talked that we don't think there was a better guy to play with
us than Steve. He was perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess, someone needs to do the dirty work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin was doing the dirty work in a game against Colorado in the
2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   He was battling in front of the net with Bourque. Just as Selanne
sent a blistering shot from the blue line, Bourque shoved Rucchin
forward, into the puck. Rucchin suffered a broken nose and cheekbone
and played only two more games that season, then spent the rest of
the time in the haze of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin was grinding again against Dallas last season. He hit the
ice to block a shot in overtime and then limped to the bench. He sat
out 44 games with the broken ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "I said it a thousand times, there is nothing that could be done
about the injuries in the past," Rucchin said. "It is definitely in
the front of my mind that I've been hurt, but at the same time, they
were both really fluky."</TE>
<TE>   But convincing people that he's not fragile can be a painful task.</TE>
<TE>   Against Boston on Thursday, the Bruins' Nick Boynton blindsided
Rucchin with a check. He dropped to the ice and the gasp from the
Duck bench was palpable. He got up and played on, having suffered
only a gash on the bridge of his nose.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a shame that I should be 'happy' that I'm out there
playing hockey right now," Rucchin said. "Unfortunately that is the
way it is and the way it has been.... It was tough dealing with
injuries. If there was one silver lining, I had multiple
opportunities to go home and spend time with my brother."</TE>
<TE>   His face has healed, his mind has cleared and the ankle has
mended. Rucchin, though, still plays in pain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin got the call that led to his fearing cell phone messages
in February of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Larry, who was playing hockey in Germany at the time, had been
suffering back pains. He went for an examination and was told he had
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He flew home from Germany the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "He was four years older than me," said Rucchin, 31. "I was always
trying to hang out with him and trying to play up to his level. It's
kind of funny, even with what I have accomplished, it still seemed to
me that he was the better hockey player....</TE>
<TE>   "I can still remember when he called from Germany to tell me.
Those are words you don't want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   For two years, Larry struggled. Steve could only watch. The
injuries allowed him to return home three times last year. Each time,
though, things were a little worse.</TE>
<TE>   "He was glad I was able go back and I was glad I could go back,"
Rucchin said. "But you can only talk about so much stuff....</TE>
<TE>   "He was more concerned about the well-being of everyone else
around him. I couldn't even imagine the grief and suffering, being so
young, being a guy who had been so healthy, playing hockey, and then
he can't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he was himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, he was unbelievable through the whole experience,"
Rucchin said. "Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Even the
doctors said they had never seen a person suffering as much as him.
He never once complained."</TE>
<TE>   When Larry died, he left a wife, a 5-year old son and the newborn
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose a brother at that age, someone he was so close to, I
cannot imagine," Kariya said. "He seems fine now. If anything, it has
given him new perspective on life and how tenuous it is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin's cell phone rang last August. His agent was on the other
end, telling him that the Ducks were offering a four-year,
$11.8-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Their confidence in me means a lot, that even after everything
that happened, that I can still play, be a part of this team and help
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those thoughts push Rucchin. Other thoughts linger just below the
surface.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so hard," Rucchin said. "Larry had young children and
wanted to see them grow up. He knew there was a good chance that
wasn't going to happen. I'm more concerned about the well-being of
his children."</TE>
<TE>   Thoughts like those could make a man beat his head against the
wall.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin settles for pounding on his hockey gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Thwack!</TE>

<HD>Referees' Telephone Test OKd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Communication between referees and linesmen, now also known as
assistant referees, has always been a problem, the linesman's
urgently waving flag not always being spotted by the referee.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the French soccer federation decided to do something
about it.</LD>
<LD>   At Saturday's first division match between Lille and Nantes, the
match officials will wear hands-free telephones that will enable the
referee and linesmen to talk during the game, the federation
announced.</LD>
<TE>   The experiment has been approved by FIFA, but only for the one
match.</TE>
<TE>   "Match officials are not against improvements in refereeing
techniques," federation board member Marc Batta told Reuters. "We're
going to carry out this experiment in hope it provides something
extra."</TE>
<TE>   A previous experiment elsewhere with vibrating pagers that could
be activated by the linesmen proved a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Team Fights On</TE>
<TE>   As if Ottmar Hitzfeld, the coach of Bayern Munich, didn't have
enough on his hands, what with the former champions having being
ousted from the European Champions League and struggling to find
their form in Germany, now his own players are fighting each other.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, French World Cup-winning defender Bixente Lizarazu
had to be forcibly separated from Croatian midfielder Niko Kovac
after the two became involved in an on-field brawl during training.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Lizarazu] lost control of himself, and there will be a fine
for that," said Hitzfeld, who otherwise dismissed the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It proves that the team is alive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian Replay</TE>
<TE>   Francisco "Paco" Maturana, who coached Colombia to the Italia '90
and USA '94 World Cups and later coached the national teams of
Ecuador, Costa Rica and Peru with mixed success, Thursday was once
again named Colombia's national coach.</TE>
<TE>   Maturana, 53, currently at the helm of Al-Halil in Saudi Arabia,
will take charge of the team, starting in January, for the defense of
its Copa America title in Peru in 2004 and for the qualifying
campaign for the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Death Threats</TE>
<TE>   Former England national team midfielder Dennis Wise, now playing
for Millwall in the English first division, has received a number of
death-threat letters and the club has turned the matter over to
police.</TE>
<TE>   Wise left financially troubled Leicester City under unfavorable
circumstances in August and has since sued the club for $3.6 million.
The threatening letters are believed to have been sent by Leicester
City fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be foolish for us not to take them seriously," Theo
Paphitis, Millwall's chairman, told Sky Sports television.</TE>
<TE>   Rome Dilemma</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Olympic Committee's failure to respond to an offer of
almost $200 million for the purchase of the Olympic Stadium in Rome
could lead to the stadium being abandoned by its two main tenants, AS
Roma and Lazio.</TE>
<TE>   The two Serie A clubs have shared the 80,000-capacity stadium,
scene of the 1960 Olympic Games and the 1990 World Cup final, since
1953, but said they would build a new stadium unless their bid was
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not bluffing when I say that next season, unless we have a
concrete response about the [Olympic] stadium, we will play our games
touring all around Italy," said Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti.</TE>
<TE>   "We will wait a little more, then we will build another stadium,
near to Rome, and it will be ready in two years," said Roma's
president, Franco Sensi.</TE>

<HD>Serena Issues a Wake-Up Call</HD>
<DH>Looking, if not playing, in the pink, she enlivens an
otherwise dreary second night at WTA Championships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe a coffee company should seize title sponsorship of the Home
Depot WTA Championships next year.</LD>
<LD>   Winners are tired. Losers are exhausted. Even an out-of-it-looking
ballboy had to be gently prodded into action the first night of this
season-ending event.</LD>
<LD>   It's called the race to the Championship. How about the crawl?</LD>
<TE>   There was one visible exception Thursday: No. 1-seeded and
defending champion Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said she wasn't operating at optimum level -- calling it
a C-minus performance -- but her 6-2, 6-2 first-round victory over
Anna Smashnova of Israel would have been at least an A-minus showing
for anyone else. She took out Smashnova in 54 minutes, hitting six
aces and 28 winners.</TE>
<TE>   The match yielded one unusual statistic. Smashnova failed to hit a
single winner. That's hard to do, frankly.</TE>
<TE>   "She overpowered me. It's another level," Smashnova said.
"Normally my game is not hitting winners and today it would be more
difficult for me to hit one. I would probably have to risk so much
and hit maybe 50-50 shots and I didn't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In other first-round matches, eighth-seeded Jelena Dokic of
Yugoslavia defeated Anastasia Myskina of Russia, 6-3, 6-4; Magdalena
Maleeva of Bulgaria upset No. 7 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, 6-2,
7-5, and No. 3 Jennifer Capriati beat Silvia Farina Elia of Italy,
7-5, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Though the crowds were sparse again, even for the night session,
the atmosphere was more lively than the first night, which obviously
had something to do with Williams, the reigning French Open,
Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the stress of defending this title is minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a large bounty on my head," Williams said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, wearing a pink dress and pink headband, embraces being
the entertainer and she pulled out a versatile array of shots, mixing
power with angles and an occasional venture to the net.</TE>
<TE>   She added a new element to her victory celebration, in part
borrowed from Mr. Entertainment himself, Andre Agassi. Williams blew
kisses to the four sides of the court. Well, at least someone
appreciated the few fans who did show up on a Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard in L.A. I think over the weekend we'll have a great
crowd, but normally on weekdays, it's tough to get people to come out
to the tennis," Williams said. "I do perform better in front of a
larger crowd. I get into it a little more. I guess it's just that
whole entertainer thing comes into mind."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Williams doesn't look like she is trying to
conceal a yawn on the court is her scheduling. This is her 13th
tournament of 2002, and after winning the U.S. Open, she played
back-to-back events in Tokyo and Germany. She called a timeout after
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a really long year, and the end of the year is always
especially tough," she said. "It's like one more tournament, one more
match. And that can get you to go crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on the verge of that in Germany, but I had to take a little
break and step back."</TE>
<TE>   Now, her decision to pull out of her next three events after
Germany looks sensible if you look and listen to the other players in
the field. Vacations are needed all around, based on this sampling:</TE>
<TE>   Myskina: "Today, I feel really bad. I feel it's the worst match in
my life.... I'm going to send my racket straight to Russia and go the
opposite way."</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva: "Everybody is tired. I'm dead. You just deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there is Dokic, who is playing her 29th tournament.
Dokic is the Yevgeny Kafelnikov of the women's tour. If she played a
Williams-like schedule, it would practically be a sabbatical.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of players are getting tired and injured," she
said. "I think it's the schedule that does it. Mentally, I'm really
feeling it much more than physically. It's hard to fight out there
when you play so many matches and tournaments. The last five or six
tournaments, it's hard because your mind is not on the court so much.
Maybe only 20, 21 tournaments. I'll cut down a lot."</TE>

<LD>Daniela Hantuchova may have been running on empty, but Magdalena
Maleeva still had a full tank. The unseeded Maleeva defeated the
jet-lagged, seventh-seeded Hantuchova, 6-3, 7-5, in the first round
of the Home Depot WTA Championships on Thursday at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Maleeva, of Bulgaria, came from behind to win both sets. She
trailed, 2-1, early in the first. Then she rallied from a 4-1 deficit
by winning four consecutive games and six of the last seven in the
second set.</LD>
<LD>   Her resiliency should come as no surprise, because Maleeva, ranked
17th in the world, has been rebounding from injuries in a similarly
determined fashion over the past few years.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's an upset," she said after beating the
eighth-ranked Hantuchova. "Obviously, she's a top-10 player, and so
maybe it is. But I have worked very hard this year."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's victory, which sends Maleeva into the quarterfinals
Saturday against Jennifer Capriati, is the latest in a string of
resurgent performances.</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva won the Moscow tournament in October, beating three top-10
players -- Venus Williams in the round of 16, Amelie Mauresmo of
France in the semifinals and Lindsay Davenport in the final.</TE>
<TE>   She followed that with a title-match loss to Kim Clijsters of
Belgium at Luxembourg two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova led Slovakia to its first Fed Cup title, a 3-1 victory
over Spain on Sunday, and she arrived in Los Angeles for the
season-ending WTA Championships on Monday night, a few days later
than the rest of the field. She was still feeling the effects of the
travel and short turnaround time against Maleeva.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely was a lot for me," she said. "I was just so tired.
I felt like I had nothing left."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-seeded Jelena Dokic, a 6-3, 6-4 winner over Anastasia
Myskina in another first-round match Thursday, also is anticipating
some much-needed rest over the next few weeks before gearing up in
January for the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   After competing in 29 tournaments this year, Dokic said she plans
to cut back next year. She also believes it might not be a bad idea
for the whole tour to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it should be looked into," she said. "It's 11 months of
tennis, and pretty much only one full month to rest, which is not
very much at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very long season, and there are so many tournaments. A lot
of players are getting tired."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No need to adjust your television set if you tune into "Monday Night
Football" and think you're caught in a time warp.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Al Michaels and John Madden will be wearing the same
yellow jackets that Howard Cosell, Frank Gifford and Don Meredith
made famous in the 1970s and early '80s.</LD>
<LD>   That's because ABC will be commemorating its 500th regular-season
Monday night game when Oakland plays at Denver.</LD>
<TE>   It's fitting that the game features the Raiders and Broncos. Those
two teams have played each other on "Monday Night Football" 13 times.
The Raiders hold a 6-5-1 advantage, but the Broncos have won two of
the last three meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Statistical guru Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau, who has
been the director of information for "Monday Night Football" for 21
years, is the one who figured out this game is the 500th.</TE>
<TE>   Clips of memorable moments from the 33-year history of "Monday
Night Football" will be shown throughout the telecast. And at
halftime ABC will announce the greatest "Monday Night Football" game
of all time, as selected by fans.</TE>
<TE>   Five games were nominated. One involved the Broncos -- their 31-28
loss to Joe Montana and the Kansas City Chiefs at Denver in 1994.
Montana's five-yard touchdown pass to Willie Davis with eight seconds
left decided the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Cosell used to talk about the ebb and flow of a game," Michaels
recalled this week. "Well, with that game there was no ebb. It was
all flow -- from opening kickoff to the final gun."</TE>
<TE>   But the game most likely to be declared the greatest is Miami's
38-24 victory over the Chicago Bears in 1985. The Bears came into the
game 12-0 and were looking to become only the second team in NFL
history to finish a season undefeated. The 1972 Dolphins went 17-0.</TE>
<TE>   Cheapest Shot</TE>
<TE>   There have been a lot of hard hits over the years on Monday night,
and a few cheap shots as well. But the cheapest shot came off the
field -- and was delivered by Raider owner Al Davis.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred in 1997, after Michaels elected to tell it like it is
on the opening of another Raider-Bronco game. Michaels said the
Raiders' commitment to excellence was "just a bunch of empty
verbiage" and that the Raiders are the "most underachieving team in
the league this season."</TE>
<TE>   More than a week later, Davis put out a press release that read
like a junior high prank. It said, among other things that aren't fit
to print in a family newspaper, that Michaels lacked truthfulness and
morality.</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing is, the NFL, which readily fines players for
cheap shots, let Davis off without even a reprimand.</TE>
<TE>   The whole mess left a scar on Michaels. But when asked this week
if it comes into play when he announces a Raider game, Michaels said,
"From my vantage point, you're so inside your own game, working with
your own team, all you care about is putting on the best show you
can."</TE>
<TE>   He's Everywhere</TE>
<TE>   Bill Macdonald fills many roles for Fox Sports Net. For instance,
he has replaced Paul Sunderland as the host of the "Lakers Live"
pregame show. And Saturday he'll be handling the play-by-play on
UCLA-Arizona, working with commentator Mike Sherrard.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday he was a hockey play-by-play announcer, filling in
for the Kings' Bob Miller, who was in Wisconsin for his
mother-in-law's funeral. And Macdonald did a nice job.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Miller missed a game before Saturday was 12 years
ago, when he took a night off to attend his son Kevin's college
graduation. Radio announcer Nick Nickson did a simulcast that time.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Notes</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, Laker fans with cable have a
choice -- watch tonight's game against Michael Jordan and the
Washington Wizards on Channel 9 with Sunderland and Stu Lantz or on
ESPN with John Saunders and Sean Elliott.... One good thing is,
because the game is live on ESPN, Channel 9 also has to show it live.
Channel 9 showed the game from Cleveland Tuesday on tape-delay.</TE>
<TE>   TNT has changed its schedule for next Thursday. The first game of
a doubleheader now will be Utah-Washington instead of San
Antonio-Philadelphia. The Clippers' home game against Orlando is
still scheduled as the second game that night.... The Clippers' first
telecast on Channel 5 last Sunday was unimpressive from a production
standpoint. The graphics looked bad and the score wasn't shown
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo begins its run of 15 NBA telecasts Sunday, when it
televises the New Orleans Hornets and New York Knicks at 1 p.m. The
game is on KVEA Channel 52 in Los Angeles. Telemundo's studio host is
Andres Cantor, known for his soccer call of goooooaaaaaalllll!!! ...
Laker games can now be heard in Farsi, the official language of Iran,
on KIRN (670). KIRN, which began broadcasting in Farsi in 1999, is
owned by Lotus Communications Corp., which also owns KWKW (1330).
"The Persian community is a great supporter of the Lakers," said John
Paley, KIRN vice president and general manager. The announcers are
Nick Zahab and Nader Zehtab.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has chosen not to renew "Southern California Sports
Report" anchor John Fricke's contract. His last day will be Dec.
31.... Also, reporter/anchor Suzy Shuster is leaving the show Dec. 1
but will contribute national reports to Fox Sports Net from time to
time. Shuster will soon be moving East to be with her fiance, ESPN
anchor Rich Eisen. They have set June 7 as their wedding date....
More wedding bells: Steve Webster, former publicity director at Fox
Sports Net and now a senior vice president at Universal Television
Group, is engaged to Stella Sampras, Pete's sister and the UCLA
women's tennis coach. Their wedding date is Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Biehn, a two-time USC All-American golfer, makes her
debut as an on-course commentator for the last two telecasts in the
"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf" series that airs Thursday and Nov.
21.... The Golf Channel and Golf Digest have teamed up on a Tiger
Woods-Jack Nicklaus special, "Tiger vs. Jack," which first airs
Tuesday at 6 p.m, and will be replayed a number of times.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Animation and ESPN have brought the popular comic strip,
"In the Bleachers," to life in the form of 15-second spots which
began airing this week. The strip was created by Steve Moore, a
former Times employee.... A new channel devoted to martial arts,
Blackbelt TV, is scheduled to launch early next year.... Another new
channel in the works is the Ice Channel, featuring figure skating.
Please, enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   New Dodger flagship station KFWB (980) got into the swing of
things Wednesday when it aired a one-hour "Ask the Dodgers" call-in
show with Bob Graziano, Dan Evans and Jim Tracy. Bret Lewis was the
host.... "The Gold Sheet Report," with Bruce Marshall and former New
York Giant Mark Collins, carried on KMPC (1540) Saturdays 7-8 a.m.,
is now being syndicated to 120 stations by Sports Byline USA....
Starting today, Bill Walton will contribute daily reports (heard at
6:28 and 9:28 a.m.) to the "Mike and Mike" show on ESPN Radio.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   ESPN began airing a new show, "Around the Horn," this week at 2
p.m. weekdays. It features a hyperactive host, Max Kellerman, and
four breathless sports columnists, who mainly just try to outshout
each other. Maybe it's just a bad idea, but the show is not off to a
good start. It quickly wears you out.</TE>

<HD>Pain Blocker</HD>
<DH>Despite playing with a broken rib, Saffer brings fire to
UCLA offensive line</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coughing wouldn't seem an especially hazardous activity for a player
considered among the toughest on UCLA's football team.</LD>
<LD>   But don't tell that to offensive tackle Mike Saffer, who was in
class Sept. 27 when he took a deep breath to clear his throat.</LD>
<LD>   "As soon as I coughed, it felt like somebody took a knife and
stabbed me right in the side of my back," he recalled. "I fell over
and I walked out of class."</LD>
<TE>   X-rays revealed that a rib he had injured the previous week
playing against Colorado had broken "all the way through," Saffer
said, from the force of the cough.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors told him he would miss four to six weeks. Not a chance,
Saffer thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt, God, this is my senior season, I can't afford to be
missing that much time," he said. "I can't afford to let my teammates
down."</TE>
<TE>   Though Saffer has often clashed with his teammates, verbally and
physically, the fifth-year senior prides himself on always giving his
best on the field, even when his condition isn't the best.</TE>
<TE>   He'll bring that never-back-down attitude into UCLA's game
Saturday night at Arizona, which will be a homecoming for the Tucson
native. Saffer spent much of the week scrambling to secure about 65
game tickets for relatives and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Though the broken rib still bothers him, the 6-foot-5, 305-pound
Saffer will make his 39th start for the Bruins. He will wear a
protective pad around his rib cage. The injury caused him to miss one
game, ending a streak of 26 consecutive starts at right tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "[Doctors] told me as soon as I could deal with the pain, then I
could play," he said. "I just said, 'To hell with it. It can't get
any worse.' "</TE>
<TE>   Saffer sat out the San Diego State game Sept. 28 and the week of
practice before the Bruins' Pacific 10 Conference opener Oct. 5 at
Oregon State. He played every snap against the Beavers, helping UCLA
gain 625 yards, the ninth-highest total in school history, in a 43-35
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been times when I've come back to the huddle hunched
over and really trying to take some deep breaths to get rid of the
pain," Saffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are those at UCLA who would argue that Saffer was
a pain in the side long before he suffered a broken rib.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment he arrived in Westwood in 1998 from Tucson Sabino
High, Saffer had a knack for getting under people's skin. He was
brash and outspoken and quickly earned a reputation for getting in
teammates' faces, usually those of the defensive linemen he opposed
in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in a little bit cocky, a Parade All-American and all that
stuff," said Mark Weber, the Bruins' offensive line coach. "Some of
the older guys put him in his place....</TE>
<TE>   "There are some older players who he's not that fond of. But the
whole thing is handed down. I'm sure there are some younger players
who don't like him."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you think of Saffer, teammates say it's hard not to
respect him. Senior defensive end Rusty Williams says he fought with
Saffer "every other day" when the two were battling for starting
spots that they eventually earned as redshirt freshmen, yet he has
nothing but admiration for Saffer's dedication on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played against him for four years and he works hard,"
Williams said. "I don't know if he likes to work hard, but he comes
out and he does it."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus, another fifth-year senior, who's out for
the season with a broken ankle, said of Saffer, "Smart guy. He
complains an awful lot. He's a very good leader, but at the same time
you just want to tell him to shut up sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise that Saffer, following in
the footsteps of his two brothers and grandfather, would like to
become a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It runs in the blood a little bit," he said. "We like to argue
and throw our opinions at everything."</TE>
<TE>   Saffer's father, Don, was a reserve guard for the Bruin basketball
team and played on the 1967 national championship team coached by
John Wooden and starring Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), then a
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Weber says Saffer's work ethic and character make him an elite
offensive lineman. A preseason All-American, Saffer is on the watch
list for the Outland Trophy, awarded to the nation's top interior
lineman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an intense individual and he plays that way," Weber said.
"He's got a real passion for the game of football. He gets after it.</TE>
<TE>   "He has all the qualities of the best [offensive] linemen we've
had--Andy Meyers, Shawn Stuart, Kris Farris, all those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Saffer, who graduated in December with a degree in history, said
he plans to move to Phoenix after the season and begin training for
NFL combines.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be happy just to get a shot, whether I get drafted or
whether I go [as a] free agent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Saffer is doing everything possible to finish his UCLA
career with a flourish. The Bruins became bowl eligible with their
sixth victory last week against Washington and have big games
remaining against rival USC and Pac-10 leader Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   A few more victories, and he might not feel the pain at all.</TE>

<HD>Taylor Should Get Ball More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Explosive freshman receiver Junior Taylor is about to become more
than a novelty act.</LD>
<LD>   He took a pitchout on a swinging gate play last week against
Washington and ran 38 yards. And he took a reverse 49 yards for a
touchdown in the opener against Colorado State.</LD>
<LD>   In four carries, he has 103 yards, an average of 25.8. But what
Taylor longs for is to run routes and have passes thrown to him. He
has only three catches for 45 yards.</LD>
<TE>   "Last week I had a lot of snaps and the coaches have told me that
will continue," he said. "I just want to get the ball. I love to get
the ball in my hands."</TE>
<TE>   It appears Taylor will get his wish. With reliable possession
receiver Ryan Smith injured, he has become the first wideout off the
bench behind Tab Perry and Craig Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really coming on as a receiver," Coach Bob Toledo said. "He
wasn't a natural pass catcher, but his hard work has paid off."</TE>
<TE>   If Taylor could choose a time and place for a breakout game, it
would be Saturday at Arizona. He grew up in Mesa, Ariz., and will
have a large contingent of family and friends at the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing for UCLA that Bobby Wade is Arizona's only
significant weapon. He deserves the Bruins' full attention.</TE>
<TE>   The senior receiver leads the Pacific 10 Conference with averages
of 7.9 receptions and 108.2 yards a game. He has had more than 100
yards in eight of the last 12 games and has moved into fifth place on
the conference career list with 208 catches.</TE>
<TE>   In an era of tall receivers, the 5-foot-11 Wade is as potent as
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's big when he gets the ball in his hands," Toledo said. "He's
great running after he makes the catch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for Arizona's offense has been relatively simple for
UCLA. The Wildcats pass much better than they run, much the same as
last week's opponent, Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for Arizona's defense is a greater challenge, even
though the Wildcats rank last in the Pac-10 in stopping the run.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona employs an alignment that emphasizes gap control and
blitzing pressure on the passer. UCLA has not seen a defense like it
all season, although Bruin coaches are accustomed to it. The Wildcats
have used the defense for about 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "They only use three defensive linemen and have linebackers coming
at you from all different directions," Toledo said. "It's hard to run
the football and you have to recognize what they are doing and call
the right protections."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Drew Olson and center Mike McCloskey call the blocking
schemes. Both are freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "That will be the hardest part," Toledo said. "We've got young
guys making the calls. It might be difficult."</TE>

<LD>It has been a year of firsts for the Pepperdine women's soccer
program but the biggest accomplishment to date could come Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves play host to San Francisco in the regular-season finale.
A victory would give them the West Coast Conference championship,
something no team other than Santa Clara or Portland has done in the
10 years the conference has sponsored the sport.</LD>
<LD>   "The girls know what's at stake," Pepperdine Coach Tim Ward said.
"Obviously, it's an awesome opportunity."</LD>
<TE>   In a five-day span last month, Pepperdine (15-1-2, 5-1-0 in
conference) became the first WCC team to defeat Santa Clara and
Portland -- two longtime national powers -- in the same season. The
victories help power the Waves to a No. 5 national ranking, the
highest in school history.</TE>
<TE>   A win Saturday also could land Pepperdine one of the eight
national seeds when the 64-team NCAA tournament field is announced
Monday. The Waves, who have a small home stadium, did not put in a
bid to host any playoff matches.</TE>
<TE>   "In a weird way, I would hope [the NCAA] flies us somewhere," Ward
said. "If you keep all the West Coast teams out there, there's so
many good teams that someone good is going to get knocked off early."</TE>
<TE>   A potent, balanced offense has been the Waves' signature trait.
Sophomore Ali Pavoni (10 goals, four assists), freshman Jenna Fodor
(eight goals, seven assists) and Lacey Ubaldi (seven goals, nine
assists) are among the top 10 scorers in the WCC. In all, Pepperdine
has had 13 different players score at least one of its 49 goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We do encourage attacking soccer," Ward said. "A lot of the girls
we recruit are attacking players. I believe in letting players do
what they naturally do well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Ryan Futagaki and Nandi Pryce are among 15 finalists for
the Hermann Trophy, which honors the top men's and women's soccer
players in the country. Futagaki, a senior midfielder, has helped
lead the Bruins to a No. 5 ranking. Pryce, a junior, leads a defense
that has recorded 10 shutouts and given up only 11 goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA senior middle blocker Angela Eckmier will be lost for the
remainder of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament
in her right knee during practice Tuesday. Eckmier missed the 2000
season because of the same injury.... Long Beach State lost sophomore
point guard Mark Bowens for the upcoming season because of a torn ACL
suffered Oct. 27 in practice. Bowens was battling Darnell Thompson
and Jibril Hodges for the starting position.</TE>

<HD>Fargas Prepared for Rain</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tailback Justin Fargas did not flinch when it started raining during
USC's practice on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Fargas, who will make his second start Saturday at Stanford,
enjoyed tremendous success during a rain-soaked senior season at
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High in 1997 and also overcame wet weather
during his freshman season at Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   Before rushing for a career-best 139 yards in 27 carries against
Oregon on Oct. 26, Fargas' previous high was 120 yards in 31 carries
for Michigan during a water-logged game against Northwestern in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "It was more like a monsoon," Fargas said. "It was a downpour for
12 hours straight."</TE>
<TE>   Showers are forecast for Palo Alto on Saturday, but Fargas is not
worried.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to focus on taking care of the ball, that's the
main thing," he said. "The yards will come."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said wet weather should not bother the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "We've soaked the ball all week long," Carroll said. "The focus is
there. We understand the elements could be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans will depart for Palo Alto today with a more sound
roster than when they returned from Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   A bye last week allowed numerous players nursing injuries to heal,
and no new injuries surfaced during practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like playing, but there's also nothing like
getting a little rest for the guys that were leg-weary," Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   Middle linebacker Mike Pollard (bruised hip), wide receiver Kareem
Kelly (ankle), receiver Sandy Fletcher (ankle), defensive lineman
Omar Nazel (knee) and fullback Chad Pierson (left Achilles) displayed
better mobility this week.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu limped through workouts early in the week
because of a high ankle sprain, but he ran without noticeable
discomfort Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis, who starred at Long Beach Poly
High, missed the Cardinal's last two games because of a bruised
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   USC players who attended Poly expect Lewis to play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, Kelly, defensive back Darrell Rideaux, safety DeShaun
Hill, running back Hershel Dennis and offensive lineman Winston
Justice are Poly graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago against USC, Lewis came off the bench and threw a
20-yard touchdown pass on the final play of the game to give the
Cardinal a 32-30 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to put all injuries aside and step up and play,"
Rideaux said. "I talked to him during the summer and he had this game
marked on his calendar."</TE>

<HD>She Makes It All Look Like a Snap</HD>
<DH>Teammates are raving about Aly Wagner, who at 22 has
emerged as 'quarterback' of future, and present, for U. S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandi Chastain, Julie Foudy and Mia Hamm were trying to explain the
other day just what it is that makes Alyson Kay Wagner so special.</LD>
<LD>   And make no mistake, Wagner -- "Wags" to her teammates on the U.S.
women's national soccer team -- is special.</LD>
<LD>   Players with world championships and Olympic gold medals on their
resume don't usually rave about up-and-coming youngsters. Support,
yes, but rave, no. Not until they have proved themselves at the
highest levels.</LD>
<TE>   But Wagner, 22, is the exception.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain, Foudy and Hamm were tripping over themselves in praise
of a youngster who could be the key to U.S. hopes for retaining the
Women's World Cup in China next year and reclaiming the Olympic gold
medal in Athens the year after.</TE>
<TE>   She is that influential. She has that much potential.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, who led Santa Clara to its first NCAA women's soccer
championship last season, scoring the winning goal in the final
against perennial powerhouse North Carolina, is a midfielder.</TE>
<TE>   More specifically, she's an attacking midfielder.</TE>
<TE>   And, to make the point finer still, she is a playmaker, the
closest thing soccer has to a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Her ability to play the position with as much or greater skill
than any of her predecessors on the national team is what sets her
apart. On a team that has goal scorers aplenty, as the U.S. does, a
player who knows how to get them the ball at just the right moment in
just the right place with just the right touch is a rare find indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Just listen to Hamm, who has scored more international goals than
anyone else in history, man or woman:</TE>
<TE>   "Aly can solve [defensive] pressure two ways: She can pass around
it and she can dribble around it," Hamm said. "But the other thing
Aly gives us is she can serve balls with both feet and she can serve
a variety of balls in terms of their texture. She can drive a ball,
she can float a ball, she can bend a ball. She's got the skill to do
all of that.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of sophistication at her age is phenomenal. That was
the first thing I noticed when she came on the team."</TE>
<TE>   That was in December 1998, when Wagner, then an 18-year-old from
San Jose, made her U.S. debut, against Ukraine at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Even at that young age, she was one of the last players cut from
the roster just before the 1999 World Cup, which the U.S. won. The
next year, at 19, she was an alternate on the U.S. team that won the
silver medal at the Sydney Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after battling through injuries in 2001, she is ready to make
the midfield playmaking role her own. Foudy, who has played the
position herself but now plays deeper in midfield, is astounded at
what she sees.</TE>
<TE>   "Aly is one of those players, it's like sometimes you catch
yourself watching her on the field," Foudy said. "You're like, 'Wait,
come on, play.' Because she's so much fun to watch. She's so
creative."</TE>
<TE>   And her potential?</TE>
<TE>   "Huge," Foudy said. "You can see it already. She's one of those
players a forward will run for anywhere because you know the ball is
going to be at your feet wherever she goes. And you can see, when she
gets the ball, the forwards just light up because they know.</TE>
<TE>   "And she gets in behind defenses. The thing I love about her is
she's got everything. She's technical on the ball, she can finish,
she can serve the long ball, and she's just so complete, and fun to
play with. She's got a good sense of humor and is always laughing on
the field."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, who has scored eight goals and assisted on 13 others in 31
games for the U.S. entering Saturday night's CONCACAF Gold Cup
championship match against Canada at the Rose Bowl, is also smart.</TE>
<TE>   If soccer is a thinking woman's game, then Wagner is the thinking
woman. Listen to Chastain:</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that Aly's a very special player," she said.
"You have a player like that come around once every decade, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   "I think her greatest quality besides her passion for the game is
that she sees it on a more complex level. I think Aly was very
fortunate that she grew up in a soccer environment when she was very
young.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a [youth] coach, Phillipe Blin, at the Central Valley
Mercury, where they taught those things. The game wasn't just black
and white. It had shades of gray. And I think Aly plays in those
shades of gray at times. Where you think you're going to see one
thing and you get something else. I think that's the complexity that
she brings to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, who helped the Mercury win three national youth titles in
a row, remains modest to a fault, long a trademark of the women's
national team.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever role they ask me to play, I'm willing to play it," she
said. "So I guess what I bring is a good attitude and the hard work
that they need."</TE>
<TE>   And that ability to put the ball in exactly the place the forwards
need it? Well, that's thanks to Blin and to Jerry Smith, her coach at
Santa Clara, and to the teammates around her, Wagner said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the spin you put onto the ball, so that [for] the
person running onto it it's easier to get a touch on it," she said.
"They don't have to slow down or change their pace."</TE>
<TE>   Just like a quarterback connecting with a wide receiver in full
stride.</TE>

<HD>He Had to Sit Tight</HD>
<DH>Kellen Winslow Jr. got a late start in football, but he's
making up for it at No. 2 Miami</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>He was born with everything he'd need to become a great football
player.</LD>
<LD>   The wriggling baby had genes that foretold size, speed and great
hands.</LD>
<LD>   He even had the name.</LD>
<TE>   But Kellen Winslow Jr. wasn't allowed to play football until he
was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   His Hall of Fame father said so.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time the season would come around, from 9 or 10 years old,
I'd get real angry, cry all the time," said Kellen Jr., a sophomore
tight end who leads defending national champion Miami in receptions
after replacing Jeremy Shockey, the New York Giants' first-round
draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   The boy tried to find a way around his father's rules. Once, he
carried his hockey pads out to a football field and tried to sneak
onto a youth league team with a borrowed helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Flag football or games in the park were all right. But Kellen Sr.
was firm on the subject of tackle football.</TE>
<TE>   "He would just tell me no, really," Kellen Jr. said. "He would
just say, 'Not yet.' That's about it. Not really why. He just said,
'You'll understand one day.' "</TE>
<TE>   One day.</TE>
<TE>   If Kellen Jr. only had a dollar for every time his father told him
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, he didn't understand," Kellen Sr. said. "It was 'Why this?
Why that?' Kids are about the moment. I've always told him, 'You
think short term, I think longer term.' "</TE>
<TE>   They laugh about it now, and about most of the other times a
father's convictions stood in the way of a son's yearnings.</TE>
<TE>   They aired a disagreement on television the day Kellen Jr., then a
senior at Scripps Ranch High in San Diego, was supposed to announce
which college he would sign with on Fox Sports Net, where Kellen Sr.
is a college football studio analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of ending the suspense, father and son ended up still
debating the merits of Washington and Michigan State after they got
to the studio, neither one ready to budge.</TE>
<TE>   With no announcement, the impasse ended days afterward when Kellen
Jr. signed with Miami instead and went on to win a national
championship as a freshman reserve.</TE>
<TE>   A season later, Kellen is a starter for the unbeaten and
second-ranked Hurricanes, who face Tennessee on Saturday as Miami
tries to prove it hasn't lost its edge in a bid for a second
consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Washington is 4-5, and Michigan State fired Coach Bobby
Williams on Monday after a 49-3 loss to Michigan left the Spartans at
3-6.</TE>
<TE>   Kellen Jr. thanks his lucky stars he ended up at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "[My father] just said, 'Put your trust in me and you'll
understand later,' " Kellen Jr. said. "Like Pop Warner, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of his father's convictions were in his upbringing.</TE>
<TE>   Kellen Sr. didn't start his own football career until he was a
senior at East St. Louis High in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly handicapped by lack of experience, Winslow went to
Missouri, became a first-round draft pick in 1979 and went on to star
at tight end for the San Diego Chargers for nine seasons, twice
leading all NFL players in receptions.</TE>
<TE>   He still recalls the burnout he saw around him in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one guy I played with on the Chargers. He was in his
second year with the Chargers, and he had been playing football 12
years total," Kellen Sr. said. "I was near the end of my career, and
I had only been playing 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I come at it from a different perspective as far what you can and
cannot do and what you should or should not do. I've always tried to
raise him to have more going on than just sports."</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Kell," as his father often calls him, was allowed to play
many other sports.</TE>
<TE>   "He could play flag football, but not organized tackle football
where most kids are wearing equipment that's too big and trying to do
things they shouldn't," Kellen Sr. said. "And I'm down on yelling by
coaches too."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did he want his son lifting weights too early, jeopardizing
his body's development, or absorbing hits from a young age.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wanted me to grow more, physically," Kellen Jr. said. "He
didn't want me to get hurt early. He'd say, 'You're going to have a
lot of football ahead of you.' "</TE>
<TE>   It certainly looks that way.</TE>
<TE>   Kellen Jr. has the skills of a receiver in a tight end's body -- a
6-foot-5, 233-pound build that's still maturing.</TE>
<TE>   His 32 catches lead the Hurricanes, and his average of 50.6 yards
a game is second only to receiver Andre Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable some of the things he does," quarterback Ken
Dorsey said.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing with Kellen when he first came was he could make any
catch, and he could run like a receiver. But the route-running and
blocking and the intricacies of college football were something he
had to learn and still is learning. I think by the end of the year
he's going to be extremely polished."</TE>
<TE>   That he ended up at Miami is a story in itself.</TE>
<TE>   Though he originally favored the Hurricanes, Kellen Jr. wanted to
go to Washington after Butch Davis left Miami to coach the Cleveland
Browns.</TE>
<TE>   But his father -- briefly a teammate of Rick Neuheisel's with the
Chargers the year Neuheisel appeared as a replacement player during
the 1987 NFL players strike -- was not enamored of the Huskies'
recruiting tactics, feeling the coaches went behind his back to
contact his son.</TE>
<TE>   He also pointedly faulted Washington for the racial makeup of its
staff. (Washington currently has two black assistants, neither one a
coordinator.) Instead, he wanted Kellen Jr. to consider Michigan
State, where Williams, an old acquaintance, was coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The athletic director and the head football coach were black at
the time, and I felt very good about the environment," Kellen Sr.
said. "Michigan State was also the only school that took him to meet
the university president."</TE>
<TE>   The day before Kellen Jr. was to announce his decision on
television, his father asked him what he planned to do.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Dad, I'm going to go to Washington.' I told him, 'If
you go on this show and tell people on national television you're
going to go to Washington, I'm going to tell you no on national
television,' " Kellen Sr. said, vowing never to sign his son's
scholarship papers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a situation where I'm going to let you make the wrong
decision and then say, 'I told you so.' "</TE>
<TE>   It made for more drama than anyone in the studio anticipated, but
there would be no television announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "We came home that evening after taping the show and went to
dinner with his godparents," Kellen Sr. said. "We needed a
third-party mediator.</TE>
<TE>   "He told his side. I told my reasons. They agreed with me. He was
pretty upset, even to the point he wasn't going to go to college. I
said, 'OK, you better get a job because you're not staying here.'</TE>
<TE>   "A couple days later, he came downstairs without any more serious
conversation about it and said, 'Dad, I'm going to go with my
original choice, Miami.' I said, 'I think it's a great school and
you'll be surrounded by athletes of your caliber.' It's the right
spot."</TE>
<TE>   Now some people figure the next great father-son debate could come
next year, when Kellen Jr. might be tempted to jump to the NFL after
his junior season.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd probably just say, 'Just finish school,' " Kellen Jr. said.
"I'd be like, 'What if I get hurt?' He'd just probably say, 'You'll
understand later.' "</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, he made a gesture his father says almost made him
cry.</TE>
<TE>   "I pick him up from the airport, he puts his bag in the trunk, and
then says, 'Wait, man, I've got to get something,' " Kellen Sr. said.</TE>
<TE>   "He pulls out a ring case. Of course I never had a national
championship ring of my own. He's so nonchalant, talking about how
they need to remain hungry and he really didn't earn it. He said he
wanted to be a major contributor on the next one and asked me to hold
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Don't give it to me, but I'll keep it for you, to keep
you from sitting in your dorm room looking at the past.' I was
overwhelmed by it. Here was a young man, 18 at the time, thinking in
these terms, wanting to get better.</TE>
<TE>   "As a parent, it made me feel like maybe I did something right."</TE>

<HD>Inspectors Prepare for Action</HD>
<DH>Trainees are experts in their fields, but sniffing out arms
production is a subtle art, veterans say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>About 50 scientists and engineers will finish a five-week crash
course here today in the tricky business of searching for weapons in
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Little is known by the public about their training, which began
behind soundproof doors on the seventh floor of a United Nations
complex and then moved to undisclosed locations for hands-on
sessions.</LD>
<LD>   The trainees are prohibited from speaking to outsiders, so only
the barest outline of their preparation can be gleaned. But the
ultimate result will be very public: The inspectors' reports from
Iraq could avert or precipitate a war.</LD>
<TE>   Will these new inspectors be ready for the job? Interviews with
former weapons inspectors and instructors suggest: not at first.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sort of a new profession for most of them," said a senior
U.N. official involved in the training. "They are experts in a
certain area, they are doing very technical work, but we ask them to
become inspectors.... Only a few of them have previous experience."</TE>
<TE>   Former inspectors say it may take a few tours of duty to get the
hang of the job. The new inspectors would go into Iraq for three to
four months at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix has said he can have an
advance team of inspectors on the ground in Baghdad within 10 days
once the U.N. Security Council approves a new resolution on Iraq,
which it is expected to do today. The inspectors will have 60 days to
submit an initial report to the council.</TE>
<TE>   So far about 260 people, including the current class, have
received the introductory five-week training conducted by the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or
UNMOVIC, over the past three years. A far smaller group, destined for
leadership roles, takes advanced courses in specialized areas.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials estimate that fewer than a third of any inspectors
sent to Iraq to track down weapons of mass destruction would have
previous experience there. Iraqis have accused some countries' past
U.N. inspectors of using tours as an opportunity to spy.</TE>
<TE>   Even for veteran inspectors, the task ahead is far more daunting
than it was during the previous inspection regime in the 1990s. From
the moment the teams touch down, they will be under extraordinary
pressure to make judgments about whether the Iraqis have assembled
prohibited weapons systems or the means for making them.</TE>
<TE>   These are hard assessments for experienced inspectors, but for
newcomers who don't know the lay of the land and lack a sixth sense
acquired from performing repeated inspections, it is far more
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as you yourself have not been tested in the field, you
cannot know what it is like," said Jacques Baute, the leader of the
Iraq team for the International Atomic Energy Agency and a former
weapons inspector at the organization that preceded UNMOVIC.</TE>
<TE>   The atomic agency inspects for nuclear weapons, while UNMOVIC
looks for chemical and biological weapons and the missiles used to
deliver them.</TE>
<TE>   The task facing weapons inspectors is slow and far from glamorous,
and requires skills as diverse as map reading, diplomacy, a knack for
psychology and the ability to write a cogent lab report. "The most
difficult aspect of the job is the amount of work it requires to be a
good inspector," said the senior U.N. official involved in training.</TE>
<TE>   Former inspectors, most of whom would speak only on condition of
anonymity because they work in sensitive positions, emphasized
learning the art of seeing both what is there and what is absent.
Does everything look the way it should? Is the Iraqi explanation of a
facility's purpose plausible? Is there something that fails to fit?</TE>
<TE>   "For example, if you go into a room and several documents are on
the table, are those the drawings the Iraqis are really working on,
or did they just burn the real drawings or throw them in the
wastebasket?" said a former chief missile inspector who sometimes
instructs trainees.</TE>
<TE>   To answer such questions requires detailed knowledge of, among
other things, how specific chemical and biological products are
manufactured; the equipment used for making them; the ingredients
that need to be on hand; and whether temperature controls are
required. But it also requires a feel for the story behind the story.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors are drawn from the defense industry, aerospace
companies, chemical and pesticide manufacturers and engineering. Some
are academics; others work for government or have private-sector
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Baute says his first inspection was eye-opening: "My first
inspection was a document search. But you don't just do the search in
offices and in file. You open drawers, cupboards; you check to see if
the ceiling is solid. These are not things that I would have expected
to be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors must scrutinize each site, testing Iraqi claims about
its use against their own observations.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, inspectors went to a plant where they suspected
biological weapons were being manufactured. The Iraqis told them the
facility was used only to make a single-cell protein for animal feed,
a legitimate use.</TE>
<TE>   "But then we see that it's way off in the desert, it's surrounded
by high walls, it's spread over several kilometers -- and we start
investigating it," said the senior U.N. official involved in the
UNMOVIC training.</TE>
<TE>   The site, Al Hakam, turned out to be the main installation where
the Iraqis were producing anthrax, using the same equipment needed to
make single-cell proteins.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't one smoking gun, but a whole list of factors that
were inconsistent," said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for UNMOVIC.</TE>
<TE>   The plant was demolished in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The key is follow-through. Sometimes, however, inspectors' worst
suspicions are allayed by evidence -- or a lack of it. In one
instance, nuclear inspectors found traces of iodine-131, a byproduct
of nuclear fission when found with other fission byproducts. But
close scrutiny and testing failed to detect any such byproducts. On
its own, iodine-131 has a legitimate medical use -- treating people
with thyroid problems.</TE>
<TE>   A crucial skill is the ability to interview Iraqi personnel.
Inspectors must be polite but persistent, canny but straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every inspector should conduct interviews," said one senior
inspector. "Some are better at analyzing data. Just because you're
the best missile expert doesn't mean you'll be the best missile
inspector."</TE>
<TE>   Hermann Strasser, a former biological weapons inspector from
Austria with expertise in pesticides, recalled interviewing a plant
manager about the use of certain equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "They are experts at baffling you," he recalled. "First I got some
information; I realized there was something wrong, so I asked some
more questions; then I got a second story, then a third story, then a
fourth story. The truth may be somewhere, but you don't know which
story to trust. The Iraqis would spend an hour telling you a story
and then say, 'Is that fine now?' "</TE>
<TE>   When Strasser would raise a problem in an explanation, they would
say, " 'Oh, I must have forgotten something,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   A look at the curriculum for the inspectors-in-training hints at
the range of skills needed. In addition to an introduction to the
legal rights of inspectors, all trainees attend lectures on Iraq's
history and political situation, the effects of a decade of U.N.
sanctions on the Iraqi people, and cultural sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Those classes take just the first two weeks. In the third week,
trainees spend three days with an Austrian military division that
specializes in chemical, biological and nuclear safety. They learn
how to use and work in protective gear and how to detect symptoms of
exposure to toxins, according to Ute Axmann, an Austrian army
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors also must master the material gleaned from past
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Then they split into groups, depending on their expertise. The
drill includes two practical exercises: an analysis of documents
taken during an investigation and a mock inspection. The host country
typically makes a chemical plant and a biological laboratory
available for the run-through, with former weapons inspectors playing
the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   The mock Iraqis try to fluster trainees by refusing to let them
take photographs or requiring that they write a letter saying why
they need to see the facility. "They have to know their rights," said
UNMOVIC spokesman Buchanan. They are allowed to take photographs and
do not have to provide written documentation of why they are doing an
inspection.</TE>
<TE>   But some lessons can't be learned in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been briefed on everything ... but what is not achieved
is that they are not faced with the stress of real life," said one
former inspector. "The exam will be the real inspection."</TE>

<HD>U.N. Measure on Iraqi Arms Nears Passage</HD>
<DH>Every Security Council member except Syria is expected
today to adopt the much-disputed resolution, a diluted version of a
U.S. draft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- After last-minute concessions to France and Russia,
the United States cleared the final hurdle Thursday on a hard-fought
U.N. resolution to disarm Iraq, and the Security Council is expected
to adopt it by a near-unanimous vote today.</LD>
<LD>   An ebullient President Bush insisted that the core U.S. demands
survived the intense two-month diplomacy even though the final
version of the resolution is very different from the one he
originally championed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm pleased with the resolution we put down," Bush said at a
White House news conference. "Otherwise, we wouldn't have put it
down."</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, a flurry of eleventh-hour negotiations Thursday --
including U.S. acceptance of a one-word change from "or" to "and" --
watered down the already limited authority granted by the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   With the change, the final version had the apparent support of 14
of the 15 members of the Security Council. Syria was the only member
threatening to vote against the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   All sides claimed victory, including the holdout French and
Russians, who said they had curtailed U.S. warmongering and ensured
that there will be a second stage of deliberations before going to
any war.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's remarks Thursday illustrated just how far his position
on Iraq has evolved over the last two months. Instead of demanding
"regime change" and an immediate authorization to use force against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the resolution launches a new
inspections program and emphasizes eradication of weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution "is a tough new resolution," Bush said. "It talks
about material breach and inspections and serious consequences if
Saddam Hussein continues to defy the world and not disarm."</TE>
<TE>   With the new resolution, the U.S. has committed itself to
supporting the return of inspectors to verify disarmament, a process
that with Iraq's full cooperation is open-ended. Once the resolution
is passed, Iraq has a week to confirm it will comply with the tougher
inspections. If it balks, military action could begin at any time,
according to U.S. officials. Military planners have said they are
looking at the winter months for any action.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was personally involved in the final negotiations, speaking
with French President Jacques Chirac and Russian President Vladimir
V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Chirac and Putin had discussed the possibility of
abstaining from the vote unless "ambiguities" were removed from the
resolution. They were supported by China, Mexico and Ireland, who
pushed hard to change that single word in a passage on the sequence
of events after inspections are completed and to remove what they saw
as a loophole for the United States to act alone.</TE>
<TE>   They said the original wording proposed in the U.S. draft -- the
third draft offered by the United States and Britain -- would have
let the United States determine on its own whether Iraq violated the
terms of the resolution, which could then trigger an attack on
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   France, Russia and others interpret the word change to mean that
only the weapons inspectors can report to the council that Iraq has
not lived up to its obligations to rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction, and only the Security Council can assess whether it is a
breach serious enough to justify military action.</TE>
<TE>   But in a feat of "creative ambiguity," the resolution is silent on
whether the U.S. must wait for council authorization before taking
action against Iraq, leaving Washington free to attack after the
council meets.</TE>
<TE>   The change of an "or" to an "and" tried to narrow the remaining
ambiguities. Fearing that the U.S. would regard Iraq's slightest
infraction as cause to attack, the simple word change satisfied
skeptical delegates that the process would be guided by the council.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'and' is very good," said Irish Ambassador Richard Ryan, who
hadn't committed his country's support for the resolution until this
week. "It keeps the hands of the council members as a whole on the
steering wheel of the resolution in the future. It's of enormous
significance."</TE>
<TE>   The move sets the stage for potentially unanimous approval today.
Syria has been expected to vote against the measure, but hinted that
it might back the resolution if the vote could be delayed until
Monday to allow the Syrians time to corral the support of Arab
nations. The United States and Britain, co-sponsors of the
resolution, declined to postpone the vote, gambling that Syria could
be persuaded to come along if the other 14 members did, but shrugging
off a possible "no" vote.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Thursday's concession on the language showed
that the United States is genuinely committed to a multilateral
process.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no 'automaticity' and this is a two-stage process, and in
that regard we have met the principal concerns that have been
expressed for the resolution," U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte
said. "Whatever violation there is, or is judged to exist, will be
dealt with in the council, and the council will have an opportunity
to consider the matter before any other action is taken."</TE>
<TE>   The compromise reassured diplomats who have suspected that despite
engaging in negotiations at the United Nations, the U.S. will
ultimately attack Iraq with or without the sanction of the Security
Council. If the U.S. is sincere about involving the U.N., said
Russia's ambassador, Sergei V. Lavrov, then the process has been
valuable.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the position of the United States," Lavrov said. "But if
they say that this resolution is not about an extra authorization,
[that] it's a genuine effort to have inspectors on the ground and to
fulfill entirely the mandate, then it's quite important."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials declined to acknowledge that their
position shifted considerably through the course of negotiations. But
three months ago, when Vice President Dick Cheney first put Iraq on
the administration's front burner, he seemed to dismiss the U.N. and
the entire idea of using inspectors to monitor Hussein and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam has perfected the game of cheat and retreat, and is very
skilled in the art of denial and deception," Cheney said in August.
"A return of inspectors would provide no assurance whatsoever of this
compliance with U.N. resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   In his own speech to the United Nations a few weeks later, Bush
barely mentioned weapons inspectors except to note that the
inspections program had been unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even
when inspectors were in his country," Bush said at the time. "Are we
to assume that he stopped when they left?"</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad has blocked the entry of teams seeking chemical and
biological arms and materials designed to build nuclear weapons since
December 1998, when the United States and Britain launched airstrikes
to punish Hussein for failing to cooperate with the former U.N.
disarmament agency.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials had argued that any military action ought
to be launched before March, when hot weather in Iraq complicates
military operations. U.S. officials say privately that based on
Iraq's history with weapons inspections and its continued efforts to
develop weapons, Baghdad will probably provide cause for the use of
force sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says the resolution does not restrict it
from launching military action, which it maintains is authorized
under previous Security Council resolutions on Iraq. But it does
commit it to a second round of U.N. deliberations on the question of
whether and how to use force to enforce Iraqi disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not handcuff the United States," said National Security
Council spokesman Sean McCormack, "but it does provide an avenue for
the Security Council to demonstrate its relevance."</TE>

<HD>4 SLA Members Plead Guilty to Killing</HD>
<DH>They express regret as they admit roles in '75 slaying of a

<LD>Four members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the radical leftist
group that cut a violent path through California in the mid-1970s,
pleaded guilty Thursday to the murder of a churchgoing mother of four
during a suburban bank robbery here more than a quarter-century ago.</LD>
<LD>   In an emotional courtroom hearing, the four aging SLA defendants
-- Emily Montague, her former husband William Harris, Michael Bortin
and Sara Jane Olson -- agreed to second-degree murder charges in the
1975 shotgun slaying of Myrna Opsahl and tearfully apologized to her
family.</LD>
<LD>   "I do not want them to believe that we ever considered her life
insignificant," said Montague, 55, who acknowledged that she pulled
the trigger in the shotgun slaying of Opsahl, but told a hushed
courtroom that the shotgun discharged accidentally.</LD>
<TE>   The slaying was "something I've thought about every day for the
last 27 years," Montague, a computer consultant from Altadena, said
after the court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that by telling the truth that it brings some relief
to the family, them knowing that I'm taking responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why she hadn't done that sooner, Montague paused for a
second and then answered: "That's a long and complicated thing."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of a plea agreement reached after days of
negotiations, Montague could spend eight years behind bars and Harris
faces a seven-year sentence. Olson, who is already serving up to 14
years for attempting to bomb two Los Angeles Police Department squad
cars, and Bortin are to serve six years in prison. A sentencing
hearing is set for Feb. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl's son, Jon, who learned of the plea agreement late
Wednesday afternoon, said he was stunned that the case had come to
such a sudden conclusion. Although he had hoped for a stiffer
sentence, Opsahl said he accepted the penalties that the SLA foursome
face.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no reason to pursue any lengthier prison time," Opsahl
said, noting that each of the four had remade themselves into
responsible citizens with families and children.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as perfect justice," he said. "There's
nothing we can do that will bring my mother back to life."</TE>
<TE>   His father, Trygve Opsahl, also expressed compassion for the four
defendants and their families.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no hard feelings for the people involved," said Opsahl,
76, a retired surgeon. "I hope they'll be able to have some life
after they leave prison."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Scully, Sacramento district attorney, said prosecutors agreed
to the deal only after concluding that substantial legal and
evidentiary hurdles remained if they went to trial. The 27-year-old
case, she said, had grown musty with age, faded memories and the
deaths of some witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "There comes a time when a wrong, albeit an old one, has to be
addressed," said Scully, adding that the agreement was "a very
difficult decision for me."</TE>
<TE>   With good behavior in prison, the four SLA members could see their
sentences cut roughly in half. A fifth suspect in the case, James
Kilgore, remains at large. Michael Mason, FBI special agent in charge
of the Sacramento office, said "we will not rest until he, too, is
brought before the bar of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento Sheriff Lou Blanas credited Jon Opsahl as "the man who
single-handedly got us going" to reopen an aggressive investigation
into the case two years ago. Opsahl, medical director at a Colton
clinic, created a Web site devoted to the case and waged a persistent
campaign to push authorities to bring charges against his mother's
killers. He eventually prevailed after Olson was brought to trial on
the Los Angeles bombing charges.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants pleaded guilty before Judge Thomas M. Cecil, for
the first time admitting to crimes they had long denied.</TE>
<TE>   Their pleas marked what is probably the final chapter for the
paramilitary band, which became notorious after it kidnapped
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst from her Berkeley apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst reemerged weeks later as a brainwashed, carbine-toting
member of the SLA. If the plea agreement had not been reached, she
was expected to be the star witness for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Montague and Harris went to prison in 1977 for their roles in
Hearst's kidnapping and a string of other crimes. They were released
in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst's past with the SLA, seemingly behind her, came crashing
back with the 2000 arrest of Sara Jane Olson, the pseudonym adopted
by SLA member Kathleen Soliah, who reinvented herself as a Minnesota
soccer mom during 25 years in hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst was slated to be, by her own account, a reluctant witness
at Olson's trial for planting bombs that failed to go off under
several Los Angeles police cars.</TE>
<TE>   After the arrests in the Opsahl slaying, Hearst presented a
different face, calling Opsahl's murder a "violent, senseless, evil
act" and suggested no qualms about testifying against her erstwhile
comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "They just don't have any power over me anymore," she said in an
interview on CNN's Larry King program. "They haven't had for years."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst had detailed the events of the bank robbery in a chapter of
her 1982 autobiography, "Every Secret Thing."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers planned to attack Hearst's truthfulness and
character, painting the portrait of a brainwashing victim steeped in
suspect memories and sullied recollections.</TE>
<TE>   Her brief reign as Tania, the name Hearst chose as the SLA's
radical convert, induced a trauma that shadows her to this day,
making her unfit as a witness, the defense lawyers have argued.</TE>
<TE>   They had talked of asking for a full psychiatric examination of
her.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst's book recounted the roles of each SLA member during the
slaying of Opsahl. While the armed William Harris waited outside,
Hearst wrote, Olson, Bortin and Montague entered the bank, masks or
disguises in place.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst, who admitted to driving a getaway car, recounts that
Montague rationalized afterward that Opsahl "was a bourgeois pig
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   During the court hearing, Montague emphatically denied she ever
said such a thing. "There has never been a time when I or any of my
co-defendants devalued Mrs. Opsahl's life in any way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hearst book also provided Montague with key evidence that
apparently helped persuade authorities to drop first-degree murder
demands, which would have carried a life sentence. Hearst said that
the shotgun Montague used was known to have a hair trigger, going off
accidentally.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst served nearly two years in prison for her 1976 conviction
of robbing the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco with the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   The robbery provided one of the iconic images of the 1970s: A
surveillance shot of Hearst carrying a semiautomatic carbine during
the holdup.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Hearst's sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter.
She was pardoned by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.</TE>
<TE>   During the hourlong court hearing, Montague spoke of the murder of
Opsahl and took full responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing glasses and a dark pants suit, Montague said she hoped the
Opsahl family would gain some measure of solace from the admissions
of guilt and expressions of remorse she and the others offered.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris, his hair and beard gray, said he acted as a
lookout during the robbery, from a position across the street from
the bank. "There's absolutely nothing I can say that can repair the
Opsahl family, and I say that from the bottom of my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, in a yellow smock and orange prison pants, a prison ID
bracelet on her left wrist, calmly described how she entered the bank
and climbed over the bank counter during the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   "I never entered that bank with the intention of hurting anybody,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bortin, a Portland flooring contractor, spoke from a statement
handwritten on a piece of notebook paper. He said he walked into the
bank, "announced the robbery" and "waved my handgun a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Opsahl's death, Bortin said he was "devastated and
very ashamed ... I know it doesn't mean much to say I'm sorry to the
family.... I just can't imagine how horrible it must be."</TE>
<TE>   Bortin alone alluded to the social and political context in which
the crime took place during the turbulent final days of the Vietnam
War. The robbery took place April 21, 1975 -- nine days before the
fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces put an end to the war.</TE>
<TE>   Resorting to Violence</TE>
<TE>   Bortin apologized for having caused horrible damage to the cause
of social change by his resort to violence.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible for all the nonviolent people that were really
idealistic and well-intentioned in the '60s," he said after the court
hearing. "We kind of deflected some bad karma on them."</TE>
<TE>   Bortin also said he hoped "this will provide some closure for the
Opsahl family."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to admitting guilt, the four SLA members agreed to
financial restitution to Opsahl's family. If they in any way profit
from the case, such as writing a book, the money would be donated to
a scholarship fund for nurses, Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to the court, Assistant Dist. Atty. Rob Gold said
that each of the four defendants had led law-abiding lives in the
last two decades and no longer "pose a threat to the community." Gold
said he had consulted with Opsahl's family before accepting the plea
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said their clients agreed to the deal only after
getting assurances that if the state Board of Prison Terms seeks to
add extra time to their sentences, the deal would be voided and the
case would go back to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The board held a hearing last month in Chowchilla state prison for
women, where Olson is serving her sentence in the LAPD case, and
added nearly a decade to her sentence. Olson's attorneys are
attempting to overturn that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also agreed to let Harris, Montague and Bortin remain
free until their sentencing early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Support From Friend</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Kaluza, who has been friends with Olson for 25 years,
said that the plea doesn't change how she feels about her.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't be spending taxpayer money to be keeping her behind
bars," said Kaluza, a loan officer in Minnesota. "She is kind, she is
generous, she is smart."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Clay Benson, who has known Emily Harris since junior high
school in Hinsdale, Ill., said she was stunned by news of the guilty
plea.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be easy to keep quiet about something like that with all
the people close to you for so long," she said. "I'm surprised and
sad and I hope that, for Emily, this brings some comfort."</TE>
<TE>   The SLA, formed in the Oakland-Berkeley area in 1973, drew a mix
of college-educated white radicals and black ex-convicts who believed
in a violent leftist revolution driven by a "symbiosis" of races.</TE>
<TE>   The SLA was largely shunned by the rest of the left, which viewed
the group as overly violent and more than a little strange.</TE>
<TE>   It exploded onto the scene with the assassination of Oakland's
popular black schools superintendent, Marcus Foster.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed, in February 1974, by the kidnapping of Hearst
and her reemergence as one of the memorable figures of the era.</TE>
<TE>   One month later, six SLA "soldiers," including leader Donald David
DeFreeze, aka General Field Marshal Cinque, died in a fiery shootout
with police in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of bombings and the Opsahl murder, the remaining
SLA members were arrested in San Francisco in September 1975.</TE>

<TE>   5 Lives Diverged After SLA Days</TE>
<TE>   The five people charged with the murder of Myrna Opsahl have taken
various paths since their days together in the Symbionese Liberation
Army. Here is a look at what they have been doing.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of the five at 57, he served nearly eight years at San
Quentin for other SLA crimes and has worked since then as a private
investigator in the Bay Area. He briefly worked as an investigator
for the district attorney's office in San Francisco, but was forced
to give that up when his felony record kept him from obtaining a
state license in 1995, according to state officials. Divorced from
Emily Harris, he remarried and has two sons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emily Montague (formerly Harris)</TE>
<TE>   She served more than seven years for kidnapping heiress Patricia
Hearst and other crimes. Montague, now 55, learned computer skills in
prison and parlayed that into a successful career as a computer
consultant to the entertainment industry. She has a committed
relationship with Noreen Baca, with whom she shares a home in
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sara Jane Olson</TE>
<TE>   The former Kathleen Soliah, now 55, went underground after her SLA
days and remade her life as a middle-class Minnesota housewife and
amateur actress before her arrest in June 1999. She pleaded guilty in
February of this year to charges stemming from a failed bombing
attempt against Los Angeles Police Department officers in 1975.
Married to a St. Paul doctor, she has three children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bortin</TE>
<TE>   Never one of the higher-profile SLA members, the 54-year-old
Bortin has lived quietly in Portland, Ore., for the last two decades,
installing hardwood floors for a living. A father of four, he is
married to Olson's sister, Josephine Soliah.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Kilgore</TE>
<TE>   Whereabouts unknown. The driver's license photo at right is
believed to be that of Kilgore. The 55-year-old Kilgore went
underground with the rest of the SLA in the mid-1970s, but unlike the
others, he never surfaced. Four years ago, Bortin hinted that he was
in touch with Kilgore and described him as "in the same situation the
rest of us are in, basically -- middle class, kids and everything."</TE>

<HD>A Matter of Life and Death</HD>
<DH>Illinois Gov. George Ryan backed executions, until an
inmate's fate was in his hands. His second thoughts have damaged him
politically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>When the death penalty finally had a name, Andrew Kokoraleis, and a
face, squared-jawed and olive-skinned, George Ryan's nearly three
decades of preparation deserted him.</LD>
<LD>   The Illinois governor had been in politics most of his adult life,
and as a legislator had voted to reinstate capital punishment. He
then helped shape the state's death penalty system, and campaigned
time and again on the conservative Republican platform of law and
order and the ultimate punishment for criminals such as Kokoraleis, a
mutilation murderer.</LD>
<LD>   In March 1999, though, the facade of infallibility surrounding the
death penalty system was peeling away like shoddy siding. And in the
midst of its startling collapse Ryan, governor for just 2 1/2 months,
had to decide whether a subject of this system would live or die.</LD>
<TE>   He called in the prosecutors and defense attorneys from the case,
questioned detectives who had interrogated Kokoraleis in the slaying
of 21-year-old secretary Lorraine Borowski. He spent nights poring
over stacks of legal documents.</TE>
<TE>   On March 16, hours before Kokoraleis (pronounced Koka-RAL-us) was
scheduled to die, Ryan still hadn't made up his mind, and directed an
aide to prepare the documents for a 90-day stay of execution. There
was a phone on his desk with a direct link to the execution chamber
361 miles south near the town of Tamms.</TE>
<TE>   A Methodist, he prayed. He asked others to pray. But he didn't
file the stay and he didn't lift the receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally decided he was guilty, and needed to be executed," Ryan
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   At 12:33 a.m. on March 17, prison officials sent a chemical
solution flowing into Kokoraleis' arm. Four minutes later, he licked
his lips, breathed heavily three times, and died.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only execution Ryan would oversee. The 68-year-old
Midwestern conservative was on his reluctant way to becoming the
unlikeliest of heroes to death penalty opponents around the world,
and at the same time a pariah in his own state party.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 10 months, fissures in the system would turn to
cracks, which would turn to crevasses.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors who "knew or should have known" they were trying the
wrong men were sending them to death row anyway; the accused were
being defended by disbarred lawyers; death sentences were being
issued solely on the testimony of jailhouse informants -- prisoners
with nothing to lose and freedom to gain in exchange for damning
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Jan. 31, 2000, Ryan was again sitting in his office
here, 16 floors above a melancholy wash of old gray snow, when the
state attorney general called. Several death row inmates had lost
their final appeals, he said, and it was time to schedule them for
the death chamber.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Ryan grumbled, "you might want to hold off on that. I
might have something to say."</TE>
<TE>   Media Summoned</TE>
<TE>   He hung up and instructed his staff to call a news conference
immediately. He did have something to say.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois
is truly guilty," Ryan announced, "until I can be sure with moral
certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection,
no one will meet that fate."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is now considering clemency requests by 142 of the state's
160 death row inmates and is likely to commute some of their
sentences to life terms, aides say.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three years after he called the moratorium, two months
before he leaves politics, probably for good, it is not clear even to
Ryan how much his fundamental philosophy has changed when it comes to
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   He still believes that some crimes deserve the final punishment,
believes he made the right decision with Kokoraleis. But when asked
recently if a flawless system were built, one that could never
execute an innocent person, would he then oppose executions on
philosophical or moral grounds, Ryan pauses at length.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the things I'm still wrestling with," he says in an
uncharacteristically hushed voice. "I don't know how you ever make it
perfect."</TE>
<TE>   When Ryan returns home to Kankakee in January after 30 years in
politics, he will leave behind a legacy he neither dreamed nor
wanted, one that reportedly had him being considered for a Nobel
Peace prize at the same time fellow Republicans were rushing him into
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "The debate has shifted dramatically," said Richard Dieter of the
Death Penalty Information Center. Just a few years ago, politicians
"didn't want to question the death penalty, let alone oppose it. I
think Gov. Ryan has been uniquely important in that he is a
Republican and a supporter of the death penalty ... and yet was
somebody who was visibly and dramatically changed by being
responsible for the death penalty in his state."</TE>
<TE>   George H. Ryan was born in Louisiana in 1934, and as a young boy
moved with his parents to Kankakee, a farm town 60 miles south of
Chicago. He grew up the conservative son of a conservative
pharmacist, served two years in the Army in Korea and, when he got
out, married his high school sweetheart, Lura Lynn, with whom he now
has six children and 14 grandchildren. He studied pharmacology and
joined the family business.</TE>
<TE>   Politics, though, soon pulled at him. And in 1972, with the family
increasingly comfortable in its ownership of several drugstores, Ryan
ran successfully for the state Legislature. Five years later,
Illinois, like much of the nation, was in the midst of a debate over
reinstating the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   As the Legislature prepared to vote on the issue, a colleague
asked who among them would be willing to throw the switch. Ryan had
no gruesome longing to be an executioner, but he firmly believed that
certain criminals deserved to die. He stood and voted to reinstate --
and then forgot about the death penalty, he says, except in the most
abstract way.</TE>
<TE>   Law-and-Order Man</TE>
<TE>   Ryan became speaker of the House, then lieutenant governor, then
secretary of state in 1991. During his eight years as secretary, he
lowered the legal limit for drunk driving, required that school bus
drivers undergo criminal background checks and otherwise solidified
his credentials as a law-and-order man.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that his beliefs and politics were uncomplicated; Ryan
irked many in his party with his support of gun control and some
types of affirmative action. But over the years his opinions had
solidified: the war on drugs was worthy; tollways had become
outdated; the death penalty was what it was.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he was elected governor, and took office under a weighty
mantle of campaign promises, from rebuilding highways to raising
sentences for gun crimes to doubling the number of parole officers.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Ryan was sworn in, though, Anthony Porter, who had
been convicted of murder, was freed after 16 years on death row
because of the work of journalism students from Northwestern
University. Porter was two days from dying when his execution was
stayed.</TE>
<TE>   One month later, another death row inmate, Steven Smith, was
exonerated, becoming the 11th person to be freed since Illinois
reinstated the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned by the revelations, Ryan began privately discussing the
possibility of a moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Kokoraleis case landed on his desk. The death penalty
"wasn't in the abstract anymore," Ryan says.</TE>
<TE>   Kokoraleis had been one of four members of a group who dubbed
themselves "The Ripper Crew" that in the early 1980s committed as
many as 18 murders, gang-raping and cutting the breasts off some of
the women before killing them.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Ryan decided there was no doubt as to Kokoraleis'
guilt, he struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolute anguish that [Ryan] went through when it came to
that first case," said Jeremy Margolis, a Chicago attorney and
unofficial advisor who was with Ryan during the execution. "He had to
wrestle for the first time in his life with the human factors that
come with the death penalty.... 'How would I feel if I were the
father of the victim? How would I feel if I were the father of the
defendant?' "</TE>
<TE>   Ryan doesn't mark Kokoraleis' death as his turning point, and
those who know him say he did not dwell on the execution once it was
over. But, Ryan makes clear, he never wants to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an awesome decision that I'm not sure belongs in the hands
of anybody, any one person, [including] the governor," he says,
adding that a review board may be a better answer, but he's not
certain.</TE>
<TE>   The same day Kokoraleis was put to death, Cook County prosecutors
dropped charges against Ronald Jones after DNA tests exonerated him
from a rape and murder conviction. He had spent eight years on death
row.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of serious trouble in the system continued to mount.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1999, the Chicago Tribune ran a series of stories
detailing flaws in the process: Half of the nearly 300 capital cases
had been reversed for a sentencing hearing or new trial; 33 death row
inmates had been represented by attorneys who had been suspended or
disbarred; prosecutors had used jailhouse informants to help
prosecute 46 of the inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, on Jan. 19, 2000, Steven Manning, a former
Chicago police officer, was cleared in the 1990 murder of a onetime
business partner and freed from death row. That brought to 13 the
number of death row inmates exonerated since capital punishment was
reinstated; 12 had been executed.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 presidential primaries were underway. The Republican
nominee, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who authorized 152
executions, favored the death penalty. So did Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic candidate.</TE>
<TE>   It was in this environment that Ryan summoned his top advisors to
a Benihana restaurant in the Loop for a late working dinner on Jan.
29. Over sushi and stir fry, the chef looking like a baton twirler
with his silver knives flashing, Ryan talked about putting all
executions on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "He was 90% sure about the moratorium by the end of dinner, but
not 100%," said press secretary Dennis Culloton.</TE>
<TE>   The following Monday, the attorney general called about scheduling
the executions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's when he made up his mind -- on the phone with the
attorney general," Culloton said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is a big man with thick, calloused hands. He has a gravel pit
of a voice that rises considerably in volume but very little in
pitch. He dresses in dark suits, white shirts, conservative ties and
function-before-fashion gold-rimmed eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about him says: You want fancy, novel solutions? Go
somewhere else. You want to build some highways, a new stadium, push
through some solid legislation? Come see me. We'll have some
meetings, make some deals and get it done.</TE>
<TE>   His predecessor, Jim Edgar, was a moderate, a consensus builder
and a teetotaler who banned alcohol at the governor's mansion. When
Ryan moved in, the drinks came back out -- his preference being the
occasional bloody mary -- and the old-style Illinois deal-makers came
back in.</TE>
<TE>   His accomplishments, including a massive $12-billion effort to
rebuild the state's sagging infrastructure and markedly increasing
education funding, however, have been largely overshadowed by
controversies -- first a scandal that followed Ryan from his days as
secretary of state, and then the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Troubles</TE>
<TE>   Underlings in his Motor Vehicles Division, it turned out, had been
handing out commercial driver's licenses in exchange for bribes.
Operation Safe Road, an ongoing federal probe into the bribes, has
resulted in 50 convictions thus far, and revealed that about $170,000
in bribe money wound up in Ryan's gubernatorial campaign coffers.
Ryan has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied any knowledge
of the kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The probe, however, has colored his governorship from the first
day. And as the parties began planning their 2002 campaigns, the
pressure for Ryan to bow out became tremendous.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in August 2001, state Republican Party executive
director Brad Goodrich put it as delicately as he could: "Because of
the affection so many of us hold for the governor and his family,
many hope he chooses not to put himself and his family through a
difficult campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Ryan announced he would not seek a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the tumult, though, the thing that has haunted him
most, friends and aides say, has been the specter of executing an
innocent person.</TE>
<TE>   Lined up on the floor of his Chicago office are 11 4-inch-thick
binders containing the guts of every capital case in the state. Ryan
and his advisors study them on planes, in cars, reference them for
journalists from as far away as Britain, Italy, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   For Ryan, increasingly conflicted about the death penalty, the
moratorium was but a first step. Less than two months later, in March
2000, he appointed a Commission on Capital Punishment to study
Illinois' system, stocking it with prosecutors, cops, defense
attorneys and judges. As the commission worked, he vetoed two bills
that would have expanded the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in March of this year, Ryan and several staffers boarded a
commercial flight to Eugene, Ore., where he was to deliver a speech
on the death penalty at the University of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   On the Southwest Airlines 737, they discussed his latest
pondering: issuing a blanket clemency for all condemned prisoners in
Illinois, commuting their death sentences to terms of life in prison.
It was just an idea.</TE>
<TE>   "The speech was over when some young [prosecutor] said, 'You know,
if you feel this strongly about it, why don't you commute all the
sentences?' " Ryan recalls. It was a challenge. "I said, 'I may well
do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   His chief aide for the death penalty, former federal prosecutor
Matt Bettenhausen, winced. Here we go again, Bettenhausen thought.
Indeed, within minutes, the staffers' cell phones and pagers were
ringing and buzzing. "It was a question and I answered it -- without
a lot of thought," Ryan says matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the group returned to Illinois, Ryan's statement in
Oregon had sunk in. The governor was now considering changing the
sentence of every death row inmate by executive fiat.</TE>
<TE>   The outcry from victims' families, prosecutors, police and others
rose immediately but was swiftly drowned out -- for a time -- by the
release of the capital punishment commission's report. The death
penalty system in Illinois, the report said, was junk, a potentially
disastrous heap of laws tossed one on top of another.</TE>
<TE>   "Our study revealed a system that is desperately in need of
repair," said Thomas Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor and
co-chair of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before the commission released its report publicly,
members of the panel gathered to discuss their findings with Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Turow, a Chicago lawyer who is the author of such legal
thrillers as "Presumed Innocent" and one of the commissioners,
remembers Ryan's reaction when the panel saluted him for his courage.</TE>
<TE>   "Ryan looked honestly startled," Turow recalled. "He said, 'What
else was I going to do?' "</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's controversial decision to impose the moratorium was
vindicated, and more. The commission -- which Ryan was first accused
of stacking with death penalty proponents, and later opponents -- did
not recommend scrapping the death penalty, but said the machine
should not be restarted unless and until it was stripped down and
rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Among the commission's recommendations: create a panel to review
prosecutors' decisions to seek the death penalty before the case goes
to trial; do away with 15 of the 20 aggravating factors that can lead
to a death sentence; ban execution of the mentally retarded; and
prohibit death sentences based solely on the testimony of an
eyewitness or jailhouse informant.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan was emboldened by the report, friends say. He began to speak
openly and frequently about the possibility of commuting all death
sentences. And he pushed ahead with plans to hold a hearing on the
case of every death row inmate who wanted to seek clemency.</TE>
<TE>   The families of victims, prosecutors, police and politicians began
again to decry what they called Ryan's insensitivity and temerity;
how dare he, with a signature, undercut the judicial process for
thousands of people who suffered a loved one murdered?</TE>
<TE>   The two weeks of hearings, which ended Oct. 25, became the most
serious challenge yet to Ryan's reform efforts. In the overwhelming
majority of cases, there was little doubt about the guilt of the
condemned. They did it. One murdered children and sodomized their
corpses, one smashed an 86-year-old woman's skull with her cane,
another killed a pregnant woman and sliced her fetus from her womb.</TE>
<TE>   "Shame on you, Gov. Ryan," said Marie Kalbert, whose sister was
beaten to death with a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   After a week of being excoriated at the hearings, Ryan said he
would likely not grant a blanket clemency, but rather handle each
case individually. Aides say one or two inmates may indeed be
innocent, and that Ryan may commute sentences he believes were
unfairly handled even though they haven't been overturned by a court.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Rod Blagojevich, who beat Secretary of State Jim Ryan --
no relation to George Ryan -- in Tuesday's gubernatorial race, has
said he will leave the moratorium in place, at least until the
Legislature addresses problems pointed out by the death penalty
commission.</TE>
<TE>   On a clear, cool fall day just before the hearings began, Ryan sat
down in his Chicago office to discuss state-sanctioned executions.</TE>
<TE>   He looks a bit tired, but he often looks that way these days. The
Chicago Sun-Times had recently run a front-page story dubbing him
"Gov. Grumpy," suggesting that the scandals and his status as a lame
duck have left him "mean-spirited" and uncaring about the will of the
voters.</TE>
<TE>   He sits on a long sofa and talks about how maybe an attorney would
be more qualified than a pharmacist to carry out an execution or
oversee a death penalty system, but probably not. He talks about the
pressure from his party.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had some people say, 'Don't do anything crazy with the death
penalty. We don't want to lose our base,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   He talks about a close neighbor in Kankakee who was murdered, and
about how his views on capital punishment began to shift, decades
after he thought they had set permanently.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought that the death penalty was maybe a deterrent.
But I don't think that's the case. I don't know what it deters."</TE>
<TE>   He talks about Andrew Kokoraleis, how he knew the man had
committed that murder, and how he could have picked up the phone and
stopped the execution anyway, but didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad enough," he says, "if the guy's guilty."</TE>

<HD>Diplomacy Gives Bush Upper Hand Against Iraq</HD>
<DH>By working closely with the U.N. Security Council, the U.S.
has put itself in a stronger position to pursue nation's disarmament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Two months of bruising negotiations at the U.N.
Security Council have left the Bush administration far better
positioned to pursue its campaign to disarm Iraq, diplomats and
analysts said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   By slogging through the process and making concessions to a world
body it has often criticized, the administration has restored
credibility with potential allies who were outraged by its initial
argument that it needed no international mandate to attack Iraq,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The goodwill the United States has fostered should help if Iraq
refuses to comply with the resolution and the Bush administration
returns to the Security Council and assembles an international
coalition for a war against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, they
said.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the negotiation process has forced each council
member government to confront the Iraq problem, and ultimately to
agree that Hussein was not complying with disarmament obligations,
that that was unacceptable and that meaningful inspections were
essential, a senior U.S. administration official said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It clearly puts the ball in Iraq's court," the official said.
"The international community ... is saying, 'OK, Iraq, we got these
Americans to give you one last chance, now over to you.' "</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said Thursday that he was optimistic after
telephone calls with French President Jacques Chirac and Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin that the latest version of the Iraq
resolution, which was jointly sponsored by Britain, would pass today.
Diplomats expect a wide margin of support, if not unanimous approval.</TE>
<TE>   But some hawkish Republicans, who opposed taking the resolution to
the United Nations in the first place, still hope the resolution will
be voted down.</TE>
<TE>   A defeat at the Security Council, argued conservative scholar
Frank Gaffney, would relieve Bush of the need to clear his moves with
the United Nations and leave him free to assemble a coalition of
nations willing to go to war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffney and other hawks argue that the final resolution -- which
precludes immediate U.S. military action against Iraq -- will tie the
United States to a bureaucratic and ineffectual U.N. inspection
process.</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for any weapons of mass destruction may drag on well into
winter, the optimum time for a ground attack on Iraq, and ultimately
fail, the hawks argue.</TE>
<TE>   "It will buy Saddam breathing room, it will embolden him, and it
will make it more difficult to take military action," Gaffney said.
"If we give Saddam another year, there's no telling how much more
serious this problem will have become."</TE>
<TE>   Liberals worry that a double victory this week -- at the polls and
the U.N. -- will embolden Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see how many members of the Security
Council will stand up to Uncle Sam or decide to get on the war train
when it becomes irrevocably clear that it's leaving the station,"
said Richard K. Betts, director of the Institute of War and Peace
Studies at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   "After the election triumph, it's hard to believe Bush won't feel
like he's on a roll and be even harder to stop," Betts said,
referring to Republican gains in the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush gave a nuanced nod to the concerns of both political camps
Thursday by insisting that "war is not my first choice ... it's my
last choice," but also emphasizing that if the U.S. finds war
necessary, it will "move swiftly with force to do the job."</TE>
<TE>   A successful U.N. resolution will make it easier for Bush to
weather charges of "cowboy" unilateralism, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The public was clearly very worried about the U.S. taking on Iraq
on its own," said David Malone, president of the International Peace
Academy in New York, a think tank. "With this resolution comes the
assurance that if the administration in the future does decide to
take on Iraq, it will be possible for the U.S. to marshal a credible
coalition."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats spent countless hours haggling over phrases, verb
tenses, even the words "and" and "or" -- and hundreds of hours on the
telephone lobbying senior diplomats, not just from the 15 Security
Council member countries but also from other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, domestic and international political realities spurred
the administration to engage in the diplomatic heavy-lifting. The
congressional authorization Bush won in October to use force to
disarm Iraq specifies that the administration should seek a Security
Council resolution. America's top ally against Iraq, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, needed a U.N. resolution to keep his own Labor
Party from rebelling. Winning military cooperation from other nations
would be difficult if not impossible without a U.N. mandate. And
finally, the U.S. cannot afford to ignore the U.N. now if it expects
help rebuilding Iraq after a war.</TE>
<TE>   But the willingness to stick it out was seen as a victory for
pragmatists over ideologues within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes spending two months banging your head against the
wall in New York," the senior administration official said. "It's not
fun. Multilateralism is not easy. But it's necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also signaled Thursday that upholding the authority of the
Security Council has become a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "When they pass this resolution, which I hope they do tomorrow, it
shows that the U.N. is beginning to assume its responsibilities to
make sure that 11 years of defiance does not go unanswered," the
president said. "It's very important that the U.N. be a successful
international body, because the threats that we face now require more
cooperation than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a National Security Council official in the
Clinton administration and frequent Bush administration critic,
praised the administration's handling of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "They have stuck to the fundamental principles you need to stick
to and maneuvered with language that has subtly changed the meaning
of the resolution over time in a way that gives as much as possible
without fundamentally undermining [Bush's] principles," Daalder said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the resolution does not preclude U.S. military action, it
does say that Iraqi violations must be reported back to the Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   The thorniest question for the Bush administration is how it will
handle the deliberations if Iraq does not comply and the council
reconvenes "to consider the situation," as the resolution demands.
How long would the "discussions" take, and would Russia, China or
other countries try to delay or deter the U.S. from attacking Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Daalder argued that the Security Council would not succeed in
holding Bush back.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution's language gives Hussein "a final opportunity" to
comply with U.N. disarmament resolutions or face "serious
consequences," he pointed out. "It doesn't say 'two final
opportunities,' " Daalder said. "The president is likely to pull the
plug at the first sign of noncompliance. We'll walk."</TE>
<TE>   If "the Europeans think by 'consultations' the administration is
giving them a veto of further U.S. military action," said Lee
Feinstein of the Council on Foreign Relations, "then they
misunderstand the nature of the deal they cut."</TE>

<TE>   Shifting rationale</TE>
<TE>   From Iraq's suspected efforts to build weapons of mass destruction
to its defiance of the U.N. and alleged ties to terrorism, the Bush
administration's rationale for its campaign against Saddam Hussein
has shifted repeatedly since summer. Quotes from President Bush, Vice
President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice:</TE>
<TE>   July 8: "It's the stated policy of this government to have a
regime change... I do firmly believe that the world will be safer and
more peaceful if there's a regime change in that government." -- Bush</TE>
<TE>   July 30: "Are there Al Qaeda in Iraq? Yes." -- Rumsfeld</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 16: "There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that this man
is thumbing his nose at the world, that he has gassed his own people,
that he is troubling his neighborhood, that he desires weapons of
mass destruction." -- Bush</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 26: "Many of us are convinced that Saddam Hussein will
acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon. Just how soon, we cannot really
gauge." -- Cheney</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: "The president has been clear that he believes weapons
inspectors should return. Iraq has been in violation of these many
U.N. resolutions for most of the last 11 or so years. And so, as a
first step, let's see what the inspectors find." -- Powell</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 9: "We are especially concerned about Iraq because of the
developments we see with respect to his weapons of mass destruction,
because he has in the past, for example, had a relationship with
terrorist organizations, has provided sanctuary in Iraq for terrorist
organizations of various kinds, and because of this continued failure
over the years of the international community to be able to cope with
this problem." -- Cheney</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11: "The $25,000 that he's paying to suicide bombers, that
he paid to Hamas suicide bombers, one of whom decided to set off a
bomb at Hebrew University and to kill several Americans in the
process, how much of a link do you want? When you look at Saddam
Hussein and the fact that he tried to assassinate the former American
president, George H. Bush, Saddam Hussein has a long history here."
-- Rice</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 17: "Remember, the issue is not inspectors, the issue is in
the first instance disarmament, and then there are many other issues
at stake here, having to do with the treatment of minorities in the
country, having to do with terrorism, having to do with a number of
other issues ..." -- Powell</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 25: "We clearly know that there were in the past and have
been contacts between senior Iraqi officials and members of Al Qaeda
going back for actually quite a long time." -- Rice</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 27: "The Congress of the United States passed legislation
and President Clinton's policy and the Congress' policy, the
country's policy, was regime change back as far away as 1998 ..." --
Rumsfeld</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Arrests the Owner of Minivan Used in Bali Bombing</HD>
<DH>The suspect confessed to role in the deadly attack, police
say. Evidence of Al Qaeda link grows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock and Sari Sudarsono</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The owner of a minivan used in the deadly car bombing of Bali
nightclubs last month has confessed that he took part in the attack,
police said Thursday, as evidence mounted that the blast was linked
to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   In a major breakthrough in the investigation of the bombings,
which killed at least 191 people, Indonesian police arrested the
suspect Tuesday after tracing the ownership of the destroyed van
through its chassis number. He has been identified only as Amrozi.</LD>
<LD>   "Amrozi was one of the main perpetrators of the Bali bombing,"
national Police Chief Dai Bachtiar said Thursday. "He has disclosed
many things and admitted his acts in Bali .... We are pursuing his
companions."</LD>
<TE>   Bachtiar said Amrozi was part of a group of people who planned and
carried out the attack. Amrozi admitted that he was on the island of
Bali at the time of the bombing, police said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the prime suspects in the attack has been Jemaah Islamiah,
a regional terrorist group linked to the Al Qaeda network and
allegedly headed by radical Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has been taken into custody but is refusing to answer
authorities' questions about a string of bombings in Indonesia. He
denies any part in the Bali bombings or other terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   CNN reported Thursday that Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for
the Bali attack through an Arabic Web site. The group said it had
targeted "nightclubs and whorehouses" in Indonesia and boasted of its
aim to hit inside Arab and Islamic countries that are part of what it
called a "Jewish-Crusader alliance." The Bali attack hit the country
with the most Muslim residents, but many of the dead were young
Australian tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda has previously used the Web site to claim responsibility
for other attacks, including a synagogue bombing in Tunisia and two
attacks on ships in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi, 35, was arrested in East Java province and taken to Bali
for questioning. He had been living in the town of Tenggulun, where
he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian television reported that Bashir spoke at least twice at
the Pesantran Al Islam, an Islamic school in Tenggulun. A school
official said Amrozi attended Bashir's lectures, but it was unclear
whether the two knew each other.</TE>
<TE>   From the police hospital where he is confined, Bashir told SCTV
television that he did not know Amrozi, but he acknowledged that he
had spoken twice at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi reportedly spent considerable time in Malaysia during the
1990s, but there was no indication whether he knew Bashir there. The
cleric, facing arrest in Indonesia for his anti-government
activities, lived in self-imposed exile in Malaysia for more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Bachtiar said police were investigating Amrozi's international
travels and his possible links to Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still collecting all this information," Bachtiar said.
"The information that has been given is that he had been to Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand. And we still have to prove his confession."</TE>
<TE>   Police are also investigating a chemical supply shop in the East
Java city of Surabaya after discovering receipts in Amrozi's garage
for the purchase of materials there.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by reporters whether Amrozi parked the explosives-laden van
outside the Sari Club, the police chief said, "The group has several
people with a division of labor, certainly including Amrozi, who
admitted going there and dividing up tasks."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "We have gathered lots of information from him, but we
still have to cross-check it with other evidence."</TE>

Revolution, now called the Day of Accord and Reconciliation.</LD>

<HD>China Kicks Off Its Party Congress</HD>
<DH>At conclave, President Jiang calls on fellow Communists to
keep up with the times and welcome entrepreneurs into their ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- President Jiang Zemin, making what many expect to be his
final speech as party chief, called on the Chinese Communist Party
today to keep in step with the times and to welcome its once-hated
class enemies, entrepreneurs, into the fold.</LD>
<LD>   In a country where the private sector now accounts for more than a
third of the economy, Jiang acknowledged the need to "bring new
forces to the great cause" of rejuvenating China, including the
self-employed and private-business owners.</LD>
<LD>   "We should unite with the people of all social strata who help to
make the motherland prosperous and strong," he said this morning at
the opening session of a weeklong national party congress.</LD>
<TE>   At the close of the conclave, Jiang, 76, is expected to hand over
the reins as party leader to Vice President Hu Jintao, 59. Other
senior officials also are expected to retire in what would be the
smoothest transfer of power in the People's Republic, one not
precipitated or marred by death, illness or political upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the 2,114 delegates who assembled in Beijing's
cavernous Great Hall of the People, Jiang used the opportunity to
praise China's progress under his 13-year tenure and to promote his
effort to broaden party membership.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, he asked the delegates to help change the Communist
Party's stripes by approving his theory of the "Three Represents," a
fuzzy formula that allows the party to co-opt members of China's
growing social and economic elite, such as entrepreneurs, who were
once reviled as "exploiters."</TE>
<TE>   The congress is expected to write the "Three Represents" into the
party charter next week, enshrining Jiang's ideas alongside Marxism,
Maoism and "Deng Xiaoping Theory" as a guiding principle for China's
development in the new century.</TE>
<TE>   In classic Communist Chinese style, Jiang sought to portray his
innovations as somehow an extension of Marxism, not what seems so
obviously a repudiation of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The world is changing," he said. "We must adapt ourselves ...
[and] conscientiously free our minds from the shackles of outdated
notions, practices and systems, from the erroneous and dogmatic
interpretations of Marxism."</TE>
<TE>   As he delivered his 90-minute speech, Jiang was surrounded by the
trappings of communism: billowing red flags, a huge hammer and
sickle, greetings of "comrade."</TE>
<TE>   But the economic vision and policies he outlined, including a call
for greater protection of private property, could hardly sound more
different from what the party's founders envisioned when they
convened their first congress in Shanghai in 1921.</TE>
<TE>   The world's most populous nation is now a country full of private
companies, crooked officials, stock markets, skyscrapers and
unemployed workers and farmers. The dream of an egalitarian utopia
led by the peasantry and the proletariat has been replaced by the
reality of unequal wealth, concentrated in the cities and slow to
reach the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang acknowledged that uneven development and the growing
disparity between the haves and the have-nots are pressing problems
the party must address.</TE>
<TE>   He also spoke of the need for clean government in a system riddled
with corruption, which has threatened the party's legitimacy as the
sole ruler of China.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no suggestion that the party would tolerate any
challenges to its monopoly on power.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of China's sweeping economic reforms, its Leninist
political structure remains stuck in time, with little hint of
anything beyond limited internal party reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We should never copy any models of the political systems of the
West," Jiang declared.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, before the congress opened, in a city awash in red banners
and tight security, Chinese police detained political dissidents to
ensure that nothing blemished the shiny image of unity the Beijing
regime wants to project.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever unity there is owes in large part to Jiang's astute
political maneuvering since he was plucked out of relative obscurity
by Deng to lead China in 1989, after the tumult of the Tiananmen
Square massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang defied predictions that he would be a temporary figure by
engineering the downfall of rivals and promoting his cronies.</TE>
<TE>   When the party's ruling body, the Politburo, is unveiled next
week, its newly constituted ranks are expected to include many of
Jiang's proteges, through whom he can wield influence even after his
formal retirement.</TE>
<TE>   His speech, which was broadcast live on national television, was
also a political victory. It had to be vetted by the Politburo's
all-powerful seven-member Standing Committee, which includes rivals
such as hard-liner Li Peng, but Jiang was able to get it through with
all the praise it lavished on his tenure and his personal theory of
the "Three Represents."</TE>
<TE>   The congress is the party's 16th national gathering since it was
founded 81 years ago. Then, there were only about 60 Communists in
all of China, and the 13 delegates to the first congress assembled
illegally, meeting at a girls school and then on a lakeside boat to
avoid discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Other congresses have also proved historic in Communist Chinese
history. In 1945, at the seventh conclave, Mao Tse-tung emerged the
undisputed leader of the party -- the beginning of 31 disastrous
years of rule, including such misguided campaigns as the Great Leap
Forward and the Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, at the 12th party congress, Deng, by then China's
"paramount leader," proposed developing "socialism with Chinese
characteristics," his code phrase for capitalism. His market-oriented
reforms were later written into the party charter as "Deng Xiaoping
Theory" at the most recent party congress, the 15th, in 1997.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Puts Off U.N. Ban on Cloning</HD>
<DH>Nation and 35 others find proposal favored by France and
Germany too narrow.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- As the General Assembly prepared for its annual
debate on international conventions Thursday, the United States
successfully delayed and diluted international agreements on human
cloning and torture that it said infringe on its domestic interests.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. persuaded the U.N.'s legal committee to put off a vote on
a global ban on human cloning for a year, saying that the proposed
ban didn't extend to research cloning and that it was better to have
a stronger agreement later than an imperfect one today.</LD>
<LD>   On a separate measure to allow international monitoring of prisons
to prevent torture, the U.S. failed to stop a vote on what it
considers a flawed protocol, but Washington is expected to water down
its impact by blocking funding.</LD>
<TE>   On the cloning issue, critics say that the U.S. approach would set
back important research and that the delay on the ban will allow
rogue scientists to proceed with plans to create cloned babies.
France and Germany had urged the committee to act to halt
reproductive cloning immediately and take up more controversial
questions on cloning for medical research later.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and 35 other countries backing its broader proposal
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Can it be effective to have a partial ban?" said a U.S. official
involved in the debate. "It's impossible to differentiate an embryo
created naturally or by cloning." And even if it were possible, she
asked, would enforcement mean forced abortions?</TE>
<TE>   The official also said that a partial ban that permits embryonic
clones to be created for research but forbids them to become babies
legally requires the destruction of the embryos. Carolyn Willson, the
legal advisor to the United States Mission to the United Nations,
called that "a morally abhorrent prospect" in her statement to the
legal committee earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Politically, it looks like a game of chicken," said Robert
George, a bioethicist from Princeton who has been advising the U.S.
mission on scientific and ethical issues. "One side says we have to
stop this now. We don't have consensus on cloning for medical
research, but we do for reproductive cloning, so let's get that thing
into place. The other side is saying, we would rather tolerate the
creation of some human clones than go into the business of permitting
an industry of embryo destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The push for a worldwide cloning ban began in August 2001, when an
Italian embryologist, Severino Antinori, claimed that he had lined up
700 couples willing to take part in an experiment to create a cloned
baby. An American colleague of Antinori's, Panos Zavos, told a
congressional hearing this year that work was ready to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Though the year's delay is a reprieve for scientists who work with
stem cells from embryos, they worry that a universal ban would set
back scientific breakthroughs in stem cell research on cures for
Parkinson's disease, leukemia and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Freda Miller, a Canadian scientist who discovered that adult stem
cells harvested from skin can be prodded to do many of the same
things that embryonic stem cells can, insists that her work should
not be used as an argument to ban work with embryos.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of what we know came from research on embryonic stem
cells," she told The Times last year. "The adult stem cells are
promising, but we won't know if they can replace embryonic stem cells
for many years."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is one of about 130 countries that has ratified a 1989
U.N. treaty on torture, but it says that the provisions for
monitoring prisons would infringe on states' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International released a statement saying that the U.S. is
demanding that funding for prison monitors come from national
governments, not from the U.N. budget, nearly a quarter of which
comes from the United States.</TE>

<HD>Drug Lord Is Released From Prison</HD>
<DH>Despite government's protest, Colombian judge frees a
brother who led the Cali cartel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUNJA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>A former drug kingpin was freed late Thursday night after serving
only half his sentence, despite a U.S. effort to find evidence to
support further charges -- and possibly his extradition to the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who with his brother Miguel once
controlled the Cali drug cartel, an empire that moved multi-ton
shipments of cocaine across the globe, walked out of prison shortly
after 10 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez Orejuela, who was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to
prison until 2010, was ordered released by Judge Pedro Suarez last
week for good behavior and participation in a prison work-study
program. As the government investigated Suarez to see if the
convicted drug trafficker might have bribed him -- Suarez has denied
it -- another judge upheld the decision Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Tensions mounted throughout the day. Dozens of police and soldiers
surrounded the prison where Rodriguez Orejuela was held, outside
Tunja about 60 miles northeast of Bogota, to prevent any violence.</TE>
<TE>   With the clock ticking, U.S. officials tried in vain to stop his
release, providing documents that sought to block it.</TE>
<TE>   Details on what information was being provided were not
immediately available, but U.S. drug agents have been trying to link
the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers to international crimes committed
after 1997, when Colombia's constitution was revised to allow the
extradition of its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez's decision last week that the brothers should be freed
shocked the nation and prompted the president to intervene. But Judge
Luz Amanda Moncada ruled Thursday that Suarez's order on Gilberto
Rodriguez Orejuela should stand. She also ordered a probe of the
government for allegedly interfering in the judicial process.</TE>
<TE>   Interior and Justice Minister Fernando Londono called the ruling a
"terrible blow."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials in Bogota criticized the rulings.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>The United States is holding a member of Bahrain's royal family as an
Al Qaeda suspect at its naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a
London-based Arabic newspaper reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   There were six Bahrainis among the hundreds of suspects captured
during last year's U.S.-led military offensive in Afghanistan to
flush out members of the Al Qaeda network, which Washington blames
for the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Asharq al Awsat daily quoted Sheik Ibrahim ibn Mohammed al
Khalifa as saying his son, Sheik Salman, was arrested in Pakistan and
handed over to U.S. authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Sheik Ibrahim, a distant relative of King Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa,
did not say when the arrest took place, but told the newspaper that
an unspecified party had received $20,000 for handing over his son.
He said Sheik Salman, 23, traveled in 2000 to Saudi Arabia for
Islamic studies.</TE>
<TE>   "He contacted us three months later to inform us that he had
traveled to Pakistan to do relief work, but we have lost contact with
him for more than a year," the newspaper quoted Sheik Ibrahim as
saying.</TE>

<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>A hard-line court has sentenced to death a prominent scholar and
close ally of President Mohammad Khatami for insulting Islam's
prophet, his lawyer said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Hashem Aghajari was found guilty of insulting Muhammad and
questioning the hard-line clergy's interpretation of Islam in a
speech he made in June in the western city of Hamadan, said his
lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht.</LD>
<LD>   Nikbakht said his client, a leading member of the reformist
political party Moujahedeen of the Islamic Revolution, also was
sentenced to 74 lashes, banned from teaching for 10 years and exiled
to three remote Iranian cities for eight years. Iran frequently
issues such multiple sentences in cases where it wants to make an
example of the accused.</LD>
<TE>   Aghajari, 45, a history professor, was detained in August after a
closed hearing. He remained in custody. Aghajari's lawyer said he
would appeal the verdict.</TE>

<HD>Powell Confident on Backing</HD>
<DH>Secretary says he believes U.S. will have U.N. support in
pressing Baghdad to disarm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Thursday that a showdown with
Saddam Hussein on hidden chemical and biological weapons and a
nuclear program could be months away as inspections determine whether
Iraq is disarming.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Powell expressed confidence that the United
Nations would support U.S. pressure on Iraq. He said the pace of
searching for weapons would be set by the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Hans Blix, and Mohammed Baradei of the International
Atomic Energy Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Declining to predict whether the Iraqi president would cooperate,
Powell said, "I gave up years ago speculating what Hussein may or may
not do."</LD>
<TE>   A joint U.S.-British resolution is before the U.N. Security
Council, which has tried unsuccessfully for more than 10 years to
compel Hussein to open his hiding places, reveal his suspected
illegal arsenal and destroy the weapons, as required after the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't intend to cooperate, I think that will become
obvious rather soon, and the U.N. will have to make its judgment as
to whether they want to participate in a charade with the Iraqi
government or whether they want immediately to convene to see if
something else should be done," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell suggested that inspections could take time, saying he could
not speak for the inspectors on "how many months they think it might
take" to carry out their mission.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding questions outside his office, Powell spoke confidently.</TE>
<TE>   He said the administration was not handling weapons threats in
Iraq and North Korea exactly the same way because it did not have a
"cookie cutter" foreign policy. But he reasserted that North Korea,
like Iraq, must disarm.</TE>

<HD>Speedy Military Ships Move Into Place</HD>
<DH>Three cargo vessels, with weapons and supplies needed for
any move against Iraq, are en route to the region, defense officials
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Three of the Pentagon's fastest cargo ships have left
U.S. shores for Southwest Asian ports, carrying weapons and supplies
that would be critical for any move against Iraq, defense officials
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the ships, the Bob Hope and the Fisher, are carrying
state-of-the-art portable bridges capable of moving large numbers of
troops and heavy equipment across the Euphrates River quickly. The
other, the Bellatrix, a smaller ship that travels even faster, left
San Diego with a vast array of electronics, survival equipment,
vehicles and supplies in its holds to support a Marine Corps
expeditionary headquarters unit deploying this week from Camp
Pendleton to the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   The Bob Hope passed through the Suez Canal today. The Fisher is
expected to do so in a few days.</LD>
<TE>   The deployment of the ships, all part of the Pentagon's "surge
fleet" designed to deliver military equipment rapidly in a crisis,
significantly boosts the amount of military hardware the Pentagon has
positioned within striking distance of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials also said this week that they had chartered two
commercial vessels to move ammunition and a tank from Germany to the
Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "We're repositioning equipment to support forces that are engaged
in the war on terrorism," said Marge Holtz, a spokeswoman for the
Navy's Military Sealift Command, which moved the bulk of the
equipment used during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The Bob Hope departed Charleston, S.C., on Oct. 24 and the Fisher
left there four days later. Both were loaded with oil tanker trucks
and the "ribbon bridges" that Army engineering battalions would need
to cross the wide Euphrates, which flows the breadth of Iraq and
passes near Baghdad, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say it would be impossible to gain control of
Iraq using airstrikes alone. Ground forces, however, would need to
cross the Euphrates. The rapidly deployed bridges could play a
crucial role, minimizing U.S. casualties by speeding large numbers of
soldiers and heavy equipment across the river.</TE>
<TE>   The bridging equipment and tankers are for use by the Army's 34th
Mechanized Infantry Division, according to a defense official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   He would not confirm whether elements of the division had been
ordered to deploy to the Middle East from their base at Hunter Army
Airfield in Savannah, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   The Bob Hope and the Fisher are part of a fleet of 19 ships
acquired and refitted by the military during the past decade at a
cost of $6 billion to improve the way the Pentagon equips U.S. troops
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The ships are outfitted with huge ramps designed to allow massive
artillery pieces, Humvees and trucks to roll on and off. The design
allows them to be unloaded much more rapidly than the cargo ships
that were used to equip troops during the Gulf War. Those ships
required giant cranes to painstakingly lift tanks and other heavy
gear out of their holds. With the new ships, the ramps come down, and
workers drive the vehicles ashore.</TE>
<TE>   More than 900 feet long and 100 feet wide, each of the ships has a
hold capacity of 380,000 square feet--equivalent to eight soccer
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bob Hope and Fisher are capable of carrying tanks,
helicopters and other heavy artillery, neither is doing so this time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the Pentagon relied on slow, hulking commercial cargo
ships conscripted into service to move massive amounts of ammunition,
artillery pieces, fuel trucks and an array of supplies to Gulf ports.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those ships were barely seaworthy. Others had to be taken
out of river berths where they had sat for years. None had the
ferry-like ramps and holds of the new fleet.</TE>
<TE>   "We got it there by hook and by crook, and the reality is we
weren't able to get stuff in here as quickly as we wanted to kick off
the ground war," said former Marine Col. Jay Farrar, who worked for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the military was working to procure
the new fleet.</TE>
<TE>   The need for the ships "became very apparent from that
experience," Farrar said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are something that's tailor-made to haul your equipment and
get it there in good shape and that is dedicated to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Seven more of the new ships and six more fast sealift ships are
berthed at U.S. ports. The ships are prepped to be ready to leave for
anywhere in the world within four days of receiving orders.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea's Bellicose Rhetoric Against U.S. Is Seen as
Mostly Brinkmanship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- Whatever else one says about the North Koreans, they've
never been accused of churning out bland diplomatic blather or
beating around the bush. The propaganda machine in Pyongyang is so
famous for its sharp tongue that a headline writer once labeled it
the "great vituperator."</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, the North Koreans have warned that they might
revoke their moratorium on missile testing. They've insisted that
they have the right to develop any kind of weapon they choose to
defend themselves against "U.S. imperialist war hawks," whose
behavior they colorfully describe as "brigandish" and
"gangster-like."</LD>
<LD>   Despite their blunt language, the North Koreans don't always mean
what they say. Longtime North Korea watchers say the regime often
ratchets up the rhetoric not when it wants to pick a fight, but when
it wants to talk.</LD>
<TE>   That may be precisely what is happening now.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea wants very badly to establish relations with the
United States," said Rhee Bong Jo, an assistant South Korean
unification minister who visited Pyongyang last month shortly after
the North Koreans confessed that they have a secret program to enrich
uranium for nuclear bombs. "Their admission was for the sake of
negotiation. This was brinkmanship."</TE>
<TE>   Donald Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea who traveled
to the North's capital this week, said officials there complained
repeatedly that they had managed to improve relations with Russia,
China, Japan and South Korea, but not the United States.</TE>
<TE>   " 'What's the matter with you Americans? Why don't you join the
procession of countries making better relations with North Korea?' "
Gregg quoted a top North Korean general, Rhee Chang Bok, as telling
him.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted early last month by Assistant Secretary of State James
A. Kelly, the only official U.S. envoy to visit Pyongyang since
President Bush took office, the North Koreans admitted to the uranium
enrichment program. They also said that the U.S. had in effect
nullified a 1994 agreement under which North Korea gave up its
nuclear weapons development in exchange for help with its energy
needs.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, various North Korean diplomats have made
alternatively belligerent and conciliatory statements on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   A North Korean envoy to the United Nations, Han Song Ryol, said in
a statement to the New York Times that Pyongyang wanted to negotiate
a deal to close down its nuclear enrichment project.</TE>
<TE>   But other North Koreans have defiantly defended the program. "We
[are] entitled to possess not only nuclear weapons but any type of
weapon more powerful than that in order to protect our sovereignty
and right to subsistence from an ever-growing U.S. nuclear threat,"
North Korea's ambassador to China, Choe Jin Su, said at a news
conference last week. Meanwhile, the envoy in Hong Kong, Rhee To Sop,
told the South China Morning Post that "if we scrap, for instance,
the nuclear program or reduce our armed forces, we would have nothing
to defend ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   And the North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun editorialized, "We
can't live without weapons. We won't trade our weapons for mountains
of gold."</TE>
<TE>   Most troubling, the official North Korean news agency issued a
statement Tuesday from an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman
threatening to end the moratorium on missile testing. In 1998, North
Korea test-fired a long-range Taepodong rocket over Japan. The threat
to renew testing was seen as an explicit warning to Tokyo, with which
North Korea has begun to discuss normalization, but it was shrugged
off by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute in Berkeley, which
studies the North Korean nuclear program, says that world leaders and
diplomats have learned not to become overly rattled by Pyongyang's
insults and threats, because they are precursors to dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "You can predict when they are edging toward dialogue by the
fierce strategy that comes before," Hayes said. He noted that North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il is an avid student of filmmaking who has
also written on the subject. "This is all very carefully
choreographed with a nod to guerrilla tactics."</TE>
<TE>   Song Yong Sun, a professor at the Korean Institute for Defense
Analysis in Seoul, believes that the North Koreans chose their moment
carefully, figuring that in the midst of its effort to build a
coalition against Iraq, the United States would be more lenient with
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "This is classic bluff and bluster that is very typical of the way
the North Koreans conducted their negotiations in the past. They need
a crisis in order to negotiate," said Scott Snyder, the Asia
Foundation representative in Seoul. "It is in their interest to play
up the threat precisely because they are weak."</TE>
<TE>   Snyder sees the current situation as similar to 1993, when the
North Koreans raised the specter of a nuclear crisis by threatening
to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. He believes that
their tactics ultimately worked with the Clinton administration and
that the resulting 1994 framework gave the North Koreans much more
than they would have gotten with a more conventional negotiating
style.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, an international consortium led by the United
States, South Korea and Japan is to build two light-water reactors to
supply North Korea's energy needs in return for its relinquishing of
all nuclear weapons development.</TE>
<TE>   According to the North Korean view, the U.S. is to blame for the
apparent failure of the agreement because of reactor construction
delays that have pushed back the completion date from 2003 to 2008.</TE>
<TE>   But those who have spoken recently with the North Koreans say that
their main complaint is that the Bush administration has not lived up
to additional clauses in the 1994 pact aimed at improving relations
and dialogue between the nations. The Bush administration now takes
the position that North Korea must dismantle its nuclear program
before any talks can be held.</TE>
<TE>   Among other specific measures, the '94 pact called for the U.S.
and North Korea to open liaison offices in each other's capital as a
precursor to exchanging ambassadors, the lifting of barriers to trade
and investment, and mutual assurance against the use or threat of
nuclear weapons. The North Koreans have suggested on several
occasions that Bush's inclusion of their country in an "axis of evil"
was an implicit threat.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Oberdorfer, a North Korea specialist, says he is concerned
that the rhetoric from both the U.S. and North Korea could bring the
two as close to war as in 1994, when U.S. battle plans were ordered
up for an attack on North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned that the United States and North Korea not play off
of each other, building up tension," Oberdorfer said, "because that
would be dangerous, as dangerous as in 1994."</TE>

<LD>Following are key points in the text of the U.N. Security Council
resolution on Iraq. The U.S. accepted a one-word change from "or" to
"and," watering down the already limited authority granted by the
resolution but paving the way for its expected approval by the
15-member council today.</LD>
<LD>   The new word is in boldface.</LD>
<LD>   The Security Council ...</LD>
<TE>   4. Decides that false statements or omissions in the declarations
submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at
any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation
of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of
Iraq's obligations and will be reported to the council for assessment
in accordance with paragraph 11 and [formerly "or"] 12 below;</TE>
<TE>   11. Directs the executive chairman of UNMOVIC [United Nations
Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission] and the
director-general of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to
report immediately to the council any interference by Iraq with
inspection activities, as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with
its disarmament obligations, including its obligations regarding
inspections under this resolution;</TE>
<TE>   12. Decides to convene immediately upon receipt of a report in
accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 above, in order to consider the
situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant
council resolutions in order to secure international peace and
security.</TE>

<HD>Victims of CIA Strike May Include American</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen</DL>
<LD>An American was believed to be among the six militants killed in a
CIA missile strike last weekend, a security source said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The men, including Qaed Sinan Harithi, Al Qaeda's top man in
Yemen, were killed Sunday when a Hellfire missile fired from a
pilotless CIA spy plane destroyed the car they were in.</LD>
<LD>   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the other
five were known by their aliases -- Saleh abu Hamam; Qiagaa; Abu
Jirah; Mounir; and Jalal, also known as Ahmed Hijazi. Jalal is
believed to have been a U.S. citizen, according to the source, who
provided no other details and did not say how authorities established
that Jalal was American.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities were trying to establish the men's identities, the
source said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Harithi, who was in his mid-40s, first met Al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden in the 1980s during the war against Soviet occupation
in Afghanistan. The two men stayed in contact after the war and met
again in Sudan, where Bin Laden had gone in the 1990s, the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Harithi was believed to have coordinated the October 2000 attack
near the Yemeni port of Aden on the U.S. destroyer Cole, in which 17
U.S. sailors died.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni newspaper, September 26, reported that Harithi plotted
last month's attack on the French tanker Limburg off Yemen, in which
a Bulgarian crew member died. The newspaper did not cite sources.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper, whose editor in chief is President Ali Abdullah
Saleh's press secretary, also reported that Harithi was responsible
for several terrorist attacks in Yemen and was planning more attacks
on Western targets in the country.</TE>

<HD>Drug Industry Poised to Reap Political Dividends</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceutical firms and other major donors to winning GOP
candidates are ready to push their legislative agendas in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Few industries campaigned harder than pharmaceutical manufacturers to
elect Republicans to the new Congress, and few industries are better
positioned to reap the rewards of the election returns, analysts said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "The pharmaceutical industry may be at the front of the line of
groups looking at the next two years as an opportunity to make a lot
of progress on their issues," said Larry Makinson, senior fellow at
the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   It is a long line, with some related industries -- insurance
companies, HMOs and physicians -- crowded near the front, along with
energy companies, financial services and much of the rest of
corporate America's elite.</LD>
<TE>   Their wish lists have many items in common, notably less
regulation and more tax incentives.</TE>
<TE>   For drug manufacturers, that translates to no price controls, no
patent reform and laws that keep drugs that are sold at cut rates
abroad from being resold in the U.S. at the lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   For insurance companies, it means tax credits to help the
uninsured buy health coverage -- but no requirement that mental
illnesses be covered like other diseases. HMOs want to put an end to
efforts to make it easier for patients to sue their health plans, and
physicians are seeking malpractice reform and higher Medicare
payments.</TE>
<TE>   In every case, the new Republican-controlled Congress will make an
industry's preferred outcome more likely.</TE>
<TE>   And while drug manufacturers and other health-care industries were
quick to describe Tuesday's election results as proof that voters
agree with them on key issues, "the real story here is money," said
John Rother, director of policy and strategy at AARP, the
35-million-member seniors' lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard School of Public
Health, agreed that the pharmaceutical industry's election day
successes said more about the effectiveness of its political spending
than voters' views.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really the money they spent in the hinterlands helping
candidates and the money they spent on advertising to soften the blow
of the issues so the number of voters who would vote on these issues
would go down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As of June 30, drug and nutritional supplement manufacturers
ranked ninth among more than 80 industry groups in direct
contributions to congressional candidates and political parties,
according to Federal Election Commission records compiled by the
Center for Responsive Politics. At that time, 73% of its $18.1
million in contributions had gone to Republican candidates and party
committees.</TE>
<TE>   But those numbers reflect only a portion of what the
$400-billion-a-year industry spent to influence Tuesday's elections.
When FEC records from the last four months become available, the
industry's contribution total will surely go up.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, drug manufacturers consistently rank among the top
two industry groups in money spent to lobby Congress. With more than
400 registered lobbyists -- nearly one for each of the 535 members of
Congress -- the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $97 million in
2000, according to records filed with the Secretary of the Senate and
compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   The industry and its sponsored advocacy groups also spend tens of
millions of dollars on print and television ads. In the months before
Tuesday's elections, they used photographs of sick children and frail
seniors to suggest that generic drugs would make them worse.</TE>
<TE>   While the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or
PhRMA, would not reveal the size of its advertising budget, an
industry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said published
reports citing ad expenditures of $30 million a year were "not
inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   The United Seniors Assn., an advocacy group financed almost
entirely by PhRMA, Pfizer Inc. and other drug companies, reportedly
spent more than $12 million in the campaign's closing weeks to air
radio and television ads that encouraged voters to support Republican
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   All that spending appears to have paid off, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's top political priority, for example, a Medicare
prescription drug benefit run by private insurance companies rather
than the government, is virtually "settled by the outcome of the
elections," said Blendon. "That's what they spent their money to
get."</TE>
<TE>   Drug manufacturers "won't win everything they want" from the
Republican Congress, he added, "but the something that gets done will
be relatively nonthreatening. They are direct beneficiaries of the
outcome of the election."</TE>
<TE>   This year, most health-care legislation languished in stalemates
between the Republican-majority House and the Democratic-controlled
Senate. The House, for example, passed a Medicare prescription drug
benefit that would be administered by private insurance companies;
the Senate debated three versions of a drug benefit but did not pass
any of them.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, while the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill making it
easier for generic drugs to get to market, the House did not consider
it. Similar divisions stalled action on tax credits for the
uninsured, expanded legal rights for HMO patients and a measure that
would have prevented health insurance plans that cover treatment for
mental illness from limiting that coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry works with Republicans and Democrats," the industry
official said. "But over the last three or four years, some Democrats
said they were going to make prescription drugs the campaign issue."</TE>
<TE>   The industry's political efforts were needed to help the public
see through "that demagoguery and rhetoric" and realize that the
continued production of life-saving medicines -- not drug prices or
the demonization of drug companies -- was the key issue, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   A survey conducted for PhRMA last week asked whether "politicians
who are criticizing prescription drug companies are motivated
primarily by a desire to gain political advantage or by a desire to
lower drug prices."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,000 voters in the survey, 51% said drug-company criticism
was mostly about politics, leading PhRMA President Alan F. Holmer to
conclude that "voters do not want to jeopardize the miracle of
life-saving innovation in modern medicines."</TE>
<TE>   Voters were not asked whether they thought drug prices were too
high.</TE>

<HD>Dispute Leaves Alabama Governor's Race Hanging</HD>
<DH>Twin counts from one county put outcome on hold. Both
candidates have refused to concede.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>You don't need chads to keep an election hanging. Ask the two men
claiming to be Alabama's next governor.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after balloting resulted in a paper-thin margin, a
disputed vote count from a single county in southern Alabama has
spurred competing claims of victory by incumbent Gov. Donald
Siegelman, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Bob
Riley.</LD>
<LD>   The final tally gave Riley the slimmest of triumphs -- 3,195 votes
across a state in which 1.3 million ballots were cast. But Siegelman
was sticking with an early count that gave him a similarly narrow
advantage.</LD>
<TE>   By Thursday morning, each candidate was behaving as if he had won.
Siegelman kept up his gubernatorial duties, traveling to Henry
County, on the Georgia line, to tour the site of a tornado that
killed at least one person. Riley, meanwhile, set about organizing a
team to steer his transition to power. At his campaign office,
staffers asserted victory in the way they answered the phone: "Gov.
Riley's office."</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman proposed a statewide recount, saying the tight results
demanded it, no matter which candidate was ahead. He said the tiny
margin -- two-tenths of a percentage point -- was small enough to
have triggered automatic recounts in 12 states. Siegelman said
ballots across the state should be recounted by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about Bob Riley or Don Siegelman. It's about the
people of Alabama, it's about the people's right to know that their
vote has been fairly counted. It's about their right to be heard,"
Siegelman said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Riley's campaign staff did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy centered on Baldwin County, a Republican redoubt
on Alabama's coastal nub, where a tally on election night showed
Siegelman with 19,070 votes -- enough to put him over the top
statewide. That result was reported and an ecstatic Siegelman
declared victory shortly after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   But a subsequent tally, described by Baldwin County election
officials as the final accounting of its precincts, showed Siegelman
with 12,736 votes, a shift that suddenly gave the edge to Riley,
whose 31,052 votes countywide were unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   County election officials said the first count, showing a higher
tally for Siegelman, was wrong. The later tally giving him 6,334
fewer votes, is "accurate and supportable and defendable," Baldwin
County Probate Judge Adrian Johns, the election overseer, told
reporters. Under the count favorable to Siegelman, there would have
been more votes for governor in Baldwin County than total ballots
cast.</TE>
<TE>   The recount call added a new twist to the swirling drama --
intrigue that grew after Siegelman called reporters to his office
Wednesday for an announcement, then abruptly canceled without
explanation. There was speculation about legal challenges -- and
comparisons to a more infamous election fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides are claiming victory. We don't know who our next
governor's going to be. It's similar to what happened two years ago
in the president's race," said Greg Heyman, spokesman for the
secretary of state's office in Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   Counties must report official results by noon today. Then, any
registered voter can ask a county to recount, provided they post a
bond to pay for it, a cost of $750 to $5,000, depending on how large
the recount. (The bond is returned if the first count was wrong.)
Results are official statewide Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Results could be contested before the state Legislature.</TE>

<HD>Bishops Name FBI Official to Post</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Roman Catholic bishops Thursday named the FBI's No. 3
official to monitor the church's new policy on clerical sex abuse and
help prevent future scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Kathleen McChesney, 51, will be the first executive director of
the church's Office for Child and Youth Protection. It is a critical
post as the bishops seek to reestablish their credibility after a
year in which at least 300 of the 46,000 U.S. priests have been
removed because of allegations of molestation.</LD>
<LD>   "Even one case of child abuse is intolerable. Our churches need to
be safe havens for everyone," McChesney told a news conference at the
bishops' headquarters, where she begins work Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview, McChesney had little hesitation when she was
asked to consider the post over the summer, despite the prospect of
leaving a law enforcement career of 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 candidates were considered for the job, said Msgr.
William P. Fay, general secretary of the bishops' conference, who
made the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong lay Catholic, McChesney has followed the church's abuse
scandal with growing dismay since the 1997 cases that almost
bankrupted the Dallas diocese.</TE>
<TE>   But she expressed confidence that the U.S. bishops are determined
to turn things around. She said the National Review Board -- which
will monitor her office and work with her to monitor the bishops'
performance -- and her own office are each unique.</TE>
<TE>   Those steps, she said, "express that the bishops want to fix this
problem. It's not going to be me that fixes it. It's going to be a
lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   "The goal? No more cases."</TE>
<TE>   Fay told reporters the review board, the office and other costs of
the abuse policy would exceed $1 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   At the FBI, McChesney has been executive assistant director, in
which she served as a liaison to the nation's 18,000 law enforcement
agencies and bureau operations in 44 countries. The post was created
by FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.</TE>

shocked that the sculptures will be taken down at the couple's

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Just when Florida finally seemed to have carried out a flub-free
election, supervisors in one county discovered they had failed to
count about 104,000 ballots in some tallies.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the blunder in Broward County did not change the
outcome of any races in Tuesday's election, which had been hailed as
a procedural triumph for the state where voting problems two years
earlier forced a five-week delay in George W. Bush's election as
president.</LD>
<LD>   The error did trim by 13,815 votes the margin of victory that
Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's younger brother, scored
over Democratic challenger Bill McBride.</LD>
<TE>   The error was discovered Wednesday and corrected in time to
certify accurate tallies to the state by Thursday's deadline,
election officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They blamed a programming error in tabulating absentee votes and
votes cast before election day.</TE>

<HD>Bush Pushes for Security Bill</HD>
<DH>He calls for the immediate passage of the homeland measure,
saying it is the most important piece of legislation in Congress.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Buoyed by Republican gains in the midterm elections,
President Bush on Thursday applied new pressure on Congress to
approve a Department of Homeland Security when lawmakers return next
week for an abbreviated, lame-duck session.</LD>
<LD>   He called the creation of such an agency "the single-most
important item of unfinished business on Capitol Hill."</LD>
<LD>   Despite a mantra at the White House that there would be no
gloating over the GOP success on election day, the president exuded
confidence and high spirits as he fielded questions from reporters,
frequently offering up quips along the way in his first full-length
news conference in four months.</LD>
<TE>   Bush twice dodged questions about whether other members of his
economic team may soon depart, after the resignation of Harvey L.
Pitt, the besieged chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he tried to keep the focus on his priorities for next
year -- the speedier confirmation of his judicial nominations,
passage of an energy bill, providing seniors with prescription drug
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Although the full effect of Tuesday's elections will not be felt
until the next Congress convenes in January, Bush's call for
immediate passage of the homeland security bill in the upcoming
lame-duck session may provide a quick measure of his newly acquired
political clout.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal -- which Bush unveiled in June -- has been stalled in
the Democratic-controlled Senate over a dispute with Bush over labor
issues.</TE>
<TE>   In outlining his agenda, Bush called for bipartisan cooperation
and avoided reveling over the election results.</TE>
<TE>   Bush campaigned vigorously for the GOP and, bucking historical
trends for midterm elections, the party not only increased its House
majority but regained control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, when asked whether he interpreted the results as a mandate
for his policies, instead said that his reading was that "people want
something to get done."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I really don't put this in personal terms."</TE>
<TE>   Besides pushing for the Homeland Security department, Bush said
forcing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to get rid of his suspected
weapons of mass destruction and revitalizing the economy remain his
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing his attention on the lame-duck Congress, Bush also urged
the returning lawmakers to quickly enact a law that would provide a
federal safety net to the insurance industry for terrorist attacks.
Such insurance has been hard to obtain for major building projects
since last year's terrorist attacks, hurting the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Passing terrorism insurance, Bush said, would create "thousands of
good hard-hat jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comment made clear that despite the strong GOP showing in
Tuesday's vote, he recognizes that a sagging economy could undo his
reelection hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while the president was short on details when it came to
his goals for the new Congress, he did say that he wanted to work
with lawmakers on "new job and growth packages."</TE>
<TE>   White House aides said details on such programs would be
forthcoming with the approach of the president's annual State of the
Union address to Congress in January.</TE>
<TE>   The president pointedly noted that some of his judicial nominees
are stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee -- whose chairmanship
soon will transfer from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) to Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R-Utah).</TE>
<TE>   After Bush spoke, a Hatch spokeswoman indicated that the senator
intends to move quickly to send those nominations to the Senate floor
for confirmation votes.</TE>
<TE>   The president indicated that he hoped those nominees would include
two that the Democratic-controlled committee blocked because of their
conservative leanings -- Charles Pickering and Priscilla Owen, both
nominated for the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said: "By the way, if they had been let to the floor for a
vote, we believe they would have won."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about Bush's economic team stemmed from speculation that
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the
president's chief economic advisor, might depart after the midterm
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Both have been criticized, including by some Republicans, for not
responding aggressively enough to economic problems, sparking
speculation that either or both might soon be leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than dismiss the speculation, Bush simply said they had
faced daunting challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a recession; there was a terrorist attack; there were
corporate scandals. We have done a lot to return confidence," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt submitted his resignation Tuesday, overcome by a series of
controversies that stalked his stewardship of the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent controversy involved the commission's appointment
of William H. Webster to oversee accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The former director of the FBI and CIA had informed Pitt that he
had headed the audit committee of a company that is itself under
investigation, but Pitt did not report this to other commissioners or
to the White House before Webster was named to the job.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he planned to ask Webster to resign his
oversight post, Bush said he was awaiting the findings of a
government inquiry into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   But the president made a point of praising Webster as "a decent,
honorable public servant who has served our country well."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he would nominate a successor to Pitt "as soon as
possible" and that he was looking for someone "who is going to
continue to fulfill the obligation of holding people to account."</TE>
<TE>   The homeland security measure that Bush wants passed would shift
all or part of 22 federal agencies into one Cabinet superagency with
roughly 170,000 employees, responsible for, among many functions,
securing airports, seaports and borders</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he opposed a Democratic push for such an agency that
began shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But when it
became apparent that Congress was going to pass such a measure, Bush
reversed course and made it an administration priority.</TE>
<TE>   His flip-flop has inspired speculation that he still may not fully
back such an agency -- speculation that the president directly
addressed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Some rumor's moving around that we may not be too keen on getting
that done," he said. "I want it done. It is a priority."</TE>
<TE>   The bill has been stalled in the Senate because Democrats say that
the House-passed bill, which Bush backs, would ease civil service
protections and other rights for employees of such an agency.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether Bush's new pressure on Congress would
immediately achieve results.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Democratic and Republican senators said Thursday that
given the unpredictability of a lame-duck session, the Senate still
might put off action on a homeland security bill until the new
session convenes.</TE>
<TE>   A GOP Senate aide said that come January, new Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) would be in a better position to bring
the president's bill to the floor and pass it without a Democratic
filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   The aide said he didn't think Democrats would dare filibuster.
"That's the reason that some people lost the elections this year."</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the news conference, Bush bantered about the
wedding this weekend of his press secretary, Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you all have sent your gifts to him," he told the roomful
of reporters, and then added, "Ari, I did what you asked me to do."</TE>
<TE>   Bush granted a reporter's request to pose a follow-up question by
joking: "If the elections had gone a different way, I might not be so
generous."</TE>

<HD>Bush Would Tap Cheney in '04</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Thursday that if he runs for reelection, Vice
President Dick Cheney will be on the Republican ticket with him.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney has said he is willing to run for a second term "if the
president's willing and if my wife approves and if the doctors say
it's OK."</LD>
<LD>   The vice president, 61, has had four heart attacks, the most
recent shortly after the 2000 election. He underwent quadruple bypass
surgery in 1988 and had a pacemaker that monitors his heartbeat
implanted last year.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got plenty of time to deal with this issue," Bush said at a
news conference Thursday. But he added that if he decides to run,
"Vice President Cheney will be my running mate."</TE>
<TE>   The president's statement went to the central question about the
vice president's political future: Would the Republicans want to give
such a highly visible position to someone unlikely to run for the
presidency in 2008?</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate his advice. I appreciate his counsel. I appreciate
his friendship ... and there's no reason for me to change," the
president added.</TE>

<HD>A Halt to Execution Gaining in States</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>In May, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening became the second governor to
impose a moratorium on the death penalty, and other states are
considering such action.</LD>
<LD>   Glendening's announcement, which stayed the execution of Wesley
Eugene Baker pending the outcome of a death penalty study by the
University of Maryland, came two years after Illinois Gov. George
Ryan announced the first such halt to executions.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan, a Republican, imposed the moratorium after 13 death row
inmates had been exonerated since Illinois reinstated the death
penalty in 1977. The state has executed 12 people, fewer than it has
freed.</LD>
<TE>   Glendening, a Democrat, made his decision based not on death row
exonerations but after revelations that nine of his state's 13
condemned inmates were from one county, Baltimore, and that nine of
the 13 were black. Glendening is awaiting the results of the study,
which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-eight states have a death penalty, and the Legislatures in
many of them -- including Oregon, Indiana, North Carolina, Arizona
and Nebraska -- have struggled for years over the ultimate
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Nebraska Legislature passed a resolution calling for
a moratorium on executions by a vote of 27 to 21, but Republican Gov.
Mike Johanns vetoed the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The revolution in DNA technology in the late 1980s has been one of
the key tools opponents have used in seeking to overturn the death
penalty in the United States, as has pressure from many other Western
nations that have abolished executions.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks, observers say, and the recent sniper
slayings in the Washington, D.C., area, have aided death penalty
proponents in arguing their case.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Gephardt's Post Begins</HD>
<DH>San Francisco Democrat early favorite for House post, but
she has to get past Texas' Frost first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco emerged Thursday as
the early favorite to become the next House Democratic leader, but
she faces a tough fight from a Texas challenger who says the party
should move to the center, not to the left.</LD>
<LD>   Pelosi's contest with Rep. Martin Frost began in earnest after
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri announced he would step down as
minority leader. Gephardt is mulling a bid for the presidency, and
Democrats are pressing for new leadership after their disappointing
performance in Tuesday's midterm elections.</LD>
<LD>   Pelosi last year became the first woman to hold a top
congressional leadership job when Democrats elected her minority
whip, their No. 2 post.</LD>
<TE>   If she succeeds Gephardt, she will make history again. She would
not only become the highest-ranking female lawmaker ever in either
the House or Senate, but she would also be the first Californian to
lead a party in the House.</TE>
<TE>   She and Frost were working frantically behind the scenes to line
up support for a secret ballot next Thursday by Democrats who will
serve in the House's next session. In announcing their candidacies,
Pelosi and Frost each promised to focus on the economy to help return
their party to power. They also pledged sharper attacks on
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "We must draw clear distinctions between our vision of the future
and the extreme policies put forward by the Republicans," Pelosi said
in a statement. "We cannot allow Republicans to pretend they share
our values and then legislate against those values without
consequence."</TE>
<TE>   Frost agreed. In a break with his party's preelection strategy of
avoiding strong stands on tax policy, Frost said Democrats should
consider whether to freeze those parts of President Bush's tax cut
that benefit the wealthiest Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to talk about fairness," Frost said in a news
conference. "What's fair for the majority of American people?"</TE>
<TE>   Frost, who as caucus chairman ranks as the House's No. 3
Democratic leader, also attacked Pelosi. "Her politics are to the
left," Frost said. "And I think that the party, to be successful,
must speak to the broad center of the country."</TE>
<TE>   Debate among Democrats over how much they should concentrate on
the center or the left of the political spectrum is a staple of
contemporary politics; likewise, Republicans argue among themselves
about whether to govern from the center or the right.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Democrats, defining their ideology has taken on new
urgency after the party's losses Tuesday, which included at least
five seats in the House. Many Democrats wonder whether they blundered
in tactics, strategy or both.</TE>
<TE>   A number of factors favor Pelosi. She comes from the most-populous
state. Besides Pelosi, California is sending 32 Democrats to the
House's next session. Nearly all will vote for her. Frost has 16
Democratic peers in the Texas delegation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the largest number of Democrats that any state has ever
had," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, a Pelosi backer. "We
know how to win elections. That's a job that's going to be
important."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, 62, moved into the leadership more recently than Frost.
She won her whip post in October 2001, defeating Rep. Steny H. Hoyer
(D-Md.), 118 to 95. Much of the support she won then remains solid.
Frost won his position four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With close ties to Democratic donors from California, Pelosi also
has raised millions of dollars for candidates around the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity is another factor. As a woman in what is still a
male-dominated Capitol, Pelosi draws an extra degree of attention.
"What Democrats need is a charismatic leader that can help shape
public opinion," said Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky of Illinois, a Pelosi
backer.</TE>
<TE>   But Frost, 60, has plenty of credentials. He has served in the
House for 24 years, longer than Pelosi's 15. He was chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for four years and knows
the intricacies of redistricting. The senior Democrat on the House
Rules Committee, he has influence over when and how legislation comes
to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   His mostly liberal record is dotted with votes that give him ties
to the party's moderate and conservative wings. Unlike Pelosi, he
supported legislation to grant normal trade relations with China. In
another break with Pelosi, he backed Bush on a recent resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Backers say Frost is a more sure-footed political tactician. They
point to an embarrassing episode during the recent campaign when
several Democratic candidates were forced to return contributions
they received from a Pelosi political action committee because of
potential campaign law violations.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, a leading Democrat, said he
would support Frost as a leader who would "reach out to all parts of
the party." He criticized Pelosi for showing a degree of
"carelessness" with the campaign contribution gaffe.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Pelosi took the unusual step of supporting another
Democrat, Rep. Lynn N. Rivers, against Dingell in a primary. Dingell
won in a district that had been redrawn to pit the two incumbents
against each other.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of Democrats, loath to alienate either Frost or Pelosi, are
likely to keep mum about their preference. One is Hoyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them are good pols," he said. "They understand the
public. Neither one of them is going to take us to the far left or
far right."</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt, who has served as minority leader since 1995, was among
the architects of a 2002 Democratic campaign strategy now being
criticized for not offering a clear enough alternative to the Bush
administration, especially on economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   He argued Thursday that factors outside his party's control -- the
terrorist attacks of 2001 and an avalanche of special-interest money
for Republicans -- left Democrats at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   But Gephardt said Democrats should confront Republicans head-on
about the economy, and especially about taxes, even if that means
some political risk. "Better than tinkering around the edges is to
come up with a complete alternative to the Bush tax policy," Gephardt
said. "We need to have a roaring discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt declined to say whether he would support Pelosi or Frost
as his successor.</TE>

<HD>DNA Testing Frees Baltimore Man Jailed 20 Years</HD>
<DH>Bernard Webster was found guilty of a 1982 rape. Technology
proved his innocence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOWSON, Md.</DL>
<LD>A judge ordered the release Thursday of a Baltimore man who has spent
20 years in prison for a rape that DNA tests show he didn't commit.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just happy to be out," said Bernard Webster, 40, waving to
reporters as he walked out of Circuit Court for Baltimore County a
free man. He declined to say more.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing that anyone can say to justify what happened in
this case," said Circuit Judge Christian Kahl, who ordered Webster's
release. "Justice moves slow at times, and in your case, it moved
very, very slow."</LD>
<TE>   Webster was 19 when a 47-year-old teacher identified him as the
man who broke into her Towson home and raped her in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Webster had been set for release in February. He wasn't entitled
to compensation from the state for his time in prison, his lawyers
said, and he is without a family, job or home.</TE>
<TE>   "To go in at 19 with a 10th-grade education and then compound that
with 20 years in prison -- it's unfathomable. I don't see how you
deal with this as a person," Public Defender Stephen Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was the third person in Maryland and the 115th nationwide
to have a conviction overturned by DNA evidence, according to the
nonprofit Innocence Project in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The victim told The Sun in Baltimore on Wednesday she was upset by
the turn in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine it, you just can't," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster became a suspect because police had arrested him in Towson
months earlier in the theft of a pocketbook, according to court
papers.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, defense attorneys presented two witnesses who said they
saw Webster playing basketball that day miles from the rape scene.
But two workers at the victim's apartment complex said they had seen
Webster around the building that day, and the victim picked him out
of a photo lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Webster maintained his innocence, and the public defender's office
took another look at his case as part of a project to see whether new
DNA tests could exonerate any prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   DNA evidence taken from the victim hours after the attack was
tested, and results sent to the defender's office last month showed
the semen wasn't Webster's. Last week, the prosecutors' office got
the same results from its own testing.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have this technology 20 years ago," said John Cox, an
assistant state's attorney. "Our intention has always been to seek
justice, and once this came to our attention, we moved as fast as we
could."</TE>

<HD>130 Charged in Alleged Links to Mexican Drug Cartel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities have indicted more than 130 people linked to a
Mexican drug cartel that allegedly supplied hundreds of pounds of
cocaine each year to California, Alaska and other locations around
the nation, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The charges stem from a nearly two-year-long investigation that
involved grand jury indictments in three cities and scores of law
enforcement officers coordinating their efforts.</LD>
<LD>   In Alaska, 44 defendants were charged. Officials there described
the effort as the largest drug trafficking case in state history.
Twenty-five of those suspects were arrested Thursday in Anchorage and
New York, according to U.S. Atty. Timothy Burgess in Alaska.</LD>
<TE>   Charges against 16 people were filed in Los Angeles, but
authorities said those defendants were some of the most significant
players in the drug cartel. Agents from the FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration seized about 200 kilograms -- more than 400 pounds --
of cocaine in L.A., about two-thirds of the amount taken nationwide
and worth more than $3 million. Also seized, authorities said, was
$500,000 in cash, also about a third of the amount taken nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Leonhart, special agent in charge of the DEA office in Los
Angeles, said the investigation revealed "the significant role Los
Angeles plays in international, national and local cocaine
trafficking."</TE>
<TE>   "It's exceptionally rare when you find a case where you can track
drugs being imported from Mexico to wholesalers in Los Angeles, then
to middle men and finally to street dealers throughout the country,"
said Steven Novak, a supervisory special agent for the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-state investigation began as several smaller probes that
converged. In Los Angeles, for example, three separate investigations
involving federal, state and local authorities were merged with the
Anchorage case, dubbed "Operation Arctic Heat." Similarly, in Kansas
City, Mo., where 38 people were charged, agents had begun their own
investigation after determining that suspects there received cocaine
from people already under investigation in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of arrests began in mid-October, authorities said,
when agents learned that one of their primary suspects was leaving
L.A. for Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Elba Portillo was arrested at her house in Hacienda Heights on
Oct. 14, according to the FBI, and has been charged with helping to
arrange the transport of 14 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico. The van
with that shipment was stopped June 20 at the border in El Paso,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators then moved to round up associates who might flee.
The first to be arrested, according to the FBI, were Yolanda
Velazquez, her son Michael Arce and her nephew Freddy Velazquez. The
three were taken into custody Oct. 30 when investigators learned they
were prepared to flee to Arizona or Mexico, the FBI said. At Yolanda
Velazquez's home in Downey, authorities say, sheriff's deputies found
a kilogram of cocaine and a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Another kilogram of cocaine, authorities say, was found in her
nephew's car.</TE>
<TE>   Also named in the Los Angeles complaint and now considered a
fugitive is Francisco "Pancho" Aviles, alleged to be a drug lord in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Military Culture Cited in Ft. Bragg Domestic Killings</HD>
<DH>Soldiers are often reluctant to get help with marital
problems, Army investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FT. BRAGG, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Five killings last summer involving couples at Ft. Bragg probably
were caused by existing marital problems and the stress of separation
while soldiers are away on duty, Army investigators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But the report also said military culture discourages soldiers and
their families from seeking help when domestic problems can
potentially be resolved.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Dave Orman, a psychiatrist who led the 19-member team of
investigators, said earlier intervention could prevent tragedies. To
do that, Orman said, mental health specialists must be in combat
battalions, as chaplains are now.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not doing what we need to be doing yet," he said. "There
was a prevalent attitude that seeking behavioral health care was not
career-safe."</TE>
<TE>   The team, including mental and physical health workers and
military clergy, visited the base in August and September.</TE>
<TE>   The team also said the anti-malaria drug Lariam, given to troops
sent overseas, was unlikely to have been at fault. Side effects of
the drug, also known as mefloquine, have been known to include
psychotic episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say four Ft. Bragg soldiers killed their wives in June
and July. Two of the men committed suicide and the other two are
charged with murder. Three of those cases involved special operations
soldiers who had served in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In a fifth case, a woman is charged with killing her husband, a
Special Forces major.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended that the Defense Department study how
increased military operations affect family stress. It also said
distrust of military family care and mental health programs "may
contribute in rare cases to tragedy." It said focus groups showed
that marital discord wasn't unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators interviewed military leaders, doctors, leaders of
family support groups, military and civilian law enforcement, and
civilian public health officials. They also conducted focus groups
with soldiers, spouses and others on the post.</TE>
<TE>   The report found family support groups were inconsistent in the
help they provided, and the Army's program for soldiers returning
from deployment also varied from unit to unit.</TE>
<TE>   Work already is being done to make sure each unit forms a family
support group when the unit deploys for training in the United States
or overseas, said Col. Tad Davis, garrison commander at Ft. Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers from Ft. Bragg, headquarters of the 82nd Airborne
Division and the Army's John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and
School, have figured prominently in ground operations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 soldiers are stationed at Ft. Bragg and about 5,000
families live on the base. An additional 21,000 military families
live in nearby communities.</TE>
<TE>   Local police have said the couples involved in each of the
slayings had a history of marital problems.</TE>
<TE>   After the slayings, the military announced that soldiers will be
screened for psychological problems before they leave Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Rapid HIV Test Approved by FDA</HD>
<DH>The procedure is a 'sea change,' activist says. In the
past, waits of up to two weeks caused anxiety and led many to not
find out results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal officials approved a finger-prick HIV blood test Thursday
that can provide results within 20 minutes, reducing delays that
cause anxiety and lead many people not to pick up their test results.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a real sea change," said Lee Klosinski, director of
programs at AIDS Project Los Angeles. "These results are so important
... that we really want to find ways to get them out to people as
quickly as possible."</LD>
<LD>   The approval was announced by Tommy G. Thompson, U.S. secretary of
Health and Human Services, who characterized it as "a very important
step in America's war against HIV/AIDS."</LD>
<TE>   The new test, called OraQuick, is 99.6% accurate and requires less
than a drop of blood.</TE>
<TE>   The standard test for HIV, known as ELISA, takes a minimum of five
hours to process and sometimes as long as overnight. But because the
test often is sent to labs -- where it is run in batches -- results
often are not available for up to two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The government estimates that each year, more than 8,000
HIV-positive people do not return to public clinics to receive their
test results.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they may be infecting others and may not be receiving
needed treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A much higher number of virus-free people don't return for their
results.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid HIV test will be available only in 40,000 technically
sophisticated labs that receive special certification from the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   That will prevent many groups from providing instantaneous results
to sex-club visitors, homeless people on the street and
emergency-room patients, who are among the most likely not to return
for their results, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson encouraged the test's maker, OraSure Technologies Inc.,
to submit evidence that OraQuick is easy to use and has little
potential for user error.</TE>
<TE>   If the Bethlehem, Pa.-based company can prove that, the government
could allow for more expanded testing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the rapid test say the wait to find out results
creates unnecessary anxiety and fears.</TE>
<TE>   One 23-year-old man, who was recently tested at an AIDS Healthcare
Foundation clinic, said he had difficulty sleeping for a week
afterward. He was virus-free.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the most stressful weeks of my life," said the
man, who requested anonymity. "I try to protect myself and I try to
practice safe sex, but things do go through condoms, and I was
worried about that.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing that I did was fun, because that was in the back of my
mind."</TE>
<TE>   HIV activists and members of Congress have criticized the federal
government for delaying the introduction of rapid HIV tests.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at the Food and Drug Administration dismissed those
suggestions Thursday, saying OraSure submitted its final application
about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said it worked quickly to review its data and inspect
its manufacturing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that we had an excellent relationship with the company,"
said Dr. Elliot Cowan, a senior regulatory scientist at the FDA.
"They listened to us, and conversely, we listened to them."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation,
said he hopes that rapid HIV tests will eventually be "no muss, no
fuss" and that it will eventually be like "putting your arm in a
blood-pressure sling in the drugstore."</TE>
<TE>   When the OraQuick test detects the presence of HIV antibodies, it
displays two red bars on a small strip enclosed in plastic. One red
bar indicates a negative result.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the California Office of AIDS said state law requires
that two HIV tests be performed before people can be told that they
have the virus.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, health authorities are working on language that would
enable clinics to tell patients that they probably are infected but
that they must get a different test, which could take days or weeks
to process.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center said its in-house lab is
ready to use the new test, but rules prevent the center from
performing screenings in its new mobile testing van, as the group
would like. The center performed 8,510 HIV tests in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really important first step," said Jeff Bailey, the
center's director of health education and prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers wanting to use the HIV test at home shouldn't hold their
breath. Because "counseling is an integral part of the equation,
over-the-counter is not a solution in today's world," OraSure Chief
Executive Mike Gausling said in a telephone conference call.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gausling didn't close the door on the option. "Pregnancy
tests used to have to have counseling too," he said, but now they
don't.</TE>

<HD>Old Maps Faulted in July Mine Accident</HD>
<DH>Report on Pennsylvania incident cites possible violations
of state laws on record keeping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>A report released Thursday concerning the July mine accident that
trapped nine workers for three days found two likely violations of
state law regarding the keeping of accurate maps.</LD>
<LD>   But it is unclear whether the state will be able to pursue charges
against anyone, said David Hess, Pennsylvania's environmental
secretary.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the state Environmental Protection Department
and the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration interviewed
more than 50 people during their investigation into the accident.</LD>
<TE>   The preliminary report said inaccurate maps led miners to breach
an abandoned coal mine, releasing millions of gallons of water that
trapped them deep underground in the Quecreek Mine for 77 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Wolf Coal Co. had based its operations at the Quecreek
Mine on maps from the 1940s and 1950s, leading the miners to believe
they were a safe distance from the abandoned Saxman mine,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   The Saxman mine closed in 1963, but its operators never filed a
final map with the state, a likely violation of Pennsylvania law, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   A second violation might have occurred when Clyde H. Maize, a
former state mine inspector, failed to turn over all maps and papers
in his possession when he retired in 1970, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items his granddaughter donated to the Somerset County
Library in June, a month before the accident, was a Saxman mine map
with "Final 1964" handwritten on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be recommending actions, but as the report notes, the
inspector is deceased and the Saxman Mine is just a shell company, so
we may not be able to take enforcement action," Hess said.</TE>
<TE>   Black Wolf President David Rebuck declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Messer, an attorney for seven of the miners, said the
report failed to provide more information about Black Wolf and state
safety procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we evaluate this report without understanding what's been
left out?" Messer asked.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes the final report will give a more complete
picture of what went wrong so future accidents can be prevented.</TE>

<HD>Razors Rigged With Explosives Injure 2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TROY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Electric razors that had been rigged with explosives blew up in the
faces of two men, wounding both, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal and local investigators urged shoppers to be careful when
buying electric razors, and to call authorities if they see a razor
left in a public place.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a very strong possibility that there are other razors
out there," Sheriff Dan Keating said.</LD>
<TE>   Keating added that the razors had been similarly rigged. He said
whoever tampered with them replaced wires, took out batteries and put
in gunpowder.</TE>
<TE>   The two explosions happened about seven months apart. Keating gave
no reason for the delay in making the incidents public.</TE>
<TE>   In the first incident, on March 27, Hosea Crumpler of Troy found
what appeared to be a new razor in a case in a McDonald's restroom,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   When the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute student plugged it in at
home, the razor blew up, wounding his face, neck, chest, torso and
both hands, according to police. He was hospitalized for several
days. "It was a pretty significant explosion," Capt. Jack Mahar said.
"A piece of shrapnel also hit his wife in the face and almost got his
little girl. We determined that someone put it in the restroom,
waiting for someone else to find it."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 12, James Burdick, 44, tried to use a different brand
razor that his wife had bought at a Price Chopper store in
Bennington, Vt., 30 miles from Troy. The razor exploded when it was
plugged in at his home.</TE>
<TE>   Burdick suffered minor injuries, mostly burns and cuts, and did
not require hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Police said whoever rigged the razor may have planted it in the
Vermont store. Price Chopper spokeswoman Mona Galub said the store
chain does not carry that brand of razor.</TE>
<TE>   The second explosion was treated as a product failure until an
analysis at the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lab
in Rockville, Md., determined that the razor had been altered
deliberately. ATF investigator John Morgan said Thursday that the
razor "was converted to an improvised explosive device." Morgan said
the explosive devices were powerful enough to kill the men.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIBERTY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A man waiting in a parking lot outside his son's school shot the
fourth-grader to death and wounded the boy's mother Thursday after a
domestic dispute, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings occurred about 12:30 p.m. as the woman was picking
up the boy at St. James Catholic School, which serves 322 students in
kindergarten through eighth grade.</LD>
<LD>   Police Lt. Mark Misenhelter said the gunman was the child's
father. He added that the suspect had argued with the boy's mother
earlier in the day, although their relationship was not immediately
clear.</LD>
<TE>   The suspect was arrested about an hour later at a liquor store in
nearby Kansas City. Police spokesman Tony Sanders said officers
received a tip that the man had said he was trying to get out of town
because he had just shot someone.</TE>
<TE>   The identities and ages of the victims were not immediately
provided. Police said the boy died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Students were taken to a movie theater to await the arrival of
their parents. Among the pupils was the boy's sister, who police say
saw the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Summers, spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Kansas City-St. Joseph, said that all students were accounted for and
that the school was locked down.</TE>
<TE>   The students never play in the parking lot, she said, "so I can't
imagine they saw this."</TE>

<HD>Police Link Pair to Slaying in Atlanta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>On the same September day that John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo
allegedly killed a liquor store clerk and wounded another in
Montgomery, Ala., they struck first in a rough-edged section of
Atlanta, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta police and state and federal investigators said they
confirmed that the .22-caliber handgun used in the fatal shooting
Sept. 21 in Montgomery was the same one that killed a part-time
employee earlier that day at Sam's Package, a liquor outlet near
downtown Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   While the sniper suspects were linked to the Montgomery incident
and a separate fatal shooting in Baton Rouge, La., a few days later,
the announcement marked the first time that authorities had placed
the two men in Georgia. The finding allowed investigators to more
tightly trace the pair's path, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said test-firing of the pistol, found last week near where
the Montgomery shooting took place, proved that it fired the three
shots that killed Million Woldemariam, an Ethiopian immigrant who was
helping out at a friend's liquor store in Atlanta after being laid
off from his job at a camera store.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Woldemariam, 41, died shortly after midnight
after being shot three times as he walked out of the store. Nothing
was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 minutes earlier, Woldemariam had noticed a suspicious car
in the lot when he stepped out to his car, according to the store
owner, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. "I told
him, 'Million, if you see a car or somebody outside, don't go
outside,' " said the owner, who like Woldemariam had emigrated from
Ethiopia. "That was the last conversation I had with him."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta crime was viewed as ordinary until authorities linked
the Montgomery case to the sniper investigation. A .22-caliber
handgun was found near where a Montgomery police officer chased a
gunman, now believed to be Muhammad, after the liquor store shooting
there. That is a different weapon from the .223-caliber rifle used in
the sniper shootings, but officials say Muhammad and Malvo were
involved in all the cases.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta detective investigating Woldemariam's slaying started
checking possible connections to the Alabama shooting, Atlanta Police
Chief William Pennington said. The inquiry paid off Thursday when
investigators at the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
test-fired the Montgomery pistol and a Georgia ballistics technician
matched it to the Atlanta shooting.</TE>
<TE>   At Sam's Package, where the front windows wear heavy mesh and the
cash register sits behind a thick plate of smudged Plexiglas, a pair
of his friends described Woldemariam as kind, a willing worker and a
devoted churchgoer who sent money to his mother in Ethiopia. He had
come to the U.S. six or seven years ago and was a Canadian national,
one friend said.</TE>
<TE>   The store owner said she was "very happy to know who killed
[Woldemariam]. But I never expected the sniper."</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Says Sniper Suspects Will Be Tried First in
Virginia</HD>
<DH>The pair likely will face capital charges. The state trails
only Texas in executions since 1976.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities transferred the two suspects in the
Washington-area sniper killings into the custody of Virginia
officials Thursday, setting up local prosecutions that could lead to
the death penalty for Army veteran John Allen Muhammad, 41, and Lee
Boyd Malvo, his 17-year-old companion.</LD>
<LD>   Solemnly describing how a sniper killed 10 victims in Virginia,
Maryland and the District of Columbia over three weeks last month,
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said he chose two Virginia counties for the
first prosecutions because they provided "the best law, the best
facts and the best range of available penalties."</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft's decision to dismiss federal extortion and firearms
charges and turn the suspects over to Virginia ensures that Muhammad
and Malvo will face murder charges that could bring the death penalty
in a state ranking behind only Texas in executions. Virginia has put
86 prisoners to death since 1976.</LD>
<TE>   "Virginia's been aggressive in its prosecutions," said Prince
William County Commonwealth's Atty. Paul Ebert, who said he would
seek the death sentence against Muhammad for the Oct. 9 slaying of
engineer Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Va., gas station.</TE>
<TE>   "The death penalty's reserved for the worst of the worst," he
added. "And I think from the evidence, these folks qualify."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ashcroft referred to Malvo only as "the juvenile," the
youth will be charged as an adult in the Oct. 14 death of FBI analyst
Linda Franklin, said Fairfax County Commonwealth's Atty. Robert F.
Horan Jr. A federal official said Thursday that investigators have
concluded that it was Malvo who fired the high-velocity .223-caliber
rifle round that fatally wounded Franklin in the parking area of a
Home Depot store in Falls Church, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The move to Virginia also strengthens the array of evidence that
can be used against the pair, authorities said. Federal charges filed
last month against Muhammad and Malvo had been tied to a statute that
requires proving that the suspects conspired to affect interstate
commerce by extortion and threats of physical violence.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad's federal public defender, James Wyda, warned this week
that the charge under the federal Hobbs Act was a "stretch" because
it was based on a rambling $10-million ransom note left at a Virginia
shooting scene after 12 people had already been shot. But one federal
official said Thursday that federal prosecutors in Baltimore will
likely resurrect those charges after Virginia prosecutors make
headway in their own murder cases.</TE>
<TE>   While U.S. marshals drove the two suspects Thursday morning in a
caravan of heavily guarded vehicles from a federal facility in
Baltimore to the Alexandria Detention Center in northern Virginia,
police investigators in Atlanta were using new ballistics evidence to
link the two drifters to a Sept. 21 slaying at a Georgia liquor
store.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta killing is the fourth connected to the sniper suspects
since their arrests last month. Police in Montgomery, Ala., have
filed murder charges stemming from a Sept. 21 homicide in that city,
and investigators in Tacoma, Wash., Baton Rouge, La., and Tucson also
are examining the suspects' possible involvement in fatal shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent flurry of police interest centers on a .22-caliber
Magnum handgun recovered last week near the scene of the Sept. 21
liquor store slaying in Montgomery. Ballistics experts from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms test-fired the gun Wednesday,
and by Thursday it had been linked to the Atlanta slaying and was
being examined in connection with two September shootings in Clinton,
Md., near the home of Muhammad's former wife.</TE>
<TE>   James Cavanaugh, an ATF agent in Nashville, said tests would also
be conducted on a .22-caliber projectile found this week on a Tucson
golf course where a man was shot to death March 19. Police initially
reported that the victim, Jerry R. Taylor, had been killed by a
high-powered rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Cavanaugh said the projectile found this week by federal agents
and Tucson police would be tested against the handgun found in
Montgomery. Comparisons may also be conducted with a Bushmaster XM-15
rifle that was seized from Muhammad's blue Chevrolet Caprice the
morning of his arrest Oct. 24. The rifle has been linked by
ballistics tests to 11 of 13 sniper-related shootings in the
Washington suburbs; the bullets in the other shootings were too badly
damaged for comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   After Montgomery police recovered the .22-caliber handgun in a
pile of leaves near where two suspects fled after the liquor store
shooting, ATF agents traced it back to a man in Oklahoma who bought
it in August 1998, Cavanaugh said. The Oklahoma owner moved to El
Paso, where the pistol was on display in a glass case at a gun show
when it was reported missing July 20. Investigators are trying to
determine whether Muhammad and Malvo were in El Paso during that
period.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if they had it at that time," Cavanaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   As investigators have burrowed backward, finding more matches
between guns tied to the suspects and homicides and shootings
committed across the country, Ashcroft was confronted with vexing
procedural and political questions about where to base the first
prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the option of keeping the federal charges intact, he
had the choice of deferring to local prosecutors in three Virginia
counties or in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft had decided quickly not to consider turning the two
suspects over to local prosecutors in Montgomery County, Md., where
six victims were slain.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the devastating spate of killings in the Maryland suburbs,
federal officials were dissuaded by Gov. Parris Glendening's
temporary ban on executions and legal barriers against imposing a
death penalty on Malvo because he is a juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of all affected jurisdictions will be encouraged" by
the Virginia prosecutions, Ashcroft said Thursday. As he spoke, he
was flanked by prosecutors and police from several Virginia counties
and by Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan and Police Chief
Charles A. Moose, who headed the sniper task force.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan deflected questions about Maryland's failure to win the
first prosecutions, saying: "We suffered as a region and we're
solving this as a region."</TE>
<TE>   But there was a conspicuous absence among the government officials
gathered around Ashcroft: Montgomery County State's Atty. Douglas F.
Gansler. The Maryland prosecutor issued a statement Thursday saying
he would work "cooperatively with prosecutors and investigators" in
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   One federal official said Thursday that Alabama also had briefly
emerged as an attractive proposition for the first trial because it
was the only location where police and eyewitnesses had identified
Muhammad and Malvo allegedly in the act of committing a crime.</TE>
<TE>   But after conferring for two days with FBI Director Robert S.
Mueller III and Virginia authorities, Ashcroft decided to transfer
the custody of the sniper suspects to Virginia.</TE>

<HD>Court Cites Age in Death-Penalty Reversal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed the death sentence of a
killer who was 17 when he chained a man to a tree, beat him, set him
on fire and then finished him off with a meat cleaver.</LD>
<LD>   In the 4-3 decision, the high court said the trial judge didn't
give enough consideration to Ronald Bell's age at the time of the
murder of Cordell Richards over two days in February 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Bell, 21, was two months shy of his 18th birthday when he and two
younger female accomplices killed Richards in revenge for what they
claimed were sexual advances toward one of the girls.</LD>
<TE>   The Florida Supreme Court ruled three years ago that it violated
the state's constitutional protection against "cruel or unusual"
punishment to execute anyone for a murder committed before their 17th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   In the majority opinion, the justices said that even though a
killer becomes eligible for the death penalty, youth still is an
important consideration in deciding whether punishment should be life
in prison or death.</TE>
<TE>   Bell's age "is an extremely significant factor that, together with
the other mitigation, renders the death penalty disproportionate,"
the court said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling did not address an appeal claim that the execution of
anyone under age 18 violates the state Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   In the majority opinion, Justice Barbara Pariente noted that
Florida has not executed anyone for a murder committed before age 18
for more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering the infrequency in which the death penalty has been
imposed on minors and upheld in this state, in my view it would
constitute cruel or unusual punishment to impose the death penalty on
this 17-year-old," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Maestas, then 16, was sentenced to life in prison for
first-degree murder in the death. Renee Lincks, then 15, was
sentenced to 15 years for manslaughter.</TE>

<HD>Plan Backs Snowmobiles at Parks</HD>
<DH>Bush team proposes a high cap on machines at Yellowstone
and Grand Teton. It would reverse a Clinton-era ban based on
pollution concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>DENVER -- Unveiling its winter recreation policy for Yellowstone
National Park, the Bush administration is proposing a daily cap on
snowmobile use that would allow 35% more of the machines than
typically visit the park.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is the preferred approach among five outlined in a
final environmental impact statement, to be released Tuesday. It
would reverse a ban on snowmobiles set by the Clinton administration
that was to take effect next year.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy, if it is approved, would go into effect in March
and also apply to another Wyoming park, neighboring Grand Teton
National Park.</LD>
<TE>   In Yellowstone, the policy would allow 1,100 snowmobiles per day.
For the last decade, an average of 815 snowmobiles have entered the
park every winter day.</TE>
<TE>   National Park Service officials would not comment on the policy.
The Times was briefed on it by members of federal agencies that are
participating in the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   Bitterly opposed by many park visitors, environmental groups and
park employees, the Bush policy has the support of local communities,
snowmobile enthusiasts and manufacturers who lobbied aggressively
against the ban. Snowmobiles have been in use in Yellowstone since
1949.</TE>
<TE>   The reversal of the snowmobile ban is the latest in a series of
actions by the Bush administration to change Clinton-era
environmental policies on public lands. That trend has included
efforts to drill for oil and gas in national monuments, to expand
motorized recreation and to allow new roads in undeveloped areas of
national forests.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Dart, public lands director for Blue Ribbon Coalition, a
snowmobile users group, said he welcomed the new policy. He said he
expects the Park Service to modify another proposal that would
require a guide to accompany each snowmobile visitor.</TE>
<TE>   "They've come around," he said. "As I understand it, it will be
business as usual, certainly for this year."</TE>
<TE>   Park Service officials contend that the proposed cap, combined
with a requirement permitting only a new generation of cleaner,
quieter snow machines, will put an end to business as usual by
protecting the health of people and wildlife while reducing noise
levels.</TE>
<TE>   Critics scoff at those assurances, pointing to recent findings by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that park employees could
suffer ill health as a result of snowmobile emissions. The EPA's
regional office here recommended in April that snowmobiles not be
allowed in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "This [plan] says that Yellowstone can be managed by politics on
behalf of special interests, and that science and the law protecting
places like this can be set aside," said Jon Catton of the Greater
Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group based in Bozeman, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service has received more public comments on the
Yellowstone snowmobile issue than any other in the agency's history.
More than 360,000 e-mails and letters were received during five
public comment periods, and 80% supported a ban on snowmobiles in
Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   In September, 127 members of Congress rallied on the Capitol steps
to raise support for a legislative ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, park rangers have worn respirators and
officials are redesigning entrance kiosks to pump more clean air into
them to protect rangers' health. This season, many employees will be
fitted with sophisticated hearing protection.</TE>
<TE>   An Occupational Safety and Health Administration study found that
park rangers were exposed to unacceptable amounts of engine emissions
and noise from snowmobiles in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The OSHA study came about after park employees complained of
nausea, headaches, dizziness and lethargy after working in proximity
to snowmobiles. Others reported hearing loss.</TE>
<TE>   The ban grew out of 10 years of study that concluded that the
machines created air and noise pollution, diminished the experience
of other park visitors and put wildlife under stress during the
season when the mortality rate is highest.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA report reinforced the concerns that led to the ban.</TE>
<TE>   According to the EPA, the emissions from a single snowmobile can
equal that of 100 cars. The agency in September issued rules
requiring manufacturers to reduce emissions by 50% by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   A study released in May by the California Air Resources Board and
commissioned by the Park Service showed park workers were exposed to
hydrocarbons in concentrations 10 times higher than measured at the
sides of Los Angeles freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The study concluded: "Efforts to dramatically decrease park
employee exposure to toxic air pollutants should be a high priority
and implemented immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The snowmobile industry has attacked the studies as "junk
science." Ed Klim, president of the International Snowmobile
Manufacturers Assn., said that lowered speed limits and cleaner
machines will be sufficient to meet park guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be some changes, and not everyone is going to
be happy," he said. "But the bottom line is that people will be able
to enjoy the park in winter."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in March, the Park Service plan would allow only
machines that it says will produce less emissions and noise, with a
long-term goal of reducing hydrocarbons by 90%.</TE>
<TE>   A Park Service official, who asked not to be named, said the
proposal for cleaner snowmobiles did not make clear how park rangers
would control which types of machines are in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything much nastier than a traditional two-stroke
machine," the official said. "The [new] four-stroke does reduce
emissions somewhat, but they aren't very quiet. We reject the idea
that cleaner is clean and quieter is quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Snowmobiles are allowed in 42 national parks and monuments and are
banned in 385.</TE>
<TE>   Yellowstone, in northwest Wyoming, is a popular destination for
the sport. Last winter, more than 69,000 snowmobiles entered the park
from entrances in Wyoming and Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials familiar with the new plan say it will offer
five alternatives, with the Park Service's preferred choice allowing
1,100 snowmobiles in the park each day. Officials said the cap was
lowered from 1,350, which some Park Service officials had wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cap is just under the average number of snowmobile
visits on the busiest days. The season runs from mid-December to
mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   While most snowmobiles use the park's western entrance, critics
fear that the preferred plan would encourage more traffic at other
gates. At the north entrance, for example, where average historic
daily use is 16 snowmobiles, the proposal would allow 50. At two
other southern points of entry, where an average of 25 snowmobiles
come into Yellowstone, the plan would allow 75.</TE>

<HD>Neuroscientists Mine the Depths of Emotions</HD>
<DH>Researchers armed with new imaging techniques present their
latest insights into behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>With a new respect for the science of emotion, researchers are
charting the anatomy of social graces, capturing neural impulses of
fairness and shame that guide behavior.</LD>
<LD>   In findings made public this week at a meeting of 24,000
neuroscientists in Orlando, researchers documented how the primal
mood circuits of the brain can color manners, cooperation and
judgment, even as scientists revealed a new understanding of how the
human capacity for emotion changes over a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   By focusing on the neural networks that drive feelings, scientists
have embraced an objective inquiry into the subjective, emotional
life of the mind. Until recently, scientists could make only educated
guesses about the nature of the emotional chords struck by joy or
sadness.</LD>
<TE>   New noninvasive medical imaging techniques, however, allow
scientists to plumb the wellsprings of the mind more precisely.
Recording the interplay of neural patterns, they seek explanations
for the subtle mood changes that influence our decisions and shape
the way we treat each other.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a shift to looking for brain patterns," University
of Iowa psychologist Daniel Tranel said. "Emotion is a topic that has
been deliberately eschewed by neuroscientists for a long time. It was
a nuisance in our data and we tried to get rid of it. Now, we
deliberately focus on it."</TE>
<TE>   In their exploration of emotion, researchers at the annual meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience this week found:</TE>
<TE>   * Neural circuits related to shame that help regulate social
behavior. Researchers at UC Berkeley reported that people with brain
damage in a region just above the eyes, called the orbifrontal
cortex, could not process the social cues that help fine-tune
manners. They persistently acted in an overly familiar manner,
telling inappropriate jokes or using off-color language.</TE>
<TE>   * An upbeat side and a downbeat side of the brain. Positive
attitudes lodge in the left side of the prefrontal cortex, which is
involved in complex reasoning and social awareness, and negative
attitudes congregate on the right, according to researchers at the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes who used
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain
activity.</TE>
<TE>   * Brain circuits attuned to unfairness. Researchers at Princeton
University identified a neural network that responds to an unfair
financial offer. They monitored brain activity in volunteers playing
the ultimatum game, commonly used to study economic and social
decision making. Heightened activity in these areas of the cortex may
underlie feelings of indignation.</TE>
<TE>   * Synapses crafted for cooperation. People who exchanged favors
displayed heightened neural activity in areas involved in processing
rewards and detecting the intentions of others, researchers at Emory
University in Atlanta found. That surge of good feeling may explain
why people work with others even when it may be against their
short-term interest, the researchers suggested.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it does not take much for an emotional impulse to
affect the way we think.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of how even relatively mild emotions influence mental
abilities, cognitive neuroscientists at Washington University in St.
Louis found that brain areas critical for reasoning, intelligence and
other types of higher cognition were swayed by watching a horror film
or a TV comedy for as little as 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, the brain-scanning experiment showed that the videos
affected a region of the prefrontal cortex just under the temples,
thought to be important for blending cognitive tasks together with
emotional signals.</TE>
<TE>   After viewing the clips, people took simple tests of memory and
mental ability. Their performance was helped or hindered depending on
how their mood had been affected by the videos.</TE>
<TE>   "Mild anxiety actually improved performance on some kinds of
difficult tasks, but hurt performance on others," said psychologist
Jeremy Gray, who led the research team.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a scientist to know that feelings can run ahead of
common sense, but now researchers are learning how emotions can
trigger errors in judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Bay Crest Center for Geriatric Care in Ontario,
Canada, measured brain activity in people looking at photos and
documented how their emotion circuits responded to a face faster than
their memories about it could be retrieved.</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain the awkward situation in which people
mistakenly hail as a friend someone they have never met.</TE>
<TE>   Despite individual differences in the depth and intensity of
emotional responses, researchers are discovering the same emotional
machinery in the very young and the very old, according to new
research by independent groups at the University of Montreal in
Canada and the University of South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "The emotions are hard-wired in the brain and are present very
early," said Montreal researcher Johannes Levesque, who studied how
the brains of females processed feelings.</TE>
<TE>   The brain's emotional circuitry, however, also appears to evolve
throughout life, research presented this week suggests.</TE>
<TE>   When 8- and 9-year-old girls were asked to watch sad film clips
and then suppress the sadness they evoked, 11 regions of their brains
showed increased neural activity, compared with only two regions in
adults, the Montreal researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Older people may appear to be less emotional than the young, but
they may feel things more intensely, researchers said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Even as physical measures of emotion, such as heart rate, decline
with age -- tempered perhaps by time and experience -- older people
still have a depth of feeling that had not been properly appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "The brain mechanisms tend to be the same across a lifetime," said
psychologist Donald Powell at the Veterans Administration Hospital in
Columbia, S.C. "The elderly may feel greater emotions but show it
less."</TE>
